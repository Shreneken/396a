An offer made by the host to the guests to spend the night, an offer which everyone knows isn't supposed to be accepted, is, and, social codes being disrupted, calamity ensues. The guests become trapped together in the same room for four days, and their good manners and propriety gradually dissolve away until they're all acting like a bunch of savage lunatics.Though made in the 1960s, \"The Exterminating Angel,\" like all good films, is so astute about human nature that it feels as relevant now as it did then. The world seems full of a bunch of privileged people who have the luxury to go through life oblivious to the world around them. But then a pandemic hits, and they're freaking out about toilet paper.I happened to watch this film a day or so after watching another Bunuel film, \"Diary of a Chambermaid.\" Together, the two films serve as a withering denunciation of the middle class, whether it be in early 20th Century France, Spain of the 1960s, or the America of today.Grade: A.",

They survive, through the sacrifice of some lambs, and in the end, everything and everybody returns to the same initial position and they leave the place. \"El \u00c1ngel Exterminador\" is an intriguing and weird surrealist and metaphoric film that criticizes the behavior of the bourgeois class. This challenging film exerts some type of spell on the viewer that makes him love it. The film looks like a dream (or nightmare) with a spectacular restored photography in black & white and wonderful shadows. The essence of the story is very clear, with the hypocrite bourgeois class trapped in their world, changing positions but without leaving their social class and sacrificing lambs to survive and in the end returning to the same initial position in the world.

            "content": "I can't say that I'm a big fan of director Luis Bu\u00f1uel. While I admire his visual flair - his movies often lack backbone, and this brings them down. The Exterminating Angel is the first Bu\u00f1uel movie that I've really enjoyed. I enjoyed it because I never got the impression that the point of this film was simply to be weird. Bu\u00f1uel has found a premise - basically, a satire on the behaviour of the upper class - and lampooned it brilliantly. The key to this movie is setting up the central plot, and the director does such a good job of it that after a while; we don't care that the film is based on an idea that makes no sense at all, and are just able to run with it. The film follows a bunch of guests at a dinner party. At the end of the party, none of them make any effort to go home and after a while it becomes apparent to the party that they physically cannot leave the room. We then watch as the upper class, people who are used to sipping champagne and smoking expensive cigars are reduced to surviving in the most basic ways. They have to hack through the wall to find a water pipe and even begin eating paper to quench their hunger\u0085 The satire works because the acting is just so different to the way that the upper class usually conduct themselves - either on screen or otherwise. The structure of the social classes is clearly defined by Bu\u00f1uel's film also. This is the sort of thing that would really scare the rich, while other social classes have other things to worry about. Before the nightmare begins, various people are commenting on the conduct of one of their own who has had slightly too much to drink. This wouldn't worry anyone who isn't 'high society', but the fact that these people do care about it shows the difference in values between the classes. Bu\u00f1uel directs the film with almost a complete lack of emotion towards the central ensemble - and this stood out to me as it really allows the film to be funny. It's almost like the director is laughing at the situation that he's put his cast of characters into, which suggests that the Spanish director isn't the biggest fan of the upper classes. There's a million and one ways that this film could be interpreted, and that is what makes it great. If you don't like films that don't make sense; this probably won't do much for you. However, I think that this is one of those films that need to be experienced; and I definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "After an evening at the opera in Mexico City, a group of high society friends meet at the house of their hosts, Nobil\u00e9 and his wife, to dine and spend the evening indulging in \"sophisticated\" conversation and whatever else such folks do at their parties. They stay later and later and eventually it's the next day, but no one has left. By that evening, they're all still in the salon, no one has left and no one will leave: they're trapped! All the have to do is walk out the door, but no one wants to be the first to leave.As time goes on, one gravely ill guest dies, they run out of food, and eventually their genteel fa\u00e7ade deteriorates and they become, as the Spanish title suggests, \"shipwrecked\", in their house on Providence St., losing all track of time. The subtitles typically leave out a lot of the Spanish dialog. Listen for the Voice of Reason, el Doctor, who's always saying \"calmanse todos\" (\"everyone be calm\") whenever there's a confrontation. Also listen for the electric shaver at odd times, much to the irritation of one of the guests.I came across this crazy film in the summer of '86 after having purchased my first VCR. I soon found myself watching it twice daily and read all the books I could find on both the film and its director, Luis Bu\u00f1uel. I found a lot of good information along with some glaring errors regarding the film, to which I attribute the possibility that the authors probably did not have access to a videotape copy of the movie and were thus unable to view it many times over.That being said, I've been able to gather that the movie is primarily Bu\u00f1uel's impression of \"high society\" parties that seem to go on forever (as he stated himself in several interviews). Much is made of the various repetitions in the film, and he stated that in some cases he'd actually witnessed the same people being introduced to each other several times throughout an evening, as is seen in the film itself.Beyond that, I get the clear impression that a lot of this film is essential a joke in the sense that Bu\u00f1uel throws in a lot of stuff just to confound the viewer and make himself laugh. When the women talk of seeing eagles when relieving themselves in large vases in a closet, this is in reality taken from a time in Bu\u00f1uel's youth when he'd visit relatives in the mountains. Their outhouses extended over cliffs and it was indeed possible to see eagles, etc., flying underneath (poor birds!).Then there are Bu\u00f1uel's favorite targets like the upper class and classical music, including condutors and cellos. The dialog is rich in non-sequitors and ironic responses that are all the more hilarious when translated from Spanish. One great example is when Nobil\u00e9 responds to his wife after she's noticed a guest has removed his coat (gasp!), \"let us remove our coats as well, to attenuate the incorrectness\".I've watched a fair amount of Bu\u00f1uel's films, and this is by far my favorite. There are others that are better in their technical acheivement, e.g. \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeousie\", but this, and its contemporary, \"Simon of the Desert\", are as good as he gets in my book.I've been searching for a copy of the screenplay in Spanish.\"We don't want answers, we want to get out of here!\"",

            "content": "The Exterminating Angel, what a movie- I've seen it twice now and each time it went against (in the best possible way) my better logic. It's a work that's the product of a kind of madman place, and it stays impressive forty plus years later due to its humor. Like Dr. Strangelove, or maybe more so akin to a Kafka work submerged in Catholic plague, the film subverts expectations. At the start of the film, Luis Bunuel makes it clear as day that his only explanation is that its nonsense. If one were wanting to dig on a pure comedy level it would work because the dialog is so strange and out of place (if taken seriously) but consistently so, and the timing of the sort of downward spiral that plunges into the denouement (if there is one). If one were wanting to look at it for more of the technical reasons, its peerless- Bunuel has a steady, carefully controlled camera, quite tradition at times. But then at others he reveals his revealing, awesome flashes of symbolism, which may or may not fly over some viewers heads. And then, if one were to go so far, on an existential level it goes into the realm of nothingness, a kind of study of how a nonsensical existence, trapped for reasons not made clear to the viewer (barely to the rich cast of bourgeois, a running gag almost), which also calls in the Kafka aspect. By the hand of a surrealist comes a deadpan satire, and it almost becomes a dark fable (the Catholic aspect to the film) by the end. It's a rather shocking film on the first try, which is why it probably had some controversy when it first opened. Giving it another chance, the film works better, on a more sensory level almost. This is the kind of film where you're either scratching your head and turning it off midway through, or laughing (while in the grips of cringing perhaps) and in a weird awe. One of Bunuel's very best Mexican films.",

In 2016, this became one of them.A surrealist film, Bu\u00f1uel left it up to his audiences to decide what the story - a group of rich people cannot leave a party - is really about. Roger Ebert said, \"The dinner guests represent the ruling class in Franco's Spain. Having set a banquet table for themselves by defeating the workers in the Spanish Civil War, they sit down for a feast, only to find it never ends. They're trapped in their own bourgeois cul-de-sac. Increasingly resentful at being shut off from the world outside, they grow mean and restless; their worst tendencies are revealed.\"During a formal dinner party at the lavish mansion of Se\u00f1or Edmundo N\u00f3bile and his wife Luc\u00eda, the servants all leave but the guests cannot. As the days past, some die, some commit suicide and nearly all of them go mad.Only when they recreate the party - after failed mystic rituals and the attempted slaughter of their host - can they leave. Yet after attending a religious service to give thanks, they remain trapped again and disappear, along with the priests, as riots break out in the streets.In Russia, the idea of people not being allowed to \"leave a party\" was considered offensive and anti-government, so the film was banned. And Bu\u00f1uel himself believed that between the budget and the conditions in Mexico, the film was a failure. He wishes that it had been more extreme.",

            "content": "I discovered surrealist cinema as an adult. Of course, there are such scenes and images in many films, but I saw the first complete surrealist movie as a grown up. It was \"Belle de jour\", a film by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, whose work I knew since watching his \"Robinson Crusoe\" in my childhood. Bu\u00f1uel had gone a long way since 1928's \"Un chien andalou\", made in France. He had gone into exile during the Spanish Civil War, first to the United States and finally to M\u00e9xico, where he spent the rest of his life. But he made films in Europe now and then, and had regained his status as one of the masters of world cinema. Although he did not think much of his Mexican motion pictures, his masterpiece \"El \u00e1ngel exterminador\" is my favorite of all his films. He once complained that Mexican actors were not able to convey the spirit of the \"haute bourgeoisie\", but what he did not take into consideration was that, if he made a film in M\u00e9xico about the rich, he was dealing with something else, called \"creole oligarchies.\" And in this sense, this farce of the 1960s' Latin American \"filthy rich\" is most accurate. Moreover, with his usual affectionate treatment of the bourgeois (something he rarely did with clergy, female characters, or street urchins), he created a most believable funny portrait of the Latino rich people, who do not know what is their origin, who they should \"pay tribute to\", or where they are headed, unlike their European ancestors. Here, a group of those characters, born in M\u00e9xico, gather for dinner after an opera performance, but when the time comes to leave the house of the Nobiles they cannot leave the room where they reunited for gossiping after meal. There is no apparent reason they cannot leave, but there they stay for days, going back to a primitive state in which their dearest \"discreet charm\" (euphemism, the rule of the game, as in Renoir's 1939 film) vanishes. And when they are set free, and go to a church to thank the Lord... well, Bu\u00f1uel sure knew how to make fun of them, with situations verging on the fantastic and funny lines of incoherent, silly or ridiculous dialogue. A wonderful movie, which is always fun to watch again, especially in a double bill with another gem, the last one Bu\u00f1uel made in M\u00e9xico: \"Sim\u00f3n del desierto.\"",

            "review_title": "Beautifully realised, with moments of surrealism that both amuse and bemuse",
            "content": "'L'enfer c'est les autres' (Hell is other people), wrote the French existentialist philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, in his play, 'No Exit' (sometimes referred to - and has been performed - as 'In Camera'), that surmised the narrative of three deceased individuals locked in a room, one that they eventually realise they will be spending eternity together in. Luis Bunuel used this simple meta-narrative concept of people trapped, to create one of his finest satires, and his first explicitly surrealist film since L'Age D'Or (1930). After Bunuel's previous film, Viridiana (1961), was condemned by the Vatican and banned in his native country of Spain (and where it was made), he moved back to Mexico where he had been making films throughout the 1940's and 50's, and produced a scabrous attack on General Francisco Franco's Spanish fascist dictatorship, and the institutions, and bourgeois facets of the country that were founded on the destruction of the poor and the proletariat, during the civil war that ended in 1939.Whilst the film works as political allegory, on a base narrative level, it functions as an irrational comedy; or farce. The guests arrive for a lavish dinner, but as they arrive, the maids leave, and progressively all the hired help leave them. Once dinner is complete, the guests congregate in the living room, but they all begin to realise that they are unable to leave the room at all. When this is discovered we observe that they attempt to go, but are either distracted or simply stop or break down at the boundary of the room. This continues through days, possibly months - the characters concept of time completely obliterated. The group falls into decay, primitive urges overwhelm them, and as this representation of Western Civilisation breaks down, the group become brutally savage, turning on the host of the dinner, demanding sacrifice. The group slaughter the lambs that were originally to be used in a dinner prank.At first the guests seem to simply ignore what is happening to them, and continue with inane chat. Exterior to the \"party\", the grounds are surrounded, but not even the police are able to enter, given the same mysterious barrier that prevents entry. It's almost a perfect parable, illustrating the ignorance of the Spanish bourgeoisie, as they strip the rights and dignity of the proletariat (here the maids leave on their arrival), whilst divorcing their minds from the violence and corruption of a dictatorship. But with this, it also shows how even the \"civilised\" sections of society, once they are stripped of their social status, their inherited manners of \"education\", and their ability to use wealth, the fall into absolute decay, probably falling apart greater than the lower classes, with their lessened moral outlook, and an almost infantile inability to deal with regular obstacles.Winner of the 1962 Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, this was to begin what become (rather belatedly for the 62 year old) his most productive, celebrated and interesting period of his career, based in Paris, beginning with Belle de Jour (1967) and ending with That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). This is the period that he developed and expanded his own style, and his unique vision on film. The Exterminating Angel has also given inspiration for others. It is a clear influence on Jean-Luc Godard's wonderfully bleak and satiric depiction of the bourgeoisie and the end of Western Civilisation, Week End (1967). The idea was also utilised in one sketch from Monty Python's Meaning of Life (1983), that saw the guests leaving as ghosts. This is by far, one of his greatest achievements, beautifully realised, with comic touches, and moments of surrealism that both bemuse and amuse.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "review_title": "Disturbing Dark Dangerous Satire",
            "content": "I am not going to go into much specifics except to say that this is one of the darkest and most disturbing films I have seen.  I would certainly in that way rank it alongside David Lynch's \"Eraserhead,\" Werner Herzog's \"Even Dwarfs Started Small,\" Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil,\" and more recently Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Punch Drunk Love.\"  Each of these films is funny in a way, some hilariously, all subversively.  I also must say, not to the detriment of the film necessarily, that this is one of the most irritating films I've seen.  Bunuel truly gets under the skin of what gets under our skin: inane quirks, selfish boors, groupthinkers.   The most disturbing imagery in the film suggests christian parallels with many of the guests praying or vowing to do good works if released, a butler that studied with jesuits and a final service in a church, as well as several lambs (often representations, as in Blake, of Jesus).  Possible also are references to Passover's \"exterminating\" angel of death, as a brick thrown through a window is at first attributed \"some passing Jew.\"  I will not presume to interpret these, and I probably could not do so convincingly if I tried, and, much like with Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive, I don't really want them interpreted for me.  This is the wonder of Bunuel.  \"Cinema is anarchistic\" is a probable misquote of him, but from the time of his last film no filmmakers except those above have been able to capture the feeling while watching a film that ANYTHING can happen, and very quickly, and how very frightening that is.  The other reason I write is that the VHS of this film is ATROCIOUS.   The best part is where one guest babbles on for about 10 seconds, none of which is shown in the subtitles AT ALL.  Most of them are difficult to read as they are against a white background, the quality is true crap.  \"Diary of a Chambermaid\" is a fine film but this is the one that truly needs to be seen as it was intended.  >",

The solution comes in a very interesting way and the least likely person. I hope you will watch and check it out.

At the end of the party N\u00f3bile, his wife, their guests and his butler (the other servants have already left) find themselves unable to leave the dining-room, so settle down to sleep on couches and the floor. The following morning they are still in the same inexplicable predicament. The doors are not locked but they are still unable to leave, as if some mysterious force field or psychological barrier were preventing them from doing so. They remain in the house in this state for several days, even though they run out of food and can only obtain water by breaking open a wall to get access to a water pipe. Even when one guest is taken ill, and later dies, they still cannot break out. The police and a crowd of people gather outside the house, but they are no more able to enter than those inside are to get out.Luis Bu\u00f1uel was one of the founders of cinematic surrealism, dating back to \"Un Chien Andalou\", his early collaboration with Salvador Dali, and \"The Exterminating Angel\" is often described as \"surrealist\". The surrealism starts with the title, which has nothing to do with anything we see on screen. Bu\u00f1uel, who acted as both writer and director, explains the strange plight of the guests, either in rational or in supernatural terms. Nor does he provide us with any interpretation of the film's symbolism, leaving such matters for his viewers to interpret for themselves.That, of course, has not prevented the critics coming up with their own interpretations, and there would not be room to deal with all of them in this review, although Bu\u00f1uel clearly intended an element of satire at the expense of the upper classes. (It is no accident that the host of the party has the surname \"N\u00f3bile\"). A popular interpretation put forward by, among others, Roger Ebert is that the film is an allegory of the Spanish Civil War and of the Francoist regime to which it led. (Bu\u00f1uel himself was, of course, an opponent of Francoism and produced this film in exile in Mexico). Many of Spain's aristocracy and wealthy classes initially supported Franco, and many of them may well have hosted parties like the one we see here to celebrate his victory, but by the early sixties his brutal dictatorship had lasted for a quarter of a century and many Spaniards, even among those who had once supported him, were starting to feel trapped. A flock of sheep plays a part in the story, and these may represent those ordinary Spaniards who supported the Nationalist side in the Civil War, \"sheep\" being a commonplace metaphor for people who are stupid and easily led. They end up being eaten by the trapped aristocrats.\"The Exterminating Angel\" is a film which tends to divide opinion, with some hailing it as a masterpiece and others finding it incomprehensible. I myself tend towards the second position, although Bu\u00f1uel would probably have said that he never intended it to be \"comprehensible\" in the sense of having a simple, easily understandable meaning. He probably intended it to be just what it is, an elegant but ultimately insoluble puzzle with no more \"meaning\" than a Dali painting. 6/10",

            "content": "If you want an introduction into the anarchic, surrealistic, bourgeois-baiting world of Luis Bunuel 'The Exterminating Angel' is the best place to start. The initial premise is simple, albeit puzzling - the guests at a dinner party mysteriously find themselves unable to leave their hosts house at the end of the evening. There's no logical reason why, they just can't. They are confused at first, but as the days go by and the food starts to run out, they become increasingly more desperate and turn on each other. Bunuel makes the most of the idea and creates a complex, multi-layered movie, packed with fascinating small details, intriguing dialogue and surprising situations, most of which is left up to the viewer to \"explain\". Bunuel is one of those directors, like David Lynch, Russ Meyer or Coffin Joe, that viewers either \"get\" or they don't. His vision is original and uncompromised and not for everyone. Me, I think he made some of the greatest movies of all time, especially his fertile 1960s period which included some of his very best work like 'Belle De Jour' and yes, 'The Exterminating Angel'.",

            "content": "One of Bunuel's most rare and amazing , \u00a8The Exterminating Angel\u00a8 is packed with surreal moments , criticism , absurd situations and astonishing nightmares . This is one Bu\u00f1uel's best , including characteristically scatological satire , fierce as well as surreal nightmares and surprising events . Dramatic film about strange relationships among various members of higher class when they remain locked into a mansion . As a luxurious mansion is the place wherein some dinner guests find they cannot for any definable reason leave the dining room . This is weird story about a group of higher class , a drama with surrealism and sour portrait upon social stratum , catholicism , with plenty of dream imaginary and many other things , being stunningly realized by the Spanish maestro of surrealism , the great Luis Bu\u00f1uel . This is a typical Bu\u00f1uel film , as there are a lot of symbolism , social critique , including mockery or wholesale review upon religion , especially Catholicism . Luis Bu\u00f1uel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion , issues well shown in a lot of films and that would preoccupy Bu\u00f1uel for the rest of his career . Here Bunuel gives a perverse studio about wealthy people , desire and tension when a misfit bunch is closed for any inexplicable reason ; and even being strongly cut and banned by Russian censorship because the idea of people not being allowed to \"leave a party\" was considered offensive and anti-government . The scene where a bear and two sheep appear during the dinner party was based on a real incident at a dinner party that Bu\u00f1uel once attended in New York . In his autobiography Luis Bu\u00f1uel claims he was asked by Warner Brothers to work on a story that eventually was filmed as The beast with five fingers (1946) , it contains many of the elements of the earlier film including the large mansion, piano recital, and stabbing of a disembodied hand . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay from the same Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Luis Alcoriza, Bu\u00f1uel's usual screenwriter ; they pull off a straight-faced treatment of shocking subject matter .The movie script was original and early working title \"The Castaways of Providence Street\" , then Luis Bu\u00f1uel took the title The Exterminating Angel from his friend Jos\u00e9 Bergamin, the Spanish poet, who had mentioned it the year before for a play he wanted to write . Out of all the films in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican/Spanish film period, this is the only film he had complete creative control over . Nice acting by all-Mexican-star cast such as Claudio Brook , Jacqueline Andere , Enrique Rambal and Silvia Pinal of Viridiana , among others . The film relies heavily on the relationship between them , as are developed love-hatred conflicts . Furthermore , Bu\u00f1uel satirizes and he carries out outright critical to aristocracy , bourgeoisie and attack upon religion . Atmospheric as well as evocative cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa , Bu\u00f1uel's ordinary . This thoughtful and dramatic motion picture was well produced by Gustavo Alatriste and compellingly directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Bu\u00f1uel's strange film belongs to his Mexican period ; in fact , it's plenty of known Mexican actors . Born in Calanda , Aragon (1900) , Bu\u00f1uel subsequently moved to Madrid to study at the university there, where his close friends included Salvador Dal\u00ed and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. After moving to Paris , at the beginning Bu\u00f1uel did a variety of film-related odd jobs , including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal\u00ed, he made his first film , this 17-minute \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929), and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year , sponsored by wealthy art patrons, he made his first picture , the scabrous witty and violent \"Age of Gold\" (1930), which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes, themes that would preoccupy Bu\u00f1uel for the rest of his career . That career, though, seemed almost over by the mid-1930s, as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War , where he made \u00a8Las Hurdes\u00a8 , as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer \u00d3scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in \u00a8Los Olvidados\u00a8 (1950), winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this new-found acclaim, Bu\u00f1uel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultra-low-budget films, few of which made much impact outside Spanish-speaking countries , though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming \"The Great Madcap\" , \u00a8The brute\u00a8, \"Wuthering Heights\", \u00a8El\u00a8 , \"The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz\" , \u00a8Robinson Crusoe\u00a8 , \u00a8Death in the garden\u00a8 and many others . After returning his native country, Spain, by making \u00a8Viridiana\u00a8 this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy as well as \u00a8The milky way\u00a8 or Via Lactea , both of them were strongly prohibited by Spanish censorship . Most Bu\u00f1uel's films were surreal black comedies , parables that satirized moral hypocrisy , social moral , artistic pretension, and , of course , the Catholic Church . In French-Spanish final period the collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re gave notorious as well as polemic films such as \u00a8Viridiana\u00a8 , \u00a8The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" and \u00a8Belle De Jour\u00a8. His last one was the notorious \u00a8That obscure object of desire\u00a8 (1977",

Bu\u00f1uel is satirising the mannerisms of the upper class here, and a few thought-provoking ideas do come to light, but despite the characters been quite well introduced, few are explored very well. It is a bit hard for this reason to care for any of the characters or their experience, and it ends up being quite melodramatic and dreary to watch. The story is not very convincing either, since it interchanges between horror and satire so that we are not sure just what exactly is keeping the characters at bay. As a surrealist piece, an explanation is perhaps not necessary, and although few, its few surrealism bits work very well. The black and white photography is perfectly suited to the project, with stark contrasts and some nice gliding shots. There are a number of good elements in the film, but I would be cautious about how strongly to recommend it.",

This reluctance to leave carries on to the next day, at which time it is apparent that they CANNOT leave. An invisible force seems to be preventing them from leaving.Written and directed by Luis Bunuel, a movie that kept me intrigued for most of its duration, only to let me down at the end. It doesn't start too coherently, feeling very clumsy in its initial setup. This is deliberate, it turns out, as the later plot development explains this clumsiness. Once it gets going it is very intriguing, as the guests are trapped in a room with nothing physically stopping them from leaving.It also becomes a good study in human interaction and behaviour, as the guests turn on each other and self-interest overrides the greater good.Everything was set up for a great revelation and solution to the puzzle, plus a moment of profundity. However, none of these really came. The solution to leaving the room was incredibly weak, and we never get an explanation for the entrapment. The conclusion gives some indication to what it was all about, but it is hardly revolutionary or overly profound.Disappointing.",

            "content": "Made in 1962, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL is a highly complex film to watch, despite is ostensibly straightforward story. A group of rich people gather together in a large house for a party, but find themselves unable to escape. Deprived of their basic comforts such as food, water and clothing, they are transformed into savages. Outside the building, people look on in astonishment; while being concerned for the welfare of those trapped inside, they make no efforts to help. Bunuel's film can be seen as an allegory of contemporary society, in which the veneer of civilization is highly superficial. Rich people, just like their less privileged counterparts, are unable to find ways of extricating themselves from difficult situations. Even though they escape at the end, they are subsequently imprisoned in the church: Bunuel shows that nobody, not even established institutions, can help them (or us, for that matter). The film ends with a flock of sheep running towards the church where the people are imprisoned, suggesting that human beings are like lambs to the slaughter. The only way to cope with this inevitable fate is to trust in Providence; hence it comes as no surprise to find the action taking place in Providence Street. THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL needs to be viewed more than once in order to appreciate the subtlety of Bunuel's script, as well as the brilliance of his cinematic technique, but it is well worth the effort.",

Although the movie was made in 1962, it was a very grainy print, and I am assuming that this was deliberate - it looked as though we were looking at something from the 1920s. I liked this; it was all part of it. This was an amazing movie - and amazingly prescient - a metaphor for the human condition (not just the upper classes), our life on this planet, and how fragile it all is (the slightest pressure on resources, the slightest dislocation, and the whole edifice crumbles). The room they did not want to leave is this planet earth and our life on it. The guests are a metaphor for all of us, and we are very, very attached to life. When we are having a wonderful time, for sure we don't want to leave life and the planet - and even when we have made the most terrible mess of it (because we don't want to leave) and the whole thing has degenerated into fighting, bickering,destruction, hunger, thirst - we STILL don't want to leave. In the movie, as in the cycle of life, it is not until there is a reprieve when everything suddenly clicks back into how it was (reincarnation?)that they are able to leave. They go back to the Church - but that is no answer either, because the whole same thing happens over again. At the end, the sheep all go to the church - \"lambs to the slaughter\" (and English phrase - I am English). It is an interesting parable for today's world: the rich (First World countries?) take for granted food and water -- until they experience the loss of it firsthand themselves (the Third World?), and then all the social castes and 'mores' which they (we) have built up, crumble - they fight each other, they hallucinate, they hunger, they thirst. Later, even once they are free of the room, we see fighting in the streets of the city, with troops firing on the civilian population. The movie was made in 1962: does any of this sound familiar in today's world of 2006 ?",

The funniest part is that nobody forces the guests to stay, nobody holds a gun to their heads or blackmails them. They just don't have a willpower to open the door and go outside where the police, family members, and press are waiting...not be able to make few steps to the party house and open the door from outside....Once again Bunuel proves that he is one of just a few artists who could tell the same joke over and over again and get away with it creating the film as perplexing, absurdist, bizarre and in the same time irresistibly funny and clever as \"The Exterminating Angel\".

Bunuel describes the slow decay of these supposedly human beings of the upper cultured classes that had been abandoned by their servants, the workers who had gone abroad. These top people finally find their way out of the trap when the servants come back. Note they have survived by eating some stray lamb that appeared one night in their diabolical circle.

Director Luis Bu\u00f1uel is making a statement here about the vapid nature of like minded members of the upper crust, but I'm not sure that it's as successful as he would have liked it to be. One way he's able to demonstrate the distinction between the wealthy and those of less noble ambition occurs at the beginning of the picture, as members of a household staff make their way off duty and find easy exit from the premises. What's left are the hosts (Enrique Rambal, Lucy Gallardo) and their two dozen or so guests to fend for themselves in fairly comfortable fashion, until about three or so in the morning, when they individually and collectively find themselves making excuses for staying a while longer. There are no physical barriers to leaving, only a seemingly impenetrable veil of incomprehension that keeps everyone rooted to their original destination. A couple does die during the ordeal, which extends for more than a few days, having ensconced themselves in a small closet to hide away from the others. The one connection any of this has to the name of the picture is represented by a single door through which many of the guests pass, which carries a full length image of an angel holding a long staff, which could have been a sword to lend credence to the title, but it just didn't look like one. Bunuel had a distasteful view of organized religion, especially Catholicism, so the angel imagery was probably meant to cast a pall over the fate of the individuals trapped inside. As the days pass, inquisitive onlookers and authorities on the outside of the mansion are just as mesmerized as those caught within, as no one is able to enter the building to offer help. It's only through the the insight of a particular guest (Silvia Pinal) that the hypnotic spell of the mansion is broken, as she insists that each guest relive the exact moment they found themselves in when the home's possession took over. Once complete, the guests find they are able to leave, after having fought and argued with each other over trivialities that afflict the very rich. I can't say that this film is one I enjoyed, or even understood much while viewing, but upon reflection afterward, much of the symbolism breaks through and one gets a sense of the director's vision. It's certainly easier to interpret than the only other work of Bu\u00f1uel I've happened to see, a short from 1929 titled \"Un Chien Andalou\". That one will make you want to slit your eyeballs.",

This is about people brought together at a dinner party, invited because of they are all upper-class people who are well known among one another.  Yet for some reason, they can't leave the mansion.

But what happens when you are stuck in one place, and wealth really starts losing its worth?  You then see how out of place they all are amongst each other.  Afterall, in the very beginning, they were all bad mouthing each other.  Bunuel mocks their phoniness.Material things in the house, loses their meaning.  They start peeing in expensive things, they don't seem to use toilets.  A man is shaving for no reason just keeps on shaving without noticing it.  A women keeps seeing a hand moving she gets psychotic.Randomly, we see some sheep in a kitchen.  This represents the whole \"out of place\" theme.  That these people are the sheep.

            "content": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel's (1900 - 1983) exile to Mexico, in 1946, had never withered his talent to surprise, shock and bewilder. His political stance clearly shows his support toward the Workers' factions and his despise for the dictatorial ruling classes that was The Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939). During his stay in Mexico, he was to make an enigma, an insight into the principles of survival amongst the elite and their dealings of the trappings of success and the fear of failure to keep composure and dignity.Some can say that his work in El \u00e1ngel exterminador may be seen as a metaphor for the eagerness of the ruling classes to rely on the lower orders to satisfy their own needs. However, when these lower orders, these servants', flee into the night, it leaves the high-ranking elite in disbelief as how to continue this bourgeoisie existence without its backbone, its workforce, that is needed to keep this lifestyle in its perpetual splendour. It too, may also be seen as the stance against the Franco regime and the working people leaving in droves, from the lands, the factories to retaliate against the dictatorship of the Spanish rulings classes. Without the lower classes these intellectuals', these land and factory owners' et al are powerless, they have no means to continue this extravagance they have become accustomed. With this newfound realisation of alienation, the implosion of morals, etiquette and social order soon take effect.However, this too can be seen also as a simple theory, but not excluding it altogether, there are deeper, spiritual meanings here too, apart from the physical, why can they not leave the room? Are they afraid to lose all their inhibitions totally and be seen as uncouth and forward? Remembering too, that this house of opulence is situated in Providence Street; the name in itself is a hint of something more worthy, more grandeur than those who reside in it; \"If Divine Providence frees us we will offer a Te Deum\" mutters a frustrated guest. With Gods, possibly, guiding hand, these souls are thrown into bedlam and chaos and stifled by their own virtues, stripped bare to become exposed as human beings the barriers of pretence, indifference, ignorance and hypocrisy are thrown into turmoil and they do not like what they see. They do not like what they have become. They do not like the fact that they are no different from any other. Amusing too, is the fact that when awaking on the first morning of entrapment, then unknown to them, after sleeping on the floor and sofas, most, comment on how poor their appearance is, it is this outward vanity that shows us just how narcissistic and self-centred this society has evolved.As the second act too evolves, it is more than apparent that in this psychological trauma as an elderly man lies dying amongst them, they are willing, but at the same time incapable of helping. Penned up sheep they have become, and unwilling to think and act with free will, until someone can lead the way of course; \"I'll shall fetch help if you leave first\", the old man dies. These are the rules of etiquette, while individualism and intelligence sets them apart from the masses, each one has to conform to the next, the first to break the rules' of etiquette, to render themselves inappropriate, is seen as unsociable and in poor taste. They are truly trapped, in both the physical sense and the mental. Only cowards reside here, each wanting out, but no one willing to try for the glory of freedom, it's best to go when one is following, afraid of the unknown neither Man or Woman is willing, or strong enough, to lead the way forward, with resentment they wait, they dissolve and rot.As the situation worsens so do the paranoia's, disdain and trust, blame turns to hate, hate turns to madness and madness turns to the ultimate sin. Only God, the Divine Elohim, can save their Souls, if not faith in something bigger because faith in one another, in the human traits of companionship, honesty and camaraderie are now non-existent.Even too, outside are the baying crowds eager to enter the house, with police barricades they shout \"Let us in, we're not animals\", they walk up to the large imposing gate and stop dead in their tracks, they cannot walk any further, something stops them that is also not seen. This could be representative of the lower classes who, divided from this system of, a higher, etiquette, and who in turn wishes to be treated and respected in the same capacity? With no one walking out and no one walking in, it is this barrier of consciousness that is setting the narrative that we are all born free but the social ties, constraints and obligations' are what sets us from the \"others\". It isn't so much that these people are trapped within a room of no bars, guards and barriers' that can be seen, it is more to the point that it isn't where they are but who they are and what has lead them to become who they are. This is a prison of their own making, and it could just have been one single Man in a phone box, a church to a baying crowd outside, as opposed to a crowded room with gentry and sophistication.If there are answers here then they are also elusive, with a looming cloud over its patrons The Exterminating Angel is a prison within a prison, and why pick on these Souls here? Perhaps, in all honesty, it is this genre of the human race that sees itself above most others, and it is God bringing these socialites' down to earth, with a bang. Simple, I know, but with this premise of the complexities' of human nature, can a simple equation be so easily found? Found out for yourself, and experience an enigma.",

The doors are not locked and there is no logical reason why they cannot leave, yet they remain trapped like prisoners, and likewise, no one can enter (the flummoxed police are stationed outside, trying to work out how to save the rich people). Over the course of the film, the loathing and contempt that they really always felt for both themselves and one another comes bubbling to the rotten surface as they are slowly stripped of their status and pretensions, fighting over water, sleeping on the floor, and insulting one another as their hungry bodies begin to stink from the oppressive heat.In this new world, the bourgeoisie's money and power are reduced to worthlessness. 'Anything but physical violence! This is not like us! Remember who you are, remember your upbringing!', a doctor exclaims, trying to break up a brawl, but this is a meaningless gesture -- here the rich are no better than anyone else, for even the servants and cooks had the earthy precognition to realise what was coming and depart at the start of the film, before the invisible padlocks manifested.This film is a brilliant, incredibly funny example of Bu\u00f1uel's career manifesto: the rich and powerful are nothing without their wealth, and in the absence of the poor they have no one to control or feel superior to. Take it all away and they become the human beings (ie. animals) that all people really are, deep down. The poor are more important to the rich than they ever realise.A film like 'The Exterminating Angel' serves to remind us that, regardless of wealth, we are all trapped inside the frigid, repressive boxes of our own (and society's) creation, and a conscious decision to leave them on our own terms is nearly impossible.",

The surreal imagery that digs into the characters' corrupted psyche were the highlight of the story, while the arguments and drama that ensues between the invitees are the side dish.The long, mundane scenes seemed a bit pointless. Maybe there was a meaning in there that I couldn't catch, but I felt like it ruined an otherwise excellent film. That's why I give this six stars, I had the feeling that Bu\u00f1uel didn't want to go full blown surrealist, which is a pity since I think a more artsy, dream-like approach would have improved this film.

They slowly devolve into savagery and vulgarity. It's sort of like the Eagles song \"Hotel California\" except that this film lasts 70 minutes longer than the song. And you can't dance to it.But the problem is not the slow pace nor is it the lack of plot. The main problem is that Bunuel fails to develop his characters, so we are left with a satire of... nothing! There is really nothing to sink our philosophical teeth into. The resolution is utterly meaningless and random, and it leaves you saying to yourself \"I could have thought of a million better ways to end that movie.\" But as it were, Bunuel chose the most vapid resolution, similar to a cheezy TV scifi drama where the solution is to \"switch the polarity from plus to minus!\" This film is utterly unfulfilling to anyone who is thirsty for philosophy and depth. Of course the Bunuel fans will retort that Bunuel never claimed to have any meaning to his films. Sadly, I must agree. But what frustrates me most is that he had the perfect opportunity to deliver an insightful commentary on the human condition, but instead he let it degrade into utter schlock.Bunuel loves to ridicule the rich. That's fine, but maybe he should give us a reason WHY the rich are so ridiculous. It's not enough to make fun of a man just because he wears a tuxedo. Without giving us sufficient insights into the personalities of his characters, that's all Bunuel is doing: making fun of people because of the clothes and jewelry they wear. But I suppose back in that era, it was en vogue to make fun of rich people. Come to think of it, audiences haven't changed much in the last 50 years.I give this film 4 stars instead of 1 because at least in this film Bunuel doesn't slaughter any animals on camera.",

            "content": "Luis Bunuel became known at the end of the 20s and early 30s with films such as \"Un chien Andalou\" (1929) and \"L'age d'or\" (1930), but his great period only began in the 60s when he was himself also already in his 60s (born in 1900).\"The exterminating angel\" (1962) is the second film of this great period, after \"Viridiana\" (1961). The film has a close relation with \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie\" that was released 10 years later. In \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie\" a couple of upper middle class people are trying to have dinner, but are disturbed each time they are about to begin. In \"The exterminating angel\" a group of upper middle class people have had dinner but find themselves unable te leave the mansion after they have finished their meal, without there being a physical barrier.Although Bunuel himself has always stressed that there is no logic in the film, two interpretations have become quite common.According to the first interpretation the film shows how thin the layer of civilisation of the upper middle class (contrary to their self image) really is. In this interpretation the film has a close resemblances with movies such as \"Lord of the flies\" (1963, Peter Brook) and \"La grande bouffe\" (1973, Marco Ferreri). This interpretation is visualised by the mansion deteriorating in a cave where sheep are roasted on an open fire.According to the second interpretation the film stands for the political isolation conservative Spain had fallen into after the Second World war with the Franco regime. In this political isolation interpretation the non physical character of the barrier makes sense. In the other interpretation it only gives the film a surrealist character, where other directors would have invented a more natural cause (such as for example heavy weather).A dinner party is one of Bunuels favourite settings. Not only in the two already mentioned films plays this a pivotal role, but also in \"Viridiana\" a parody on the last supper is one of the key scenes. I think the reason is that a dinner party combines on the one hand a basic human need (food) and on the other hand a social convention (etiquette) with which the upper class tries to distinguish themselves from the rest of the population.",

            "content": "Surrealism has amongst its artistic goals, a revolutionary destruction of the social forms that stand in the way of the \"creative\", and instead, are moribund in their repetitive rigidity. The arch villain in Bunuel's Book of Social Crimes is the exploitative institution of the bourgeois. This, ruling class, is held in contempt in most of Bunuel's films, but most notably in this movie.The movie opens with a Catholic Cathedral, funereal music, and sheep as the congregation. Bunuel's bourgeois are Catholic adherents of Karl Marx's \"Opium of the People\" {his description of the role of religion in society}.The scene then shifts to a plutocratic mansion, where a gathering of the rich and cultured is to take place, in which one of the most holy sacraments of bourgeois society is about to begin. The social ritual in which assorted bourgeois people sit at a large banquet table and are plied with different courses of elegantly prepared food by foot servants, which had been anxiously and expertly prepared by the chef and his kitchen staff.Bunuel alerts us {the viewers} early as to the incipient chaos to follow by having the kitchen staff abandon their conventional order of events by unpredictably walking off the job. This strange/peculiar juxtaposition of that which is predictable sets the stage for the arrival of the Exterminating Angel, whom we never see physically, but are made aware of as the movie progresses. The evening progresses as the depleted staff serves dinner to the narcissists gathered at the table. The central theme in this movie is reached when Bunuel applies a primitive form of magic and superstition to the apparently \"modern man\", represented at the bourgeois dinner party. This tradition often described in Frazier's \"The Golden Bough\" is the drawing of a circle around a primitive victim by a shaman from which there is no escape. The victim will not, {because of fear and superstition}, step across the line and break the circle. The result is a lingering death paralyzed within the chalked circle.At the end of the dinner, and after pleasantries and some cultivated appreciation of classical piano playing, the invisible circle is chalked at the exit to the dining-room leaving the assorted guests unable to perform the act of taking their leave and departing.Here you have the central issue of the film, as the bourgeois guests descend into a nightmarish hell of inertia, apathy and utter lack of resourcefulness, so that the typical bourgeois traits of herd-like conformity, self interest and alienation become stumbling blocks to the simple human capacity to act. No action is possible as the vile, dark side of the inner bourgeois personality is slowly revealed. They sleep, they dream, {often surrealistically}, they harbour murderous resentment {as scapegoats for their dilemma are sought}. Everything is in stasis, nothing can break the spell { a magic ritual with chicken legs is attempted, but fails}. People die, lovers commit suicide, sheep {the lamb of God?} are eaten as civilization, of which the human social phenomenon of the bourgeois can be considered to be its apex, crumbles back into the cesspool of primal soup from which it developed.The spell is eventually broken when one of the guests remembers the alchemical and ancient magical practice of reenacting the events that led up to the circle being drawn but then changing its chain of magical order by leaving, {like an automaton}, at the usual time and mannerThe movie then reverts back to the prologue with the sheep entering the Cathedral, in order to worship. An utterly amazing movie!!",

The subtitles were white, and sometimes disappeared when the picture was white. When the subtitles were particularly lengthy, they sometimes got cut off on the edges of the picture.

A satire of the bourgeoisie? An offbeat survival tale? A bit of all?In spite of its surrealist moments, for the most part this feels like an expanded episode of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. A bunch of archetypical characters in a puzzling situation struggling. It even has a kicker, as the best episodes did, although most TZ episodes are a bit neater in the denoument.The movie is charmingly odd and has notable moments, some of which seem like call backs to the great Dali/Bunuel collaboration Un Chien Andalou. At the same time, it's not terribly involving; at an hour and a half feels overlong. The characters are bland and there's little real drama between them. Compare this with Hitchcock's Life Boat, which also trapped a group of characters in a small space but did so much more with those characters.But then Bunuel is more about concepts than character or drama. Which is probably why I've been underwhelmed by most of the Bunuel films I've seen. This one is worth checking out, but it could have been a better movie.",

There are plenty of trapped/survival films, but I haven't seen any where the people were so poorly equipped and trapped so unexpectedly as they were in this film.

They showed no new information and, despite what the movie's fans might believe, it was an extremely poor hint to the movie's conclusion.The progression was good and bad, but leaning more towards unrealistic. By the climax, the room looked appropriately disheveled, but the people were clean shaven and only mildly unkempt. The drama was also extremely reserved compared to most other movies in the survival genre.",

A group of upper crust party goers are suddenly put in a situation like the Star Trek force field. Except the force field seems to be in their heads. They cannot leave the room they are in and are forced to take up residency in this mansion. The servants have hit the road and so they are forced to face the trials imposed on them using the tools their pathetic selves have provided. Obviously, Bunuel doesn't like these people and makes them incompetent and ineffective. The kicker, of course, is that they don't have any will, just like the sheep and the bear that run through the house. Of course, it is all surreal and strange traits began to show themselves. They are fundamentally uncivilized and fall prey to baser instincts as well as wallowing in their own filth. There is a great kicker at the end which seems to work, but where is the world going. Or is this just allegorical? Is life just like this, only less dramatic. Certainly a seminal work.",

Sorry, but why do \"surreal\" movies have to have a messy, amateurish, and above all, an incoherent scenario and dialogues? Can't we have interesting and realistic discussions, with occasionally some surreal moments? In this way, the surrealism can be emphasized.And no, this movie is not creative nor intellectual. It is incoherent from the beginning. In the first 15 minutes, the dialogues were so messy and unrealistic that I didn't understand anything. Therefore, I cannot remember them, and consequently, they are meaningless. Incoherent is not artistic, nor creative. Not everyone can be David Lynch.",

My parents were for ever trying to find a 'better' place for themselves in 'society' and parties seemed design to meet and influence people. There was also the guilt that had to be felt for not attending church. I didn't know why I didn't feel much affinity for their seeming ingratiating behaviour and what I took to be illogical beliefs, but when I saw this it was as if there were now at least one other person in the world who thought as I. Sounds as if I'm elevating myself a bit here but it is not intended. We had little exposure to TV and it was all too possible for a parental unit to present an unchallenged view of the world. So Bunuel came crashing into my life and I lapped up all his films and when later 'Belle de Jour' even made it to the main cinema in my local town I was thrilled. By then, however, even my parents were fans. Others have described the simple plot line and I am merely comparing watching it so long ago and being transfixed by such a resonant movie and seeing it again now. Because the film meant so much to me I have been fearful of re-visiting it but I need not have been concerned. It is brilliantly shot with fantastic dialogue, funny, profound and still explodes like the biggest firework in the box.",

Basically wealthy society couple Se\u00f1or Edmundo Nobile (Enrique Rambal) and his wife Luc\u00eda (Lucy Gallardo) invite a group of twenty friends for formal dinner, following an evening at the opera, at their lavish mansion in Mexico City. The house servants one by one are called away or for various reasons leave the estate, and after dinners the guests adjourn to the music room where guest Blanca (Patricia de Morelos) plays the piano, and later when they may normally return home, the guests remove their jackets, loosen their gowns and settle down for the night on couches, chairs and the floor. In the morning, for an unknown reason, it is apparent they are trapped in the music room, not physically but psychologically, unable to leave the guests consume what little water and food they can find from the previous night's party. Days go by, the plight for the guests becomes intense, they quarrel, become hostile and hysterical, only Doctor Carlos Conde (Augusto Benedico) manages to keep his cool and with logic and reason guides the guests through the ordeal. Elderly guest Sergio Russell (Antonio Bravo) dies, his body is placed in a large cupboard, later a young couple due to be married, Beatriz (Ofelia Montesco) and Eduardo (Xavier Mass\u00e9), lock themselves in a closet and commit suicide. Meanwhile the guests manage to find a water source, breaking through the wall and a water pipe, several sheep and a bear break loose from their bonds and find their way into the room, the sheep are taken and slaughtered and roasted. Dr. Conde reveals to Nobile that Leonora (Bertha Moss), one of his patients, is dying of cancer, a secret supply of morphine is used keep her fit, but the drugs are stolen by brother and sister Francisco (Xavier Loy\u00e1) and Juana (Ofelia Guilm\u00e1in). One of the guests Ana Maynar (Nadia Haro Oliva), a Jew and a practitioner of Kabbalah, fails to free the others performing a mystical ceremony. Eventually, Ra\u00fal (Tito Junco) suggests Nobile is responsible for their predicament and must be sacrificed, only Dr. Conde and noble Coronel Alvaro (C\u00e9sar del Campo) oppose the angry mob, Nobile offers to take his own life, but then young foreign guest Leticia 'La Valkiria' (Silvia Pinal) sees everyone is in the same position as when it all began. On the instructions of Leticia the group reconstruct the conversations and movements from the night of the party and discover they are free to leave the room, local police and the servants are gathered outside the manor, they found themselves similarly unable to enter. To give thanks for their rescue, the guests attend a ceremony at the cathedral, when the service is over, the churchgoers and the clergy find that they are trapped, it is unclear if those trapped in the house before are now trapped again. The house guests seem to have disappeared, the situation is the church is followed by a street riot and the military step in, the last scene sees a flock of sheep entering the church, and the sound of gunshots. Also starring Jacqueline Andere as Alicia de Roc, Luis Berist\u00e1in as Cristi\u00e1n Ugalde, Claudio Brook as Julio the Steward, Rosa Elena Durgel as Silvia and Enrique Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez as Alberto Roc. I admit the first twenty minutes or so I was gripped, it was just simply the gentle upper class party atmosphere, but once you realise the guests are trapped with seemingly no way out, becoming almost crazed and retracing their steps to solve the problem, it does become interesting, there were some stand out and chilling moments, overall it was a satisfyingly darkly comedic in part satirical drama.

The premise reminded me of No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre, but unlike that play, these people aren't dead, and the setup is geared to satirizing the wealthy class. Early on, despite all their affluence and culture, we see them act heartlessly towards the servants, and once in their confinement, they steadily degenerate into base behavior. The bubble of civilization is quickly burst, and it's almost as if at any moment Rod Serling might step out from behind a curtain and tell us that these folks are in the Twilight Zone. It's an interesting film to watch while cooped up during the coronavirus crisis! But I confess it only got truly interesting to me in the ending sequence, where some additional (and ambiguous) layers were brought in, e.g. military rule and the populace as sheep going into the church, which seemed to suggest Spain during the fascist era, and some further dark commentary on humanity.",

In 1962 (three years before I was born), this may well have been scintillating, cutting-edge film making. By 2012 standards, \"The Exterminating Angel\" holds up only as a period piece. It represents its era well much the same way George Melies' \"A Trip to the Moon\" represents its era. I selected the Melies film for comparison because it is widely regarded as a watershed achievement for 1902. I can think of no other reason why \"The Exterminating Angel\" should be heaped with such praise by modern audiences - because it shaped what followed it. That alone does not make it a great film.Other better and more enjoyable watershed films include \"Lost Horizon,\" \"Metropolis,\" \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Nosferatu,\" and \"Casablanca.\" \"The Exterminating Angel\" is an unfinished thought, too conventional to be considered much of an experiment; it wants to be a thought-provoking message movie, but it doesn't have anything to say and the only thought it provoked for me was \"how much longer until I begin to care about what's happening?\" Is \"The Exterminating Angel\" a bad movie? No, but nor does it represent the best that cinema has to offer and deserve to populate so many the top 50 or top 100 lists.My review may very well be derided for being too narrow-minded, ethnocentric, and corrupted by CGI. Trying to learn about the history of film, I looked forward to \"The Exterminating Angel\" and was more than willing to view it in its own terms. Days after watching this film, however, I still can't shake my conclusion that, even this agonizingly overlong movie was trimmed by three-quarters, the storyline and resulting tele-play wouldn't even make a memorable Twilight Zone episode. Hoping to see a bit of film history, I could find little reason to care about the characters or their plight, its causes and resolution. The film seemed less like a movie than an exercise.

            "content": "Take an assembly of wealthy dinner guests, cage them up long enough, he proposes, and they'll lay into each other like scavengers. The Exterminating Angel's a profound satire that implies that we conceal barbaric impulses. The dinner guests enter two times. They climb the stairs, cross the ample entryway, and then enter again. Same visitors, higher camera angle. It's a gag; shortly we'll appreciate the pay-off: The visitors, having so totally entered, can't exit.Bunuel's mocking abstraction looks to be lampooning a genre which generally cuts through the larger blueprint of the universal unfairness and backbiting between in-people and outcasts, which are the crucial heart of Bu\u00f1uel's send-up, the disaster genre, before it even became entirely recognized. (Naturally there were some preceding models, like Hitchcock's Lifeboat.) Bunuel starts with diminutive, disquieting omens. The helpers abruptly flee, simultaneously as the guests are expected. The hostess is angry; she intended an after-dinner amusement including a bear and some sheep. Now it'll have to be called off. It's characteristic of Bunuel that such surrealistic dashes are visited without remark.The cocktail hour's a hit. The guests murmur insults about one another, judging and interrelating by materialism, envy, resentment. They saunter into the lounge, where we peep a woman's purse, overflowing with chicken feathers and rooster claws. A doctor forecasts that another woman will soon go bald. However the more general framework of the congregation appears customary enough: Drinks are nursed, piano-playing, everyone seems graceful in dinner clothes.Then, in a succession of cunning occurrences, it grows ostensible that no one can go. They make parting motions, flow toward the foyer, nothing preventing them. Nevertheless, they just can't. There's a regretful acquiescence to the circumstance, as they make themselves snug on futons and carpets. This is an inspired beginning for a tricky movie. The pitch is discreet, yet so many ominous fine points have amassed that by this time, Bunuel has us bound in his magic charm.Most people are frauds, the self-righteous and affluent above all. The dinner guests are the aristocracy in right-wing authoritarian Spain. Having prepared a feast for themselves by overpowering the workforce, they sit down for a banquet, only to be confined in their own capitalistic dead end. Ever more bitter at being excluded from the body politic, their nastiest predispositions are exposed. So akin to refinement is the cave.Bunuel had the most extraordinary late blossoming in which his flair emerged in a momentous freethinking torrent of severe lampoonery and smiling fascination. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is an inversion of this movie, wherein guests are perpetually sitting down to dinner, yet continually obstructed in their longing to eat. Here though, we see a negligible betrayal of propriety turn into the breakdown of society. This story doesn't just destabilize our assurance in our social conventions but it contests our abilities of understanding and discernment, which are shown to be effortlessly deformed by erratic plots.Ironically for a Bunuel film, the story's simple to encapsulate, but the characters' reasons stay inexplicable. The plot puts us in the same state as the guests, confused over why they can't leave, how they might flee, what it all signifies. The movie's completely prearranged around the demoralizing dinner party, which happens on Providence Street. The dinner party works as one of the refined ceremonies to reject humanity's animal temperament. Bu\u00f1uel converts it into an insubordinate measure of using human barbarity, which may rationalize the incidence of the lady of the house's bear and sheep yet which prove far less inhuman than her company. Bu\u00f1uel highlights the disparity between the dinner party's main purpose of nourishing a necessity we share with all other animals and the Conservative procedure that's used to disconnect rich from poor, sanctified from irreverent.All this has the sort of untried architecture that Bu\u00f1uel would thrust to its boundaries in his ultimate works, that can also be seen in his early surrealist landmarks. It generates a friction between sensory acuity and storyline consistency, where the narrative movement's doubted as a method of censorship, the causal imagery appreciated as a mine of breakthrough and insurrection. We're persistently met with reiterations, contradictions, incongruities, which can be overlooked if we concentrate too much on storyline progression. Yet a sensory alertness facilitates us to see that something's exceedingly amiss with this plot, and sanctions the character played by Silvia Pinal---sexier than ever---to suggest an inspired way to escape.Like the guests, we crave a coherent clarification that'll liberate us from the angst provoked by such unsettling actions. This struggle to understand is staged in the narrative as Pinal, dubbed \"the Valkyrie\" and \"the Virgin,\" takes charge with an idea she senses, one with some significant holes. Regardless, via some collective \"faith\" in this silly premise, the guests are astonishingly liberated, only to have the identical sort of entrapment recur in another (faith-based) location. While the guests have been conditioned by their civilization to practice custom and story consistency, we've been conditioned by earlier sequences that recurrence is the secret.When sophistication's slim layer collapses, Bu\u00f1uel's plutocratic visitors fall into cruelty, destroying walls to get to water pipes, committing suicide, commanding sacrificial slaughters, and consulting the supernatural, imaginings, and stories for solace and relief. Their unexplained powerlessness to leave the room is undergone as a breakdown of determination, maybe no more mystifying than the one that thwarts people from altering the utterly dishonest economic sociopolitical structure on which our own advantages, and the deprivation of others, are built.",

However, in his carefully concocted screenplays, no text, no image, no character, no sequence doesn't have a meaning, not always a logical one, but at least an associative one. Hereafter, a modest contribution to the many interpretations already published about 'The Exterminating Angel'. We should not forget that the screenplay of this movie is based on an unfinished play by Jos\u00e9 Bergamin, a catholic and Marxist.In 'Providence street' a group of upper class people (pars pro toto) gets trapped in a house after a dinner party given by the soprano Lucia after her performance as 'Lucia', the main role in the opera 'Lucia di Lammermoor' by G. Donizetti. The libretto of the opera, based on a novel by Walter Scott, contains a bad (forced) marriage, a mad scene, a ghost and a suicide, all elements used in the movie. Before the dinner party began, all members of the underclass (the servants) had left the house for all kinds of reasons, except the majordomo ('a clown'). At night, the guests don't want to leave the house and prefer to stay inside it during the whole night. In the morning, they find out that they are trapped inside. A journey into 'the disintegration of human dignity' begins. Without their servants, the upper class members are not capable of organizing a normal way of life. Their mansion doesn't become a paradise, despite the playing of a piano piece by Pietro Domenico 'Paradisi' and despite a cabalistic ritual, amulets (chicken feet) or even a Masonic cry. The inhabitants are confronted with other living 'symbols' inside the house: a bear (violence) and sheep (victims). The latter will be slaughtered in order to save the party members from starvation.The spell is broken when a party member can reconstruct the past, the beginning of the ordeal. They can turn the time back and leave their prison. Their liberation is celebrated with a 'Te Deum' mass. When they come out of the church, they see another spectacle: common people are shot down by their long arm, the police. The plebs is offering itself up to the existing powers like sheep, of which a long row enters the church in a holy procession. The opportunity of a power grab has been missed. The angel is still exterminating the underclasses.",

I could not find when he started using an hearing aid, but two documentaries mention the fact: 1- In \"El naufrago de la calle Providencia\" Carlos Savage the editor of \"The exterminating Angel\" quotes Bunuel as saying that \"high pitched voices\" made him suffer. 2- In \"A proposito de Bunuel\" a member of the crew says that Bunuel reduced the volume of his hearing aid in certain circumstances. Jean Claude Carriere mentions that Bunuel liked him \"because I had a voice he could understand\" without much effort. Such handicap probably created a frustration, perhaps even hatred towards music.In \"Exterminating Angel\" there are events that cause an \"evil spell\" : 1 \u0096 The presence of a Bear was certainly known to the servants and they escape, because they are afraid of what the bear might do\u0085 2 - Music and references to it play an important part, since :The guests came from the operaThe main singer is toasted to by the House Master at the beginning of the dinner., by her performance in \"Lamaermoor\" .

Maybe it is my imagination but I believe that Bunuel hated music and considered it an art of the Devil used to alienate humankind. And that is exactly what modern so-called \"pop\" music does. It intoxicates the senses and leads to irrational, immoral and sometimes even criminal behavior. When the film was made in 1962, that music was just appearing..",

The result is an indecipherable, unclassifiable but utterly mesmerising work which, following 'Viridiana' from the previous year, marks the beginning of Bunuel's Golden Age.It is never likely to appeal to the average Multiplex/Netflix viewer whose sole desire is to be distracted but for the discerning few it exerts an irrestistible fascination by virtue of its layers of meaning, what is says about the follies of humankind and not least its technical brilliance as a piece of film-making.According to the director himself 'the best explanation of this film is that, from the standpoint of pure reason, there is no explanation'. As critic Roger Ebert has astutely observed, Bunuel might just as well have said that 'from the standpoint of an explanation, there is no pure reason.'Most of the film takes place in the confined space of a salon and the way in which Senor Bunuel groups and moves his players is masterly. His cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa provides oodles of noirish gloom and the art direction of Jes\u00fas Bracho is especially impressive as the luxurious mansion slowly takes on the aspect of an abandoned dwelling.Comedy and menace go hand in glove here as the surface of civility is scratched to reveal the unpleasantness beneath. There is also an element of Schadenfreude in the undeniable thrill one feels when seeing the privileged suffer. No film of Bunuel's would be complete of course without a dig at Catholicism and here the guests, having escaped the trap of the salon, find themselves trapped by the Church.Critic Georges Sadoul has suggested that this marvellous film summarises Bunuel's life and work and indeed some of the images and episodes here put one in mind of his 'L'Age d'Or' made thirty-two years earlier. Having come full circle Bunuel talked of retiring but luckily for us this proved to be an idle threat.",

As days pass, their frustration regarding the situation & desperation due to dwindling supply removes all the veil they put up in the society.Written & directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, it's a film meant to confuse & confound, and the earliest indications are the repeated scenes that are deliberately added to the final print. It's an interesting concept that's wonderfully executed during the first half but overstays its welcome in the next as things become repetitive with no end in sight.Despite having so many characters in a single room, all the actors ably play their part, both individually as well as around others. Camerawork is excellent, and the greyscale photography gives it a timeless vibe. Also, there are dream sequences, flashes of symbolism & mystical subtext that may get more transparent on revisits.On an overall scale, The Exterminating Angel packs an intriguing premise and uses it effectively to show the savage instincts that all humans harbour but there are also elements in here that can be too perplexing and may go over the head of few, not to mention that the barren stewing of rich folks becomes tiring sooner than expected.

At least, that film featured Catherine Deneuve, which would be a definite plus for any movie. This one has no one I ever heard of before, but I will admit that these presumably Mexican actors, especially the women, did a very good job at the thankless task asked of them by their surrealist, ultra left wing director.It's as surreal as a Dali painting, and just as boring. Well, Dali is a little less boring, because you are wondering just what the hell he means. Bunuel leaves you in no doubt about his meaning. He hates anyone who isn't living in filthy squalor, and isn't as ignorant as your average scurrying beetle. Sure, a good many of the more economically advantaged people on the planet lead disgustingly meaningless lives, and are more-or-less sponging on the rest of us. Bunuel seems to think they are also leading lives of not-so-quiet desperation as well, and haven't sense enough to come in out of the rain, or at least out of a dining room where they haven't had too much fun. I admit there have been interesting stories told on themes like this, but Bunuel didn't do it for me in this film. It starts off interestingly enough, while we are wondering why all the servants of a large house are leaving, like rats scurrying off a sinking ship, just before the start of a big dinner party. Only the butler elects to stay. The interest quickly evaporates into boredom as we get repeated views of guests descending into lethargy when they find they can't bring themselves to leave the dining room, which gradually begins to resemble a pig sty.Now, I, personally, have a reputation as leaning strongly to the left, so my lack of appreciation of Bunuel doesn't stem from opposition to his political orientation. The people he portrays in EL ANGEL EXTERMINADOR may be parasites, but they are not the worst \"enemies of the people\". Those enemies are folks like those portrayed in BARBARIANS AT THE GATE, about the notorious corporate takeover of RJR Nabisco. THE HUCKSTERS shows another sort of up-scale scoundrel at work, and there are many other films that display the villainy and lack of any moral integrity of upper class types in a manner far more interesting and meaningful than folks of the ilk of Bunuel and Berthold Brecht ever did. When it comes to denouncing powerful, wealthy scoundrels, I prefer concrete, straight-from-the shoulder expositions, not fanciful allegories like this one.",

Bizarrely the party never ends, all of them, with the steward Julio (Brook) are incarcerated in the living room, whoever intends to get out of the room, will involuntarily alter his mind to stay, meanwhile for the people outside, the same mysteriously inexplicable force hedges them from entering too. Trapped in this claustrophobic space, the coexistence turns sour with time ruthless consuming the sustenance, the energy and the etiquette, simultaneously squabbles, vituperation, oneiric hallucinations, suicidal tendency and roughhousing all come to the fore (Bru\u00f1uel could go to extreme with cannibalism but he chose to refrain), the procedure of everyone takes off their facade and betrays their true self is excruciatingly riveting, the film could scale new heights as a superb probing essay on human nature if Bru\u00f1uel cared to exhume deeper to each character's meaty back-story (the fraternal hint, the flirtatious lady with terminal cancer, the undercurrent of adultery between the hostess and the Colonel, a votive trip to Lordes, the before/after reaction of taking the ulcer pills, not to mention the \"La Valkiria\" Leticia played by the first-billed Silvia Pinal, there are a slew of untold scandals are in need of elaboration). Instead the upshot is executed with a much murkier distinction, conspicuously they are all pawns in Bru\u00f1uel's storybook, it is rather an exacting task to distinguish all the different roles from a first-viewing, if only Robert Altman would do a remake, and expunge the political metaphor of the ending, then it would be transformed into a highly-watchable character analysis and an incisive farce with eye-dropping theatrical showpieces.Of course Bru\u00f1uel's mastery is omnipresent in the film, the superimposition shot of a clear sky upon a facial portrait, the outlandish amalgam of lambs and a baby bear, and the creative approach to offer a vent to let them out (a Paradisi's sonata is the turning point), until the climax, we all realize it is just a trial run, and the denouement is a dual indictment on undiscerning religious belief and the political status quo at then, pepped up with a palpable feeling of hopelessness. Also the slap to the bourgeois is loud and clear since the film's opening, it is the servants who are sentient of the pending uncanniness, and urge to leave the house as soon as possible, only the obtuse are being entrapped by the almighty trickster. Then what happens to the hoi polloi in the church? The purge is more generic or we should merely stop over-interpretation? Anyway who needs a concrete answer as long as Bru\u00f1uel is concerned.",

            "content": "Easy targets sometimes make for films that are hard to watch, if the effort is too easy, but make for great drama if things are balanced well. A few years back it was white trash, effete rich are served up in this film, even Greek gods were frequent targets back a few millennia.There was a line early on in this film, where one of the upper crusties says something to the effect that the poor don't even feel pain, like a bull when it is stabbed. These days such a line would cross another line, but like racism...while things have grown better over time, I think a lot of classist attitudes have gone covert, and still flourish till this day.Many people have cited the opening quote from this film: \"The best explanation of this film is that, from the standpoint of pure reason, there is no explanation.\" Which could be a good premise for a horror film (which this film oddly could be seen as), or more likely as a surrealist's credo. Thus the reality Bunuel observes already seems ridiculously unreasonable to him. How can it make sense to us, that gap between the super rich and the suffering poor? Might as well investigate it with Masonic rites, chicken claw Caballah, the lure of Lourdes, or some of that Roman Catholic jujitsu that makes the pope seem like a superhero in certain Latin latitudes.Hell, we're all going to be bald in two weeks anyways. And yes, the doctor was my favorite character.The film is still funny in some parts, the black and white cinematography to me gives it more a patina of age for appreciation and respect, whereas color might have made that fancy salon/prison even more rococo. The actors I thought were tremendous, for a film that feasts upon ludicrous lampooning, many of the characters could be sort of lost in the shuffle, but each of the ensemble really established a unique persona.I actually liked the horror penumbra early on when we are not exactly sure if there was more to this film than satire. It reminded me of the book \"House of Leaves\" (which I'll finish one day). There are little loops in the film, going up the stairs twice, and the repeated meetings of two of the early guests with varying results. I really liked those brain breakers, the first one makes you think was that a mistake, cheap editing? I wonder if anyone has made a version of this for the stage? Or even a radio drama? By the end of this film, I found myself wondering if an old Saturday Night Live sketch about people trapped on an escalator was engendered by a writer having gone to film school for a semester and having seen this film? Perhaps I, like the guests of the Nobile's, stayed too long? But in the end, the quote about needing fear to help us conquer anguish, kind of jarred me out of my surreal-saturated stupor. Was that Bunuel's goal, and is he saying that the human animal actually needs terror/patriarchy/dictatorships to help us look past our existential dread? It gave my mind one last twist, and made me twig on the ridiculous notion not so long ago proffered by some that Iraqi's needed someone like Saddam Hussein to \"lead\" them.The world is still surreal even though Bunuel has left the dinner party.",

Fifty years ago, famous Surrealist director Luis Bunuel pointed his acerbic finger at the upper class in this incredibly focused satire of the bourgeois. Such a story as this depends on the audience's ability to look past little details such as a lack of growing facial hair on the men stuck in the living room and accept everything Bunuel throws at us.It seems the most vicious attacks are saved for the Church, which Bunuel seems to view as having similar rules and restrictions as the bourgeois does but with the added promise of eternal salvation in the afterlife. The final sequence of this film is powerful in the way it showcases the bourgeois's almost complete indifference to the struggle and pain of others, even after they have suffered similar conditions. Perhaps the main reason for this film's lasting impact, and the beginning of a whole new career for Bunuel, is its completely unflinching look at what lies at the root of all human beings. In taking away their physical freedom and psychological dressings, Bunuel exposes these people for what he believes we really are: slightly more intelligent, but still animals in every other sense. Our inevitable decline into savagery, incivility and pure selfishness can only be exposed in the most extreme conditions. However, who is to say this isn't possible in some distant future?",

The plot is very simple: A group of wealthy luncheons can't seem to leave the room, even when there is nothing forcing them to stay, or holding them prisoner. It is as absurd as that. The brilliance of it all is in how the aloof selfish characters deal with the situation, and how they deal with each other in every political sense.

The \"action's\" limited to one location for most of the run time. They lie about. Maybe do some pacing. And talk, I don't remember about what. It's kinda like watching Sidney Lumet's films of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and The Iceman Cometh, just with the odd touch of the surreal occasionally sprinkled through-out.

Instead you have to think about it a lot, in order to understand the depth of this movie. The story is about a group of bourgeois in Mexico who are having a soir\u00e9e at the mansion of one of them, after an evening at the opera. The group of them is the representation of their class and of those who are willing to comfort them. When the film starts we are watching first the servants one after the other leaving the mansion, except the valet, who is staying to serve the guests. As the film is proceeding we are participating in the ethical overthrow of the bourgeois, while they are \"locked\" in one room of the mansion. The same time everybody else is \"locked\" outside the mansion, without being able to get into it. I mention \"locked\" even though there is not a single thing that block their way! The ethical overthrow of the bourgeois and the transformation into something inhuman is little by little established. In the beginning they are trying to act by the book. Their savoir vivre is guiding their manners, even though we can detect signs for their later behavior. When they see that they have to share the room with everybody else and they are not able to get out of it, then the problems begin... The only thing I have to add is that this movie is quite political and it's a comment about our way of life and how our mind is \"locking\" us.",

It's not entertaining. It wasn't and wasn't expected to be a success. Bunuel had to compromise on a lot of things and 'make-do'. He invented/discovered as he made it; a man creates.--------I guess it's a trade-off\u2014a lot of work on a long block of time making a singular thing instead of many things, many hits in the ether.

Like a lot of Woody Allen's last 25 films or so \u2014 purportedly showing this battle royal but bogged down by Howard Stern-like narcissism and self- importance. Can't get near a sub-conscious for fear of losing 'me'. Thus the fakers miss the real action and merely pose internal antipathies which wind up right-wing status quo.----\u2014 Back to the universal knowledge \u2014 creatives must override their personal agendas to transcend.

Movie, surrealistic (what a word!) and with this Spanish film director I mark our future goal.I prefer to accept the story as theoretical setting, presenting the bubble of happiness of the rich class in society - the so-called \"elite\" who never gave up their status and would not admit it to someone lower. Which has amazing, but genteel, tact, dialogue and decency. Elite, whose enemy is his own members.Placed under force majeure circumstances, its representatives are ready to strip the clothing of pretence and show their essence. Before they reach the lowest point in their moral degradation they will go through disregard of age limits or gender differences, violation of art, arrogance, egoism and savagery. Instead of looking for a way to save themselves (understand the world), they stare at each other (like different countries), seeing enemies into each other and are ready to kill each other. In this headlong fall, they quickly recall despicable habits that would attribute to ordinary people's daily needs - they are enjoying the water like champagne. They are able to even eat paper (which I never thought about) indicated by the servant in the film. And what else can be shown in the removing of their elegant shell when they are bored with life, feel inner hate for him, show coldness of empty man, are lost in fashions (e.g. shaving men's legs) and hate the so-called refinement.In such a society salvation find only the dead, lovers, scientists, those who take opium. Outside this society one can be lonely beast, or being an innocent lamb, he immediately would be harnessed to the needs of the elite. This whole farce would not end if eventually they have not reach their greatest meanness, only then the memory of its former heights would rise and to make way for the opportunity to sort out the real worth of the human existence.Perhaps the question why we see this happening is irrelevant.

Throughout the film Bunuel makes it clear that no matter the layers of formalities, it takes nothing more than a little captivity for otherwise civilized people to abandon their pretenses and revert to their original and authentic form.A must-see.",

Although produced in Mexico, the jab is presumably meant mainly at Franco's Spain, at a time when the film could not have possibly been shot there. The film is usually referred to as surrealist; absurdist might be more accurate, although Bu\u00f1uel's iconography, from sheep roaming through palatial corridors to a disembodied hand later plagiarized, consciously or not, by the Addams Family, is unmistakable. Typically for Bu\u00f1uel, the sometimes farcical tone doesn't diminish the suggestive power, pulling oneiric to punch political.",

            "content": "THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL is a surrealist drama about a high class as social parasites, which are gathered in one place.After a visit to an opera, a group of fashionable people from high society has gathered at a party in a villa of a respected gentleman and his wife. However, their servants unaccountably leave their posts. The guests enjoy a luxurious and somewhat strange party. They notice, after dinner, that's all the servants gone, and that they can not get out of a music salon, even though all the doors and windows are open. The guests consume what little drinks and food are left from the previous night's party. Days pass, and their situation is complicated. They become hungry, thirsty, sick and hysterical...Mr. Bu\u00f1uel has offered a strange display of human degradation, which has brought depression and hostility in a civil conflict. He has, through a surreal approach, manipulated with the characters, pulling out all the best and worst characteristics from them. An isolation is a mystery in this film. However, an isolation is a form of decision in the real world.Mr. Bu\u00f1uel has showed us one of the characters of a privileged society, which is symbolically lost in its sole discretion. The story is a quite nervous and depressed, the pace is engrossing and transitions are explosive.Director's focus is on his people and situations in the society to which he belongs. This exceeds a surreal character and satire in this film.The acting is very good. I would mention Silvia Pinal (Leticia), as the voice of reason and realization.This is an unusual and frustrating game, which examines the patient with the audience.",

            "content": "I seldom watch movies that are built on nothing and yet transmit as many ideas as Luis Bu\u00f1uel's The Exterminating Angel. When one stops to reflect how this movie is built, one realises it's just a group of people trapped inside a living room; and yet it holds the viewer in thrall until the end.An upper class couple invite their friends for a pleasant dinner. For some reason, the maids and servants feel compelled to leave the house. Their behavior is incomprehensible. The guests have to make do with one faithful servant. But as the night goes on no one seems disposed to leave. As rude as it may be, they sleep over. Then in the morning everyone realises something chilling: try as they might, no one has the willpower to leave the room.That's the fantastic premise that allows Bu\u00f1uel to make an indictment on the behavior of the upper class. Little by little these shallow people become vicious, debased and murderous. Bu\u00f1uel almost sounds childish in his obsession with making fun of these people, in showing how they're no better than anyone else. In lesser hands such an obvious point would be embarrassing to put up with. But he pulls it off with a lot of black humor and technical skill, making the movie enjoyable in itself.",

            "content": "Bunuel's 1962 film revolves (almost literally) around a group of middle-class people at a dinner party. This theme would be explored further in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie but works better in his earlier piece. The premise of the film is playfully simple. The guests of Nobille are trapped in a room at the end of the evening unwilling or unable to leave. That's it. Until the third reel of the film when the epilogue gives us another context in which to view the previous 80 minutes worth of action.The characters are placed within this Kafkaesque narrative, seemingly of their own accord at first. There is no barrier to the next room yet no one can pass its borders. There is no science-fiction at play here, more an existential angst keeping them from what lies beyond. Some of the players half-heartedly try and make their escape but some give-up without trying or stall at the last, crying, unable to move further. Their predicament is not one of comfort either, there is death, starvation and thirst within the group and their ordeal goes on for weeks. Occasionally Bunuel brings the audience out of the room and we see people on the outside staring at the house with as much perplexity as those trapped inside. A rescue attempt is made but again, no one really tries to just walk in, open the doors and let the poor wretches out.What are we to make of the situation. Obviously there is a metaphor that Bunuel wants us to read. Is it a simple case of the middle classes being trapped within their own understanding of the world, with the desire to understand other kinds of people merely an act of lip-service to their supposed ideals? Is it a comment on the Spanish Civil War whereby those on the streets were forced to fight as the middle classes ate their lamb? The ending reveals more than I will say but I think this is Bunuel's best film of those I've seen and it is a crisp, timeless watch which asks more questions than it answers.",

The premise is ludicrously simple: a group of dinner guests enter a living room after a party, which they can't leave for some inexplicable reason. The movie does a great job of grabbing your attention right away with a few repeated scenes or bits of dialogue that at first appear to be editing mistakes, and by suddenly cutting to a live bear and three lambs with very little explanation. After the guests become trapped, you quickly pick out who the leading characters in the group are; I can't remember their names, but I could easily describe the personality of each with a picture. That's not an easy thing to do with only 1.5 hours and 18 guests. The plot and pacing are nicely done, and although the film does feel slow or repetitive in certain moments, it never completely lost me. The theme of the movie (the hidden savagery of the bourgeois) is done so well and mirrored so exactly in that plot that anyone could pick it up, and the final tie-in to the church is a nice touch. The sound quality wasn't great, but I think that's more from budgetary constraints; I would have liked a score or music of some kind all the same. Overall, an interesting premise, well-executed, that left me wanting to see more from the director.",

The story is simple: some dinner guests strangely find themselves unable to leave the house where they have eaten.Rather than indulge in outlandish visuals to create an effect as Bu\u00f1uel frequently did, this film conveys its surrealistic magic chiefly through dialogue. Many Bu\u00f1uel films are chock full of words, and \"Angel\" is no exception. What happens is one realizes the dialogue is off-kilter. It is mostly totally incoherent. After about an hour of reading the movie's subtitles, the effect feels almost drug-induced. The resolution is what one might expect from such a film, but it's Bu\u00f1uel's beefy execution of his M.O. that makes this a treat. How do the actors deliver such lines with so much conviction? \"The Exterminating Angel\" is brilliant.",
