            "content": "Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed. There's no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, \"In Cold Blood\" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads. It's the stuff of nightmares. But this is no dream. The events really happened, in 1959.Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist. Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! It makes for a memorable, and haunting, film.Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real-life killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth-talking con artist with an all-American smile.After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico. Things go awry there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place. But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart.Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, \"In Cold Blood\" stages in riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later. It's that setting that does it. Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night?",

            "review_title": "Extremely disturbing, even now",
            "content": "Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true-crime films are matched.  Veteran writer/director Richard Brooks (ELMER GANTRY) adapted Truman Capote's non-fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty-five years later.Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two ex-cons who, on a tip from Hicock's old cellmate Floyd Wells, broke into the Holcomb, Kansas home of Herbert Clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000.  But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr. Clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars.  Two months on the run, including an aimless \"vacation\" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car.  But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb.  Tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five-year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14, 1965.Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught.  John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does Gerald S. O'Laughlin as his assistant.  In a tactic that is both faithful to Capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around, Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies.  Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night.  We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to.  The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher-film violence.Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black-and-white, and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall's expertise.  The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper.  The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low-key fashion.  It is a 134-minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the 'R' rating is there for a reason.",

            "review_title": "Fantastic, Disturbing film",
            "content": "Remarkable, disturbing film about the true-life, senseless, brutal murder of a small-town family, along with the aftermath, and examination of the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith.No matter how much time goes by, or how dated this film may look, it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this.This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent farm family in small-town Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith.An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature, scared, petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone. But, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along a road of \"proving\" something to each other. That they were man enough to do it, to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big \"score\"; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led. These were two grown-up children, who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters.The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family, but the point is made. These were respected, law-abiding, small-town people, who didn't deserve this terrifying fate. The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path. Hickok, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with.An interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve. Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these? Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit, operating under the radar, believing they fool everyone they come into contact with? To be deterred, you must believe it's possible you will be caught. Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught?; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes, and got away with them? This was supposed to be a \"cinch\", \"no witnesses\".When caught, Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks. Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in. Hickok blinked first. A silly game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men.Fascinating psychological thriller, telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history. Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their careers.",

            "review_title": "A worthy adaptation of one of the landmark novels of the 20th century",
            "content": "An exquisite adaptation of one of the landmark novels of American literature, In Cold Blood tells the tale of two men who murdered a Kansas farm family in the late 1950s. It's a tremendous film, not just because of the excellent acting, beautiful direction and intelligent writing it showcases, but because it succeeds in showing us that no matter how extraordinary evil may seem, it is the very ordinariness of evil that is most compelling.Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) were two-bit criminals looking for the perfect score. They thought it would be robbing the Clutters (John McLiam, Ruth Storey, Brenda Currin and Paul Hough) of the $10,000 dollars a cellmate of Dick's had told him Mr. Clutter kept in their farm house. There never was any $10,000, though. Just 40 bucks, a radio, a pair of binoculars\u0085and 4 brutal murders. As Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe) of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation takes on the case, Perry and Dick flee to Mexico, only to run out of money and have to crawl back to the United States. As the two men responsible for one of the most sensational crimes of its time desperately scrabble along, Dewey and the forces of the Law inch closer and closer.Perry and Dick are eventually captured in Las Vegas, confess and are shipped back to Kansas for a trial that ends with a jury taking only 40 minutes to sentence them to death. It takes 5 years on death row for their appeals to be exhausted, 5 years of waiting before Perry and Dick have their date with the hangman's noose and executions even more cold blooded than the slayings of the Clutter family.What first attracted Truman Capote to this story must have been the idea of American innocence shattered by savagery. What he ended up writing was something that forced us to confront the humanity in the men who committed such inhuman acts. This motion picture by Richard Brooks follows that same path. Perry Smith and Dick Hickock aren't monsters. They aren't even exceptionally bad men. They're both battered dreamers who were born into life's ditch and never managed to crawl out of it. Yet this film makes no excuses for Perry and Dick as they never made any for themselves. As they drive 400 miles to the Clutter farm, there's no attempt to deny the chilling self-centeredness of our two soon-to-be killers and their disregard for everything but their own wants and needs. That's what most evil is in this world. It isn't a compulsion to hurt others. It's simply not caring who you have to hurt to get what you want.The performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are superb. Blake has the showier role as Capote was drawn to the inner turmoil of Perry Smith and the paradox of such a seemingly bright soul driven to such dark deeds. Blake brings out the deep well of emotion in Smith, depths that allowed him to revel in childish fantasies of buried treasure and gave him the strength of will to obliterate an entire family. Wilson, though, is just as good in capturing the shallow, shark-like quality of Hickock. He lets you see that it's Dick's lack of emotional depth that makes him both more functional than Perry in normal society and weaker than Perry in moments of crisis. If Perry feels the world too intensely, Dick lives in a state of denial so profound it couldn't be cracked with an atom bomb.Shot in black-and-white, In Cold Blood has some of the most stunning images you'll see. Even after decades of increasingly stark and graphic violence in popular culture, there are still moments in this movie that will grab your heart and squeeze. And a scene with Perry looking out a window on death row, the rain outside reflected onto his face like tears, is absolutely beautiful.If you haven't read In Cold Blood, watching this movie will make you want to read it. If you've already read the book, watching this film will make you want to read it again. That's about the highest praise you can give this sort of work and I give it without hesitation.",

            "review_title": "Meticulous Celluloid Version Of Truman Capote's Book",
            "content": "Many films are derived from novels and, in the normal way, it is unhelpful to compare the movie with the book, for the obvious reason that they are distinct art-forms, constrained by different technical limitations. However, this one really does have to be understood in the context of the book which engendered it.Capote's book is a factual account of a multiple murder in a small Kansas town.  Two young drifters plan a robbery which misfires and ends in violence.  The book traces the course of the patient investigation which eventually brings the killers to justice.  Because the book is  a species of journalism, uncompromisingly anchored in fact, the film cannot help but follow suit, with the added burden that it must faithfully represent on the screen real persons, places and events.The mean lives of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith are documented in stark monochrome.  Panavision is used to powerful effect to show the wide, flat spaces of Kansas.  Quincy Jones's atmospheric jazz score adds salt to the bleak images.  The austerity of blue collar life in the Mid West of the 1950's is splendidly evoked as our two delinquents move through a rolling montage of Travelodges and diners, launderettes and interstates.This is a film of straight lines.  The flat, relentless landscape of Kansas generates horizons that are ruler-straight.  Roads stretch into the distance without the hint of a curve.  Slat blinds cast harsh bars of light across room interiors.  The penitentiary scene is a symphony of geometric lines.  Hickock and Smith have had their characters forged by incarceration, and we see that their 'outside' lives are, in a real sense, another form of imprisonment.  The lines which enclose them denote the hopelessness of their existence.The starkness is reinforced by neat, economical editing.  The throwing of a light switch in the Hickock farmhouse carries us to the Clutter home, where a light is being turned on, and the words 'any crowded street' whisk us into just such a street. A cigarette butt is discarded, and its ugly cylinder becomes an electromagnet searching for the murder weapon.  The Clutters' cleaner realises that a radio has been stolen, and we see the radio playing at Dick's bedside.Once under arrest, Dick makes a powerful speech about tattoos. The detectives are trying to provoke him by sneering at his 'body art' and he points out that we all carry tattoos of some kind.  Our dress, speech and attitudes mark us indelibly and fix us in our time and place.Herb Clutter and his family lead a spartan home life.  The farmhouse is spare and unadorned, but its order and solidity make a sharp contrast with the chaos and squalor of the rented rooms where Dick and Perry hole up. Dick 'hangs paper' (passes dud cheques) in respectable Kansas stores, amassing clothes and electrical goods on a spree which exploits the trust between vendor and consumer and uses it as a weapon - Dick and Perry's revenge upon 'decent' America.Once the arrests have been made and a trial scheduled, the film switches to a voice-over narration.  No doubt this was done  in order to shorten the custody passage (this is extensive in the book, but does not lend itself readily to film treatment), but it jars.  Up to this point, Hickock and Smith have told their story through action.  Narration is second-best.However, the film is a highly-reliable rendition of the book, and contains some impressive touches.  Mail bags come somersaulting from the hurtling express-train like so much tumbleweed.  The rapid crossfire of the detectives' press conference conveys a lot of important information to the viewer in an economical way.  A detective talks us through a psychological profile of the as yet unknown killers, and it is very persuasive.  While our two heroes are lying low in Mexico, a beautiful mariachi song accompanies a bedroom scene, the music evoking a sense of loss and regret, and leading naturally to Perry's flashback memories of his mother's degradation.To ask if the film is as good as the book is meaningless, but it is certainly a highly-commendable reworking of the book in visual terms.  The interplay between the two delinquents is first-class, the easy charm of Dick giving way at critical moments to naked fear of the inscrutable dreamer Perry.",

            "review_title": "Haunting True Crime Tale",
            "content": "In the year 2006, \"In Cold Blood\"-a riveting thriller from 1967-has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have. First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, \"Capote\" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience.As a stand alone film from it's era, \"In Cold Blood\" is top notch in every way. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" fame). Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events). It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen.The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo. The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last \"confession\" so to speak. It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears.The only thing hampering \"In Cold Blood\" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end. The tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey.",

Based on Truman Capote's biographical novel, this is the story of a couple of lost souls who arrive at a home, hoping to rob it, find the family home, and kill everyone. They get in too deep and can't leave any witnesses. It doesn't take long to capture them and the bulk of the movie involves what it's like as they await their executions. There is nothing sugar coated about this. They await hanging for a deplorable crime. What is interesting is that we see these men as human beings. They are not victims, but they have had checkered lives and have not figured out how to live properly.

One of the cable channels was screening \"In Cold Blood.\"  I watched the opening sequence. Despite the beautiful weather, and the girlfriend nagging at me to get up off the couch and go outside, I knew I wouldn't leave the room until the movie was over. I can't add much to the fine reviews by others, particularly the review by the gentleman from London, except to add that the dialogue in the movie is marvelous.  The writer and director caught the laconic, spare speech of the Midwest.  The questions and answers between the characters are perfect. (Paul Stewart, the reporter:  \"Don't the people in this town lock their doors?\"  John Forsythe, the detective:  \"They will tonight.\")  And the way Perry and Dick look at each other menacingly in critical situations gives one the chills.  (Dick:  \"Don't worry baby; we left no living witnesses.\" Perry, staring at Dick:  \"I know one.\") Of all the great performances in the film, my favorite is John Forsythe as the KBI detective who grows weary from contemplating the evil minds behind the murders of his Kansas neighbors, the Clutters.  A close second among the great performances is Scott Wilson, who makes Dick a charming loser going nowhere in life, unable and unwilling to civilize himself to live in society.Certainly this is one of the ten best movies ever made, and the best of all the \"True Crime\" movies.

            "content": "The Coen brothers made a couple of films about crimes starting small and getting out of hand very quickly. Perhaps the best example is \"Fargo\" (1996).\"In cold blood\" is different. From the very beginning two men are planning a cruel robbery and they intend to let no witnesses behind.That the loot of all the violence amounts to a meager 43 dollars certainly gives a cynical touch to the story but the full amount of senselessness is expressed in the way the story is told. Using a technique from the horror genre which boils down to the principle that suggesting is often more effective than showing (see for example \"Cat people\", 1942, Jacques Tourneur), very little of the actual robbery is shown. Instead in the first half of the movie we see the criminals travelling to the place of the crime, doing perfectly normal things as drinking coffee in a diner but also bying a rope to tie down their victims. These scenes are alternated with images of the Clutter family (the victims) perfectly unaware of the danger that is (literally) approaching.The black and white cinematography of Conrad Hall is breathtaking and the jazzy score of Quincy Jones is catching. And then the criminals have arrived at the Clutters home.The headlights of the car go out.The music stops.And all we hear is the wind howling round the farm.The second part of the film seems to be a plea against capital punishment. To be honest the first part of the film had made such an overwhelming impression on me that I was unabe to feel any compassion with the perpetrators. This is not to say that the second part of the movie does not have strong moments. Brilliant (and very well known) is the scene in which one of the perpetrators (Perry played by Robert Blake) is telling the story of his life. It looks as though he is crying, but in reality there are raindrops flowing on the window.\"In cold blood\" is based on the non fiction novel of the same name by Truman Capote. The film manages to maintain some sort of documentary look and feel. This is done by filming on the location of the real Clutters farm but above all by not casting prominent stars in the lead roles.",

            "review_title": "A Realistic Account Of A Heinous Crime",
            "content": "When the unexplained brutal murders of a family of four came to the attention of Truman Capote in 1959, he immediately decided that he would write a book on the subject and the result was \"In Cold Blood\" which became an international bestseller and won him a considerable amount of acclaim from the literary critics of the time, who referred to it as a \"non-fiction novel\" and a masterpiece. The murders were committed in the small community of Holcomb, Kansas at 2.00 am on 15 November 1959 and after years of detailed research; Capote's book was published in 1966. Almost inevitably, a movie adaptation followed in 1967 with Richard Brooks directing, producing and writing the screenplay.When a couple of prisoners, who'd been released on parole, meet up in Kansas City, Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) tells Perry Smith (Robert Blake) about a robbery that they could carry out which would be a \"cinch\". Using some information that he'd gained from a prison inmate who'd been employed some years earlier by a farmer called Herb Clutter (John McLiam), he tells Perry that they could easily steal the contents of the man's safe which should contain about $10,000 in cash. Scott had intentionally picked Perry to be his accomplice because his short fuse and propensity for violence would be perfect in a situation where they needed to ensure that they'd leave no witnesses behind after committing their crime.After making the long road journey to Holcomb, the two men enter the Clutter family's home and on discovering that there's no safe or large sum of money present, ruthlessly slaughter the innocent family and leave with only $43, a portable radio and a pair of binoculars, before fleeing to Mexico where Perry wants to go hunting for Cortes' buried treasure. When this endeavour proves to be a waste of time, Dick decides that they should head back to the States and make their way to Las Vegas. This proves to be a serious mistake because, by this time, Dick's prison buddy had turned informant and then later, Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead investigator Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe) easily traces their progress by following the trail of bad cheques that they leave in their wake.The two fugitives are then soon arrested, interrogated and tried for the four murders that they'd committed.Wherever possible, Richard Brooks filmed the action in the actual locations where the original events had taken place and featured some of the Clutter family's neighbours, jury members from the murder trial and the hangman who'd executed Smith and Hickock, in some of the movie's minor roles. This type of realism and the documentary-style presentation serve the material really well and ensure that the right tone is maintained perfectly throughout the whole movie. It's also commendable that Brooks avoids any form of sensationalism, any glamorisation of the two murderers or any attempts to rationalise their senseless actions. Conrad Hall's cinematography also complements Brooks' work magnificently and strongly emphasises the chilling, bleak and highly disturbing nature of the story as it unfolds.Predictably, the movie's most notable performances come from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson who both make a huge impression. Blake looks troubled as the asprin-addicted son of a violent father and an adulterous mother and lives with constant pain as a consequence of a motorcycle accident. Wilson is also excellent as the swaggering, manipulative Hickock who exploits Perry Smith's gullibility for his own ends and displays some talent as a con-man.\"In Cold Blood\" is an immensely powerful and gripping tale that is particularly thought-provoking and unsettling because of the fact that it's based on a real-life case.",

Nonetheless, Richard Brooks's 1967 adaptation of the original novel still bears watching. Robert Blake and the recently deceased Scott Wilson - nowadays recognizable from \"The Walking Dead\" - depict Perry Smith and Dick Hickock as a pair of men who feel like they have no other hope in the world, so they pull off their infamous crime.The characters say and do things that must've been shocking for viewers at the time. Without a doubt, this was one of the movies that helped bring down the Hays Code. And that's just one of the reasons why it remains a classic.

            "content": "This was a brilliantly made movie, all the more compelling because the story is true. The choice of black and white filming adds to the stark horror of the Clutter nightmare, as well as the sordid, senseless lives of the story's killers, viscerally portrayed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. Together, as narration near the end of the film details, they form a single inexorable killing machine, each a manic complement to the other in executing a grisly and horrific crime.In an odd but self revealing moment, Perry Smith (Blake) reveals much of what he knows about himself when he confronts partner Dick Hickock (Wilson) about to rape the Clutter daughter - \"I despise people who can't control themselves\". Repeated flashbacks of Perry's dysfunctional family life reinforce his self loathing before he spins out of control to take out the Clutter's.It wasn't till after the film was over and I had a chance to think about it did the detective line of inquiry make itself clear. Each partner was confronted with the knowledge that they had left a living witness to their crime. The portrayal of the murders reinforces the viewer's knowing that everyone in the Clutter household was killed. The cleverness of the ruse lay in it's simple truth - each killer was a living witness to the other's atrocity.Amid the tension and grim reality of the actual event, I did get a kick out of the scene where Robert Blake's character hits pay dirt with the young hitchhiker when they find a garbage can filled with deposit bottles, he called it the 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. That was a nifty reference to a boyhood role of Blake's in that 1948 film; in it he sold a winning lottery ticket to Humphrey Bogart.The film's use of a non linear story telling technique only adds to it's intrigue and suspense. In it's way it forces the viewer to pay stricter attention than one ordinarily might, and has a way of effectively reaching inside the minds of it's principals, particularly Perry Smith. There's a line spoken by Hickock that speaks volumes about their characters, and in it's way may have sparked the title of one of the more controversial films of the Nineties. In conversation with Perry, he follows up his 'perfect score' comments with an observation of his partner's murderous resolve - \"I got you figured for a natural born killer...\".",

            "content": "IN COLD BLOOD has to be ranked as first-rate movie-making, even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make-believe, but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work, based as it is on a true-life crime spree.It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end. The B&W photography of Conrad Hall does a superb job right from the start.Also clear from the start: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are natural born actors. They do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill. \"Ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair? Hell no. There are two kinds of rules in this world. One for the rich and one for the poor,\" says Wilson, taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel.Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family, showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind.Blake, reminiscing about movies, and thinking of hunting for gold in Mexico, says: \"Remember Bogart in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'?\" (An ironic moment, because Blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets). \"I got you pegged for a natural born killer,\" Wilson tells Blake.JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the lead detectives on the case, discovering that all four family members were tied up, shot in the head and one had his throat cut. \"Don't people around here lock doors?\" asks PAUL STEWART. \"They will tonight,\" is the terse reply.After the murders, the killers discover that there was \"no big fat safe in the wall\", like their prison informant told them. So, in the end, it was truly a stupid, senseless crime. The question is: WHY did they do it? And this is something the second half of the film explores in depth. It takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation.It's these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they've made numerous mistakes and left a living witness. The actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end. \"It makes no sense,\" Blake tells Forsythe. \"Mr. Cutter was a very nice gentleman. I thought so right up until the time I cut his throat.\" The screenplay by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point--and so is his direction.Summing up: Brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere $43.

            "content": "The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories (Gein, Bundy, Dahmer), or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood (OJ, Manson). The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively) met by some luck, conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in Kansas, and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars. Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either. They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance (a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change), and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead. The story ended in 1965.But it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous (the late/great) DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama (save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect). The air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the \"third\" man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by Smith and Hickcock teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story. You feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B-movie. These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through.It's also an excellent 'road-movie' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence (the actual night-time scene of the crime taking place late in the film), then on to Mexico, then back to America towards Las Vegas. We get to soak in the personalities of these two, probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate. It's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two (sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick's Badlands characters), and it's also a sign of daring for the period. There's no sermonizing, like \"he did this because of that and this or the other.\" We see how Smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that Smith loved and hated him. The complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for Capote's book (which, I should confess, I've still yet to read, though I plan to). And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence (i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks), but without any deep-rooted explanation to it all.The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s, and it's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top-of-the-pops performance (this and Lost Highway, oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years, his quintessential pieces of work), and Wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor. While they're surrounded by fine supporting work, they themselves are eerily absorbing, driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure, and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends. Is this a morale of the story, if there could be one, that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified, of good vs evil getting smudged? Smith apologized for his crime before being hung, and he points out, \"but to who?\" This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true-crime the bonafide chills, and it's quite possibly the best American film of 1967.",

            "content": "I finished reading Truman Capote's novel \"In Cold Blood\" just a few weeks ago, and was completely blown away by it; it was one of the most exquisitely eloquent pieces of writing I've ever read, and a real emotional kick in the guts, all the more so because it's non-fiction. The story of the Clutter family murders (at the hands of two ex- convicts, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock) in 1959 has become reasonably well- known in recent years, thanks to two unrelated but basically identical Hollywood features dealing with Capote's experiences in writing the novel \u2013 'Capote (2005)' and 'Infamous (2006).' The first film to depict the crime, however, was Richard Brooks' 'In Cold Blood (1967),' which sticks rigidly close to the source material and is all the better for it.Conrad Hall's stark, oppressive black-and-white cinematography forcefully pounds the documentary-like authenticity of the film, which, even so, is occasionally punctured by surreal flashbacks and fantasies that offer in a window into the killers' states of mind. The transitions in these moments are occasionally clunky, but one scene pulls off the tone-shift brilliantly: Perry, reluctantly, is watching Dick make love to a woman, and suddenly sees his mother on the bed, cheating on his father with a stranger. Capote's novel was to some extent sympathetic towards Perry Smith, whose personality was sculpted by years of physical neglect and emotional abuse. This was, I think, a necessary part of telling the story; the Clutter murders were so unexpected, so random, that the killers' motivations needed exploring. Brooks' film, while keeping the crime investigators and Holcomb townsfolk in relative anonymity, is at its most blisteringly intense when Perry and Dick are on screen, and the performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson (dead- ringers for their real-life counterparts) are perfectly and painfully nuanced.In some ways, Capote's richly-detailed brand of journalism works slightly better in print than on screen (and, indeed, Paul Stewart's reporter character is introduced in the final act purely as a cipher for the author's brilliant prose). Brooks' adaptation perfectly captured the motivation and mindset of the central murderers, but there were other facets of Capote's novel that I would have loved to have seen included (in another movie, perhaps). In the novel, the town of Holcomb was a character in itself, and, in the months following the Clutter murder, was buzzing with suspicion, insecurity, and hollowness. The novel's most powerful moment was its ending: on one bright afternoon in 1964, Alvin Dewey comes upon Nancy's best friend, Susan, paying her respects to the Clutter family. Now a beautiful young woman, Susan attends college and courts boys. She departs the cemetery, still bearing emotional scars but looking towards the future. It's one of the most affirming passages I've ever read. Brooks' film denies us any such closure.The late 1960s was a real turning point in the cinema history: films like 'Bonnie and Clyde (1967)' and 'The Wild Bunch (1969)' bloodily cast aside Hollywood's formerly conservative ways, and here Brooks sits somewhere in the middle. Despite the film's rigid pursuit of realism, the images themselves aren't particularly violent; it's what's implied that is emotionally harrowing. The monochrome photography makes the film less viscerally confronting than, say, Powell's 'Peeping Tom (1960),' but nevertheless suggests a clinical coldness that is equally disconcerting. The home-invasion on November 15, 1959 (cunningly withheld until the film's second half) is one of the most intense sequences I've ever seen in a film, and feels so voyeuristic that I could scarcely watch. Like the novel, this is something approaching a masterpiece.",

            "content": "As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement. As in a few other comments that I have written, the bizarre results of Academy Award voting are often difficult to explain. The omission of \"In Cold Blood\" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable \"Dr. Dolittle.\" While only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that Rex Harrison disaster, Richard Brook's powerful adaptation of Truman Capotes non-fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out. While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material. Based on a Nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, \"In Cold Blood\" was filmed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio. Together with Quincy Jones's unsettling score, Hall's work should have been credited above the title with Brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built. The performances are fine as well. Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers. (There is an inside joke at one point when Blake speaks of Bogart and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" while the duo are driving to Mexico. As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film.) The film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti-capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult-to-watch final scenes. Some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the Clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one-dimensional characters of little import. This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row. The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth. However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, \"In Cold Blood\" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts. Run a double bill with \"Dead Man Walking,\" and you may not speak for days.",

            "content": "My feeling toward \"In Cold Blood\" echoes Vito Corleone's opening statement of the Five Families' meeting: \"How did things ever get so far? It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.\" Indeed, what can be more deplorable than four lives bought at such a cheap price as forty dollars? Six, if you dare to count the killers.Richard Brooks' \"In Cold Blood\" chronicles with a documentary-like precision the whole chain of events that lead to the infamous Clutter Massacre in November 1959. Two ex-convicts, Dick Hicock and Perry Smith, a charming con-man and a tortured Korean-War veteran, broke into the farm of a respectable God-fearing Kansas family and killed father, mother, daughter and son in the titular way, without any other motive than stealing ten thousands dollars hidden in a safe, some tip from Hicock's former cell-mate, as wrong as tragic. It sealed the Clutters' fate as the two young killers insisted on leaving no witness.The narrative strikes for its realistic depiction of all the unfortunate circumstances that made this crime possible. Not to diminish Brooks' merit but most the credit goes to the author of the original story of the same title, Truman Capote. Driven by what could be seen as morbid fascination, Capote approached in an unorthodox yet modern way a seemingly fait-divers story. And for reasons, although we see the two bodies swinging under a tight rope at the end, are we really that satisfied that Justice was done? Society takes its revenge but what a thin consolation after such a waste of lives, including the killers.Let's focus on the killers because that's where the intellectual challenge lies, and because the story primarily deals with them. There's no way to feel any sympathy for their actions, but the film intelligently allows us to channel our sentiments toward a more magnanimous perception. At one point, the journalist, who should've been identified as Capote (one of the film's minor flaws) makes the following diagnosis: the two men could never kill anyone, but together they formed a third personality capable to commit the irreparable. It shows that the two men could never kill alone. Hicock's eagerness to kill has the resonance of desperation and he later explains to the police officer (John Forsythe) that he counted on Smith to be the real 'trigger', since he already killed a man, but then Smith reveals that he never killed 'that guy in Vegas'. Some natural born killers! When they use a stolen checkbook, Hicock uses his charms and smooth talk for more benign crime while Smith seems to drown his soul into a constant depressed state. What a waste indeed, Hicock would've made one hell of a salesman, Smith, a tormented artist, but they lost their soul somewhere and had to vent their anger on the furthest thing to their existence: an ordinary, happy family. That poignant contrast is simply a waste making up for another waste. That's how it works and the way it fails. Interestingly, the film is from 1967, the year saw the release of the groundbreaking \"Bonnie and Clyde\", one of the New Hollywood landmarks that paved the way to a less Manichean approach to outlaws and more realistic take on violence. Yet Brooks wasn't a newcomer in Hollywood and his portrayal of violence is less explicit than in Penn's masterpiece. However, there's something extremely fresh in the shocking realism he uses, transcended by a haunting black-and-white photography, from no one less than Conrad Hall. And I don't think any scene shook me more in my life than the killing of the Clutter Family.The murder sequence is kept till the end to leave us time to analyze the killers before the killing and be in the opposite situation than the jurors. We're not there to play society role, but to understand what kind of mess and waste can lead to another. After the murder, the film's pace is faster as to show how fast things go. I was surprised that the film was listed in AFI's Top 10 Courtroom Dramas although the trial doesn't last longer than 10 minutes. The conclusion on the Death Row leaves us contemplating a system, whose own actors assess the uselessness. They're all disillusioned yet no one would deny that Justice must be done, not even the killers. Hicock respects the idea of revenge since that's what he tried to do all his life.There's no message, no preaching in \"In Cold Blood\", simply an invitation to understand why tragedies have and will always happen. And for its meticulous attention to detail, the film was shot in the same Clutter house and the actors Perry Blake and Scott Wilson bear uncanny resemblance with the actual killers, \"In Cold Blood\" is a cold and bold take on banal horror with strong sociological resonance. It's also one of the best pictures of the year, one that should've been nominated instead of the anachronistic \"Dr. Doolittle\". One criticism though, I'm less impressed now by what amazed me at the first viewing: the jazzy Quincy Jones score and the use of 'clever' transition cut, as they betrayed a too artsy approach to a rather austere subject.Ironically, the greatest looking shot of the film wasn't expected and worked as a tribute to the genius of Conrad Hall. The final monologue of Perry Smith relating his last happy memory as a prospector in Alaska with his father, with reflection of rain forming tears in his face is the epitaph of these souls who've lost the sparkle of humanity as a reaction to the hell they went through, and a premonition to the destiny of Robert Blake. Blake constantly refers to Bogart in \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\" a movie where he starred, as if his reality served the fiction. How ironic that the fiction would serve his reality, as if he was doomed to carry a shadow of truth in all the roles he played.",

The editing, lighting, and photography are all handled terrificly, with standout moments such as when Perry throws something off a bridge and there is a cut to the impact of a crane dropping a magnet into a river. But the greatest shot of all comes during Perry's final monologue, with rain running down a window which projects the illusion of tears on Perry's face as he looks out and speaks about his estranged relationship with his father.",

            "content": "True story of the mass murder of a family in Holcomb, Kansas, killed in their home late one night by a pair of two-bit hoods looking for a non-existent safe, which rocks the small rural community. Writer-director Richard Brooks pulls out all the stops with this screen-version of Truman Capote's fictionalized tome. It's a good-looking picture moodily photographed by Conrad Hall that often calls attention to itself because of its crystalline black-and-white images. Take away that vivid look and the new-fangled language and what you have is a '50s-styled melodrama, undermined by both jangling hyperbole and moralistic pandering (and topped with some Bible-quoting and finger-wagging). Brooks pummels away at the sordidness inherent in his exposition, yet allows the killers (well-played by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake) to emote and sound off--to become \"human\"--barely avoiding the literary, built-in apologia for their behavior (they were thrown away by society!). The movie is one-part crime case and another part queasy drama, with the murders detailed in an appropriately disturbing fashion just shy of feeling exploitative. The performances are solid, and Brooks is deft at skidding along the edges of 1967 permissiveness, but there's something about dramatizing this case which doesn't quite work (neither here nor in Capote's book): by giving up so much time to the killers, probing their minds and so forth, too much depth is attributed to two soulless murderers. Pauline Kael of the New Yorker noted the killers no longer run over the dog with their car as they did in the book, the point being this (not the murders of the family) might have killed off our interest in the pair as characters. Four Oscar nominations, including Brooks for both Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. ** from ****",

Like the book, it shifts narrative perspective intermittently, traversing past and present from the perspectives of the killers and their helpless victims.The cinematography is documentarian in style, and the fact that Brooks chose to shoot the film at the actual locations (including the real \"murder house\") gives the film an even more disturbing veneer to privy audiences. The film is fairly muted in regard to showing on-screen violence, but the impact left behind by what is implied is properly effective. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson turn in two enormously effective performances as the lead antiheroes, and the film's last scenes rival Susan Hayward's harrowing turn in \"I Want to Live!\"As far as crime films go (true or not), \"In Cold Blood\" is a masterwork of the genre. It works as well as a straightforward thriller as it does a police procedural, and is supplemented by a cold, detached demeanor that allows their audience to project their own emotions onto it. It's a film that's cold as ice, but is sure to elicit a response from anyone with a pulse. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Nightmare on the Prairie: A Little More Personal View",
            "content": "Few movies are more horrific or unsettling than this one. Writer-producer-director Richard Brooks may have set out to denounce the death penalty, but what he got instead was a penetrating trip into the proverbial heart of darkness, made all the more affecting because based on fact. Watch those cold barren landscapes pass by as the death car approaches its destination: the lonely burger stand, the austere hardware store, the empty sidewalks and featureless sky, a gray horizon ebbing out to nowhere. It's early winter on the high prairie. These are the contours of alienation, Midwestern style, the kind of inner and outer terrain that periodically produces a Charlie Starkweather, a John Dillinger, or a Perry Smith. This revealing early part is too often overlooked for the facile Freudianizing that comes later on.Then too, it's Ozzie and Harriet, David and Ricky, who are slaughtered. By all accounts, the Klutters were a prototypical 50's family -- well-adjusted, friendly folks, so confident of the outside world as to not even lock the front door. One can only imagine the actual horror of that routine Saturday night in a remote Kansas town, or of Nancy Klutter alone in bed, awaiting the final footsteps of the shotgun blast. There was another kind of America out there, one they could hardly imagine, but one just as real as their own well-ordered lives. And it blew in off the frozen prairie, psychopathic drifters on that endless road to nowhere. Despite the differences in style, there are passages in this film every bit as scary as Hitchcock's celebrated Psycho.Fortunately, producer Books wins out over writer Brooks. Writer Brooks is too eager to subvert the expressionist horror with political preachments, but producer Brooks had the good sense to go on location and hire non-movie stars Blake and Wilson. As visual doubles of killers Smith and Hickock, they project the so-called banality of evil, in spades. But they also bring an unexpected pathos-- subtle enough argument against the death penalty. Brooks' real triumph, however, was to bring on board Conrad Hall as cameraman. It's Hall's superbly gripping style -- as another reviewer ably illustrates-- that glues the elements into a single atmospheric whole. Without that sustaining mood the film would collapse into disparate, opposing halves, allowing writer Brooks' flawed script to dominate. Anyone thinking that black and white photography is artistically pass\u00e9 should view this film, an enduring masterpiece of the genre.The actual events of November,1959, reached across the Midwest to New York City where they caught the eye of litt\u00e9rateur Truman Capote, who used them to change the face of crime writing in America. That same cold wind blew westward too, across those of us in southeastern Colorado. Suddenly, deer rifles came off racks, doors got locked, and strangers best kept moving. A bleak early winter quickly got bleaker. I'm a long way from that time now, but maybe not so far, after all. Echoes from that nightmare weekend still sound somewhere deep inside. Maybe it's the echo that still keeps my gun close to the bed and my doors securely locked. And, for sure, a light on somewhere in the house, anywhere.In retrospect, the killings, coming at the very end of that mythic decade, amount to a symbolic shattering of a more tranquil time, of a complaisant middle-class, and to a telling portent of the turbulent decade to come. Fifty-five years later, I only hope that somewhere, somehow, the book and the movie have done some good. Something to help compensate for the brief, promising life of Nancy Klutter. For it's through her last agonizing moments-- alone and facing into the night --that we all experience those final echoing footsteps that is the true heart of darkness.",

            "content": "... at least for me, because by the end of the movie, I really, really wanted Dick and Perry to die. It wasn't a feeling of revenge. I didn't care if they suffered, in fact it is too bad lethal injection wasn't around before it was, because I'm sure a botched hanging could be an awful way to go. I just had a feeling that the earth was a safer place without these two guys in it. The movie did a great job of humanizing two cold blooded killers in a way that few films had done before. It showed their backgrounds, it showed that Dick was the leader and definitely the more dangerous of the two. He didn't really care that he killed four total strangers, and he was even somewhat apathetic about his own death. Perry probably would have had none of this killing business and just gone on to re-offend and be re-incarcerated for less violent offenses the rest of his life, AS LONG AS he didn't meet up with a stronger more forceful personality such as Dick Hickock, who called Perry on his fantastic tales of untrue crime. Before DNA and the many advances in forensics since 1959, Alvin Dewey has a huge task on his hands. Who would kill four likable people like the Clutters with seemingly no motive? Today the answer is - almost anybody. In 1959 this killing made national news because of its random senseless nature and its rural locale where crime was very low. John Forsythe was mainly an actor on television his entire career, but he was outstanding as the lead investigator in this crime. He keeps the police procedural part of this film quite interesting with his methodical sensible approach.The last part of the film shows Dick and Perry on death row for five years. If you didn't see the first part of this film you'd think these guys were artists, poets, philosophers. That's just because they are being told when to get up, when to go to bed, when to eat, etc. Even the most hardened of criminals will seem OK if you take all of their decisions away from them, and that's how parole boards get fooled, which is something society has learned the hard way over the last 50 years. Or have we? I watch this film and I can't help but think about the Carr brothers. Next to them Dick and Perry look like Rotarians. There are so many similarities. Both killed in Kansas, both picked houses occupied with complete strangers where they thought there was lots of cash, both killed the household dog - the Carrs as a parting shot after executing four people after hours of ritualistic sexual torture and robbery - Dick and Perry killed the Clutter's German Shepherd because they weren't going to be able to get near the Clutters without doing so. Yet the Carr brothers remain alive 15 years after the crime with their death sentence being overturned by the gutless Kansas Supreme Court. Google \"Wichita Massacre\" to see what I'm talking about.Finally this film teaches how not to react to a home invasion, a term that would not exist for another 35 years after the Clutters were killed. If somebody breaks into your house BECAUSE you are there, you can assume they are after much more than your stuff. Your first duty is ESCAPE because then the criminals realize the clock is ticking, especially in the age of cell phones and 911. Resist with lethal force if you can, escape when you can. If the Clutters had all scattered in four different directions rather than allowing themselves to be tied up to protect the other family members it is likely that at least Perry would have panicked and that would have been the end of it.Most chilling scene to me - Nancy Clutter winding her alarm clock before she goes to bed as a train whistles - the same whistle is heard by Dick and Perry as they slowly drive up to the Clutter home. Her killers and her own death were that close and she didn't have a clue. Highly recommended.",

Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family. Despite the annoying slant at the end, this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating. Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this.

            "content": "\"In Cold Blood\" is the relatively faithful filming of the non-fiction novel of the same name by Truman Capote. It tells of the senseless murder of the Clutter family, modestly wealthy Kansas farmers who two convicts believe have $10,000 in a safe in their farmhouse. The movie captures most of the book, even some of the themes that don't lend themselves to being filmed, and is generally about an accurate a depiction of the Clutter murder as the book was. The most glaring change is the awkward insertion of a reporter character to provide some editorializing. Presumably this character is based on Capote, but even though the film was edgy for 1967 (it was the first American film to use the S-word, apparently) audiences weren't deemed to be ready for an effeminate, gay New York writer and the character is watered down greatly.I found the movie striking because it exhibits many elements of the New Hollywood of the 1970s, despite being made in 1967. Perhaps the realism of the story forced it, but this movie definitely doesn't feel like anything else I've seen out of mainstream US cinema in the 1960s. The characters are realistic and we aren't asked to feel sympathetic for them or at least feel sorry for the way they fell to their current state, which seems to be the big contrast from most films of its era. The black and white cinematography, the symbolic transitions in the energetic opening, the sparse soundtrack near the end, these all look forward to the ground-breaking movies of the 1970s.The score by Quincy Jones is generally good but the heartwarming themes played at the Clutter house, prior to the attack, seem quite out of step with the hip sounds heard elsewhere, and the score's awkward disappearance as the movie wears on is a bit problematic. At 130 minutes the movie is overlong, especially with the moralizing at the end, which has its moments but generally serves to show this movie isn't fully part of the sleek New Hollywood of a few years later.Perhaps it's just because I read the book first, but the movie also seems to not properly exploit the shocking nature of the crime. You don't even really find out what they did, in all the gory detail that made it famous, until late in the movie.I just felt like had this movie been trimmed down to 90 minutes it could have been a real stunner, instead it has one foot in the New Hollywood and its big toe in the tradition of bad juvenile delinquent movies of the 1950s and 1960s. Sure the direction is sleek but I couldn't help feeling some of the sermons of the movie's conclusion would have been at home in a horrible delinquent movie like \"The Violent Years\".Still, this movie is a perfectly good filming of the book and one of the earliest American examples of the kind of cinematic thinking that made so many great movies in the 1970s.",

It deals with what Truman Capote went through to get material for his book, \"In Cold Blood.\" This 1967 movie, \"In Cold Blood\", is the dramatization of all that, the movie of the book, but minus Capote himself.

It is a natural follow up. The movie of course cannot cover EVERYTHING in the book, but it does a good job of capturing the key scenes.The remaining comments contain certain SPOILERS. Robert Blake is Perry Smith and Scott Wilson is Richard 'Dick' Hickock, the two ex-cons fresh out of prison who drove 400 miles to the small Kansas town just to rob Mr. Clutter, because they were led to believe that he had a safe full of money in his house. There was no safe and all they got was 40 dollars! The movie is in black and white, appropriate for the subject.

A stolen watch thrown into a river becomes a magnet dredging a dam for a stolen car. An anonymous car driving past the soon-to-be murdered family's farm is replaced by an inside view of another car - the killers', though they're not at the farmhouse... yet.The killers are two drifters and parole breakers: a smooth talking conman and an inward turned, violent and disturbed criminal. \"Dick\" Hickock is a natural born shyster: in his best scene he swindles a tailor out of a free suit and money when they cash a phoney check. Note the way the tailor clearly doesn't trust him, but allows himself to be swindled.A weapon that the movie uses against its audience is a non-linear narrative. Just as shots seamlessly dissolve from happy family to violent criminality, the present is linked with the past in Perry Smith's mind as we witness his traumatic and violent family history. These events loom large in Smith's mind, so large that the conman Dick Hickock can easily manipulate his disturbed partner and turn talk into violence.The effect of all this provides the movie's most troubling association: that of fate. Note the way the tailor's face is that of a man who knows he's being screwed. Why does he allow Hickock to continue his swindle? And the recollections in Smith's mind: at first we see them as flashbacks in a dangerous mind, but then the killing at the farmhouse itself is shown after everything else, putting it on an even kiel with these reflections. The non-linearity of time, the decades old flashbacks looming just as large as the present, these things suggest that the actions we witness are fated to occur; the criminals and their victims were always inclined to collide like two asteroids on a collision course. Note also the way the men are arrested: this would be a climactic event in a lesser movie. Here it is a routine stop, blink and you miss it.The events leading up to their capture are also given short shrift. Even in 1967 audiences were familiar with police work as it is shown in movies. We already know they're going to be caught, so why go into details? But it's more than that. The total of the movie seems to be suggesting that the murder itself, the capture, the death sentence, were always on the cards even before the criminals knew it.The constant equation, moving from place to place that should be bracing in their disparity, makes for one of the most troubling movies ever made, bleak and nihilistic, and bolstered by fine performances from the two main leads: Scott Wilson like a young George C. Scott as Dick Hickock, and Robert Blake, terrifying as always, showing why he was made to play one of the most frightening movie characters ever as Mystery Man in Lost Highway, 30 years later.Call it fate.",

            "content": "'In Cold Blood' is a film written and directed by Richard Brooks whose story is based on the non-fiction novel of the same name written by Truman Capote. The story involves two ex-convicts Perry Smith and Richard 'Dick' Hickock played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively. They hatch up a plan to rob the Clutters, a wealthy family in Kansas. But during the robbery they find that there is no safe filled with cash and in the heat of the moment they end up gruesomely murdering the entire family. The film follows them on the run as the police try their best to get to the bottom of the crime. Now I don't have much idea about the actual crime and the actual people involved with it. So this review will be solely based on my impression of these people from the film which in turn is based on Truman Capote's impression of the events.I loved how the film starts. The director intermixes the scenes involving Perry and Dick along with the scenes showing the Clutters in their home. This works and acts like a foreshadow for the inevitable brutality that is going to follow. I couldn't help but feel a bit heartbroken to see the scenes involving the Clutters already knowing at the back of my mind, their eventual fate. The director hints at the existing financial inequality in society. He underlines the fact that as long as the imbalance in society exists, crimes like this will go on forever and ever and no one can do anything about it. Families and people will continue to remain vulnerable to evil forces borne out of dissatisfaction. Another very important and interesting aspect of the film is the unpredictability of human nature. Richard Brooks does give you hints and indications as to what triggered the two convicts (Perry in particular) to do what they did by giving you some details of their past lives and their childhood, but in the end Brooks wants you to know that some crimes just take place out of nowhere without much explanation to support it. Human beings with unstable minds and unstable psyches can be capable of the ultimate form of evil. Interestingly, this aspect of the unpredictability of crime is also covered in Bennett Miller's 'Foxcatcher'. It's interesting because Bennett Miller is also the director of 'Capote', the film which follows Truman Capote in his quest to acquire more and more information on this murder of the Clutters while he was working on his book 'In Cold Blood' which serves as the source material for the script of this film.I thought the middle act of the film was a bit uninteresting. It had nothing to do with the pace, it just involved scenes that didn't match the quality of the rest of the film. The procedural element of the film is the only thing of the narrative that I wasn't a big fan of and this is what fills up the middle act. The acting is solid from everyone involved, with bits of over acting in some scenes which is expected as we were still in the 60s and over the top acting had still not completely left Hollywood. The direction and screenplay is brilliant. The recreation of the crime scenes was absolutely brilliant. There are some jump-cuts from one scene to another and the transition was seamless. The last 30 minutes of the film is directed meticulously. The music by Quincy Jones basically revolves around elements of jazz and blues. The music in the film is beautiful to listen to on its own, but at times I found it to be a bit jarring and inappropriate in certain scenes and at times a bit too loud. 'In Cold Blood' isn't a perfect film, but it is certainly a good account of a gruesome crime. It is well directed, it has elements of both procedural films as well as road films. It just shows that no matter who you are or what you do, you are always vulnerable. The American Dream is ideal, but it is not beyond the grasps of evil forces.",

A stark, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The professional, Blackboard Jungle).It is interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this film, has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film.This is a film that stays with you after viewing.",

We don't see the murders right away, the tension builds up in what's unseen, with the characters of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock fully explored both by the incredible script and the acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. In spite of oneself, one develops a warmth and interest in this pair of losers who are on a journey of catastrophic proportions. The audience knows this and they don't. All the supporting roles are depicted well and the tragic pasts of the leads are slowly revealed in flashback, one can see how these monsters were created. The movie was filmed on the actual Clutter property and house and some of the jury members are extras along with the police and the townsfolk. An unspeakably awful tragedy, a family wiped out in the mistaken belief of hidden cash and the two perpetrators hanged. Remorseless, uncomprehending unto death. 9 out of 10. Extraordinary. A must see for fans of the genre and for fans of the recent \"Capote\". 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Obviously, many people like this movie. Equally obviously - that being the case - I must have missed something. Based on the actual murders of a Kansas family, I nevertheless found the story to be plodding and the acting (aside from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, who I thought were all right as the killers) to be quite lacking in either emotion or intensity. I admit that I've never read the Truman Capote book on which this is based. I have seen parts of the movie \"Capote,\" which supposedly details the process of Capote's writing of the book, and was bored almost to tears with it. \"In Cold Blood\" left me with much the same feeling. Essentially, this seems to be a psychological study of the killer Perry Smith (Blake) - with whom Capote is rumoured to have developed a relationship while researching the book - which tries to explain how he became a cold-blooded killer. But why? Are we supposed to feel sympathy for him? I had the feeling that the viewer was being manipulated into feeling sympathy for him, especially in the scenes near the end of the film, when Smith is on death row, but if that was the goal, it failed with me. Is this making a point about capital punishment? If so, I wasn't entirely clear what the point was. Was it pro, anti or neutral? I'd guess anti, but if so, it didn't do a very good job of it. The use of flashbacks to explain Smith's upbringing wasn't well done, either. The most \"dramatic\" part of the movie to me was a little trick by director Richard Brooks who, as Smith is speaking about the crimes to the prison chaplain on death row, uses the rain falling and dripping down the window Smith is looking out of to cast a reflection on Smith's face, which look like sweat and tears. The effect was well done, but again it seemed an attempt to elicit sympathy for Smith, who in my view (and I'm against capital punishment) was undeserving of sympathy.For whatever reason, I just reacted against this movie. I found it dull and manipulative. My gut reaction is to give it a 1. That would be a bit unfair, given the reasonably good performances from Blake and Wilson, but I still can't go higher than a 2/10 on this one.",

I'd read Truman Capote's story when it first appeared in 4 installments in \"The New Yorker\" magazine and found it VERY gripping. To my surprise, decades later, this movie struck me likewise. I often feared I was going to see senseless violence. The film follows Capote's book quite faithfully (except the role of Capote is played as a bland reporter). IMO, Ebert's reviews are on the mark. (And, just in case your reaction is like mine, have a bottle of wine available; my build-up of tension was relieved by a couple glasses right after viewing.)FWIW: the section re: \"personal life\" in the Wikipedia article on Robert Blake/\"Perry Smith\" is interesting.

And it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money.Those darker moments are the most haunting ones.The flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying.When Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says \"Oh, please, don't\"...The brutality of man, it's impossible to explain.Then the hanging scene.First there goes Hickock and then Perry, first talking to the minister.In the last image of the movie we see Perry hitting the end of the rope.Sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains.Especially Perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for.He thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves.But it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody.They go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood.How could you sympathize these people?",

It was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across America and there had recently been a mass-murder in my hometown where I saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage. The freshness of that close-to-home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation. Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it's story. I've only seen this a couple times since. It was too real. Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers. I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10. Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche.",

Perry makes up a plan of finding hidden treasure worth 60 million dollars in gold in Mexico and hopes he does it the same way Humphrey Bogart does it in 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre'(1948). Dick convinces that they could go after the hidden treasure after breaking into Mr. Clutter's house and walk away with the 10,000 bucks ensconced in his safe. The Clutters are a revered, rich, god-fearing family in a rural town in Kansas. They are deemed to be the people who would-not-harm-a-creature. The duo execute the robbery as planned but end the lives of the the Clutters. To their aghast, they do not find any safe as told by Dick's friend Harold; all they could rake in is 43 bucks. They leave no traces, clues or witnesses and make it really intricate for the cops to identify them. However, the cops process a photo of the impression made by their blood-soaked shoes and use it to trace the convicts with the help of Harold testifies. The men then head to Mexico and after Dick makes Perry understand hidden treasures only happen in movies, they set out to their native state. They are finally caught by the cops in California. They come up with alibi which the cops rule them out as preposterous. They are proved guilty and sentenced to death. They are taken to \"The corner\" after a 5-year long wait. The men then hang from the gallows for the heinous crime they committed.Like 'To kill a mocking bird'(1962), the movie doesn't have much screen-time in a courtroom but it is an equally good movie nonetheless in the genre 'Courtroom Drama'. The movie is a landmark in the way it brings out the message of the gross crimes committed by the people; how people are undaunted by the capital punishment despite watching and hearing many people hang from the gallows. The movie also showed that all the convicts will one day be brought to the book by the hand of the law; such is the perseverance the police force show in catching the criminals. The art-direction , background score and screenplay, combined with wonderful Editing and continuity has made this a movie worth watching. It is far-ahead of Fargo any day. Pun intended.",

But other than the slow pace, I did find many things to like about the film. I liked the tone of the film and the eerie nature it gives off. Being filmed in black-and-white gives authenticity to the film, which after all is based off the real crime. The location of the movie ties into that eeriness because the film was shot on the site of the actual murder, so we get to see how everything actually happened, or close to it at least. I loved the quiet, semi-jazzy score from Quincy Jones. Also I felt maybe the final half-hour of the film was the best part of the movie.Richard Brook's film is about two men named Perry and Dick who are about to commit a robbery on a Kansas farm based off suspect information. When they realize they were not about to make the big score they had anticipated, they make sure not to keep their victims alive. Now the two men escape and flee to Mexico. But with law enforcement after them, their freedom may be running out.The film is full of nice performances. At the time of release in 1967 and even by today's standard, there are really no big stars. But I felt the cast did a good job. Robert Blake does a solid job as Perry, the man with a conscience and a violent edge. Scott Wilson, more famous for playing Herschel in the Walking Dead television series, does an excellent job as the carefree Dick.Overall, In Cold Blood is a solid crime drama. I felt it could have been much better given its slow, meandering pace, but the film is full of solid performances and it has a killer ending. I also felt intrigued as I learned about the actual crime, based off the research of Truman Capote. It was a very grisly crime, and I'm glad the movie did not skip the details of the crime. I actually thought, based off the first half of the film, that it would not show the crime. If that happened, I would have been thoroughly disappointed. I really like movies based off true stories, which is why I checked this film out. Not an entirely great film, but certainly chilling and enjoyable.My Grade: B-",

Yet the cars in the film are solidly early-1960s models, from the murder up to the 1965 execution. You'd think Brooks, whose realism is otherwise stunning, could have filled the set with a few older Ramblers and Plymouths. Outside of that, it's a penetrating and gripping adaptation that cannily avoids sensationalism and allows us to get into the heads of the killers (very well played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson). I love the elliptical storytelling: At first Brooks avoids showing us the actual murders, only circling around to them an hour later to show them from Perry's point of view, all the more devastating since we've now been clued in to his miserable childhood. The movie does sentimentalize the Clutter family a bit (especially in Quincy Jones' otherwise superb scoring), and there's a touch of grandstanding about capital punishment toward the end that screams \"message.\" But it's a brilliant, matter-of-fact staging, aided by Conrad Hall's suitably sharp, bleak, moody black-and-white cinematography.

Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day.The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine.Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing.Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy. Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff--and recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "Writer & director Richard Brooks of \"Elmer Gantry\" fame adapted Truman Capote's bestselling novel \"In Cold Blood\" about the senseless slaying of a farm family in rural Kansas in the later 1950s. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson take top billing as the pair of cold-blooded murders who killed the helpless Clutter family. The two protagonists are ex-convicts. Dick (Scott Wilson) learns from a prison inmate with whom he shared a cell that Herbert Clutter had a safe at his farm house and keep $10-thousand dollars on hand. Perry (Robert Blake) is a Korean War veteran with a disfigured leg who breaks parole by joining Dick in Kansas. They buy rope and duck tape and masquerade as hunters. They drive 400 miles and pull up at the Clutter residence after dark. They break into the house by simply turning the door knob and take the defenseless Clutters hostage. Dick has already decided that they cannot leave behind any witnesses. What surprises Dick and frustrates Perry is that the s0-called safe that the inmate assured Dick about doesn't exist. They show no qualms about killing the Clutters in cold blood, but they wind up with $43 instead of $10-thousand. The chief mistake that they make is that Perry stepped into Mr. Clutter's blood after they slit his throat. It never enters Perry's mind to discard his boot. A flashbulb photograph uncovers the diamond formation of Dick's shoe. The pair light out for Mexico, but it turns out to be a dead end for them. At one point, Perry wants to travel to the Yucatan peninsula and search for Cortes' hidden treasure. Dick derides Perry for such outlandish notions, but his incredible screw-up is nothing compared to Perry. They are nabbed by the Las Vegas Police and Kansas investigators pick them up. Eventually, they separate the two boys and interrogate them individually without the other knowing what their questions are. Perry holds up the longest, but Dick caves in and admits that Perry killed them. They are taken back, tried, and found guilty for the deaths of the four Clutters.The premise of \"In Cold Blood\" is harped on repeated throughout the narrative. Why did this senseless murder have to happen? Indeed, during a scene when the authorities are transporting Perry back to stand trial, he observes, \"It doesn't make sense. I mean what happened. It had nothing to do with the Clutters. They never hurt me. They just happened to be there. I thought Mr. Clutter was a very nice gentleman... I thought so right up to the time I cut his throat.\" At one point, a criminal psychiatrist says that neither Dick nor Perry had what it took to commit the murders. Nevertheless, when they got together, a third personality emerged. Brooks shoots this gritty saga in black & white, and Conrad Hall's photography gives this crime thriller an raw air of authenticity. Nothing about the crime is glamorized. The only drawback for some viewers will be Brooks' indulgent 134 minute storyline and the absence of humor and sexuality. According to the trivia section at IMDb.COM, Brook lensed the action on several actual settings, for example, the Clutter's house and the courtroom. The final scene when Perry talks about his life is brilliantly lighted and staged. Outside the prison, rain pours down, and the water draining off the windows is reflected on Perry's contrite face. Stunning stuff!",

They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on.Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations.Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.",

            "content": "IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it's also so bent on being realistic, it's sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects! Brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. Although he films on actual locations, he keeps his distance. The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which surely they were. They're not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the Capote book) and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the Capote \"character?\") The landmark photography is by the great Conrad Hall.",

            "content": "Truman Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" is a deeply disturbing read, and if Richard Brooks' film adaptation is a somewhat softened version, it's not by much.Brooks opens up the film to show flashbacks of Perry Smith's (played by Robert Blake) troubled youth in an effort to make the audience sympathize with him and then be that much more horrified by the cold-blooded things he does. But there's a big difference for the audience in seeing fictionalized versions of events instead of reading journalistic accounts of them, and I thought that Brooks humanizes the film a bit too much when one of the most notable aspects of the crimes depicted in it and that made Capote's book such a sensation was the realization that men could be capable of such inhuman actions. Still, his decision to film the movie in stark black and white and treat the subject matter frankly matches the journalistic tone of Capote's book nicely, and it makes for a very unsettling film.One of the things I liked best about the movie is that it makes the eventual execution of the two criminals nearly as horrifying as the murders they carry out. This is something that struck me when reading Capote's book -- the cold-bloodedness with which the legal system goes about capital punishment is as disturbing in its way as the cold-bloodedness with which killers go about their business.Robert Blake is most remembered now for his performance in this film, but I was as impressed if even not a little bit more by Scott Wilson as his buddy and instigator of their crime. Blake plays his character as a damaged soul carrying a burden of guilt; Wilson's is the scarier creation, the criminal without a care in the world.\"In Cold Blood\" garnered four Oscar nominations in 1967, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay nods for Richard Brooks, Best Cinematography in the first year the Academy officially disbanded distinctions between black and white and color in that category, and Best Original Score by Quincy Jones. Despite its directing and writing nominations, it wasn't nominated for Best Picture, which might not be a very notable footnote in Academy history had \"Doctor Dolittle\" NOT been among the nominated films. As it is, its omission stands as an outrage.Grade: A",

To those aware of black and white era, it will surely remain a perfect crime drama, humanist movie and a truthful statement about the American rural society which was very closely knit. All this might not be same for today's viewers whoever they might be, wherever they might live because they have only a brief inkling of that bygone era. This is not unusual as these folks are more used to today's films with explicit gore, mayhem, violence and bloodbath. So compared to all this the meaningless multiple homicide depicted in \"In cold blood\" might appear as childish or may be laughable to them. For its 134 minutes duration, \"In cold blood\" is a very gripping film. One genuine reason to watch it is its masterful original soundtrack by Quincy Jones. Apart from these factors there are many aspects of this film which have become old due to the passage of time. For example-an offhand viewer might get the idea that there is a lot of blood, gore and horrible violence in this film. However it is more of a psychological portrait of a senseless crime which was perpetuated by two highly irresponsible young criminals. In short it is a must for those people who appreciated Psycho by Mr A H. This film is in no way Psycho's poor cousin.",

This was a highly combustible scenario in America whereby two entirely different cultures collided. What justified such heinously depraved actions anyway?.. As this film presents the scene,(while Hickock and Smith drank) these two men were not intoxicated, nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs!! It was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation.. Basically, these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect... Anytime past 1975, we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment... However, this incident takes place in 1959!! This dreadful revelation sideswiped us, and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics!! With the recent release of the movie \"Capote\" based on Truman Capote, who was the creator of the documentary \"In Cold Blood\", the American people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film!! Robert Blake played the role of Perry Smith, one of the villains in this movie... This is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life!! \"In Cold Blood\" centers on the element of the unexplained... There was no vengeance involved, there was no material gain to be acquired, there was no potential for social advancement here either, this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means!! The situational diatribes which Hickock and Smith lamented about were always ambiguous!! Under the circumstances, why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent Kansas family?.. Will Geer (Grandpa Walton) plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness!! His argument is thoroughly convincing... His contention being: \"These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours\" This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury!! Absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime!! It was Capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public's attention!! As it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.. \"In Cold Blood\" did just that!! This incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960's!! Such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical Americans for the future!!!Truman Capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book, (which was a best seller) and, with this documentary as well... The acting in this film by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as well as people like John Forsythe, was incredible!! The director, Richard Brooks, (\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", \"Blackboard Jungle\" \"Elmer Gantry\" and \"Key Largo\" to name but a few!!) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie!! I think that \"In Cold Blood\" is one of the best films in the history of movies!! The film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics, and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level!!.... This movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence!! Our nation's ideologies are incredibly different now, than they were in 1959!! This movie introduces the American people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system!! I recommend to everyone that they see this movie...\"In Cold Blood\" was the focal point to the film \"Capote\"! Think about it, making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in Hollywood!! In the case of \"In Cold Blood\" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, \"In Cold Blood\" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!",

I've had this DVD since the day it came out but figured today was the perfect day to see it since it made a good double feature with Capote. Richard Brooks direction and screenplay does a very good job at showing the police tracking down the two killers but things go a bit overboard when the script tries to \"explain\" murderers. The narration in the final twenty minutes wasn't needed either. Up till that point this is a very good thriller with a wonderful atmosphere and some very good performances, especially Blake. It's worth noting that there's a character in the film that's supposed to be Capote but he's certainly not anything like we seen in the 2005 film. This film was controversial when released due to the strong profanity and other issues but I guess the studio didn't want to push things by showing Capote the way he really was since in this film he's shown as a tough guy.",

The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay.The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer/director Brooks creates.Notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to-be-killed are linked. Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone. Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to Perry washing his face. Only Perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs. This failure/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die. we cut to the Clutters.Perry talks his dream about a yellow bird, \"Taller than Jesus\" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them. \"The Nuns begged for mercy,\" he tells us, \"But the bird slaughtered them anyway.\" The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom.The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs.Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on. Nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner. The decision seals her fate.Perry talks of Bogart in \"Treasure of Sierra Madre\". But it is another Bogart picture, \"Beat the Devil\" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure.Cut to Herb Clutter signing a $40,000 life insurance policy. He's thinking about mortality at the moment. Ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours.Dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them. Later, in fact, it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered.\"There was one witness,\" the detective keeps telling Dick later. But was that witness the jail-house friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie.Fascinating film.",

Ask me, and you'll get, to wrap the audience up tightly with a good story, well told. My wife would be the entertainment voter. I think we're all right.Richard Brooks' film version of the Truman Capote book isn't by any stretch of the word, entertaining. That leaves us with wrapping up the viewer with a thought-provoking story. I remember seeing bits and pieces of In Cold Blood as a teen when it was shown on CBS. I couldn't get the idea through my head why two stupid criminals would slaughter a family for any reason that made sense. I knew I wasn't getting the point, even though I had made it past the concrete- operational period in my intellectual development. My life experiences hadn't told me about the random barbarism humans could inflict on each other. I was blessedly innocent, even though I understood why a bunch of soldiers had decimated a couple of villages in Vietnam in 1968 (venting their frustration on less-than-humans) and why four kids got gunned down at Kent State (weekend warriors who panicked). But butchering four innocents in a farm house, just for a couple bucks, simply didn't add up. To be honest, it still doesn't.Jump forward to seeing Brooks' The Professionals in a theatre during the winter of 1975 (with the premiere of his Bite the Bullet), and the scene, where Jack Palance's banditos systematically execute dozens of Mexican soldiers, left me wondering why, why do such a monstrous thing?I remember sitting there in that theatre and figuring it out, getting the answer to my question. Why My Lai? Why the Clutters? Why this or that massacre?Convenience. Lives are expendable for expedience' sake. And that is why Aristotle would understand In Cold Blood. I understand the story. My wife would too, but she would be so sickened by the subject and so perturbed by the idea of not being entertained by a medium that is supposed to entertain, that I envy her. She shields herself from Aristotle.When I saw ICB again, something like ten years ago, I was more knowledgeable about movie-making, more aware of the psychological screwiness of Dick and Perry, but I felt that same nausea I felt when I first saw the film.It still didn't make sense.

But the point(s) of the story - this is not simply a thriller - came across all the more poignantly this time; a story of two men - two very different characters - who end up together for a perfect score (''a cinch.''), which goes terribly wrong, and subsequently, their persecution and demise - all leading up to what the title actually refers to. All filmed in beautiful, moody black and white, accompanied by a very cool soundtrack and a lot of '60s lingo, 'baby'.A big part of it entails the character study of (mainly) Perry Smith, a good-hearted man in a way, but with an explosive temper. The memories of his troubled past are beautifully intertwined with the story, which works its long and winding, but confident way to a gloomy, atmospheric ending. In between, the stories of the victims, the shocked community and the burdened investigators come into play, so that in the end there are no simple answers to the questions posed - only questions.I'm glad to have tried it once again, it's no less than a classic. The statement that is made with this elaborate, at times emotional story that ends in pure gloom, makes this a bold film (as I can only imagine the book of Truman S. Capote must be), and not just for its time. Finally, big kudos to Robert Blake and Scott Wilson for making their character no less than lifelike.A big 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "HAVING BEEN MADE so long, long ago, IN COLD BLOOD (1967) lacks the extremely graphic violence that became a hallmark of the crime drama in the 1970s. In the period before the likes of BONNIE & CLYDE, THE GODFATHER and the actioners of guys like Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson, imagination and good acting were still being applied in liberal amounts.SOME HAVE COMPLAINED about this film (and all others) not having been filmed in color. Those who hold this opinion generally equate Technicolor with quality film making. To those folks, Black & White is strictly old hat; being a relic of the old days.AS FAR AS this particular production's use of the Black & White, it was the correct choice. For a story that deals with such unbelievable occurrences and characters of such incredible, inhuman behavior needs to be done up in a particularly appropriate darkness. In every sense of the word, the film is dark, truly an example of \"Noir\"; even though it is based on a real incident.ALTHOUGH THE HORRORS of the perpetration of the mass murder of a rural family is the central element which drives the narrative, special attention to revealing the psychotic personalities possessed by the two killers. THe story is crafted in such a manner as to build a solid background (foundation) to the incidents that transformed what would have been a robbery for monetary gain in to an atrocity of totally insane commission and lacking any motive, other than inflicting pain and sorrow on others for no reason.THE CAST CONSISTING of Robert Blake & Scott Wilson as the killers, along with Paul Stewart, John Forsythe, Charles McGraw, Ruth Storey, Brenda Curin, Jeff Corey and many others, did a fine job in presenting an essentially downer of a film. There is no other way to spin such a tale.AT ITS CONCLUSION the story is a sort of morality play. Through Paul Stewart's character, questions asked about the whole case, from beginning to end. The questions are said from one character to another, yet they are meant for all of us. How do we prevent such unspeakable atrocities? How do we deal with the dispensing of \"Justice?\" WE DO RECALL SEEING author of the book IN COLD BLOOD, Truman Capote as a guest on The Johnny Carson TONIGHT Show. This was while the film was in full release nationwide. When asked what conclusions that he had drawn from all of his research of the incident, his reply was blunt and straight forward. Mr. Capote said that it would be far better for all of the nation if an occasional innocent were to be executed, rather than having so many homicidal maniacs roaming about with impunity.WELL SURPRISING, BUT, Way to go \"Tru!\"",

            "content": "Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting.Robert Blake walks away with the film. The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair. The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score.Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home. As \"prosecutor\" (a character that isn't given a name in the script), played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head. Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film, prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry's own ever-escalating sense of impending doom. He repeatedly makes remarks, \"No one ever gets away with a thing like that,\" and \"I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us.\" Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's. Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime. I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more-so as events progressed, but I only loathed Dick.The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played. We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred. The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes.For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the \"Goofs\" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated. Such as the \"reversed\" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas. To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real. A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle. As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence (no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to), but a thoroughly excellent film.",

Even today, nearly 50 years later, this is certainly one unique film-experience that still holds up very well.Impressively filmed in a semi-documentary style, In Cold Blood tells the true-life story of 2 young men who senselessly murder the Clutter family for a large sum of money that was supposed to be hidden in a safe in their Kansas farmhouse.Masterfully directed by Richard Brooks, this compelling picture was based on Truman Capote's book of the same name. The film's exceptional b&w camera-work was done by Conrad Hall.For anyone who's interested in seeing a fine example of first-rate movie-making from the 1960s, I recommend this picture very highly.",

            "content": "A unique film...one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period. The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Really one of a kind in this respect. PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record). Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them. But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions. This is some of the best acting you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. I'll stop here. It's not a feel-good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff.",

The film shows the viewer exactly what it was like on a deadly night in Kansas in a remote farmhouse. The Clutter family was murdered by two men who believed Mr. Clutter had a safe containing thousands of dollars in cash in his home. There was no safe. In a rage, two losers killed a helpless family of four. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two killers. But it's wrong to say they merely played them; they seem to become them. The book upon which it was based was written by Truman Capote, who interviewed both murderers before their executions. He extracted exact sequences of events from them and put them together. To add to the realism, the film was shot inside the actual house where the crimes occurred. I believe that this film is one of the true classic movies. It's shot in B&W also.",

            "content": "I'm torn in what to think about In Cold Blood. On one hand, it's a smart thriller that gives a taste of authenticity, being that it is based off a true story. The film was shot in the real locations the murder took place and it makes good use of black-and-white photography to give off a sense of realism. On the other hand, the pace of the film was excruciating slow. Except for the final half hour of the film, I was twitching non stop in my seat and every once in awhile, I caught my eyes drooping. A very good story to tell, but I wonder if the execution of the film was properly done.Anyhow, this thriller received unanimous praise for its authentic storytelling and how this film could have been passed off as a documentary. The film is based of a murder of a family that took place in a rural Kansas town in the early 1960's. The film is told almost exactly as the real murder went down. The black and white camera work was a good idea because it adds a realistic feeling to the film. The house where the murder took place was actually used to replicate the murder scenes for the film. Even people who were associated with the murders such as neighbors, friends, etc were played by themselves and I thought it was really cool. The performances from everyone came across as natural thus transforming their characters to a near life-like state.This film is about a pair of ex-cons named Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) who are meeting in Kansas, thus breaking the terms of their parole. They plan a robbery based on information from a former cellmate of Dick's in regards of ten thousand dollars worth of cash. Once they robbed the cash, they plan on moving down to Mexico to escape from the law enforcement. However, things don't go as planned. They end up killing all four members of the Clutter family only coming away with a measly 43 dollars in cash. Now they are truly on the run from the law. But if Detective Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe) has a say, Perry and Dick will find their way at the end of hangman's noose before all is said and done.The film is a very small film and the cast is near unrecognizable (However, some of you might recognize Scott Wilson who played Herschel in the popular The Walking Dead series). Despite the relative unfamiliar faces, the performances come across as natural. It's good the film does not feature any star power because it would have undermined what director Richard Brooks was trying to do. He was trying to recreate the events that happened as real as he could and having big name stars would not have helped his cause. I really enjoyed these performances. Robert Blake performed Perry very well. Perry was the more sensitive character but he can be violent. Dick, played wonderfully by Scott Wilson is more of the manipulator, the man who gen get people to bend to his will. He is also a dreamer, as he dreams for money and escape from America. The two actors had great chemistry with each other, which added on to the natural tone of the characters.This film is not for everybody. It was certainly made very well. I had a huge problem involving the pace of the film. It seemed to move only at a snail's pace especially during the second act. The film also has a sense of trickery to it, which may tick some people off. The first minutes of the film shows the first half of the murder before it dwindles to the next act. I started wondering if we were ever going to see the second half of the murder, when it suddenly happened towards the end. Those scenes were hard to watch, but they were undoubtedly powerful. The beginning and the end of the film are the best sections of the movie. The murder act itself and the aftermath/sentence of the two men were two scenes that were well-done. Also, I had mixed feeling about the score composed by Quincy Jones. On one hand, the score itself was great and is often thrilling. But on the other hand, the music is what you would hear in a Hollywood horror film and that's exactly the opposite of what Brooks was trying to do-not to Hollywoodize his film. Personally, I accepted the use of the music after much thing but just barely.The film does provide some themes to ponder about. The two guys are from different cultures and backgrounds, but they were attracted to each for the same goal. To rob money. The film also shows how emotion goes into the thinking. Because of the result of getting 43 dollars, it became an unfortunate turn of events for the Clutter family who were about to lose their lives due to bad information. The film is eerie, sad, and sometimes quite boring. This story was actually researched by Truman Capote and this research was turned into a screenplay by Richard Brooks. The screenplay was a very well-written one at least.Overall, I generally liked In Cold Blood although I'm not over the moon about it as other critics are. I loved the authentic tone of the film and the performances are very natural. They bring Brook's words to life as if they were their own words. But the film is very slow, and I found the second act to be painful to sit through. But there is no denying how effective the film is and the payoff is very powerful. I would recommend this film, but be prepared for a movie that takes its time to tell the story.My Grade: B-",

            "review_title": "Murder destroys the victim and perpetrator alike",
            "content": "(SPOILERS!)I first saw \"In Cold Blood\" about fifteen years ago and found it to be a tremendously moving film.  In light of the accusation of murder against star Robert Blake, I decided to see the movie again.  I wanted to see how his fictional portrayal of a murderer stood up against his performance as an actual suspec as demonstrated in an interview he did for a television news magazine.\"In Cold Blood\" tells the true story, as recounted in the famous book by Truman Capote, of two fifth-rate criminals, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, who invade the home of a Kansas farmer named Clutter and murder his entire family in cold blood for about a pair of binoculars, a radio and about forty dollars in cash.  The film, told in a docudrama style, covers their meandering flight from justice to their eventual capture, trial and execution.  (It should be noted that the film makers used many actual locations in this film.  The Clutter house used in the film is the actual Clutter house itself where the murders were committed.  Also, in an eerier note, seven of the jurors in the trial scene are the actual jurors who sentenced Perry and Dick to death!)The film, featuring justifiably famous cinematography by Conrad Hall, stylishly accomplishes many diverse goals.  It works as an effective police procedural as investigator John Forsythe diligently tries to bring the men to justice.  It works as a psychological drama as we delve into the minds and backgrounds of two men who are individually ineffectual but terrifying potent in combination.  The film also works as a indictment of the death penalty.  That was the hardest goal to achieve considering the senseless brutality of the crime.The film was written for the screen and directed by Richard Brooks.  In all honesty, this time around I found the exposition gimmicky, heavy-handed and a little dated.  Brooks used gimmicky editing transitions to link the various opening threads of the story which I found more annoying than clever.  I generally enjoyed the jazzy score by Quincy Jones, but even the score annoyed me during the exposition period.  There was too heavy-handed a contrast between the jazzy score of the criminals and the hearts-and-flowers approach to the Clutter family.  Didn't need the sledgehammer.  I also found the first scene where we have a divergence from reality, when Perry imagines himself a singer in Las Vegas, somewhat clumsy.  Compare that scene with the masterful one where Brooks mixes the past and the present as Perry watches Dick with a prostitute in Mexico and you will see what I mean.Fortunately, the film grows smoother and more dynamic the closer the killers get to the Clutter house and ultimately becomes just as moving as I remembered.  I think Brooks' wisest decision was to delay showing exactly what happened in the Clutter house until late in the film when it would have maximum emotional impact.  Oddly, and this really shows the skill of director Brooks and writer Capote, the death of the murderer Perry has almost equal emotional impact.  Although the film failed to make me an opponent of the death penalty, it does illustrate how chain of death just continues to bring sorrow to more families.How did Robert Blake fare in my little retrospective?  When I first saw the film, I found him  absolutely riveting as Perry on an emotional level, but even then, my critical faculty was aware how close he was coming to sailing over the top.  This time I found him less over the top, if only in comparison with his own strange, rambling self-defense in his television interview.  As he recounted his sad childhood, and kept addressing not the interviewer but his child by his murdered wife who was too young now to understand his words, I found him no less compelling.  Like in the film, he gave a moving performance which, in my opinion, hinted of a unstable mind molded by a traumatic upbringing.  I only hope that in reality Robert Blake will prove to be more innocent than his fictional counterpart Dick Perry because, as this movie illustrates, murder destroys both the victim and the perpetrator alike.",

            "content": "The acting and direction in the movie adaption of In Cold Blood played an important and effective role in the characterization of Dick and Perry. In order for this film to work, Scott Wilson needed to play Dick as a cunning and charming personality. The suit store scene perfectly displays these tendencies. In this scene, Dick demonstrates his cunningness by giving the salesman a believable and ordinary story for why he needs a suit. He then uses his charm when he tells the salesman he is the best man and this is his wedding present to Perry. Now, the salesman has an emotional interest in helping Dick instead of merely wanting to make money. After picking out the suits and Dick's continued charm and wit, the salesman believes he has a bond with Dick when he treats him as friend by trusting him with the check. The top notch acting from Scott Wilson, convinced the viewer of Dick's personality and abilities which aided the movies attempt to display an authentic crime. The emphasis in each scene, provided by the director, successfully made the audience sympathize with Perry. The constant pain Perry showed from his accident that created his aspirin addiction demonstrated his vulnerability. Perry's flashbacks throughout the movie, initiated by a mini deja-vu, informed the viewer of Perry's troubled past. For example, when Perry is near his death, he recalls his father aiming a gun at him while telling him to \"take a good look\" because this is the last thing he will ever see. This scene came before his hanging when he was concerned about his last moments in the world and how they would feel. The flashback allowed the audience to almost pardon Perry's action as a result of a troubled childhood. All of these vulnerabilities culminate during Perry's account of the murder when he reluctantly goes into the Clutters house followed by his attempts to persuade Dick to leave the house. This direction, along with the acting, allowed an accurate, gripping, and entertaining film adaption.",

I also thought the investigative detective team had a bit of the Dragnet style stiffness to it but John Forsythe was very good in his role as an intelligent non emotional, non judgmental investigator.  What sets this film apart for me is the time spent after the conviction. The time spent on death row by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock.  Here we get to witness what their lives became and how they individually dealt with what they had done and where it had lead them as they waited five years to be executed. Many crime films end shortly after the point of conviction or with a captioned epilogue scrolled across the screen about the final fate of the murders. Here we witness the quiet agony that they endured in the stark, cold barren surroundings of their prison which is probably the greater of punishment for their deeds than the actual execution. These images of their desolate existence on death row along with the actual murder scenes are the strongest of the film and the ones that stick with me the most . The contrast of the two murderer's personalities was striking and especially so in the way they expressed themselves in the final moments before their deaths. It's always difficult for a movie to match up to a good book but this film succeeds quite well in capturing the feel of Capote's work.",

Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and terrific acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me.The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch. The re-creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off. The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders. The movie has a very documentary feel---besides the scenes at the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie. This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it.",

The events leading up to the Clutter family farmhouse cut directly to the discovery of the bodies, and only after the subsequent manhunt, when all the missing background information and psychological motivation has been sketched in, are the details of the murder itself recreated in flashback. Writer director Richard Brooks is obviously more interested in the killers than their victims, who are portrayed as two-dimensional stereotypes of wholesome prairie virtue. Compare their scenes with the attenuated climax leading up to Dick and Perry's date with the hangman, where Brooks offers a powerful argument against capital punishment by showing the futility of trading one murder for another. The film was shot largely on location in Holcomb, Kansas, with stunning, stark black and photography by Conrad Hall and a memorable, moody jazz score by Quincy Jones.",

It dances the same delicate dance of the book, creating sympathy for Perry and then pulling back and showing his monstrosity, and then drawing in and creating sympathy again. It is this that is more disturbing than the murders themselves. Dick is less fleshed-out, in part, I suspect, because the movie avoided mention of the pedophilia, although mostly it's amazingly frank for its era. It also omits the fact that Dick's personality changed after a head injury, which was something I found fascinating in the book. Nonetheless, the movie works both as an adaptation of a \"true novel\" and as a film in its own right. It applies just the right amount of artistry to show Perry's distorted thoughts, and just the right amount of bareness to show a true story as it unfolds.It is, perhaps, the bareness that is most shocking. Consider: The movie is rated R for violence, despite the fact that none of the violence appears on-screen. It feels that real.What the movie cannot do, quite reasonably, is portray Truman Capote\u0097you'll have to see Capote, or perhaps Infamous, for that. The eyewitness journalist here is a fictional character named Jensen, of a neutral hard-boiled type that allows narration to happen without getting in the way.",

            "content": "Truman Capote allegedly read a brief article in the New York Times describing the killing of the Clutter family in Kansas and shortly afterward visited the scene of the crime with author Harper Lee (who eventually lived off considerable royalties from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".) I remember reading \"In Cold Blood\" in my teen years when I was considering working for the FBI as a field agent. Then and now I have always been fascinated by crimes that allegedly defy explanation: \"senseless killings\". But what enraptured me was Capote's considerable gifts as a writer and story teller. His work as both a short story writer and novelist has consistently been underrated and under appreciated. Two years after the publication of Capote's book, Richard Brooks (who had adapted and directed the film version of Tennessee Williams' \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" and had also collaborated with John Huston on the screenplay of \"Key Largo\") brought Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" to stark life in the movie theaters. While I am always somewhat hesitant to see my favorite novels and plays transferred to film (since they invariably lack the power and verve of the original), I had always wanted to see \"In Cold Blood\", but it is a film rarely shown on television. It is a powerful film, rightly shot in black and white and often evoking the \"film noir\" feel of the 40's and 50's. Robert Blake steals the film, as he should in this role, as the moody and tortured Perry. We see his life unfold both linearly and through a series of flashbacks, developing an understanding of how a sociopath's life might be formed. He is accompanied on this haphazard and fruitless journey by Dick, played brilliantly by Scott Wilson (who had just previous to this film played the murder suspect in \"In the Heat of the Night\" with Poitier and Steiger). But, of course, as with any great film, this movie is replete with supporting actors who are consistently strong throughout the picture. Charles McGraw, who plays Perry's father, almost steals the picture with his seven-minute scene as he lapses into a reverie of Perry's drunken sex-crazed mother and his love and supposed devotion to his young son. Another notable from the supporting cast is Gerald O'Loughlin as one of the detectives in hot pursuit of the suspects. One of the true highlights of the picture is the underlying musical score composed by the brilliant Quincy Jones, who had already scored several films prior to this one, but it was certainly 1967 which put Jones on Hollywood's musical map for back-to-back tour de force scoring of \"In the Heat of the Night\" and \"In Cold Blood\". Some may find that the voice-over narration toward the conclusion of the film verges on the heavy-handed in the implication of the fruitlessness of capital punishment, but Gallup polls of the mid-sixties reveal that 82% of Americans were not in favor of the death penalty, so, for the Zeitgeist of the era, the commentary fits well. For anyone who appreciates film noir, first-rate cinematography, quality musical scoring, and superb acting, \"In Cold Blood\" is a must-see film.",

            "content": "Death comes calling twice over in this grim, gripping depiction of the real-life murder of a Kansas farm family and the subsequent arrest and prosecution of their murderers.At its core, \"In Cold Blood\" is a powerful argument against capital punishment, suggesting that society is no less depraved than killers Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson). At least the killers can't be accused of possessing reason in snuffing out human life.\"How can a perfectly sane man commit an absolutely crazy act?\" asks a reporter, played by Paul Stewart. The answer, as presented here, is that neither man was sane, nor was the system that ordered them killed.In one of many chilling moments, Hickock explains how he favors capital punishment: \"What's wrong with revenge? I've been revenging myself my whole life.\"But \"In Cold Blood\" is no celluloid treatise about a social issue. It makes no attempt to soft-soap the nature of Smith and Hickock's crime, with writer-director Richard Brooks shooting the Clutter massacre in a harrowing if not graphic fashion. There are many ghastly moments on screen, but what you don't see is worse for what it leaves to your imagination.Where Brooks does hedge is in the presentation of Smith as a troubled, sensitive soul pushed into killing by cruel circumstance. There's an annoying tendency to go to psychiatry as if everything that the criminals did could be explained away as psychosis rather than meanness. Much time is spent by Stewart's reporter character discussing how Smith and Hickock formed a \"third personality\" who was the real guilty party in the case. Given how seriously and factually the story is otherwise presented, the Freudian focus comes off as cheap and simplistic.The nature of Smith's role here versus what it was that night in Holcomb, Kansas has been much debated. What can't be debated is the effectiveness of the \"you-are-there\" format the film takes, or the lived-in performances of Blake and Wilson. Brooks, following the example of Truman Capote's source book, takes a journalistic approach to the material that is sometimes dry but establishes a mood of overwhelming dread.Speaking of \"dry,\" John Forsythe is quite a bit of that in a positive way, playing Alvin Dewey, one of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation detectives assigned to the case. As a counterpoint to the psychopathic Smith and Hickock working the investigation, he shines especially in an interrogation scene where Smith is told he made a key mistake by leaving what another detective calls a \"living witness.\"Who was this living witness? Some argue it's an inmate at a prison with whom Hickock discussed the Clutter crime. Others say it's whichever of the perpetrators watched while the other killed. But the visceral work of Brooks, and cinematographer Conrad Hall suggest another possibility: You the viewer.Whether or not you think the crime is also in the punishment, \"In Cold Blood\" has lost none of its power to make you care.",

The fact that it is based on true events makes it more important that the ctors involved know their roles and understand them. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are fabulous at playing the two emotionless criminals, merely focused on getting money they're after and making sure there are no witnesses. The shooting of the film really drew me in, while being shot long after color had been used in many films, the director chose to shoot in entirely black and white which caused the film to be more chilling. The wide lens helped to portray the vastness of the Kansas area that it had been shot in and made it clear to the viewer just how isolated the Clutter family was from any source of help. The match shots in the beginning of the film between Robert Blake's character and the Clutter family allowed the audience to see the complete opposite ends of the spectrum those characters were from each other. Another point to be made is how well the murder of the family was shot. The film goes from the light going out in the Clutter home, which seems to be symbolic for their deaths and the Clutter's family friends finding them, in fact the viewer never actually sees the bodies themselves just other's reactions to seeing them which adds to the curiosity. The score used in the film adds to the nervousness and wild energy of the film as well. The combination of all of these elements makes this a great film.",

            "content": "In the 1967 film In Cold Blood, director Richard Brooks worked hard to capture the full essence of Truman Capote's take on the murder of the Clutter family.One of the most important aspects of the story that Brooks made sure to keep accurate was the location of the film. All of the scenes took place in the same places where the actual crimes and events had occurred--the same gas station that the real Dick stopped at before picking up Perry, the same store in which the killers bought rope and tape before the murder, the same wild gambling towns that they passed through--Brooks even included people and reporters that had witnessed the real killers being taken to the courthouse after they were caught. His attention to this fine detail aided in the impact of the film. It makes it easier to imagine the events taking place in real life, rather than simply a movie set. The film also helps to portray Dick and Perry's relationship with action and expression. I could especially feel the tension between Dick and Perry when they were in the Clutter's house--Perry was somewhat hesitant and frustrated with how ridiculous Dick was being in his futile attempts to find the safe, and Dick refused to leave until he found the money. Not only was it interesting to see how the actors portrayed their relationship, but I also thought they represented Truman Capote's Dick and Perry well when they were being accused (separately) of murdering the Clutter family. Dick was described in Capote's book as being confident, but he could also easily panic in tense situations. After the detectives mentioned the Clutters, it seemed difficult for Dick to handle the situation, and he no longer could to joke and smile as he had before to cover himself. He also forces all the blame on Perry in his fit of panic--he tells the detectives about the man Perry had supposedly killed before, and that he killed all of the Clutters. In general though, the film tends to focus more on Perry and his past life and thoughts. The way both the film and Capote's book are set up, one almost feels more sympathetic towards Perry. Despite this, Perry is still a criminal. Even at the end of the film, we see more of Perry than Dick, as Dick is executed first. Even Perry's actions add to the tense mood in the end when he is going to be executed--his voice shakes, his eyes fill with fear as he stares up at the noose on the way to The Corner. Overall, the film did an excellent job of bringing the emotion and characters to life from Truman Capote's In Cold Blood.",

It starts out with very menacing music that sets the tone for a story that will cause most viewers to feel a great deal of discomfort.Even though most films by this time were being filmed in color, the director insisted this be shot in black and white - and proved a great decision. It helps under gird the very dark tone of the film. There is a very memorable scene near the end when one of the killers, Perry (Robert Blake) is talking in prison to a preacher. He is silhouetted next to a window with rain falling. The reflection of the rain dripping down the glass forms what looks like tears falling down his face. It was nominated for an Oscar for cinematography but lost to BONNIE AND CLYDE.The film starts out introducing us to the killers and the victims. It keeps switching back and forth between the wholesome, nice Clutter family who are as American as apple pie and the low-life criminals, Perry and Dick. You can't help but feel nervous as you know the fate awaiting this poor, nice family. They really did a good job of building tension in this viewer. The fact that the audience of the day was very familiar with the murders, it meant the plot was little surprise to anyone. But the writer and director still do a good job creating suspense and tension in spite of knowing what is going to happen.Bad language - surprising for an old film from the 60's. Guess it was used to add to the shock value.The Director went to a lot of trouble for authenticity. He wanted to use little known actors in the leads so people would focus on the characters and not the stars playing them. It was filmed on location in the actual town, and even used the house where the murders occurred.There is no doubt to the premeditation and cold-bloodedness that went into these killings. It's shocking to me that film towards the end tries to paint the murderers in a sympathetic light. It reminds me of another similar movie, \"I WANT TO LIVE\", where another criminal (that time a woman, Barbara Graham) was painted in a sympathetic light in order to convict the death penalty instead of the criminal. There is no doubt what the director's intention was when you see the way he closes the film. After the final shot of Perry hanging on the end of the rope, the film closes with a final title screen: IN COLD BLOOD. There's no doubt he's referring to the death penalty, and NOT the senseless killing of the Clutter family. That was pretty cold-blooded to the Clutter family's memory.",

Thus, it's several degrees removed from a typical murder movie or \"slasher\" film because you are able to form some type of identity and sympathy with the victims.  Nearly ten years ago, I had a friend who was senselessly murdered at the age of 41, leaving behind a wife and three young daughters.  The assailants (there were 4 of them) had thought that he would be carrying a large amount of cash (i.e. thousands), but they only made off with a few hundred dollars. While watching IN COLD BLOOD, I was at first relieved that the actual murders weren't depicted.  Then, when they appeared later in the movie as Perry was recreating them for the police, I simply couldn't watch and hit the FF button until they returned to the police car.  Maybe someday I'll go back and watch it, but it was far too real and senselessly brutal for me to endure, not to mention rather \"close to home\" for me personally.

O'Loughlin, James Flavin and John Gallaudet along with Charles McGraw and Jeff Corey as the killers' dads, doomed Clutter patriarch John McLiam and damning district attorney Will Geer...Making IN COLD BLOOD not only a celebration of riveting crime cinema (that'd inadvertently break ground for the likes of THE GODFATHER to TAXI DRIVER to anything by Quentin Tarantino) but a career-defining pinnacle to those character-actor veterans, while providing a springboard for a young Scott Wilson, one of the most intense, focused and uncompromising performers of his generation...And although Robert Blake had been acting since childhood, and was at the start of an adult career that would include both vicious antagonist and idealistic protagonist roles, IN COLD BLOOD remains a peak-combination of both -- especially the finale death-row monologue that... in its own unique, emotionally powerful way... couldn't (and still cannot) be matched.",

            "content": "This adaptation Of Truman Capote's classic book, by Director Richard Brooks is a sad and chilling tale of a violent, callous murder of a family and the eventual execution of the men that committed it. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play Perry Smith and Dick Hickock two criminals that go to the country home of the Clutter family in Kansas looking to rob them. Dick and Perry were misinformed and the Clutters didn't have the $10,000 they were after, just a mere $40. The two heartless killers murder.l Herb Clutter, his wife and two children to avoid being identified, and do so in a violent, and merciless way. The story follows them on the run, and their eventual capture, trial, and execution. The story is a sad one, and it is hard to believe that anyone could be so heinous and callous, but the film was excellent. Blake and Wilson play the criminals perfectly. Their performance make you think they are in fact cold blooded killers, not just actors. The suspense built through the film by not actually showing the crime until later on in the movie via flashback. That was a smart and powerful way to keep the crime somewhat mysterious until you knew the men that committed it. Brooks did a wonderful job directing such a sad tale, by using flashbacks, a good score, and filming in black and white. This film was excellently done.",

            "content": "I'm gradually getting caught up on a lot of the mainstream Hollywood classics, particularly those of the 60s and 70s, that I never got around to. Never saw this one back in the VHS days as it wasn't letterboxed, but this beautiful DVD has no such problem. Indeed, Conrad Hall's gorgeous high-contrast B&W photography is the best thing about this somewhat overlong, amateurishly psychological portrait of the Cutter killings, and their killers, that Truman Capote immortalized in the book on which the film is based. The acting's fine too, particularly by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson (why hasn't he had a more significant career?) as the killers, but the attempts to give context to their horrific night of violence just rang hollow to me. This would not have been a particular problem (we can't explain all crazy human actions just by noting the alcoholism, poverty or violence in their backgrounds) if the film hadn't tried to make this the major point in its look at capital punishment. \"They didn't have a chance to be good\" it seems to be saying, but it doesn't really convince us.That and the obvious, even borderline offensive crosscutting between the would-be-murderers and their victims to draw parallels between them in the early scenes makes the film more than a bit heavy-handed at the get-go (though overall this is the best part of the film) and really fairly tedious and stretched-out by the finish. There are enough good things here to make it worth seeing, but this to me exemplifies a lot of the problems in the well-intentioned high profile Hollywood liberal social dramas of the era, even if the stark photography and (mostly intimated) violence point the way towards a less compromised future. Nice musical score by Quincy Jones, at his peak around this time. DVD rental.",

During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.",

I have actually read the book before seeing this movie and it does a pretty solid job of retelling the events of the book, showing that the two men who are running away from the police are real human beings that have to somewhat cope with the actions that they just commited. They don't reveal who the two men are in the book until the end when their importance is revealed, however in the movie, it is pretty obvious what their importance to the story is and they tie in with the main murders that have taken place.

When I saw the movie, I thought that it was made in 1990s. I was shocked to learn later that it was made in 1967. This movie is a real masterpiece and the second best thriller after Silence of the Lambs. In Cold Blood very cleverly shows how every one is disturbed in their own mind, how a good person can go to the dark side, and how these killings are never going to stop.....

The films storyline stays quite close to that of the main storyline of the book, however key themes have been changed. Instead of having a careful balance between descriptions of the Clutter's lives followed by Dewey's life, and Perry and Dick's lives building to an eventual collision, the film is mostly focused around Dick and Perry. The directors interpretation of one of the messages of the book is also clear to see, dedicating 5-10 minutes on the execution of the prisoners, when in fact the books description lasts only half a page, Brooks obviously wanted a climax for his film, which is why the seen builds up for such a long time. Richard Brooks also chose to leave out the fictionalised meeting between Susan Kidwell and Alvin Dewey at the end of the novel. I think that these changes are a good thing, Brooks is conveying his interpretation of the book. Scott Wilson and Robert Blakes performances were of the highest standard.",

In a true triumph of miscasting, John Forsythe plays the Kansas detective in charge of the investigation of the heinous crime. Forsythe seems to be reading from cue cards. Veteran character actor Paul Stewart plays a writer of some sort, following the case. He is no doubt supposed to be Truman Capote, but he plays it straight, not as a flaming homosexual (which is somehow disappointing!) The oppressively gritty and grainy black and white cinematography is relentlessly depressing, probably the the aim of the film makers. The backgrounds of the killers is also portrayed as dark and gritty. The whole production has the look and feel of a \"B\" movie, a second-billed cheapie.This film has a good reputation.

            "content": "I saw this film when it first came out (I was fifteen at the t\u00edme) and remember that I felt sorry for the character that did not commit any of the murders but was hanged anyhow. You could say that he was the cooler of the two. Now, 35 years later, I see that this character was just as guilty if not more so, pressing the other guy into a frenzy in which he, most hot-bloodedly, kills.But the title 'in cold blood' does not refer to these two killers as I thought first. It refers to the state of USA (or any other state who has capital punishment), that kills methodically, technically and anonymously (the hangman being 'we, the people').It is the difference between hot blood and cold blood. Just picture that a state had capital punishment but that it let relatives of the deceased do the killing. Some would do it in a frenzy, in hot blood, and be over with it. Some others, however, would not do it and regard what happened as a tragic accident, especially in this case, where the killer went into a panic and killed. But the state doesn't feel anything. It kills for political reasons, if it sees fit to do so. The men in power may pardon if that is opportunistic or may kill even in dubious cases as this one, if that is the way to get the voters. That was what this film was about: The cold-blooded murder by the state. Cold-blooded with no feeling whatsoever. In the Haarman-case in Germany in the twenties, Theodor Lessing described how the state let the murderer humiliate the relatives of some of the young boys who were murdered, as part of proceedings. Maybe not deliberately but insensitive of what was going on. Had the state let the relatives retaliate just there and then, then everything would have been so much more humane. But this anonymous killing without feeling, even depriving the relatives of their rightful reaction, is worse than anything.Of course, I am against capital punishment because I consider it as a way of brushing the problem under the carpet to make it disappear. A killed man disappears and the problems connected with him also. Would he live (of course for life in prison) the prisons would have to become larger both in number and in space, so large in the end, that a state such as the USA, finally would have to ask the question, which is long overdue: What kind of a disgrace of a society do we live in, in which a growing percentage of our citizens have to be put behind bars?",

Blake, more or less, played himself; whereas, Wilson seemed deeply entrenched in his role as a street-wise loser who was intimidated, yet sometimes mesmerized by Blake's pseudo-intellectualism.  The author of the book, Truman Capote, wanted \"name\" actors to portray the killers.  Steve McQueen was one mentioned for one of the roles.  However, the director rightly saw that the story outshone the cast, so he made the decision to find two actors who closely resembled the killers.  Capote persuaded him to film the movie in black and white, much like \"Psycho.\"  He also literally \"moved heaven and earth\" to have the Clutter house (the scene of the murders) used.  If you will notice, there are no high profile actors in the film.  This decision was made in order to enhance the idea that the plot was of primary importance in making the movie.  Above it all, Wilson stood out as a relative unknown actor who \"stole the show.\"",

            "content": "Richard Brooks's In Cold Blood shows a film interpretation of Capote's book. I feel that he depicts Dick and Perry accurately as described in Capote's words. Both characters appear the same to me in the In Cold Blood film as they did in the book where Dick shows confidence in his actions but in reality comes across not as battle-hardened as he believes while Perry holds a troubled past that molds his criminal caricature. Dick walks around in the film dressed in business attire using blank checks to get by in life capturing Dick's smooth personality. Nevertheless, Brooks's film shows Dick's pathetic nature when talking with Dick in the privacy of an empty room as he stresses over Perry's \"nonsense\". Perry first appears in the film as a delinquent in jail talking about a heist that will set him for life. His character's outfit looks like a stereotype of a high school delinquent with a leather jacket, greasy black hair, and long jeans. However, throughout the film the director reveals Perry as an innocent person with a troubled past containing violence and trauma that leads him to evolve into a killer. While characterizing Dick and Perry through their appearance and actions, Brooks also builds the story through the sequence of scenes accompanied with background musics to signify the type of scene approaching. The scenes sequence in an order that builds a short back story for Dick and Perry and leads on to when both end up in death row with a few glimpses to effectively explain later scenes. For example, the audience does not get to see the murder of the Clutter family underway until after Dick and Perry head to jail. These glimpses into the past such as the murder and even when Perry remembers his troublesome childhood help explain the story and build an emotional, logical connection with the audience. The music accompaniment helps depict these scenes as people associate music and tones with certain emotions. For example, part way through the movie Dick and Perry travel down the highway and the music begins to speed up to make the audience aware of Perry's anxiety as he remembers his motorcycle accident. Also, at death row the music creates a rhythmic beat as one of the fellow inmates walks towards his sentence at \"the corner\" as the others locked away watch from their cells. Through certain elements such as the sequence of the film's scenes and characterization of Dick and Perry on both an emotional and physical level, I believe Brook's cinematic version of In Cold Blood provides an insightful and clear look into the killers' experience before, during, and after the Clutter family massacre.",

Truman Capote undoubtedly added and exaggerated drama in the book, so it's not a biography, but it's not entirely a novel either. The movie was filmed on location in the actual home where the murders took place, the courthouse, and the gallows. They even used people from the town in certain roles, even featuring the daughter's horse. The photos in the home were actual pictures of the family.The acting and directing were top notch, even by today's standards (this film was released in 1967). The black and white was utilized beautifully and shockingly. The only thing that was bad was the musical score, of course it was on par with the era. You had weird electronic noises mostly, but it was modal. When the family was shown before the murders, the music was pretty, but then the murders was shown, it was grating. It seemed to move to the background through the film, maybe they figured it worked better silent than with an eerie soundtrack.I didn't get to watch the whole movie in one sitting, so I probably didn't get the full effect. For how well together the film was, I think it deserves praise.

Capote spent quite a bit of time interviewing Hickock and Smith before writing their real accounts in the style of a novel. For me, both the novel and film are both over-hyped. I think the original casting choices for the lead roles - Paul Newman and Steve McQueen - would have resulted in a less realistic but definitely more entertaining film. I can't fault Robert Blake or Scott Wilson for poor acting or unfaithful rendition, but only Wilson has a modicum of the charisma to lead such a film in a central role. Blake just mopes and grimaces! Some notoriety may have been gained by Blake because of accusations of the actual 2001 murder of his wife Bonnie Lee Bakeley. Like O.J.Simpson he was found not guilty by the criminal, but guilty by the civil courts. One of the few highlights for me was a small but interesting role for the much underrated noir actor Charles MacGraw as Perry Smith's father.The first half hour of the film moves very slowly and doesn't really engage the viewer. The Quincy Jones score and B&W photography are no way near the far superior Anatomy of a Murder. I was eventually drawn into the story and while I admire the attention to detail, it just doesn't make good cinema. The rain reflection scene really wasn't all its cut out to be. This is a good, realistic film, but no great classic and does drag in portions (especially the beginning).",

To know, you have to watch this masterpiece cinema with no dull moment.It seems to me, the cinematography and the photography are much ahead of their time. And obviously an underrated one. It deserves IMDb top 250.Dick did great than Perry, where they made a great duo.100% Recommended.",

I found it frustrating that Dick wouldn't give up looking for money that wasn't there, and that Perry killed everyone just because he felt the need to. The acting was very well done on Robert Blake's and Scott Wilson's parts. The cinematography was also well done. I saw this movie in black and white, but there were still good examples of cinematography. I remember seeing the scene before Perry was to be hung and he was talking next to the window. I remember how the rain that was going down the window showed up on Perry's face, and how that was a total accidental shot.This movie also gets into the criminal mind. The two characters in the movie have had rough pasts when it comes to parents and family, especially Perry. I think the movie is trying to explain that most criminals do what they do partly because of how they were raised.",

            "content": "Stark, striking pseudo-documentary style, like a Fred Wiseman film, though with some odd defects: some scenes of the detective (John Forsythe) are too dark or low-lit; if this is symbolism, it's inconsistent and inappropriate for the realistic style. People might argue the film does contain symbolism, specifically the famous rain on the window that overlaps onto the face of a fugitive, as if crying for him. However, film photographer Conrad Hall admitted that scene was a serendipitous accident.The time (a year?) the 2 fugitives spent hiding is apparently compressed in a few seconds - one moment it's summer, then snowing, then summer. Then the detective answers the phone and reacts as if no time has gone by when he hears they've reappeared. At the conclusion, the film tacks on an anti-death penalty message by noting how capital punishment is also committed \"in cold blood;\" a comparison too big too late.What I find most remarkable is the similarity to \"Midnight Cowboy\" which was made 2 years later. Both films are about two socially fringe characters - one short, lame dark haired, the other tall and light-haired. One character admires himself in the mirror and has subjective flash-backs, the other is a con man. However, the book \"Midnight Cowboy\" was published a year before the book \"In cold blood.\"  Was \"Midnight Cowboy\" loosely based on the actual murderers, perhaps from newspaper reports? While the characters seems more than accidentally similar, it's a mystery what influenced what.",

There is nothing more horrifying or sexy as your own imagination and this film like many other older films asks you to rely on your brain rather than feed you garbage. I can only hope that hollywood writers and directors can figure out once again learn to direct an emotional or sensational response from an audience rather than throw it in their laps.\nBut the story was bland.

I just got done watching it and still feel there is not enough sympathy for the victims. Could the author be making a statement against capitol punishment? For the time the movie was made, that could be very realistic.    But the movie ends with the hanging of Perry Smith. I have never seen such a graphic hanging in the movies. Those short seconds say something to me. If I feel bad for you or not, you are going to be punished for what you did. Chew on that awhile.    The main complaint I have about the movie is.

Now, I am not an expert on Hollywood movies, but still like to watch movies that makes you rivetted on your seat. But for first 15-20 minutes I had no idea what is going on. Add to it, the main characters continuously using slangs, and I was already uncomfortable in my cosy sofa.I am a generation X'er, and recently exposed to fast paced and slick movies such as Kill Bill, Ocean's Eleven, Matrix to name a few. So this movie obviously tasted my patience. Add to it the stern faced Robert Blake, which continuously reminded me of Sunil Dutt's character in Mother India. I believe that you do not have to remain stiff to play a cold blooded killer.

Also, it is a well-made film.My issue is that the film, like the book, is soft on Perry Smith. He is portrayed in both the book and film as an intelligent, self-taught, and (at times) decent man, which I can accept. On the other hand, he cut the throat of a man and then shot the man and his wife and two children in the heads with a shotgun. Except for the scenes in which the murders are depicted (which probably last less than 30 seconds) when Smith is shown going berserk, neither the film (nor book) portrays Smith as what he was -- a cold-blooded psychopath. Even the murder scenes appear to excuse Smith for his acts because he was having a psychotic episode involving memories of the pain inflicted on him as a child and young man. Well, boo frickin' hoo.We seemed to be being directed to the opinion that Smith was basically a good man that just \"snapped,\" so he can't be blamed for what he couldn't control.So, as a work of historical fiction, both the film and the book it is based on are very good.

            "content": "Based on a true crime turned into a non fiction book by Truman Capote, In Cold Blood is the story of a heinous crime gone wrong. Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock ruthlessly murder the Clutter family, convinced by an ex cell mate that the Clutters have a safe containing $10,000 in their house; they kill all 4 family members walking away with only $43, a pair of binoculars and a radio.I would recommend paying strict attention to this movie if you tend to talk throughout them, there is a lot of scene jumping throughout this movie which builds up to the last 45 minutes. The murder scene is not showed at the beginning but at the end, I was a little bit stunned when the killers walked up to the house and then it cut to a scene of the police arriving at the house, but it adds to the realistic grimness of the last 45 minutes, it makes more of an impact because you are constantly wondering what they did, what happened.The killers drive down to Mexico after the killing, and hold up there for a while before returning to the states where they are captured. In Mexico, Perry has a flashback of his Mother seducing a man in front of her kids, a man proceeds to barge in, whip her and pour alcohol all over her body. These little insights to Perry's background indicate that maybe he was crazy/damaged, his Father or \"The Lone Wolf\" offers detectives stories of Perry as a child and insists he raised him well, Perry on death row tells of a psychotic Father who pointed and shot an unloaded gun at him for eating a biscuit.Perry and Dick waited on death row for 5 years. They were both sentenced to be hung, originally on Friday the 13th. The gallows scene was pretty bad, I sympathized with Blake's character Perry, that and the fact that he was pretty suave and an interesting character with his leather jacket and rockabilly hair. This film made me come away from it feeling sick, in the final scene Perry's body is dangling and the words \"In Cold Blood\" come on the screen. It makes you think about capital punishment, isn't it just as bad as murder? The film looks amazing, has a noir edge to it, it is incredibly dark and at times exudes such a realistic quality that you forget it's a movie. The jazz soundtrack by Quincy Jones reminded me hugely of Angelo Badalamenti and Twin Peaks, (there is even a mention of cherry pie). I found no major flaws to this film, so if you are a goof nerd you will find them on here. I am not going to be picky over a make of guitar or someone saying $40 then $43.

The last twenty minutes or so of the film drag at an excruciatingly slow pace and the random addition of a preachy, heavy-handed narrator almost kills the power of the incredible last shot.

The addition of an ever changing musical soundtrack, ranging from devious and dark to light and happy, clearly set the tone for each and every scene. These varying themes easily showed viewers what was going to happen and gave them a blatant idea of what was going on. Coupled with the darkness of the film itself the soundtrack added a fantastical feeling to some scenes, almost as if in a dream sequence. The addition of a couple dream sequences in and of themselves made the movie seem dreamy in parts, making it difficult to tell what was reality and what wasn't. The acting and portrayal of the main characters, Dick and Perry, was brilliantly done. The complex nature of their relationship showed in the actions and reactions of the two characters, and their motives and feelings, whilst sometimes unclear, revealed themselves in a realistic and 'human' way. The acting was neither under nor overdone, the dramatic and desperate situations were done exactly as they should have been done. Some of the sarcastic comments, and jokes made by Dick and Perry are exactly what two men of that young age would act like, which brings a fantastic sense of realness to the movie, despite the fantastical sequences and music.

Confining the perspective to the victims and perpetrators, only referring to the authorities as a sort of divine or alien third party, would have elevated the tension and the quality of the film overall, especially given how convincing both Blake and Wilson are in their respective roles. Oftentimes the film just feels too overt in its musings, as when two random detectives witnessing the final executions, one young and idealistic, the other a jaded veteran, debate on the pointless nature of the murders and the executions.

It's a gamble, but in the end, I found myself watching the movie's final moments with a quickened pulse and whitened knuckles. Why? Could it be the cinematography? The commendable acting and dialogue? Or could it be that, in depicting every event with such docudramatic flair, Brooks and Co. really, truly succeed in making you feel like an accomplice to the whole thing? Either way, \"In Cold Blood's\" final moments will forever haunt me. Time for a shower.",

It was chosen to be shot in black and white to focus more on the emotional content rather than the visual extravagance though this seems to have an unexpected result that makes the film visually mesmerizing for its time and through out today's standards, it makes me think it may have inspired some of the filming aspects of sin city. All of the actors in this movie brought their A game and are very memorable Robert Blake,\nScott Wilson, John Forsythe and Paul Stewart are all worth mentioning no actor is worth narrowing out though because they all delivered their characters most grandly.

It's extremely heavy going and honest for it's day, and it's amazing a film like this was allowed back in 1967. In November 1959, Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) come up with a plan to rob the home of Herbert Clutter (John McLiam) in Holcomb, Kansas, who is apparantly loaded with money. However, the robbery goes wrong, with Clutter and his wife and two children ending up being murdered in the process. Smith and Hickock go on the run, first to Las Vegas, then they head south and cross the border into Mexico. They're able to stay one step ahead of the law, led by Kansas FBI Chief Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe), who is determined to bring Smith and Hickock to justice, and it's not long before their money starts to run out. It was a murder that shocked America at the time, and it was a matter of time before it would become a film. It makes a good film too with some very good performances to boot, and it almost has a a New Wave feel with it's black and white photography, and it showcases what a good director Brooks was, and his work is in need of another look.",

The film follows the book as closely as you could reasonably expect, while also adding a great deal of cinematic style. While the film isn't usually regarded as a film noir, being based on a true story and everything, it is actually one of the best examples of film noir ever made, at least on a visual level. The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall features some of the best, starkest, most moody black-and-white photography in any movie, ever.

It's only grayscale, so the amount of black and where it falls on the characters, props and background emphasizes everything much more.\n\nThe lighting choices of this film helped bring that eerie feel, especially late at night when the duo is rummaging through the Clutter's house and proceed to kill them. The scene needed to be dimly lit with perfectly cast shadows, and I think the choices were strong and well played. The lighting aspect that struck me most was near the end when Perry was talking to the journalist and about to be hung. He was standing next to a window and it was raining, and with the perfect lighting from outside it projected images of the raindrops rolling down the window onto his face. It looked like he was crying. It was a stirring image that emphasized the moment so much more, a reflection on his past and his regrets. There were multiple times in the film where I loved the lighting and the effect it gave, but this moment was the most brilliant. This was a strong, solid movie and I enjoyed every bit of it.",

There they brutally kill a nice typical American family for kicks.  The events sparked a uproar throughout the country as the police seeked out the murderers.\r\n\r\nLike the Manson case, this brings evil to randomly chosen people.  It frightens us since it shows these events can happen to anyone and by people who look as though they could blend into the crowd easily.\r\n\r\nRobert Blake and Scott Wilson are very good in the leads and director Richard Brooks captures the underlying creepiness and malevolence of the duo perfectly.\r\n\r\nThough it failed to get nominated for best picture.

I will admit that this film was more powerful than any other thrillers I have ever seen. This film comes with the level of Hitchcock classics and Silence of the Lambs. It's not just chilling, but also incredibly realistic. Conard Hall's Black and White Cinematography gave a stunning look to the film. Brooks direction and a smart screenplay takes us directly inside the head of the criminals who pulled the trigger. The fact is that we see the whole film through their eyes and although it seem weird that only these two killers are given the emotional weight, but that's not what it looks like. Brooks takes us to the dark side of Human Nature and this attempts takes us too deep. \n\nIn Cold Blood is lengthy, a little slow and they stretch the story a little bit, otherwise it would have received a perfect score from me. Nevertheless, this film always works in giving you chills and the story, though you might have heard it countless times, is given a more dark look. This is a good film if you want to have a thrilling weekend, but again this is just my personal opinion. Highly Recommended.",

Based on true events, director Richard Brooks patiently and disturbingly paints a picture of two characters who act stupidly and carelessly, concentrating on fulfilling their own shortsighted, selfish desires while senselessly taking away four lives. At times, Brooks seems to be over-sympathizing and romanticizing these two killers, but based on this film as well as the equally phenomenal \"Capote\", it seems like the Perry Smith character (in this case played by Robert Blake) had a heart and was truly sorry for his heinous act of violence. Definitely a little dated, but still a shocking study that remains gritty and arresting throughout. Blake and Scott Wilson (now of \"The Walking Dead\" fame) are utterly fantastic in their respected roles. A movie that definitely should be seen. The only thing that keeps it from being an all-time great is an unnecessary, unfair take on the death penalty, marring an otherwise outstanding second half of the film especially.",

            "content": "The biggest mistake I made in finally watching the classic IN COLD BLOOD was watching it within hours of finishing the book, thus turning what I knew was a highly-praised crime thriller from the late 60s into yet another example in the classic story of \"the movie never lives up to the book.\"  So my first inclination was to basically dismiss the movie.  I wasn't sure that it had anything to offer someone who read the book, so faithful as it is to Truman Capote's masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor this movie, I thought I'd play a game of \"three up, three down.\"  Here are the three main reasons why the movie IN COLD BLOOD is worth your time, folowed by three reasons why it just can't measure up to the book:\r\n\r\n1.  Conrad Hall's cinematography.  His name was the first that jumped out as I began watching...the master who passed away after the one-two punch of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" after a long list of Oscar-nominated work behind the camera.  The scene where rain on a window reflects on Robert Blake's face as tears is something that even non-cinemaphiles would notice.  \r\n\r\n2.  Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.  Both men just LOOK like your vision of Perry and Dick when you read Capote's book.  They are pathetic enough, yet handsome enough.  Obscure enough, yet wild enough.  They're pitch perfect.  Maybe one of the reasons why I thought the film wasn't adding anything to the experience was because these two were almost exactly what I had created in my head for these killers. \r\n\r\n3.  The Clutter family house.  I did not know this when I was watching, but I found out that they filmed this movie in the actual house where the Clutter family was murdered.  How creepy!  That instantly made me appreciate the film more.  You'd never get permission to do something like that today!  Robert Blake said that it was important to not be \"too Hollywood\" about the film by making it somewhere else.  To be watching and know that the place where the actors were tied up and killed was actually where it happened gives one a chill that few crime movies can muster.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fairness, here are three reasons why the film falls short of greatness:\r\n\r\n1.  A voice-over/narrator comes in toward the end.  I think it's supposed to be like the voice of Capote.  It's not needed.  It sends the film off in a different direction than it was going.  And it's out of joint with everything else.  I took that as a sign of weakness in tidying up the film that the director felt that was needed.  It complicated what was otherwise a sparsely-told and filmed story.\r\n\r\n2.  That age old problem of pared-down character development from page to screen causes us to lose a lot of the complexity of the two men.  I know this is to be expected, but it is at the expense of things like Dick's pedophelia and Perry's old Army buddy, who tries to remain his friend.  \r\n\r\n3.  I didn't feel like there was a lot of artistry in the translation, short of moments of Hall's camera brilliance.  With the exception of the trick of Perry seeing his father's face in others (a way of stylizing for the audience the notion that Perry comes from a violent past), everything else in the film is as literally lifted from the book as possible.  Consequently, once you've read the book, there's less of a reason to watch the film.  There's not much of a creative spin put on the material.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the virtual skipping over of the court proceedings, one of the best sections of the book.  And I was also miffed by the toning down of racial prejudice from book to film, but I suspect that was the sacrifice made in 1967 to get it made.  Having said that, I give IN COLD BLOOD a qualified thumbs-up as a classic film worth seeing.  But nowhere near as good as the Truman Capote book!",

Here, writer and director Richard Brook finds a way to translate the book into a genuine motion picture worth seeing.

The book centers on the real life crime where a well-known family of four are brutality murder by two thoughtless individuals, Richard Hickcock and Edward Perry. The film has us following the two before the crime and after their arrest. I have never read the book, but I am sure it is nothing more than brilliant. Here, writer and director Richard Brook finds a way to translate the book into a genuine motion picture worth seeing. He not only shows us the crime and the events that led up to it, but he manages us to get us inside the killers. We get learn about who they are and see their background along with the motivations and complex personalities the two shared. The film then ends with one of the blackest endings ever. Very well told, I enjoyed In Cold Blood a lot and this is the one \"based on a true story\" films that you have to check out.",

It is expertly crafted, a film that so slowly but so steadily increases in emotional and psychological tension until it erupts in the gruesome finale, which, in fact, sent a shiver through my body and practically rendered me speechless. The actors portraying Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, respectively) are a perfect fit, more so than the actors portraying them in \"Capote\" or in the television adaptation of \"In Cold Blood\". They get consistently better throughout the film, as depth is brought to them. As for the direction, I am not all that familiar with the work of Richard Brooks but I am well aware that he is a great director. Here he does an excellent job captivating the dark and dreary Capote novel and transferring it to the big screen. But besides being well-acted and well-directed, \"In Cold Blood\" is a visually captivating film. How it didn't take home the Oscar for Cinematography or even a nomination for Editing is beyond me. One of the main reasons for my liking of this film was because of its striking visuals. For being almost 45 years old, it certainly is a visual achievement.",

            "content": "Unlike the film Gangs of New York, which adapted a spell-binding text and rendered it into conventional Hollywood tripe, In Cold Blood enhances the true crime novel by Truman Capote and brings it to life on the silver screen. The events which permanently altered life in tiny Holcomb, Kansas - and perhaps throughout all small towns in the United States - have been the subject of a true crime novel by Truman Capote, a documentary, television movie and the first widely-distributed American film to use profanity.\r\n\r\nCapote devoted six years to the project, compiling records and minutiae in order to uncover why Perry Smith and Dick Hickock murdered four members of the Clutter family during a botched robbery. Some claim that the book was the first non-fiction work to investigate a crime so thoroughly; others feel that Capote altered details and fabricated facts to suit his purposes.\r\n\r\nThe film is more succinct and streamlined, there are brief cameos by the criminals\u00e2(TM) families but it lacks the meticulous personal histories which help explain the motives behind a seemingly senseless crime. The combination of personal interviews, court documents and parole hearing testimonies reproduced in the book leaves the reader almost sympathetic towards the murderers and the difficult lives they have experienced. Several times during the film, a character may say that \u00e2individually they were hopeless but together they formed some sort of evil sentience\u00e2\u009d (or words to that effect) but the shallow reasoning does complete the puzzle of why this crime occurred in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe crime was subject to national media attention because of its seemingly futile nature. A family was killed for the sum of forty-three dollars, a radio and a set of binoculars. Capote chose to investigate the story further because it represented an attack on traditional values by unknown individuals; the Clutters could have stood in for any family in the country. Hence the major shortcoming of the film: readers know that the murders were the culmination of a lifetime of frustration but viewers only receive the Reader\u00e2(TM)s Digest version.\r\n\r\nStill, the film includes hallmarks of film noir, such as the chaotic jazz score and the grainy black and white footage. The first part of the book establishes how Smith and Hickock are moving inexorably towards the Clutter family -- although they seem to be exact opposites, fate has decided that they are destined to collide. Director Richard Brooks employs jump cuts to establish the parallel between the perpetrators and their victims.\r\n\r\nFate plays a central role in the story as there are numerous chances for the crime to be averted or the criminals to escape persecution. Yet the crime and its aftermath are unavoidable. Often, a bird\u00e2(TM)s eye view follows Smith and Hickock in their car, providing the audience with extra information of which the drifters are not yet aware. Brooks chose to film in black and white, perhaps echoing the news coverage of the event and also signaling that the crime cut short a more innocent time period.\r\n\r\nThe film and the book develop very slowly. We know what has happened but we do not learn the details until later. The climax, a flashback of the murders, is not a surprise but it remains suspenseful nonetheless. The deliberate pace may not suit today\u00e2(TM)s audiences although it is more realistic portray of the crime and subsequent pursuit. Studying the characters becomes as enthralling as watching action sequnces.",

It tells the story of the crime, their capture, and their execution.  It is based on the classic non-fiction novel by Truman Capote, his story has also been made into a movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffman (earning him a Oscar), called \"Capote\".  \n\nI usually don't care much for films with heavy social commentary but it doesn't take anything away from this movie.  While this film hasn't changed my mind about the death penalty, this movie (and I presume the book) make a very strong case against it, without being overly self righteous and annoying as so many other films have, \"Dead Man Walking\", and \"The Life of David Gale\" come to mind.",

Featuring outstanding acting, superb direction, and black-and-white cinematography that can only be described as sublime, In Cold Blood takes us into the heart of senseless violence while simultaneously taking us on a ride through the illogical structure of the American justice system.  Like Capote's novel, the film neither exonerates nor condemns the two killers, but it does take time to demonstrate the many idiosyncratic, inexplicable aspects of the penal system.  While the film never quite evoked the horrors that novel did--probably because it doesn't depict them--it is still a harrowingly realistic portrayal of murder and its punishment.  A powerful exploration of the killer's mind and environment that produces a killer, In Cold Blood was way ahead of its time and remains an American classic.",

What he brought back was the timeless novel In Cold Blood, telling that story and the stories of the two young men that were going to the gallows for that crime.\n\n \n\nI've never read the source material, but I've seen both adaptations of Capote actually researching the novel (Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Infamous with Toby Jones). Both docudramas are powerful pieces in their own right, but it's this film that is a masterpiece. It stars Robert Blake as Perry and Scott Wilson as Dick. These guys have both been to prison, each of them with dreams to follow. The thing about dreams is they need working capital, like a business. So in the dead of the night they follow a prison tale of a farmer and his safe, driving to the rural Kansas home. The next morning the family is dead. No safe. No money. No dreams.\n\n\nWe continue to follow the pair as the haphazardly make their way to Mexico for a little bit, but they come back because those dreams are so damn good. The inevitable happens. They make the mistake and Lady Justice takes over.\n\n \n\nBefore this film there were movies that followed the antagonists point of view, but In Cold Blood makes you sympathize with these two young murderers or in the very least Perry. Here's two men that slaughtered an entire family in their own home and we feel pity for them. They're lifetime losers and this was where the road they shared was heading for a long, long time. They were ticking time bombs. They were two chemicals that mixed together and tragedy followed. \n\n\nThe movie is filmed as bleakly as the characters it shows us. Black and white in 1967 was very rare, but for this film it works for an added effect that would later be used by Scorsese in raging Bull and Spielberg in Schindler's List.There is no color because this life is colorless. There are no bright spots. Darkness is at the end of that tunnel, not that great light that everyone is talking about. This is a very beautiful film from director Richard Brooks.\n\n \n\nThis is one of those wonderful gems from the late 1960's that teetered between the old Hollywood and the new. This was before the ratings system, so hearing the word \"bullshit\" was an awe inspiring experience (this is the first Hollywood production that used it). In Cold Blood is a groundbreaking film that broke new ground and even though it didn't quite open the door for those great films of the 1970's we can say that it turned the latched and cracked it open a bit. This is one of the great films of the '60's.",

Having seen Capote and read In Cold Blood, I can easily say that this film did the book justice (Capote was released after this one as you all know). This film was fantastic. I really liked the use of black and white filming. It gave the film a...well, I'm not sure how to describe it, but this film would not have worked nearly as well if it was in color. I liked the two lead actors as well. I feel that they effectivley carried the film and captured the personalities of the two killers. I would highly suggest this film to anyone. It is a fantastic film. \r\n\r\n\r\nTRIVIA TIME: 1. To get the authenticity he wanted, Richard Brooks  filmed in all the actual locations including the Clutter house (where the murders took place) and the actual courtroom (6 of the actual jurors were used). Even Nancy Clutter's horse Babe was used in a few scenes. The actual gallows at the Kansas State Penitentiary were used for filming the executions, however, in a 2002 interview, Charles McAtee (who was State Corrections Director for Kansas in the 1960's), clarified the hangman in the film was an actor, not the real deal. \r\n\r\n2. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson were not the first choices to play the cold-blooded murderers. Studio heads at Columbia Pictures originally wanted Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the lead roles. Newman chose instead to star in Cool Hand Luke and Hombre that year; McQueen worked on The Thomas Crown Affair and Bullitt. \r\n\r\n3. The two pairs of eyes pictured on the movie poster are those of the real killers, not the actors portraying them.

Like film noir, the movie has a dark visual look and even darker subject matter to go with it, but unlike noir, the mystery surrounding the crime is not \"who?\" or \"what?\", but \"why?\". Few crime films have ever managed to make that question so overbearing and relevant has this one, and Brooks achieves it by keeping the focus on the two criminals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 brought to life with astonishing humanity by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before and after their notorious act. Instead of showing us the graphic staging of the murders early in the film when they would chronologically occur, Brooks instead cuts directly to the discovery of the bodies the morning after (as chilling a scene as you ever will see) and saves the killings as the climax, having allowed the audience to explore the psyches of the killers after committing the deed. This simple but ingenious restructuring of the book's narrative flow may not make it any easier to accept the senselessness of such violence (nor should it), but it does bring us a bit closer to understanding that enigmatic question of \"why?\". \"In Cold Blood\" is all the more hair-raising for its stark realism, shot in news reel black-and-white by the brilliant Conrad L.

            "content": "Richard Brooks brings to life the classic non-fiction novel written by Truman Capote. It is carefully thought out in the writing and the way he directs it. Both of the leads do a great job of portraying their characters but it is Robert Blake that shines through his sympathetic portrayal of Perry Smith. The b&w cinematography is amazing. Each shadow cast on the characters' faces so great. Unfortunately the great Conrad Hall didn't win the Oscar that year, it going instead to Bonnie and Clyde which did deserve it as well. Quincy Jones' jazzy score highly supports what is going on the screen and during the opening credits together with the beautiful b&w cinematography makes it feel as if you're watching some kind of film noir. Also the editing is fantastic the way it juxtaposes some shots with others back to back. In my opinion it was also robbed of an Oscar nomination for that category.\nIn Cold Blood is certainly one of the best adaptations and one of the greatest films of all time and very much important. All this and coming out in one of the greatest years in the history of cinema. Other great films that came out in 1967: 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her, The Battle Of Algiers, Belle De Jour, Bonnie and Clyde, Closely Watched Trains (Ostre Sledovan\u00c3\u00a9 Vlaky), Cool Hand Luke, The Dirty Dozen, The Graduate, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, In the Heat Of the Night  Playtime, Point Blank, Le Samoura\u00c3\u00af, and Week End.

            "content": "On November 15, 1959, a peaceable farmer, his wife, and his son and daughter were murdered in the sleepy whistle stop town of Holcomb, Kansas. As homicide goes the Clutter case was particularly gruesome-- a 12 gauge shotgun was the principal murder weapon.\r\n\r\nIt was the stuff of sober radio broadcasts, grim TV reporters, sensational headlines, and bestselling tell all nonfiction accounts. The latter, IN COLD BLOOD, was the work of journalist-cum-author Truman Capote, who penned a chilling, if verbose, account of the tragedy. What might have been a \"mmm, that's terrible\" of a Sunday morning's paper was instead immortalized, ostensibly forever. \r\n\r\nI read (or rather, heard) the novel on a long Christmas car ride-- not exactly the merriest entertainment, but nonetheless riveting. Painstakingly describing anything with any connection at all to the murder, Capote paints a vivid picture indeed. Naturally, I wanted to see how his portrait of the tragedy matched up with the monochrome filmic one.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, surprisingly, that I got to thinking of as IN COLD BLOOD started was the sound of it. The film begins with a jazz number, all trombones chuffing and rhythmic thumps and pulses, and intercut-- can I say, masterfully?-- with the squeals of a bus and a train's shriek. \r\n\r\nWe see a jumble of images and a loose thread of a plot starts to develop-- one man, Perry (on the cover the one in the foreground, also the one most focused on in the movie) has gotten out of jail and, from his feverish uneasiness and too-rapid movements, is expecting to meet someone. One collect call later, hopes are dashed and plans are set anew. \r\n\r\nPlans, it turns out, that will be the undoing of six lives-- two guilty, four innocent. Perry meets a guy he knew, briefly, behind bars, in anticipation of a newly minted stratagem. The perfect score, buddy Dick assures his worry-prone companion, with an emphasis on the words \"no witnesses.\" \r\n\r\nBehind the camera is a no name director, Richard Brooks, who's entirely credible filmography reveals a number of stage and screen adaptions and tersely written melodramas-- chief among them being the high school classic BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and sizzling Newman vehicle CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. For a novel adaption, Brooks proves himself a ballsy guy in the direction department. There are plenty of interesting angles and fast edit flourishes, enough to keep the armchair cinematographer well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe pacing, criticized in some circles as slow, is indeed that at times-- but in more of a \"slow burn\" kind of way. On my end, a solid two hour movie is most often a treat, as it provides the opportunity to become invested in the characters and atmosphere of a well made film. \r\n\r\nAlthough the sequence of events, as in the novel, is jumbled up, there seems to be an insinuation that this time, justice will be served, and two guilty men will take a ride on, as Dick glibly terms it, the \"big swing.\" With that in mind, the film is a giant lead-up to the hanging, a chilling scene that is masterfully realized.\r\n\r\nAlong the way we meet a host of characters-- neighbors, family members, fellow travelers, FBI men, and the Clutters-- a wholesome, well- liked family that sadly, really were murdered. Brooks' depiction of the cold blooded killers is just that, cold, and there are no attempts to defend or glorify the heinous men.\r\n\r\nWhile not all may enjoy the dark IN COLD BLOOD, and it is not necessarily a must see in my mind, it is nevertheless recommended viewing for those so inclined. As a novel adaption, and as a stand alone film, the final product is a chilling true to life account that will stick in your mind, for better or for worse.",

            "content": "The biggest mistake I made in finally watching the classic IN COLD BLOOD was watching it within hours of finishing the book, thus turning what I knew was a highly-praised crime thriller from the late 60s into yet another example in the classic story of \"the movie never lives up to the book.\"  So my first inclination was to basically dismiss the movie.  I wasn't sure that it had anything to offer someone who read the book, so faithful as it is to Truman Capote's masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor this movie, I thought I'd play a game of \"three up, three down.\"  Here are the three main reasons why the movie IN COLD BLOOD is worth your time, folowed by three reasons why it just can't measure up to the book:\r\n\r\n1.  Conrad Hall's cinematography.  His name was the first that jumped out as I began watching...the master who passed away after the one-two punch of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" after a long list of Oscar-nominated work behind the camera.  The scene where rain on a window reflects on Robert Blake's face as tears is something that even non-cinemaphiles would notice.  \r\n\r\n2.  Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.  Both men just LOOK like your vision of Perry and Dick when you read Capote's book.  They are pathetic enough, yet handsome enough.  Obscure enough, yet wild enough.  They're pitch perfect.  Maybe one of the reasons why I thought the film wasn't adding anything to the experience was because these two were almost exactly what I had created in my head for these killers. \r\n\r\n3.  The Clutter family house.  I did not know this when I was watching, but I found out that they filmed this movie in the actual house where the Clutter family was murdered.  How creepy!  That instantly made me appreciate the film more.  You'd never get permission to do something like that today!  Robert Blake said that it was important to not be \"too Hollywood\" about the film by making it somewhere else.  To be watching and know that the place where the actors were tied up and killed was actually where it happened gives one a chill that few crime movies can muster.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fairness, here are three reasons why the film falls short of greatness:\r\n\r\n1.  A voice-over/narrator comes in toward the end.  I think it's supposed to be like the voice of Capote.  It's not needed.  It sends the film off in a different direction than it was going.  And it's out of joint with everything else.  I took that as a sign of weakness in tidying up the film that the director felt that was needed.  It complicated what was otherwise a sparsely-told and filmed story.\r\n\r\n2.  That age old problem of pared-down character development from page to screen causes us to lose a lot of the complexity of the two men.  I know this is to be expected, but it is at the expense of things like Dick's pedophelia and Perry's old Army buddy, who tries to remain his friend.  \r\n\r\n3.  I didn't feel like there was a lot of artistry in the translation, short of moments of Hall's camera brilliance.  With the exception of the trick of Perry seeing his father's face in others (a way of stylizing for the audience the notion that Perry comes from a violent past), everything else in the film is as literally lifted from the book as possible.  Consequently, once you've read the book, there's less of a reason to watch the film.  There's not much of a creative spin put on the material.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the virtual skipping over of the court proceedings, one of the best sections of the book.  And I was also miffed by the toning down of racial prejudice from book to film, but I suspect that was the sacrifice made in 1967 to get it made.  Having said that, I give IN COLD BLOOD a qualified thumbs-up as a classic film worth seeing.  But nowhere near as good as the Truman Capote book!",

Hickock poses as the macho alpha male but ultimately cracks under pressure while Smith seems submissive until his violent, impetuous side comes out.\n\nThe juxtapositions Brooks uses - especially during the film's magnificent first hour - between the doomed Clutter family, their fated killers, and the police investigation to find Smith and Hickock give the film a dynamic quality missing from other, fictional cinematic tales of life on the lam (like Terence Malick's contemporary movie, \"Badlands\").",

            "content": "I still haven't gotten around to reading the book, I'm afraid.  I meant to after I'd finished [i]Capote[/i], and I didn't.  Perhaps I'll have watched it by the time we get to [i]Infamous[/i], the other telling of Truman Capote's version of events.  Because, of course, pretty much what we have is Truman Capote's version of events, and how accurate you consider that has a lot to do with what you think of Capote.  (Frankly, I shall always think of him as a fat little man in a red suit; thank you, 'Bots.)  There are certain bare facts that cannot be changed; Herbert, Bonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon Clutter are dead.  (Herein played by John McLiam, Ruth Storey, Brenda C. Currin, and Paul Hough.)  Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) killed them and were executed by the state of Kansas for their actions.  For the rest, we must look to what Capote got out of them and what can be gleaned from other sources.  And here, of course, Capote is our main source, since the movie is, at least in theory, based on his book.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick Hickock was in prison, his cellmate, Floyd Wells, told him that Wells had once worked for a Kansas farmer named Herbert Clutter.  Clutter, Wells claimed, had a safe with a great deal of money in it.  It would be an easy job for anyone with the will to accomplish it.  So Hickock and a prison friend, Perry Smith, cross into Kansas, breaking Smith's parole, and seek out the Clutter farm in Holcomb, Kansas.  Wikipedia describes the murders of the Clutters as part of the plan unraveling, but it's clear from the outset that the Clutters will not live through the night.  After all, Hickock says repeatedly that they will leave no witnesses.  What [i]is[/i] an unforeseen event is that Herbert Clutter had no safe.  He made as many transactions as possible by check, and all in all, there was some $40 in the house.  Hickock and Smith took off on a career of frankly stupid crimes, mostly check fraud, and are eventually captured in part because they are driving a stolen car.\r\n\r\nWe'll stick to the facts of the Clutter case, here, tempting though it may be to drift into Blake's own murder trial.  However, I think there is enough material about Hickock and Smith to occupy, well--it's said that Capote amassed 8000 pages of research, and I'm only trying to fill five paragraphs.  Part of the chilling aspect of the film, in fact, is the possibility that these men may well be sociopaths.  I've read some speculation that at least Smith was probably schizophrenic.  Apparently, Capote indicated that the men might not have been entirely repsonsible for their own actions.  It is also, however, indicated that no psychological evidence was presented at the trial by either side.  Obviously, as I've never read the book, there's only so much I know about the case.  It's possible that the punishment--even without going into death penalty arguments--was too severe, and that the men could not have formed intent.  It's an interesting speculation, anyway.\r\n\r\nMentally ill they may have been, but all that bright Smith and Hickock were not.  The decision to leave no witnesses was, in and of itself, not the smartest decision that could have been made.  The original plan to disguise themselves with black stockings would have made it possible to avoid the gallows.  Further, making their escape by writing bad checks just left a paper trail that was easier to follow.  The escape to Mexico wasn't a bad idea, but the return to the US was.  And at the heart of the story, it seems to me unlikely that trusting a random cellmate about the location of a $10,000 payoff was a good idea.  I don't know for certain that there was malicious intent there; in fact, I rather doubt it.  But I am given to understand that jailhouse stories are prone to exaggeration, and this one seems more likely, given Clutter's propensity for writing checks, to have been an outright lie.\r\n\r\n1967 was a curious year in film.  [i]The Graduate[/i] beat [i]In Cold Blood[/i] for Best Director.  [i]Bonnie and Clyde[/i] (which you won't see here, because I hate that movie) beat it for Cinematography.  [i]Thoroughly Modern Millie[/i] won for Original Score.  [i]In the Heat of the Night[/i] won for Adapted Screenplay.  The five movies really have very little in common with one another except the year they came out.  In feel, [i]In Cold Blood[/i] is the oldest.  It's from the same year as the others, but it does project a '50s mentality.  In that sense, it captures the time it's supposed to quite well.  The Clutter murder is a hint at the darker side of an era we see as wholesome, and I think it does very well at that.",

One may even quibble about how Smith and Hickock are both careless criminals, but in reality, they [i]do[/i] exist. There is one precise scene that gives an impression of being an out of place; when both Perry and Dick pick up two hitchhikers. However, through the eyes of their parent, is when we see somewhat of a compassionate nature with these two convicted felons. Also, Perry Smith's flashbacks, make him less-menacing. These events of his unpleasant childhood memories are melancholic. Even Conrad L. Hall's ([i]American Beauty[/i]) cinematography, similarly adds an unambiguously bleak tone. The film succeeds brilliantly when Brooks focuses on the two criminals' backgrounds, not to see them entirely as monsters; how \"neither one of them would have done it alone.

Check out CAPOTE and INFAMOUS which explains part of Capote's fascination for this case from a personal perspective. The film's final half hour is brilliant!",

And the murders committed weren't quick or right on the spot.  How can they have done this without being disturbed people, or monsters, or anything?  That's more haunting than anything else.",
