            "content": "This film shows what a director can do with some good actors and a good script. It takes Audrey Hepburn to turn this into a great film. Her vulnerable blind woman, at the mercy of a group of drug traffickers, is amazing. Alan Arkin, who sometimes plays comic victims, is outstanding as a true psychopath. He doesn't want the hidden drugs. He wants power over everything. He'd be the last guy a group of organized criminals would want on their side. But they've got him and they need to cater to him. The movie is about situations as Audrey Hepburn must defend herself, once she realizes this is necessary. She knows the house and knows that in darkness she has a chance. Still, she weighs about eighty pounds and has probably never confronted someone physically in her life--and she can't see her attackers. I'll tell a little story. There's a scene where a towel on top of a refrigerator hangs down so the door can't close. The woman must darken the room, but the light in the refrigerator is going to stay on until the towel is removed. A friend of mine saw this movie with his family, and when this happened, his mother, a real character, stood up and screamed: \"Pull the towel out of the door.\" The whole family disappeared under their seats and denied the existence of this woman.As far as suspense goes, I can't think of a movie (and that includes every slasher movie I've seen) that has such sustained terror as this one.",

            "content": "To be blind, deprived of the power even to see the danger that threatens you, is a frightening experience... It also, obviously, gave director Terence Young the opportunity to carry out one of the most important rules of suspense: let the audience discover more than the principal character...When we can see imminent danger which the victim, by definition, cannot see, the emotional impact is increased on the viewer... We desire earnestly to cry out in warning, but we cannot... We can only sit helplessly, and wait to see what become apparent... And when the sightless is a young and lovely woman, there are many twists and turns, disturbing moments, claustrophobic atmosphere, great suspense...Most of the drama is played out in Hepburn's apartment in NewYork, and there is an outstanding development when Susy Hendrix (Hepburn), alone with her telephone cord cut and awaiting the return of the gangs, decides to use her disadvantage as a defensive weapon... Her one advantage in being blind was that she required no light\u0097and she methodically destroyed all the light-bulbs...After three brutal murders, only the master-criminal, a merciless villain (Alan Arkin) is left to confront her\u0085 He selected the most terrifying way of terrorizing her... Susy lost her sight in a car crash or really the fire from the crash\u0085 Audrey Hepburn earned her 5th and final Academy Award nomination for her brilliant performance",

            "content": "In \"Wait Until Dark\", I really felt sorry for Audrey Hepburn's Susy Hendrix: blind, lied to by a 'nice' guy who is actually in cahoots with a murderer, sassed by the bespectacled neighbor girl, and then--after a hellish night spent being terrorized by thugs--husband Efrem Zimbalist Jr. walks in and doesn't even give her a hand. \"I'm over here, Susy\", he tells her, mildly condescending. Film is based on Frederick Knott's popular play, and has an elaborate but obtuse set-up involving a missing doll filled with heroin. There's a great deal of talk about where it is, who had it last, etc. The filmmakers bide their time before getting to the showdown between Hepburn and Alan Arkin, cool and collected as a self-assured psychopath. If you can make it through the first half-hour or so, you'll find that \"Wait Until Dark\" gets cooking thereafter. There are some terrific jolts, and Hepburn is a great, stubborn fighter. The frosty, subdued color photography is 'realistic' and very stylish, as is Henry Mancini's spooky music. The end-credits theme song (by Mancini, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans) seems a throwaway, but is nicely sung by the uncredited Sue Raney. *** from ****",

Some guys terrorize a blind lady in her apartment--how interesting can that be?! Well, I finally broke down and saw it--and I was really surprised. The film had MUCH more depth than I'd suspected and it was amazingly taut thriller.The film begins with an old man sewing some heroin into a doll. The doll is then taken aboard a plane by a lady and she convinces a nice guy (Efram Zimbalist Jr.) to carry it for her. Later, some very evil men come to get the doll--and the trail has led to Zimbalist's home. But he and his blind wife (Audrey Hepburn) have no idea what's going on nor that their lives are in danger. Now here is where it gets interesting. The three criminals (Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna and Jack Weston) decide that instead of just bursting in the place and ransacking it, they'll run a scam on the blind woman--and that is where the film gets REALLY interesting. I'd say more, but don't want to spoil the suspense. However, the film gets really, really creepy and the plot offered man surprises because it was so intelligently written. A few things I liked was the interesting child in the film (very unusual and different) and the wild ending. Overall, I major surprise to me and one of Hepburn's better films.",

Three men will do whatever it takes to get the doll. At first they try to trick her. When this doesn't work, they resort to violence.The con the three men attempt to work on Susy is amazing to watch unfold. They come to her one at a time with a story that slowly unfolds. They force Susy to believe that her husband was involved with a murder of a woman and that finding the doll is the only way to save him. The con reaches a point where Susy would do anything to get rid of the doll. But they push their luck a little too far and Susy starts to suspect that something is wrong. The con men believe they could pull one over on her because she is blind, but that doesn't mean she is stupid. Wait Until Dark may not be a traditional horror movie, but the final fifteen minutes or so with Susy and Roat alone in the darkened apartment are as gut-wrenching as I've ever seen. The horror comes from the situation Susy is faced with, the fact that we already know what Roat is capable of, and Susy's fragility and blindness. Together, these factors make for a very exhilarating ending.The acting in Wait Until Dark is phenomenal. I cannot tell you how impressed I was with Audrey Hepburn playing the blind Susy Hendrix. I bought her \"blind act\" from the first moment she appeared on screen. I'm not surprised that Hepburn was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. And Alan Arkin is so deliciously psychotic as Roat. You really get the feeling he is capable of anything. Richard Crenna and Jack Watson are also quite good as the other two con men.",

The really creepy aspect comes when oily thug Harry Roat (Alan Arkin) gets into her confidence.This is one of those movies that will probably make you suspicious of the people around you.

            "review_title": "on the nature of mounting fear",
            "content": "Two points of view of this film come to mind as I start to figure out how to report on my reaction to it, although neither opinion affects mine to a large extent (only in understanding how the film is in relation to the points made). One is by Roger Ebert and the other is by Stephen King. The latter says, point blank, that it's the scariest film ever and that Alan Arkin's steely performance as Roat is the \"greatest evocation of screen villainy ever.\" The former is Ebert's point about the \"idiot plot\", which many of us have seen in movies of dramatic and thriller and romantic comedy varieties, where a character or characters could get out of the predicament or just general situation they're in by saying something or calling someone or, in this case, locking a door. I can argue both of these opinions- Ebert's since it's not entirely an idiot plot (Susy has some complex reasons for not alerting the police when she can with the young girl, albeit she tries to call via operator before disconnection), and King's since, frankly, it's not totally scary by today's standards and Arkin, while really brilliant, has been topped over time.But so much of this picture works so well because the writing is focused on characters in a set-up situation that unfolds like a game. Other plays do this, especially those with thriller elements like Sleuth where a personal side is brought into a criminal plot (there it was an affair used as a catalyst for jewel thievery, this time the absence of a woman's husband, and hints about his infidelity, to goad a woman to reveal the location of a quasi-MacGuffin). Wait Until Dark's strength is to build upon the fear not just of this character but the audience's as well. A home is a personal place, and these people- Roat, Mike and Carlino- keep coming in and out like it's nothing (well, a BIG money nothing), exploiting Susy's recently acquired blindness. Almost anyone watching the film has some dread of someone breaking into the home and stealing something, anything really. That in this case it's a doll loaded with heroin and there's a double-cross and murder in the first twenty minutes makes things a bit more complicated.Point is, there's something relatable, frightening in a not-so abstract way, about the danger Susy is in. That she's blind gives a great sort of hitch to her knowing all that's going on until the young girl tells her, no, there are no cops really outside, and yes, that man kind of looks familiar, and that phone booth too. The palpable tension builds as we sense there's little Susy can do about what's happening as so much of this game has been put into place by Roat, even without the sharp Mike (a very cool pre-Rambo Crenna) and not-always sharp Carlino knowing everything either. And Arkin creates this very sinister being kind of like a pre-Chigurh figure, perhaps with a touch of Quilty from Kubrick's Lolita. The guy is a master of disguise, and dresses up like various Roat's to try and get information from Susy, or to get her doubting or build her suspicions up. At the same time he's crafty in a costume, he's so evil that one suspects he'd kill his own mother for the doll of heroin. With his sunglasses on at night.Arkin gets that cold presence out- worthy of an Oscar which sadly he didn't receive in a prestige year- and Hepburn is good as always as playing a vulnerable but not stupid wife who can be terrorfied but knows what to do when she feels provoked. It's strong acting from everyone in the film (save perhaps for that young girl who, as young actors do, is weak in a role that is little more than a plot device), and while it takes a little bit to get started with the story, once it settles into that night with Susy all alone, it gets very tense. It's a thriller that is about the good and evil squared head-on with people, and the gray areas that come out when manipulation becomes the name of the game. Late in the film Roat says that his co-horts have \"Comic-Book minds\". It might depend on the comic-book, or how they figure in the real world. 9.5/10.",

            "content": "Since first leaning of it from the audio commentary by Alan Jones and Kim Newman for The Bird With The Crystal Plumage (1970-also reviewed) this has been a title I've been very interested in seeing, but have just not been able to find. Picking up the DVD at a good price during the early Easter sales,I got set to wait until dark for a viewing.View on the film:Taking place in one apartment for 90% of the runtime, director Terence Young brings his skills of staging explosive Action set-pieces in 007,to the nail-biting Home Invasion Thriller,with Young pushing the camera right to the back of Susy's apartment,which gets filled with a claustrophobic atmosphere,as Young surrounds Susy with a terrifying trio of thugs.Previously working with the lead actress on Charade (1963) cinematographer Charles Lang closely works with Young in bringing a proto-Giallo psychological terror to the mind-games, via striking shards of light coming from the shutters on the window,and through the darkness of Susy's world.Charged by a spine-tingling score from Henry Mancini, Young unleashes a magnificent final shock,which jumps directly towards the audience,to confront them with what Susy must fight against.Working the year earlier together as writers on the film Kaleidoscope (1966), Robert Carrington & Jane-Howard Hammerstein's adaptation of Frederick Knott's play, break the limited stage-bound settings with a excellent character study of Susy, whose blindness can not hide her increasingly fearful doubts over who is actually in her apartment.Giving just a small sliver to their backgrounds, the writers cleverly use limited trips outside the apartment to give glimpses of the hand the thieves are playing, which superbly makes the mind-games the thugs (who include a gritty,threatening Alan Arkin) for Susy to take part in,be ones played on a knife edge.Meeting Young when at 16-year-old she was working a volunteer nurse in a Dutch hospital where Young was treated after he got injured in the battle of Arnhem, Audrey Hepburn gives a mesmerizing turn as Susy,whose walking on egg shells fear turns into fight or flight,as the thieves wait until dark.",

            "content": "Before watching this film the only thing I knew about it was that it starred Audrey Hepburn and when the opening scene showed a woman named Lisa boarding a plane with a doll filled with heroin I thought the action was going to take place somewhere exotic\u0085 I couldn't have been more wrong! Lisa flew to New York and on arrival gave the doll to a stranger at the airport. We later learn that this was because she hoped to get it back later and keep the contents for herself. That is the last we see of her\u0085 alive. The action then switches to a New York apartment where two men go looking for Lisa; they don't find her but the do meet a sinister man who gives his name as Roat. He tells them that they must get the doll back from the man from the airport or he will ensure that they take the blame for Lisa's murder. The apartment belongs to the man and his wife Susy. While they are there Susy returns but does not see them: it turns out that she is blind. She goes out again and when she returns one of the men comes back claiming to be her husband's friend Mike from his days in the Marines. After he has earned her trust Roat and the other man start making visits setting up a story that makes it look as if her husband is implicated in Lisa's murder and that finding the doll and disposing of it is the only way to prevent the police from arresting him. Susy doesn't believe that her husband would do such a thing but they manage to convince her that the circumstantial evidence will be enough.Set almost entirely in one room of Susy's apartment this is a tense thriller that has a constant sense of menace; especially when Roat is about. The one room setting gives the film a claustrophobic feeling that is amplified by Susy's blindness. Audrey Hepburn did a good job as Susy although she did occasionally move a bit faster than one might expect of a blind person, Richard Crenna was good as Mike; we knew he wasn't a good man but the viewer could be excused for thinking he really cared about Susy and Alan Arken was delightfully sinister as Roat. If you are looking for a good tense thriller without too much wild action you could do a lot worse than this. It may get a little melodramatic at the end but for the most part the tension is excellently maintained by the dialogue and how it is delivered not through violence.",

Anyway, this film is the ultimate in suspense. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for each new twist, and was not sure if the bad guys would win or not!

One other person's comments was titled \"The best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made\". It think that is very true. Most of the film is shot within this basement apartment unit. And the thriller is so great because of Hepburn being blind and these three bad guys freely walking into her unit and introducing themselves as her husband's friends, or police, or some neighbour. But they all forget one thing: She uses her ears like no regular person does, she doesn't need eyes. But that is where the thriller kicks in. Sometimes it is pretty painful for us to watch (us who can see) because she seems so vulnerable. Wrapping around of all this is Henry Mancini's music. He is using a technique that he also used in the film \"Night Visitor\" where there is this melody on the keyboard and after everynote there is the detuned note following it. Pretty cool effect. One thing I didn't get though, There is a scene where the room looks pretty dark and Alan Arkin still has his sun glasses on. I loved this film, 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "WAIT UNTIL DARK is one of those expert stage plays that's translated beautifully to film. It's the classic one-room story, proving that you don't need endless changes of location to keep a film varied, interesting, and light-footed, and it has a wonderful script that segues from light-hearted humour and interaction to a deadly serious game of survival. In many ways, this is a film made before its time. Audrey Hepburn is the tough woman-in-peril a full twelve years before Ellen Ripley made the character a stereotype, and the climatic, well-remembered shock sequence in which Alan Arkin returns from the dead neatly prefigures the endless recycling of the villains in the likes of '80s slasher fare such as Friday the 13th.It's one of those films which is pure entertainment to watch. Everything is spot on: the acting, the set, the script, the music. There's no rush to get on with the plot in hand, no grated-on action sequences, just endless suspenseful moments, a growing mystery, and punctuations of twists and turns that never disappoint. Audrey Hepburn, lovely in the role of the blind woman being stalked by three sinister figures, is perfectly cast and never fails for a moment to convince that she's a disabled woman. Of the rest of the cast, it's Alan Arkin who steals the scenes with his evil-personified persona of 'Roat', and Richard Crenna who excels as one of the bad guys who actually turns out to be not so bad after all.Things gradually build up to a fitting crescendo, a pay-off that fits the bill perfectly and ends the film as it could only be ended. Only one thing surprises me: that Hitchcock didn't direct this. I'm not saying Terence Young did a bad job, just that if Hitchcock had directed it then many more people would remember it today than they do now. It's a shame, as this is every bit as good as some of the master film-maker's mystery movies.",

            "content": "I went into Wait Until Dark with high expectations, due to what I've heard; but the film didn't meet them...it massively surpassed them! Honestly, I really can't praise this slick thriller enough - but I'm certainly going to try! What makes Wait Until Dark so brilliant is not the acting, the characters or even the plot; it's the claustrophobic setting. As the film is based on a stage play, most of the action takes place in just one setting - the apartment of Suzy, a blind woman. Director Terence Young makes best use of this fact to make the film what it is, as we are always focused on Suzy's living space, and through closed camera movements and the way that Young shows what is going on outside the apartment from the inside; we are really able to get into the world of the paranoid and frightened blind woman at the core of the story. The story itself features a crook named Roat, played by the underrated Alan Arkin, who has lost a doll containing heroin. After finding out it's made it's way into Suzy's apartment; the man recruits two fellow criminals, and together the men spin a web of lies to finally get Suzy to hand over what they want.Wait Until Dark is a constantly fascinating film that is as exciting as it is intelligent throughout. Despite spending a lot of it's running time on the story surrounding the crooks and the doll; the film still finds time to build a character for Suzy, and you will not be able to do anything but get behind her as you watch her being tricked by the criminals. It's dramatic irony at it's finest! Earlier on I said that the acting is not what makes the film great - and it's not - but the fine performances certainly don't hinder it! Audrey Hepburn gives what is maybe the finest performance of her career as the star of this film. Playing a blind character can't be easy, but Hepburn ensures that she is always believable in the role and massively impresses throughout. She is joined by the excellent and underrated Alan Arkin, who gives a suitably demonic performance as Roat; the leader of Suzy's attackers. His understated evil blends well with his rather odd demeanour and on the whole, I can't understand why he hasn't gone on to become more famous. Richard Crenna and Jack Weston complete the cast, as Roat's henchmen, and both do a good job as the men deceiving Suzy.Wait Until Dark is a unique film, as there aren't that many covering the topic of blind people, and there's even less in the thriller genre. The best is really made of Suzy's affliction too, and the film gives us something of an insight as to what it means to be blind. I really liked the way that the film didn't portray our heroine as a completely helpless individual too; despite the fact that she's massively disadvantaged, Suzy is always shown as being a resourceful woman. The way that the film implants you into it's story is fabulous and the tagline - \"The blinds moving up and down...the squeaking shoes...and then the knife whistling past her ear...\" gives you an idea of what you're in for. Young has given the film a great attention to detail, and taps into the fact that blind people have more acute senses of hearing and smell by way of several sequences that see Suzy outwit her opponents. The film's true brilliance comes towards the end - and the climax to the film is beautifully poetic. On the whole, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's unfair that the film hasn't been blessed with a more suitable status since it's release in 1967, and for that reason and many more - you absolutely must see this film!",

Susy finds herself being terrorized by three criminals led by vicious psycho Roat (a supremely creepy and credible portrayal by Alan Arkin) who want to regain possession of a heroin-stuffed doll that they believe Susy has stashed away in her apartment.Director Terence Young, working from a compact and compelling script by Robert Carrington and Jane-Howard Hammerstein, relates the gripping story at a steady pace, builds plenty of nerve-wracking tension, makes fine use of the claustrophobic apartment setting, and pulls out the heart-pounding stops for the harrowing climax in which Roat stalks Susy in her darkened abode. Hepburn does an ace job of playing an extremely appealing, gutsy, and resourceful damsel in distress. Moreover, there are sound supporting contributions from Richard Crenna as smooth and ingratiating hood Mike Talman, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as nice guy photographer Sam Hendrix, Jack Weston as sleazy corrupt cop Carlino, Samantha Jones as ill-fated mule Lisa, and Julie Herrod as gawky teenage girl Gloria. Charles Lang's crisp cinematography provides a pleasing polished look. Henry Mancini's shivery score hits the spine-tingling spot. A real on the money nail-biter.",

After arriving successfully in New York City, a man startles Ms. Jones and she asks kind-looking Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (as Sam Hendrix) to hold the doll. Jones disappears, so Mr. Zimbalist takes the doll home to his Manhattan apartment. He goes off on a photography assignment in Asbury Park, leaving totally blind wife Audrey Hepburn (as Susy) alone with the misplaced doll. While she is out, a psycho crook from Scarsdale, Alan Arkin (as Harry Roat), searches the apartment. He doesn't find the doll...Next to arrive are small-fry criminals Richard Crenna (as Mike Talman) and Jack Weston (as Carlino). Hired by Mr. Arkin to find the missing doll, they find a dead Mrs. Roat, instead. The three crooks believe the heroin must be somewhere in Ms. Hepburn's apartment, but nobody can find the doll. They terrorize the blind woman, but Hepburn either can't or won't produce the doll...Writer Frederick Knott's Broadway play \"Wait Until Dark\" was intricately plotted and beautifully presented, by Arthur Penn, in 1966. It starred Lee Remick, Robert Duvall and Mitchell Ryan and was obviously headed for the big screen. Surprisingly, only Julie Herrod (as Gloria) was retained from the original cast; as the teenager upstairs, she is quite helpful...This film version is thoroughly engaging and suspenseful. Winning several \"Best Actress\" of 1967 nominations, Hepburn delivers one of her best performances. Arkin is as award-worthy, but received less acclaim. He once said, \"You don't get nominated for being mean to Audrey Hepburn.\" They and director Terence Young have their best moments in the classic climax, which makes grand use of light and darkness. A second viewing provides answers to plot questions, leaving a husband's failure to rush over to embrace his wife the only bothersome detail.

            "content": "Great little gem that -for the most part- stands the test of time very well! Audrey Hepburn is cast beautifully as the blind woman victimized by three deviants. Alan Arkin is truly terrifying as the leader and his performance here ranks as one of the all-time-great screen villians. \nDirector Young handles the pace masterfully.  No sequence really goes on longer than it should.  Henry Mancini uses a nice, quiet score that creates appropriate tension as the film builds to its classic showdown. \nMy favorite thing about the film is, I think, the use of lighting in the final sequence.  Charles Lang uses a creepy, dimly-glowing, red-orange light to illuminate the apartment after Suzie has smashed every other bulb.  The effect has a shadowy, nightmarish quality and the scene looks like it was filmed yesterday.When you think about David Fincher reworking the original concept here for PANIC ROOM, it really is a flattering comment to WAIT UNTIL DARK and its power in still being able to chill.  It's also funny to think that with all that impressive photography and filmmaking, the film didn't have nearly half the tension of this 1967 classic.",

It may not have epic chases, mushy love scenes, or even a plot involving robotics, but it does capture the mind for that hour and a half.

The plot is well thought-out, with twists and turns to keep you busy from even before Hepburn sets foot on the stage. It almost entirely takes place one or two rooms of an apartment, utilizing the limited set to a \"Rear Window\"-esque advantage. There is suspense, emotion, crime, passion, and a delve into the world of the blind- and its potential symbolism. Convincing performances, death and devilry, and an almost mother-daughter relationship are all found within this obscure classic, \"Wait Until Dark.\"",

It stars Audrey Hepburn (somewhat at the peak of her success) as the blind housewife Susy Hendrix whose house is perpetrated by three villains looking for smuggled heroine. The three have set up a whole plan to mislead Susy but, due to her carefulness and extra developed other senses, she unmasks them and brings herself in great danger. It quickly becomes obvious that \"Wait Until Dark\" is based on a stage play since nearly the entire film is filmed at one location only (Susy's living room). But, opposite to what you might fear, this isn't a real demerit as it gives you an even stronger idea of how trapped Susy must feel. The finale is a real nail-biter, with Hepburn's character turning the tables and giving her opponents a little image of how it feels to live in the dark! A truly exciting piece of cinema! As mentioned before, Hepburn is really great in her role and she receives excellent feedback from Richard Crenna. Alan Arkin slightly overacts in his role of sadistic crook, but he's still a highly memorable movie-villain.",

She doesn't know it, but she posses a doll full of heroin, and three men are working together to get it. Like some Hithcock thrillers such as \"Rope\" and \"Rear Window,\" \"Wait Until Dark\" takes place in an apartment. Another similarity is that strange events happen that turn out to be very shocking! The film is interesting because Susy alone figures out the trio's plan to take the doll. She works with he friend, Gloria, to unravel the plan. Twists and turns come and go throughout the film. The scariest, or most shocking one involves a telephone. I won't tell you what it is, but it made me gasp. The twists get a bit confusing at times, but they provide good shocks for the audience.Audrey Hepburn does a good job of playing a blind woman, and knows exactly how to act.Men come and go throughout her apartment, and it's up to the audience (and her) to figure out the plan.

At the mercy of villains who want a doll full of drugs that was passed to him in the airport, she is outwardly blind and fragile, and inwardly tough.Set in New York's Greenwich Village, Susy's photographer husband Sam (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) goes off on an appointment that turns out to be a fake and leaves her alone in their apartment. Returning from a trip, while at the airport, a model forces a doll into his hands and rushes away. When people call and start asking him for it, he can't find it, and says he will check in his office.This isn't the answer the meanies (Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and Jack Weston) want. Once they realize she's blind, they set up a series of identities to get into her apartment, not realizing that Susy is a lot more perceptive than they realize - she knows the blinds are being open and closed (as a signal to send someone else in), and that several identities have the same squeaky shoes.When Susy enlists the help of the little girl in the building who helps her with errands and household things, she realizes, due to a phone signal the two set up, that she's dealing with a rough crowd. Her realization is a powerful moment.If you saw this in the theater, the last thirty minutes are among the most terrifying in cinema - not because they're the absolute scariest, but in part because they're unexpected. Anyone who saw this with a group of people remembers the screaming of the audience.This is a wonderful film, one of my favorites as it's so good and takes place in my old neighborhood. Alan Arkin is fantastic as the cruel Roat, who covers his evilness with a flip attitude. Audrey Hepburn does a beautiful job as the blind Susy and looks exquisite.A real classic, Wait Until Dark is entertaining, scary, and well-directed film, moving at a good pace. Highly recommended.",

This is a great thriller, that builds up slowly which means you do get to know your characters beforehand, you understand what's going on, and that acknowledgement makes you worried about the characters, makes you concerned about what they're doing. the way their backstories are presented is also interesting by the way. most of the options in this movie felt pretty right.\nthe storyline is easy: a doll that contains drugs is smuggled into the US. the smuggler a woman, sees she has someone waiting for her at the airport, so she passes the doll to a fellow passenger. then three crooks reunite at the house were presumably that doll is, and need to persuade the wife of that passenger to tell them where is the doll - audrey hepburn playing a blind woman.How they try to gather the trust of the blind woman it's also a clever move. it almost looks like a movie within this movie. most of the movies wouldn't go for this route, but they actually did - and it was a great option. there aren't many characters here but their personality and mostly their actions throughout the screen are very well thought. this almost feels it can happen somewhere in the world without being over the top.the main character is also not defenseless. She has a personality, she's not only a fragile blind woman - we can see that since the beggining. she's also smart which makes things more interesting. And the final minutes are heart racing, they're scary, intense, powerful and i can only imagine people in the theatres back in the days suffering about what's going on in the screen. the way they work the cinematography is a great achievement. The way the story was built too. I liked creena and weston here, but alan arkin\n... he nails it. and it's so nice to see him young playing his role - i loved his role as a grandfather on little miss sunshine, i need to see more movies where he's in. older ones. i want to see this in a big screen one of these days.then you have the cherry on top: audrey hepburn. God, what a marvellous work she does here. i gave it a 9 and not an 8 because of audrey hepburn's work. She is amazing portraying this apparently fragile and disavantaged woman, but so smart, clever and mostly relateable - the audience can feel her pain, can feel her suffering, can feel her despair, and can root for her always because she looks like a real person, she is a human! She does this part wonderfully. I'm usually not the type of person that gives extra value to actor's work, but here? Man. She makes this great sript, this great direction, this great cinematography reach a new level. This role should be iconic in her career, and while she was fairly nominated for an academy award by this, we don't mention this movie while talking about her big career films. She is what an actor or actress should be: elevate good things to new heights.This is a fantastic thriller. I didn't give many spoilers, but still i'll say i have a few. You deserve to go to this without knowing much. this is one of the best thrillers i remember seeing, and one of the best performances i saw someone giving in the screen. Deserves to be a classic like rosemary's baby, or psycho or something like that. For me this is in that standpoint: most iconic suspense movies of all time.",

Now she's alone in her apartment, as the gang conspires to get the doll, which they think is hidden in the apartment. So where's her husband (Zimbalist) when she needs him, and how is a 10-year old girl going to help, especially when the gang's chief assassin (Arkin) looks like he pulls wings off butterflies.The movie's adapted from a stage play, so it's no surprise the scenes are pretty much confined to Susy's apartment. Still, there's enough action so that you hardly notice. And what a cunning screenplay, all the ingenious scheming and trickery. I really like the clever way the lights go on in Susy's head before they go off in the room.I guess if there's a moral, it's something about never underestimating the handicapped. No there's nothing deep or thought provoking going on here. But the movie is one heckuva of a nail-biter, especially the last 10-minutes, which are beautifully staged.

Surrounded in her dark world by bad guys trying to trick her at every turn, Susy is something of a role model to many in her smart and astute grasping of the peril unfolding. It is here that we need some quality fiendish turns from the actors playing the bad guys to keep the film at the smart standard that is set by Hepburn. Richard Crenna is solid and sneeringly charming as Mike Talman, and Alan Arkin is simply delightful as Harry Roat - a genuine nasty piece of work with a killer smile - although he strangely looks like he should be playing base guitar for The Velvet Underground!It's a fine entrant into the thriller suspense genre as the ending via fridge light is fantastic and seals the deal (a superb piece of camera and lens work showcases skills to match Audrey's performance).

            "content": "Everyone's afraid of the things that go bump in the night. For people who are blind, things that go bump in the day can be just as frightening.Terrence Young's \"Wait Until Dark,\" starring Audrey Hepburn, capitalizes on just that fear. A man in an airport is handed a doll by a complete stranger. The doll, unbeknownst to the man, is being used to transport heroin into the country. When some crooks want the doll, they track down the man. Their search leads them to his New York City apartment ... and his wife, who is blind.Audrey Hepburn turns in a wonderful performance as Suzy Hendrix, a woman who has been coping with blindness for a year. Just starting blind school and learning how to relive her life, Suzy is a functioning -- albeit frightened -- mass of walking vulnerability. Her husband (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) is intent on making her learn how to do things on her own, and she is eager to please him, while at the same time desperate for help. Her stress and fatigue is palpable.When the crooks -- played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston, and led by a heavily accented Alan Arkin -- begin their elaborate confidence scam against Suzy, she has no way of knowing they are lying. If Crenna says he is an old war friend of Suzy's husband, how does she know he is making it up? If they tell her there is a police car watching her from outside her window, how is she supposed to know the street is empty? If the leader Roat is a different character each time he comes into her apartment, how can she tell?\nSadly -- and very suspensefully -- she is unable to tell truth from lies without the help from both her young neighbor Gloria and her own heightened senses. The suspense shifts halfway into the film from us wondering if she will be swayed by the conmen to if she will be able to outsmart them, and, ultimately, if she will be able to outlive them.\"Wait Until Dark\" is an amazingly suspenseful film with wonderful performances by Hepburn, Arkin, and Crenna. It keeps you both on the edge of your seat and at the end of your patience as you wait for Hepburn to realize what we already know. Not only are the men out to get the doll, but they are out to destroy Hepburn's confidence, as well as her life.\nHepburn is totally believable as a blind woman, and she certainly did enough background work to earn the commendation -- as well as an Oscar nomination. Studying at a school for the blind before filming began, Hepburn learned how to use a walking stick, how to do her hair and make-up with her eyes closed, and even wore special contact lenses to impair her vision. Watching her, you truly feel her desperation and her vulnerability.Perhaps what makes this feel so good is the boldness of its approach. Just as Hepburn smashes out the light bulbs in her apartment to nullify her enemies' advantage, so too does director Terrence Young put the audience in the same spot as both the victim and the attacker. With moments of pure darkness in the film's final, nail-biting scene, the audience is also rendered blind, forced to rely on their other senses, just as Suzy does. It is gutsy, and it is brilliant. The loss of vision only heightens our tension. It makes us the hunted.Granted, there are some questionable plot points -- such as why Suzy didn't let young Gloria, who she soon found had the doll all along, keep it at her place, and out of the hands of the con artists, as well as the perplexing question of why a blind woman living in New York City very seldomly locks her door. But these are minutia in a sea of wonderful filmmaking, and nothing can take away from the \"Wait Until Dark\"'s  wonderful, gradual climation of suspense. It is subtle, it is perfectly cast, and it is scary as hell.",

Before that, things get a little tedious and there's too much interplay between Hepburn and the interlopers before their devious scheme is developed.The heroin seekers are played in rather theatrical style by ALAN ARKIN, JACK WESTON and RICHARD CRENNA and the stage origins of the original are sometimes clearly evident in the claustrophobic apartment setting.Hepburn's blindness is well-simulated, but the tale itself is a bit too contrived to be taken very seriously. By today's standards, the gripping suspense of the final moments is somewhat tamer than when the film was originally made, diluted no doubt by the more graphic exposition of crime in today's thrillers.Perhaps this is the fault of Terence Young's direction which lets the pace slacken too much before building to a strong climax.",

And, luckily for this movie's creators, the actors deliver. Audrey Hepburn makes this a much better movie than it has any right being, and Alan Arkin delivers a weird but effective performance as the off-kilter psycho who comes after her for some heroin he believes is stashed in her apartment. The film gives away its stage origins -- most of the action is confined to Hepburn's apartment, and director Terence Young doesn't do a lot to give his movie a cinematic quality.

            "content": "\"Wait Until Dark\" is a quirky and enjoyable little 1960s thriller that is most well-known for it's impressive leading stars. The story follows Susy Hendrix, a blinded woman who is trying to deal with her disability. Her husband, Sam, gives her all the support she needs, while trying to keep her as independent as possible. But when Sam leaves her for the night in her quaint New York apartment, she is not aware of the hell that is about to ensue. A group of three thugs after a heroin-filled china doll believe it is in Susy's home, and they hatch a plan to try and get it from her. At first their plan works out well, as the men take advantage of her disability and masquerade as a friend of Sam's, a police sergeant, and many others. But Susy soon catches onto their plan, as the men begin to terrorize her.Obviously inspiring the 1971 thriller titled \"Blind Terror\" (which starred Mia Farrow), \"Wait Until Dark\" is an excellent thriller. It was likely one of the first films to introduce the \"blind woman in peril\" situation, and for that it gets a lot of credit. The film takes place in a rather small but comfortable apartment, and a sense of claustrophobia is relevant here. The entire film looks as if it could have been a play that was just filmed because of the simple sets and the blocking - despite the simplicity of it all, it is an atmospheric film none the less. The 1960s style is really obvious as well, and it is easily seen through the sets, furniture, costumes, and even hairstyles, which gives it a nice sense of nostalgia. Legendary Audrey Hepburn is our leading lady, in a performance that earned her another Oscar nomination (and deservedly so), as the innocent blind woman who is terrorized by a bunch of shady men. She gracefully plays her character, making her likable and strong-willed. Her performance is nearly flawless. A young Alan Arkin plays Rout, the ringleader of the thugs who are after the heroin-filled doll, and is menacing and intelligent at the same time. There are quite a few tense scenes in this movie, among them being the classic climax of the film in which Arkin plays a cat-and-mouse game with Hepburn in a pitch black apartment - it truly is great. There are a few plot holes I would like to point out though. One of them being Susy's reluctance to hand over the doll when it couldn't do anything but help her, and also the fact that she chooses not to lock her front door, even after she is aware of the potential danger she is in. Despite these flaws though, this film still sustains tension and these are forgivable in the end.Overall, \"Wait Until Dark\" is a worthwhile thriller from a time long gone. Stellar performances from Hepburn and Arkin are reason enough to check this out, as are the neat story and the nostalgia factor. In a sense this film is dated since it has lost most of it's shock factor for the modern day audiences, but I was still thoroughly entertained with it and would recommend seeing it anyway, especially if you are a fan of Audrey or Alan. There is enough suspense and tension to keep nearly anyone interested. 9/10.",

            "content": "Although Audrey Hepburn got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for this film it might have been interesting to see what Lee Remick who inaugurated the part of the terrorized blind woman on Broadway did with the role. I guess Hepburn was certainly a bigger film name than Remick.You will never see a woman more frightened on the screen than Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark. Being blind her eyes have to go blank for the role. But with body language and voice she conveys more fright than any three of us could handle in real life.Watching Wait Until Dark when Samantha Jones hands Hepburn's husband Efrem Zimbalist that doll which is ostensibly a souvenir of her travels, I was put in mind of all those post 9/11 warnings about accepting items from strangers at an airport. But in this case this was after they landed and cleared customs. The doll inside contained a kilo or three of heroin and Jones was going to hold out on her partner Alan Arkin and do some side business on her own.Arkin's not a man to trifle with. With what he does with Jones you know he'll have no hesitation in doing something sick and horrible to an innocent like Hepburn who knows she has this doll.Arkin taking advantage of her blindness tries to work a con on Hepburn with confederates Richard Crenna and Jack Weston to get the doll. The details I won't tell you, but the man does have a scheming mind and it gives Arkin a chance to play multiple characters for Hepburn and the movie going public.Richard Crenna with this film broke into serious acting on the big screen. He's a small time grifter but not up for some of the sick stuff that Arkin is into. Quite a change from the parts on the small screen he was best known for, Luke McCoy on The Real McCoys and Walter Bedeker on Our Miss Brooks.I'm surprised that Crenna and Arkin were not given some Oscar consideration along with Hepburn who got the only Academy recognition. She lost to that other Hepburn who won for Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.Wait Until Dark has some similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder in that it's set on one set for the most part. It's as thrilling as the Hitchcock film, though not as cerebral.",

            "content": "A few years ago, there was a Broadway revival of Frederick Knott's play, WAIT UNTIL DARK, starring Quentin Tarantino. Besides the stunt casting, critics were pretty hard on ol' Quentin about his acting ability, or lack thereof. Even he would probably admit himself that he's a better director than an actor. But to be fair, some of the harsh criticism he faced might have had a lot to do with this movie. Director Terence Young's outstanding screen rendering of Knott's play is, after all, the one by which all others are compared.For starters, Henry Mancini more than proved his brilliance as a composer, by gracing this film with one of the creepiest and most memorable themes EVER for a mystery. I defy anyone who has seen this movie to hear that theme and not get egg-sized goosebumps all up and down the length of their spine. And the quality of the rest of the score pretty much matches that theme.Then there's that cast. Audrey Hepburn, so great in light comedies and dramas like BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, SABRINA and CHARADE, and even musicals (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?) completely took her fans and movie-going audiences by surprise as Suzy, the \"champion blind lady\" who must outwit three desperate thugs, searching her apartment for a heroin-filled doll she doesn't know she possesses, while her photographer husband, Sam (Efram Zimbalist, Jr.) is away.Richard Crenna is at his best as the most sympathetic of the three bad guys,and Jack Weston is a great comic foil for his compatriots. But the one tour-de-force performance that equals if not rivals Hepburn's is Alan Arkin as the malevolently evil Harry Roat. THIS is the guy Quentin has to thank for all the 'boos' he received, because for an actor more recognized for his quirkier and more comedic roles, Arkin is all business as Roat, using his comic talents to augment a character dripping with unpredictable menace. He's so damn good, in fact, that even actors in stage productions of DARK must sweat bullets, knowing they'll have to compete with the memory of this performance.If there is any one complaint at all, it's that the screen version, like so many screen adaptations of popular plays during this period, seemed to stage-bound, even with scenes added to \"open up\" the scenario and make it seem more cinematic. Otherwise, Young's taut direction and a great adaptation by Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington do Knott's work as proud as the excellent cast.And do I need to mention that climax? With apologies to the memory of writer Ira Levin, his play DEATHTRAP and so many others like it most probably cribbed from the ending of this play, which the movie stages to a fare-thee-well, delivering what has to be about ten minutes' worth of the most pants-wetting suspense in cinematic history. (And it's not even a HITCHCOCK film!!!) If you are a lover of crime dramas and suspense thrillers who hasn't seen much to impress you these days, yet you have NEVER seen this movie, it's high time you pay a visit to your local video store and track this classic down. And if it's been a while since you've seen it, see it AGAIN...And turn all the lights off before you start watching it, I DARE YOU!!!",

It seems unnecessary that he is this patronizing and detached from his wife's recent blindness. All she seems to want to do is please him, her primary purpose in life is to change to whatever kind of person he wants her to be. Ugh. The second was when Gloria was sent to await a bus to get help from the husband who is coming back to town from an out of town shoot (he is a photographer). Why wasn't Gloria sent to the police? Third was the always open door, surely our Suzy could lock it once she knew she was being conned? And fourth was the minuscule amount of drugs in the doll, surely if it were gems or a key it would have added more credibility to the anxiety of the crooks? And fifth, where did Roat go at the end. Maybe I missed something. First time I saw it I was completely gullible, this time, more vigilant. Sometimes it serves no good purpose to watch movies more than once. 8 out of 10 for Audrey and a truly remarkable performance from Alan Arkin.",

Audrey Hepburn's beauty and innocence is perfect for the blind Susy Hendrix and seeing such an adorable person being completely taken advantage of makes the film that much more terrifying. If we saw these evil people (highlighted by Alan Arkin's brilliant performance as the despicable Roat) taking advantage of anyone else, it wouldn't be half as hard to watch as it was when we saw it done to Hepburn. The plot is relatively simple. Through a twist of fate, Susy Hendrix's husband Sam received a doll loaded with heroine. The mysterious Roat recruits Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston) to act out an elaborate scheme to get Susy to find the doll and return it to them, without knowing the true contents. A simple structure with one setting (Susy's basement apartment) being the location for 99% of the film becomes the perfect setting for a film loaded with fear and suspense. There's no eerie score, clich\u00e9d plot devices or contrived moments created only to add a fear to the moment. It's just the simplicity of a blind woman being taken advantage of by these immensely frightening, intelligent and evil individuals. The film is based on a play of the same name, and it shows. The acting is the perfect match for the dialogue and combines to make a simple story so compelling. Hepburn's performance is the stuff of legend and further proof that she is one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the screen. Her Oscar nomination was more than deserved; I'd give her the win.

            "content": "I adore this movie to pieces. I have seen bloodier movies, I have seen more cerebral horror, but with the exception of John Carpenter's THE THING, I have never been as terrified by a movie. I felt physically ill close to the climax the first time I saw it and that never happens with me, not even when I saw THE SHINING for the first time.The premise and set-up are quite simple, but the acting, direction, and music make this a nail-biting, almost sadistic exercise in suspense. The camerawork is not show-offy, but subtly limits our perspective and makes that cozy little basement apartment seem claustrophobic. The lighting goes from being warm to being almost expressionistic as the stakes raise. Henry Mancini's score is off-kilter and queasy, putting the audience on edge from the first image-- itself very evocative of the terror to come: a close-up of a doll being cut open, its cotton innards rising toward the frame.The characters really elevate this one as well, as they are mostly very memorable. Audrey Hepburn's Susy Hendrix is more than a blind woman in distress: she is a person struggling with psychological insecurity, trying her best to put an upbeat face on her sufferings. The con game becomes as much a matter of overcoming her internal battles as it is a matter of figuring out just what is going on with these weird men. Her blend of grit and vulnerability makes her an ideal thriller protagonist and I find her arc one of the most satisfying in film.Alan Arkin's Harry Roat Jr. is one of my favorite movie villains, an eccentric drug-dealer who dresses like a beatnik and takes delight in inflicting pain, whether it's through something as simple as making Susy believe her husband is cheating on her to threatening her with a slashed throat. He appears laidback and friendly, but there's an uncanny quality to him which makes him seem all the more sinister, especially since his smiles never reach his eyes and his face is usually hardened when he isn't trying to charm. There's a close-up of him near the end of the film, when it appears Susy's at his total mercy, where the civilized mask has dropped, that just gives me the creeps.Though they never get as much attention in reviews, Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are great as Arkin's lackeys, two small-time criminals blackmailed into helping a man even they despise. Crenna in particular does a great job at selling his performance-within-a-performance, and I love the way he underplays his character's feelings for Susy.I don't quite know what makes this movie so great. There's a heavy sense of dread which permeates the story, even during the cheerier domestic scenes with Susy and her husband. The climax is worth its weight in spilled popcorn: I knew about the jumpscare before seeing the film, but I was so invested in the movie that I forgot all about it and jumped right off my couch when it happened.Anyway, I've gushed enough: this is one of my favorites. As a writer, I would love to make something so tightly-constructed and unsettling.",

            "content": "Magnificent and unusual thriller which is surprisingly effective despite its rather cosy foundations. I first saw this movie on TV late one night with my Nan and we were absolutely gripped and jumped out of our seats a good few times. I watched it again yesterday afternoon and found it to be even better than I thought despite a few minor quibbles.Firstly, I agree that a few teabags of heroin didn't warrant all this fuss, but the idea of a cute/ creepy kid's doll stuffed with it is a malevolent image all the same. What puzzles me more is why on earth Susy risks her life for it when she has absolutely no idea what's in it. She even at one point says \"I'm saving my husband's life aren't I?\" which is completely out of nowhere. She suspects for as while it is evidence of her husband's implication in a murder or perhaps adultery plot, but she doesn't have any idea what is going on and yet risks her life for it. If it was me, even if I did know what was in the doll, I'd still hand it over to Roat!The other slight flaw in the film comes in its origins as a stage play. While the claustrophobia is a great asset, the problem lies in the adaptation not taking into account the reactions of a cinema audience are different to a theatre audience. Take for example the scene early on when Susy enters the flat while the three villains are meeting there. Why doesn't Roat tell them she is blind, he has time to? Because on stage one of the plays most effective moments was having Susy enter and face the villains and then the penny drops for the audience that she cannot see. This \"shared reaction\" of an audience is something pretty unique to theatre and needs heightening considerably to work on film.Additionally, the sequence where Susy realises the operator is still hanging on the phone line is a crowd pleasing laugh on stage but is not an effective gag in a movie.Minor quibbles though in a marvelous film. Very creepy music, wonderful acting, tension building very effectively (a particularly powerful moment being Susy's gasp as she realises Mike is one of the gang)and isn't Samantha Jones gorgeous?",

            "content": "Watching Alan Arkin play the curmudgeonly grandfather in this year's \"Little Miss Sunshine\", one tends to forget what an exciting and versatile actor he was back in the mid-1960's. Here he has a field day playing Harry Roat, a coolly intelligent psycho intent on taking a doll filled with heroin from a blind woman, whose husband inadvertently left it in their apartment. This sharply effective 1967 thriller was the last movie Audrey Hepburn made before her nearly decade-long, self-imposed retirement. She ended fifteen years of transcendent performances with her superb portrayal of Susy Hendrix, a photographer's recently blinded wife just getting used to living with her new limitations. Her gradual evolution from seemingly helpless to surprisingly resourceful is what grounds the terror-ridden film in humanity.The plot begins at the airport where a mysterious young woman asks Susy's unsuspecting husband Sam to keep the doll for her. He takes it back to their Greenwich Village basement apartment where the rest of the vice-gripping plot takes place. Sam leaves Susy alone, and three men insinuate themselves into the place, one posing as Sam's old college friend to gain her trust. Roat plays three different people in his sadistic attempt to get Susy to hand over the doll. You can take it from there, but it does lead to a corking, no-holds-barred finale between Roat and Susy brilliantly executed. Without mentioning any particulars, the heart-stopping lunge (described colorfully in the DVD featurette) is a memorable piece of fright cinema.Credit needs to go to director Terence Young who sets the wheels of the rope-tightening plot with precision, and the economic screenplay by Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington based on the Frederick Knott play. Granted there are some contrived elements but you can figure them out yourself. There are solid contributions from Richard Crenna and Jack Weston as Roat's cohorts, Julie Herrod as the petulant teen-aged neighbor and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Sam. Henry Mancini composed the cocktail lounge-style 1960's title song, but he also wrote the tense, strings-squealing music score. The 2003 DVD contains one worthwhile extra, an eight-minute, looking-back featurette containing interviews with Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (just ending his marriage to Hepburn at the time of filming). There are also two theatrical trailers, the original and a cheesier one where the audience is told the lights will be completely darkened for the film's last eight minutes.",

            "content": "Wait until Dark (1967)I wish this was a better movie. I love Audrey Hepburn, and she's truly the star here trying to make the limited script work. I don't know that she plays a blind person quite right, but good enough for me. She's charming.The other highlight is the up and down performance of Alan Arkin in an early role. When he's the sunglass wearing psycho looking for the heroin in the doll he's pretty good, but when he puts on disguises and plays other roles he's kind of silly, though maybe that's intentional. Of the remaining four characters, no one is quite right on (the girl, I suppose) and the cop/thief played by Jack Weston is too exaggerated for my taste.This is a play, to be sure, made for film. That changes some of our expectations, in theory, but in a way that makes the script, which is the weakest point, even weaker. Plays, above all, have to be finely tuned in their dialog, their concepts, their economy. This one is such a huge strain, especially in the middle parts, it's hard to not laugh at it a bit. I'm not saying it's not horrifying in concept\u2014a blind woman being tormented by some thugs to get information out of her she actually might not have\u2014but the delivery is canned and so compacted in this screen version, shot almost entirely in an apartment, is just creaks.You do get the feeling this is supposed to the be the equal of say \"Rope\" or \"Rear Window\" by Hitchcock, which just shows you the limits of many directors and scripts because this doesn't have the depth, the visual panache, the psychological twists, of a good Hitch. It does have some of the 1960s falseness that pervaded the industry (including Hitchcock's films), and I have never quite acquired a taste for it. 1967 marks the birth of \"New Hollywood\" and a vigorous, fresh kind of filmmaking that is rather the opposite of this. For good reason.I've seen this three or four times over the years, and every time I say, maybe I'll like it this time. Nope, not quite. It's fun, it's good, and it's got very good moments \u2014and it's got Audrey\u2014but that's not quite, not at all quite enough. It does have a great finale, however, and it has some really bizarrely inventive music by Mancini using quartertones on the piano. So, there are aspects...give them some effort.",

They still can't find the doll so the dangerous Harry Roat enrols the help of crooked cops Talmin and Carlino. Problem is that the doll is most likely somewhere in the apartment that Lisa shared with the newly blinded woman Susy. As night falls the three men set up a way into her flat using a variety of false ids.If you can get passed the illogical parts of this story then the end result is actually quite an enjoyable and tense little stage play. The doll could be anything and could contain anything because it is only a device that sets up the scenario. From here the film plays a nice game while Susy gradually puts the pieces together \u0096 it may not have mystery but it is still quite tense because, although we know what is going on, the fact is that we don't know what Susy is going to do. The apartment location is surprisingly well used because it could have easily been too stagy and static. Young moves the story around the room well but mainly it is the cast that make it work as well as it does.Hepburn may not always look convincing as a blind woman (she seems to lead with her eyes in a way that is unconvincing) but it is her fear and trust that she brings across well, making the character believable and engaging. Arkin is just as good but has less screen time; he is menacing while being charming and he makes a memorable villain that has a good part of the final scenes in the apartment. Crenna will be the guy from Rambo to the majority of people but he is effective here \u0096 delivering his lines with one tone while his face says something else. Weston and Zimbalist provide good support but the film belongs generally to the main three and specifically to Hepburn.Overall an enjoyable little thriller that builds well within the confines of the apartment block. The story may not be perfect but the cast work hard to more than make up for it; along with good use of the space, they deliver the story and characters in a convincing fashion.",

            "review_title": "The Dark Side of Audrey Hepburn",
            "content": "Audrey Hepburn first made her name in romantic comedies like \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Sabrina\", but throughout her career she tried to extend her range as an actress by alternating these with more serious films. Thus she followed up \"Sabrina\" with \"War and Peace\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" with \"The Children's Hour\". Today, however, it is her lighter films that tend to be remembered by the public; with the exception of \"The Nun's Story\" the serious ones are lesser known.Audrey never made a film with Alfred Hitchcock- she probably had the wrong colouring for a director who famously preferred blondes as his leading ladies- although according to her biographer Robyn Karney he did approach her to star in a film called \"No Bail for the Judge\", which in the event was never made. She did, however, star in two films in the sixties which both, in different ways, showed the influence of the great man. The first was Stanley Donen's \"Charade\", a light-hearted thriller-cum-romance in the style of \"North by Northwest\". The second, made four years later, was \"Wait Until Dark\", a much tenser, darker thriller which owes a greater debt to Hitchcock's dark side.This film perhaps shows us the dark side of Audrey Hepburn. She plays Susy Hendrix, a young woman who has lost her sight in an accident and who is slowly learning to cope with her blindness. The plot is a complex one and centres upon a classic Hitchcockian McGuffin, a doll stuffed with heroin. The doll has come into the possession of Susy and her husband Sam, who are quite unaware of its contents. A criminal named Harry Roat is desperate to recover the doll, and in order to do so he employs a couple of con-men who devise an elaborate ruse which involves one of them posing as an old wartime comrade of Sam and the other as a policeman. Susy is at first taken in, but gradually comes to suspect that the men are not what they seem, leading to a tense final confrontation between her and Roat. He might appear to have all the advantages, being both sighted and a violent, ruthless thug up against a defenceless blind girl. The title of the film does, however, point to one thing she has on her side. To compensate for her blindness she has developed acute hearing, so she is at an advantage in the dark and sets about smashing all the light-bulbs in her flat.Audrey was not only the most beautiful actress of her generation, but also one of the most charismatic. She had the ability to make almost any film she starred in her property to the extent that it becomes impossible to imagine any other actress taking the leading role. \"Wait Until Dark\", based on a stage play hardly anyone has ever heard of, could have been just another routine thriller; instead, it is an Audrey Hepburn vehicle, which means that it becomes something special. Susy, vulnerable and frightened yet courageous and determined, is one of her most lovable characters. She did a lot of preparatory work for the film, attending a school for the blind and even learning to read braille, and this obviously paid off. We always accept Susy as blind, even though we know perfectly well that Audrey herself was not.The success of the film is not due to Audrey alone. There is a good performance from Alan Arkin as the creepy psychopath Roat, and the direction is skilfully handled by Terence Young. The last twenty minutes, when Roat confronts Susy in the darkened flat, are particularly gripping- a scene of which Hitchcock would have been proud. I have read that the fact that the action is confined to a single flat betrays the film's origins as a stage play. In my view, however, Young was quite right to resist any temptation to \"open it up\"; this concentration on a single enclosed location is necessary to create an atmosphere of claustrophobia and tension. (The recent Jodie Foster thriller \"Panic Room\", which also features a woman in danger from three criminals and which owes a lot to \"Wait Until Dark\", was similarly confined to a single house, although that was based on an original screenplay, not a stage play).This was Audrey's last film before her nine-year absence from the cinema (due to events in her private life), but she was still clearly an actress at the height of her powers. \"Wait Until Dark\", like \"The Nun's Story\", \"The Unforgiven\" and \"The Children's Hour\", is evidence that she was not just the Queen of the romantic comedy but also a very versatile actress. 8/10",

The villain, Roat, conceives a plan that requires that he change his disguise, and further requires that he manipulate two other people.  I can see how a psychopath might be intelligent and clever.  What defies belief is how someone preoccupied with drugs could be so inventive, so creative, so quick-witted, and so resourceful.  Had the object of his attention been something other than drugs, a valuable gem for example, the premise might have had more credibility.To further the plot along, Roat's complex scheme requires an intelligent victim. And thus, Susy Hendrix, although blind, is super alert, quick-witted, and resourceful.  Helping Susy is Gloria, the glasses-wearing, precocious teen.Indeed, \"Wait Until Dark\" gushes with smart characters who know exactly what to say and do, at exactly the right moment.  The result is a story that comes across as affected and artificial, a conclusion further supported by the film's implausible ending.If the story is weak, the acting is not.  Alan Arkin is terrific as the villain.  Both Crenna and Weston give credible performances.  And who could criticize the demure and likable Audrey Hepburn?  Not me.This movie does belong in the \"thriller\" genre.  But its suspense is diluted somewhat by a too talky script, the result perhaps of its origin as a play.Overall, \"Wait Until Dark\" is a good movie to watch once, mainly for the acting achievements of Arkin and Hepburn.",

            "content": "When I'm watching a thriller, I'm not very easy to please and yet I am. I just don't want to see too many big explosions, enormous car chases, big stunts,... All I want is a good story with some fine character development, a nice decor and a lot of tension. The only problem is that not too many thrillers - and certainly not the most recent ones - meet that prescription. The ideas of people like Alfred Hitchcock are very often copied, but almost never met, let alone exceeded. So from time to time I like to watch 'old' thrillers like for instance this one. (A movie that has been created 11 years before your birth always feels old, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good of course).\"Wait Until Dark\" starts with a meeting between Sam and a mysterious woman at an airport. She asks him to hold a doll for her and soon after disappears without a trace. She is found dead in Susie's apartment by two small time criminals called Mike and Carlino. Susie is Sam's wife and has recently been blinded because of an accident. That's why she doesn't know that there was a dead woman in her place, put there and already removed again by Harry Rote, or that the doll - for which the woman was murdered - was stuffed with heroin. But by know, Susie has heard on the radio that a dead woman was found in the neighborhood and when Sam has to leave home for his work for a couple of days, she doesn't feel too safe. In the mean time, Mike, Carlino and Harry Rote have teamed up to find the doll and invent a story of a police investigation. They tell Susie that Sam is the suspect in the murder case and that the doll will link him to the body. At first everything seems to go well as they try to convince Susie of giving them the doll, but Rote is a cold killer and starts to loose his patience...As this movie proves: a good thriller doesn't need many sets or characters to be very effective. The biggest part of the movie is situated in the confined space of Susie's apartment and almost all the time there are only four characters that you'll see. Nothing more, nothing less. And it works perfectly. Thanks to the fine story and the excellent acting by Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna and Jack Weston, this movie never seems to loosen its grip on you. You just stay interested from the beginning until the end as the tension and suspense more and more start to build up. What I also admire in this movie is the fact that it all feels so timeless. It feels a bit like a Hitchcock movie. He too knew how to make excellent thriller that, even though made almost forty years ago, still stands. Nothing seems to remind you of the fact that this is an 'old' movie. Sure, there are some smaller details - like a car or an airplane - that will show you that this isn't one of last year's movies, but overall this movie has aged perfectly. As a conclusion I would like to say that if you are interested in a very nice thriller with some nice acting, a great story full of suspense and a timeless feeling, than I wouldn't think twice and watch this little gem. I reward it with at least a 7.5/10, although I believe that an 8/10 isn't exaggerated either.",

It seems to be a desperate way to get three crooks to lie to a blind woman only to have her outsmart them all. But I just can't let the setup go. It feels too fragile like the smallest disruption would put the story into collapse.Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as the blind woman. Alan Arkin is too mannered in his acting as the creepy crook. Is he trying to be a cartoon? Both Richard Crenna and Jack Weston provide solid characters. The acting in general is well above average.Maybe a play works better. It's a more artificial place to watch a story. Having a fake unreasonable story doesn't diminish it as much on stage. When it's adapted to the screen, it needs to be tight.",

            "review_title": "The best Hitchcock movie Hitchcock never made",
            "content": "This is a very enjoyable and suspenseful picture and quite frightening in moments. Well done cinematically, although it is often a bit too obvious that this is basically a stage play. However, many of the most suspenseful moments are more suspenseful because they are in the language of cinema rather than stage. Frequently the composition accentuates a sensation of claustrophobia which contributes a lot to the suspense.I refer to this picture as \"The Best Hitchcock Movie Hitchcock Never Made\" because it has many hallmarks of the master's work. First, a quick story summary: recently blinded woman unwittingly comes into possession of a doll which an evil criminal and two henchmen are after. The criminals create a rather involved plot to wrest the doll from the blind woman's possession and mayhem ensues.First, we have the doll. This is a classic \"MacGuffin\" in the Hitchcock tradition. A MacGuffin is an object on which the plot hangs, which drives the characters' actions. It could be anything -- a box of chocolates with diamonds inside, a slip of paper with incriminating evidence -- it doesn't matter what the item is that pushes the story along, and indeed we don't know what the doll contains until the last couple of reels -- precisely because it is inconsequential to the workings of the film.Second, we have the central suspense-building technique of the film, which is that the audience knows what is going on while the protagonist does not. The blindness of the central character affords wide latitude in exploiting this idea. It is a technique often used by Hitch to manipulate the audience, memorably for example in Sabotage and Rope, to name only two. It works here to great effect.Third, there is really only one \"jump out and say boo!\" moment in the movie and it is extraordinarily well-timed. After the suspense has been built to a fever pitch and artificially deflated there is an almost cathartic moment of leap-out-of-your-seat-and-scream shock before the last suspenseful moments. Compare it to Psycho, for example, and the final moments in the basement in that picture -- a similar effect on the audience.Fourth, yes, as some other comments have said, the criminals' plot is a little too involved to be realistic. But like the doll it exists only to produce suspense in the audience. On this level it richly succeeds. Hitchcock by and large dismissed credibility as key to a plot (read Hitchcock/Truffaut for many interesting thoughts on this). If the film is to engage the suspense of the audience on a cinematic level, to such an extent that they suspend their disbelief, the plot's purpose is to provide a framework in which this can occur. Again, the picture works on this level.Richard Crenna is as wooden as ever, though. His range and depth make me think of what Andie McDowell would have been like if she had been born a male tough-guy. Hepburn does a fine job with difficult material. Arkin convinces as the psychotic criminal.While not on a par with Hitchcock's best work one would have liked to have seen what the master would have done with this material.",

            "content": "A clever screenplay and a tight plot deliver a neat psychological thriller, with Audrey Hepburn portraying a blind woman who's the target of a vicious criminal intent on retrieving some heroin hidden in a doll her husband received in an unintended hand-off at the airport. Whew! It sounds complicated but it's really not once the story gets going. This one will keep you fascinated with it's subtle twists with the characters, resulting in a convincing climax as the handicapped woman wins out against her tormentors.One thing I thought the writers were going for though resulted in no follow through. At one point, crooked cop Talman (Richard Crenna) makes a slow, deliberate call to the phone booth outside Susy Hendrix's apartment, and the attentive viewer will figure she's counting the dial clicks to realize it's the same number he gives her for his police contact. That seemed a wasted moment for me, since Susy was so resourceful in every other respect. Another point, when Susy prepares for her showdown with Roat (Alan Arkin), she eliminates all the light sources in her apartment, but the ones she simply unscrews by hand would have burned her without protection, so that seemed like an unforced error in the story.So the picture is a half century old as I write this, and if you need to be convinced such a thing as inflation exists, how about Talman asking for two hundred fifty bucks up front for him and partner Carlino (Jack Weston) to fall in with Roat? What! - mere chickenfeed today for the enterprising criminal. And then, when neighbor Gloria shows up at the apartment with two full bags of groceries for five bucks, I knew we were still in the Twilight Zone era.For all that, the picture still delivers pretty well in the suspense department, and the coup de grace in the script occurred when Gloria made her two-ring telephone signal to Susy that second time, and she realized the outside phone booth connected Talman with Roat. Still, I had to wonder when it was all over if it was really worth it for Roat to kill three victims for those few bags of heroin he pulled out of the doll. I'm not up on my drug prices, but it didn't seem like there was that much there for him to get so intense about. Even so, Arkin was convincing in his role, all three of them if you count the impersonations, but then again, why go through all that for a blind lady?",

This IS the classic intersection where good story telling and imagination (on steroids) come together, make no mistake. It could also be compared to a revamped, 60s-style PERILS OF PAULINE opus, where poor Audrey has to somehow, someway rise above it all, and being blind is just pushing the envelope a little further, if you will!

This is high camp stuff that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and if there's a bit of Hitchcockian flavor in this, perhaps, it has to be the fates awaiting the bad guys here. KARMA CENTRAL.

Would anyone call \"Dial M For Murder\" in any way pregnant with a message? Nope. It's designed to entertain, from beginning to end, and it gets the job done.Hepburn's husband has inadvertently given her a doll containing a large amount of heroin and then is off somewhere on a trip, out of the picture, unable to help, as husbands and boyfriends in these movies always are. This leaves the innocent and blind Hepburn alone in her basement apartment in New York, her only possible assistant a snotty young girl who lives upstairs.Audrey Hepburn was fortyish and no longer a naive young lass but retained her classic features and reed-thin modelesque figure. She does as professional a job here as she did anywhere else.The three villains who are in cahoots in an attempt to find out what Hepburn did with the heroin doll are diverse. Richard Crenna is the only one who is young and handsome and he's not unsympathetic. Allan Arkin knocks him off. Jack Weston is the dumb and brutal soldier of the group. Allan Arkin knocks him off.Arkin himself is the brains. He's given to wearing shades and black leather. He carries a switchblade and his hair is cut in bangs across his forehead. The single most startling moment in the film is given to him. I won't describe it except to call it \"The Leap.\" It worked so well that it's been imitated a dozen times since. The only problem I had with Arkin as a ruthless murderer is that he's such a nice guy. He really is. And to see him lurching around in the darkness trying to cut the throat of someone as appealing as Audrey Hepburn is -- well, \"casting against type\" can be carried too far.Frederick Knott has structured the play in an almost classical way, beginning with happiness, satisfaction, and normality -- for those who find happiness and satisfaction in normality -- and then introducing the threat, and building on it, bit by bit, until the fulminating climax.You won't be bored for a minute.",

Terrific film for me, where the bad guys are shown in a very unusual way, and the fight between them and blind Audrey Hepburn is jawdropping.... Tense, taut, ths feature won't let you drop till the end. A movie critic, in 1968, seemed obsessed by the fact that the apartment door remained unlocked by Suzy - Hepburn - and that amused me. He may be right, this critic, but so many goofs appear all the time, if you watch closely enough. This is an excellent movie for me anyway. I know that there are some goofs here; for instance when villain Jack Weston enters Hepburn's apartment, when she is supposed to be alone before he gets in, WHY doesn't he get surprised to see the apartment with all his lights on? Lights on for a blind woman? Ha ha ha. And when, in the end, Suzy smashes all the lights, to be equal to her enemies, WHY does she let only one light on? Only to let the audience continue to watch? Ha ha ha. And the matches trick in the end, with the gasoline threat, for the villain Arkin, is a very smart way to permit the audiences to watch thru total darkness....",

Crenna and Weston are superb as blackmailed con men out to talk Hepburn out of the doll she knows nothing about. Crenna in particular begins to develop romantic feelings towards her. Julie Herrod plays a young girl in the building who allies herself with Hepburn as sort of watch out.

You want to shout a warning to her, tell her that there's a dead woman in the closet and those around her aren't what they seem. She's matched, on the other end of the character spectrum, by Alan Arkin as cool, emotionless, sadistic Harry Roat. His smooth villainy and her immense appeal and impaired state ratchet the suspense sky-high. It's almost unbearable during the climax, in which we're literally left in the dark with only the sounds of Susie's screaming and Roat's labored grunting. I refuse to divulge any more, but it's quintessential nightmare material, and you'll never forget it.

The final scenes between her,Audrey,and the usually rather stiff Efrem Zimbalist Jnr are very well done and touch the emotions.Henry Mancini's score is sometimes effective but seems on occasions overtly familiar to CHARADE(1963),an Audrey Hepburn/Cary Grant classic Mancini composed several years earlier.The film would've been absolutely outstanding if it wasn't for the indifferent opening scenes,and rather more light relief:the only bits of real humour come at the end credits,when we see Arkin credited as ROAT,ROAT JNR,and ROAT SNR(JNR and SNR were obviously impersonations as part of the subterfuge to steal the heroin-stuffed doll),but it's still a very good thriller nonetheless.",

Arkin wouldn't have looked out of place in a 1990's pulp fiction genre. Scary, believable, superb! Hepburn was her usual vivacious self, apparently revelling in the blind woman against all odds scenario, superb!Two scary, sh** I wasn't expecting that, type of moments came in the form of the Arkin's car driving, & his incredible gymnastic spring towards the end.

            "content": "One thing that's noteworthy about Audrey Hepburn is that she retired from acting at a pretty young age. In fact, this was pretty much the last film she made for about 10 years. What that means is that she has a relatively limited (compared to other major stars) body of work - and what that means is that it's easy to get a pretty good look at her talents because you can easily watch a good chunk of what she did. I like Audrey Hepburn. She's very talented, and I've seen her in some superb roles. - but, although I'm sure she had personal reasons for her early retirement from the biz, I can also see why this movie might have pushed her in that direction. This was not one of her better movies, and although she herself was pretty good in it, this was also not one of her better performances.In \"Wait Until Dark\" Hepburn played Suzy Hendrix - a young woman who's gone tragically blind due to a car accident. Her husband has been duped into unknowingly bringing home a doll stuffed with heroin, and while he's away those who want the heroin start to work their way into her apartment and her life, trying to confuse her and then pressure her into giving them the doll. But somehow this tried way too hard to be a cloak and dagger, suspense thriller kind of movie. It packed too much into itself; there were - to use an analogy - too many moving parts. The end result was that rather than being thrilling or exciting or suspenseful, I actually found this rather dull and hard to follow. Hepburn put a lot into playing the part of the young blind woman (at times I wondered - would a blind person really do that? - but I'm willing to cut some slack just because of how difficult it must be for a sighted person to play a blind person) but the rest of the cast seemed at times to struggle, and I was especially unimpressed with Alan Arkin as Roat (the leader of the group trying to get the heroin filled doll) in one of his very early performances. I will grant that the climax of the movie, as Suzy and Roat confront each other in the apartment, is pretty exciting, which helped make me feel that there was a good reason for watching this. I confess that by about the halfway point I was starting to question why I bothered. Aside from Hepburn and Arkin it's a pretty limited cast including well known actors like Richard Crenna and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and a completely unknown young actress named Julie Herrod as young Gloria (who seems to be Suzy's sometimes friend and sometimes nemesis) who was actually not bad, but whose career never went anywhere. The limited cast and set (it basically all takes place inside Suzy's apartment) is probably a result of this having been adapted from a stage play.There was one thing in this that made me chuckle. Unless you're a Canadian you probably wouldn't pick up on this - but I wondered how much money somebody paid to advertise in various scenes of this movie. This was made in 1967 - Canada's Centennial year, and the year of Expo '67 in Montreal, which was the big - really BIG - Centennial event of that year in Canada. The beginning of the movie is filled with shots of Air Canada jets - one of which has \"expo67\" painted on its side, and there are various references to Canada and - especially - Montreal made in the film. It seemed like a pretty obvious \"Come and visit!\" type of ad - although the movie was released just as Expo was closing, I could see this being used as a way to entice people to keep coming back.

They clutch to the walls, holding their breath, a corpse hanging from a bedroom closet. Then there's the whole plot of terrifying her into giving them the doll. And of course, there's the final confrontation, one of the best I've ever seen and which made me jump from my seat, something I almost never do. Throughout the movie there's just a sense of dread and evil, like something really horrible is about to happen, that will hold everyone's attention in thrall.Audrey Hepburn is incredible as Susy; she seems lost and vulnerable, but also has an upbeat look in her face. She also has a great trait I like in characters in thrillers: she's smart. Several times she outsmarts the villains, making her active instead of just a passive victim.Alan Larkin, however, steals the show as Harry Roat, a leather-jacket-wearing, sun-glass-inside-the-house-wearing, knife-loving villain. As smart as Susy and infinitely vicious, he's one of the great villains of the cinema.Wait Until Dark is a great thriller, very much in Hitchcock's style: there's a situation and an innocent person must get out of it. We know who the good and the bad are and what's at stake. It's the cat-and-game mouse, the outsmarting each other, that's fun to watch. And in this movie it's a perfect game of wits, where you're not certain until the end who'll win. What's certain is that no one will forget this movie.",

This movie is outstanding and brilliantly intricate. The opening investigation sequence where the plot is revealed is intense and sets the movie up perfectly. Hepburn is amazing, like everything she's in, and the conclusion is unpredictable and surprisingly violent. There's a little girl in this that is appropriately, painfully annoying.

The principal actors in the film, Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin, are excellent and the plot is actually damn clever even though I found some slight holes in it. If you know anything about blind people, you know their other senses are much more alive, so it puzzles me that Audrey wouldn't know there were three- count 'em- three men in her apartment, including a dead body in a garment bag, no less, that she passes within a whisker of. And, in fact, later in the film, Audrey is able to hear Jack Weston's character dusting and indentify Alan Arkin's character as wearing the same pair of shoes as he poses in different identities. Also, why in the world would a bunch of shady drug dealers go to such lengths to weave this whole tapestry of a story to get Hepburn to turn over the missing doll?  Especially since it turns out there's not a hell of a lot of dope inside it, just a few packets worth. Arkin explains at the end \"I tried to do it their way...but they're a couple of amateurs\", but he's involved in the play-acting right up to his neck, appearing in fake wigs, moustaches, and accents.  And that's another thing: I like Alan Arkin a lot, and I always enjoy him in just about everything he's in, but whenever I see him playing around in different looks and voices, it just reminds me he'll never be anything more than a Peter Sellers wannabe.  All the same, this movie will legitimately keep you in suspense most of the way. And Henry Mancini's tick-tock musical score is superb.  *** out of 4",

It has many imitators that try to re-create a horror story, but fail. Even if the initial scare doesn't make you jump, (which, by the way, it probably will,) You will remember this when you are alone. After you wake up from a nightmare where an unseen evil is stalking you, you will think to yourself how would you protect yourself if you no seeing ability, or even if you could somehow make a defense. This is not a story of the supernatural, like in Halloween, a monster movie, like Alien, or a Bad-guy-that-won't-die movie, like in Friday the 13th. This is a story, where we are given the plot as if we are reading it from a book, where all the characters have emotions and motives for their actions, and where sometimes we find ourselves just as confused and blinded as Audrey Hepburn is, and that is what makes the terror real.",

This movie, one in which Audrey Hepburn was nominated for her fifth (and final) Oscar nomination. Let me just say that she really, REALLY deserved it. Alan Arkin, who plays the creepy/eerie narcotics dealer (Roat) is just as horiffying in this suspense thriller as Audrey is beautiful. He schemes his way into Susie's apartment, searching for a doll full of heroin. Even though he's way ahead of Susie, basically because she's blind (but don't let that fact fool you, she's extremely brilliant) Susie figures out piece by piece what's going on. Roat's two henchmen, Mike and Carlino, are so-so in the acting department, but try their best to get the doll out of Susie.    Watch this during the night time, with the lights off, and it will change you. For one, don't mess with blind people, and two, don't think that just because a movie is made in the 60s that it won't be scary. This is scary, and suspenseful.

            "content": "This enigmatic thriller's greatest strength lies in its ominous, suspenseful tone - helped immensely by its excellent, slightly off-key soundtrack and instantly gripping opening - which Young wisely knows when to push to the foreground or pull to the back while never letting it truly relent. It's interesting how the audience is able to not only know the intentions of the criminals but also understand the blind protagonist's perspective too. This means that the various reveals in 'Wait Until Dark (1967)' aren't shocking to us but they are to her, which is a move that shouldn't have worked yet strangely does incredibly well. It's in the way in which we see her come to understand the situation that we realise how terrifying it truly must be. The horror comes from how phenomenally we are put in the shoes of the protagonist, how vulnerable we feel when we relate to her. Then, it transforms slightly when she starts to embrace her relatively newfound world of literal darkness and fight back against those who would take advantage of her. It's when we start to see how determined and resourceful she truly is that the chills turn to thrills and pure excitement, but a hint of dread always remains. This leads into the feature's fantastically tense finale that uses its unique slant extremely well and finishes the piece on a high note. It's because our lead has to find her own way out of the never-safe situation that it all ends up so satisfying. 8/10",

In fact, this was one of the reasons that the character of Roat was so hard to cast-but lets be glad Arkin finally took the role. He contributes quite a lot to this film. The film is based on a stage play of the same name, thus a lot of the action happens on one set. I generally find such films fairly boring, and the first time I saw this one I didn't find it all that interesting. But I so enjoyed the Roats character, that I went back and viewed it again-and this time I loved it.

            "content": "When a doll is stuffed by heroin, heroin becomes the stuff a big nightmare is made on, and if you think your comfortable viewer's position will get you immune to genuine fright, you've got another thing coming... or jumping.So, we have a blind woman named Suzy Hendrix, left alone in her apartment and three men who want to get the doll. How that doll got in Suzy's possession is swiftly handled like a typical Hitchcock McGuffin. How the two con-artists Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston) accept to help a sinister black-clad sunglasses-spotting criminal named Raut (Alan Arkin) to get a hold on the doll is smoothly executed in an expositional blackmailing. And how we get to this get-the-doll premise to a harrowing thriller is the second of a three-act structure from Frederic Knott, who wrote \"Dial M for Murder\".Then Terence Young's nonsense directing transcended the unity of time and space and plot, making for an experience that would frighten the audiences through a vicious exploitation of theaters' darkness. The film is indeed known for its exceptional demand of minimal lighting in the theaters in order to enhance the sense of sheer terror at the climax. And yes, while experiencing it, I was wondering how it would have looked in the theater, the last scene that made me think so was the horrific shower in \"Schindler's List\".Remember, women were taken to the camp shower, they have heard rumors about hem being death traps, but what could they do? The door was closed and then the anticipation is worse than the ensuing situation. Of course they scream, what else could they do? Since the dawn of ages, darkness has been associated to death and terror in a way that's been rooted in our DNA. But here we get a plot where for once, darkness is synonym of life, because that's how the blind person's life is defined... and yet it doesn't make the moments in the darkness any less scary.And the whole story is based on an audacious plan that relies on the writer's creative ability in anticipating his own character's creativity. First, Suzy is the center of a plot meant to earn her trust so the three thugs can look for the doll without awakening suspicions. And progressively, she starts to realizes that something isn't right, she's capable to hear familiar footsteps or stores being opened and closed. It's a matter of time before she assembles the pieces of the puzzle, not without the help of a kid named Gloria... who lives upstairs.\nThe film sets the tone and the mood in an effective way, and no matter the flaws that come in the way, the ending is satisfying because we're kept at the edge of our seat, rooting for a heroine twice, because she's blind and because she's Audrey Hepburn... and because she's facing a villain who mans business although I'm not much a fan of the way Arkin played his Raut like a master of disguise, it looked too farcical for such a no-nonsense film. Anyway, after \"The Miracle Worker\", I wanted to stay on the 'blind' theme and watch another classic, so \"Wait Until Dark\" came as a natural choice.I expected another tale of damsel in distress lost in an apartment and I got that but a little more I didn't expect, a film that seems to exploit in a playful way the idea of having a blind protagonist surrounded by criminals and turn a promising gimmick into a frightening and unforgettable experience, especially during the final ten minutes. Indeed, if one must judge a thriller by its climax then Terence Young\" \"Wait Until Dark\" ISa masterpiece.What can be blamed though is that it take a little time to build up and that the film is so cautious in not letting many loose ends that we ought to find a few glaring ones. Roger Ebert kept wondering why Suzy didn't lock the door, I saw the film carefully and I guess that one can be so distraught he might forget. I had just forgot my glasses today and have difficulty writing right now, quite fitting for the movie. But I'm not giving up easily on the film, there are a few contrivances here and there but Audrey Hepburn gives the kind of performances where she encourages our own suspension of disbelief.From the very start we can feel that she smells something fishy, too many things happen in a short span of times, two many intrusions, a cop, an old friend, but in the confusion, she seems to maintain her trust on Crenna because their interaction seems to work despite its malevolent starter, which speaks for the film's effort to maintain a realistic touch.And it is realistic from our own POV, we wander through the house enough time to get used to it, to feel the place and then like Suzy, be able to anticipate the moves and counter-attack the bad guys. The building allows her to count on the help of her neighbor Gloria and determine whom she can trust. Some users said why didn't she leave the place, well maybe because if there's one place to be blind, you're your home....Not that it says much, it all comes to the point where she realizes she must destroy all the sources of light in the film (almost)... if she's got to face a ruthless killer, let's make it a fair fight... one wouldn't believe she could pull off but \"The Miracle Worker\" thought me a blind and deaf person could become a writer, I can buy that a blind woman can do it. Still, the film isn't interested in the what she does but how she does and this is where it gets is spot as one of the scariest and thrilling experiences ever.Young knows how to dispose a few jump scares and taking the ultimate step by plunging the screen in full darkness. If only for that, this is an experience any movie lover should live.",

            "content": "After watching Breakfast at Tiffany's and Roman Holiday, I saw that Audrey had talent to go with the looks and I quickly garnered a near obsession for her! Wait Until Dark may not be her most attractive role, even though she is extremely gorgeous in this film, but it is definitely one of the best performances I have ever seen by anyone. Coupled with this fantastic performance is a brilliant plot build up. The scheme put together by the men looking for the doll is very clever as, although contrived, takes full advantage of Susy's blindness. Even more clever is how Susy works out their scheme, mainly by using her heightened sense of hearing, something the men did not take in to consideration. These slow, intricate developments are fascinating to watch but most importantly, lead to a climatic ending reaching Hitchcock levels of suspense. As the title of the film suggests, you really have to wait until dark to fully appreciate how well made this film is. When Susy turns the tables on Roat (Alan Arkin) by smashing all the lights, the cliff hanger is nail biting and it isn't until the very last shot that you see who comes out on top. Hepburn is especially well cast in this role as it is very unnerving to see such an icon go through such an ordeal.As I mentioned, Audrey Hepburn's portrayal of Susy Hendrix is an all time great performance. The way she depicts being blind is very convincing; the frustration at her condition is very clear to see and her mannerisms appear perfect. This is a great role for Audrey as she often was cast in lovely films that lacked edge. This, along with Charade, packs a bit more of a punch and gives her something to grind her beautiful teeth in to. It's a shame she went on a ten year hiatus because this could have been the start of a new era in her film roles. Alan Arkin is excellent as Roat. Although he should maybe leave impersonations to someone else, he is the personification of evil and comes across very well as a ruthless crook. The lack of remorse and his apparent calmness are very effective in letting the audience know what they're dealing with. Richard Crenna also puts in a good performance as the semi likable Mike. He is charming but also very impatient with regards to the doll, the only thing that Susy appears to be ignorant on.As the film almost exclusively takes place in a flat, there is an overwhelmingly claustrophobic feel going on which does wonders with regards to the suspense build up. The director has done a great job in making Susy appear vulnerable and making you really care about what is going to happen. The low lighting levels create a very intense atmosphere that reflects the dark goings on within the film. To compliment the direction perfectly is the haunting score. The repetitive piano pounding in parts is almost numbing, as if you were losing one of your senses, and the high tempo music in the climatic finale makes it as if you can almost see what is happening even though there is no light.This is how thrillers, should be; style and substance in equally huge doses. I can not believe how little is thought of Wait Until Dark as it easily competes with many Hitchcock films that are regarded as classics. Maybe the genre was out of fashion at the time of release but it really does deserve ample praise as it kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat.",

You have here a woman whose screen persona is completely built around her classy Continental elegance, whose personal life was marked by serious-minded humanitarianism, and you drop her into a horror-thriller about a heroin dealer antagonising a blind woman - it all seems so incomprehensible that Hepburn's seventeenth starring role should be such a grubby, grotty turn from all of the princesses and doe-eyed gamines and society women . Well it payed off big .\nAudrey Hepburn received her fifth (and last) Oscar nomination for effectively playing a blind woman in this well-executed thriller based on the Broadway smash hit; equally good are the villains, played by the young Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna. . I would go so far as to say that Hepburn's blend of weakness and fortitude is the key ingredient to everything else in Wait Until Dark, providing exactly the correct note of nervous ambivalence that makes this such a superlative, viscerally effective thriller.",

Let's move on shall we.The movie is a great example of a suspense/thriller, there is almost always some tension, but it does get a bit slow at times.

            "content": "It doesn't really matter, all things considered, that the husband is patronising and unlovable, or that the closing shot - a close-up of Hepburn as she hugs her husband in relief - says \"the horrible deal is over\" but not \"the happy marriage may now resume\".  It's Hepburn's story and he plays no role in it.  Still, if he were nicer, it could only improve matters: we'd be able to care more when the villains tell lies about him behind his back, for one thing.It DOES matter (a little) that the doll is valuable to the villains because it contains heroin.  I'm sure this \"topical\" reference felt like a modernising touch in 1967, but really - why bother building such elaborate schemes around a few teabags' full of a drug which any self-respectable crime syndicate will be importing by the tonne?  The mere fact that heroin is a SUBSTANCE, that there's always more of it where the last lot came from, ruins the effect.  No, some more traditional item hidden inside the doll would have made more sense: either jewels (which might be, for all we know, unique), or information (the password to a bank account, industrial secrets on microfilm, the key to a safe, some such).Perhaps I'm being harsh because I can't help making unfair comparisons with other Hepburn vehicles - ones directed by the likes of William Wyler, Blake Edwards, and Stanley Donen, which are made of finer stuff altogether.  But compare the script for this with the script to, say, \"Charade\" - both clever in different ways, you'd have a hard time saying for sure which is better; the tight way the story is constructed in \"Wait Until Dark\" is just marvellous, and the neat idea of keeping the action confined to the one place and most of the time to the one room is realised in a natural, uncontrived way.  On paper this is one of THE great thrillers.  Terence Young brings it competently to the screen, too, making sure we know the layout backwards, not making a single mistake that would allow the tension to collapse.",

Audrey Hepburn is always excellent but this time she gets to play with a different type of source material. Wait Until Dark is based on a crime thriller drama play by Frederick Knott and Hepburn plays the lead, who happens to be blind. I haven't seen many films based on blind characters, but it seems like she nailed this role. It's an electrifying Hitchcockian type film.I say that because it has all the makings of a Hitchcock film. Our lead is a woman who is quite the underdog, there is a mystery, and it nearly takes place all in one room. Alan Arkin plays the main antagonist and is quite memorable. But I think he could have used more development and screen time to make the climax even more impactful. The story is about Susy (Hepburn) who gets caught up in a drug deal unknowingly. The men will go to deep measures to secure their heroine, but Hepburn seems set on doing what's right. It has some classic intense scenes that can probably be classified as horror, and when you have a likable lead like Hepburn, it can be difficult to watch.Henry Mancini gives us the eerie score that compliments the visual thrills incredibly well. Even almost 50 years later, the film holds up extremely well. Even if the film is directed more like a play than an actual film, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience. Plus, Audrey Hepburn said 'Batman' in the movie. That just about combines two of my favorite things.

Such a feat is accomplished by great acting and a good storyline.

She would return in 1976's ROBIN AND MARIAN, which failed to score a big success, and 1979'S BLOODLINE, a major flop the poor woman should never have lowered herself to make. A couple of TV movies followed, but Hepburn's Hollywood career essentially ended with WAIT UNTIL DARK.Having said that, the lady really goes out on a high note here. WAIT UNTIL DARK is a taut, tense, high-energy thriller that has the added fillip of a single claustrophobic set; the film is based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit, and aside from one short scene out on the sidewalk, all of the action takes place inside the Greenwich Village basement apartment of Susy Hendrix, a woman blinded about a year ago in an accident who is attending blind school and trying to adjust, and her husband Sam (Efrem Zimbalist Jr), a photographer who is supportive of her efforts at independence, sometimes too much so: he tends to nag at her a bit, and at one moment, she cries out at him, \"Do I HAVE to be the world's champion blind lady?\" to which he responds almost as loudly, \"Yes!\" We soon see that Sam has his reasons for wanting Susy to manage on her own as much as she can: a photographer's hours are somewhat unpredictable, and he never knows when he may be called away on a job. Sam has enlisted the help of their ten-year-old neighbor Gloria (Julie Herrod, the only actor from the Broadway cast to make it to the film), but there is some tension between the girl and Susy at first; Susy thinks Gloria has been moving the furniture around to confuse her, and Gloria, neglected by her mother, is somewhat sullen and takes it out on Susy.But it is not Gloria who is moving the furniture. For the apartment has already been invaded by three men: Mike Talman (Richard Crenna), one \"Sergeant\" Carlino (Jack Weston), and Alan Arkin as Harry Roat Jr from Scarsdale, one of the most fascinating screen villains I have ever seen.The plot revolves around a doll filled with heroin that a woman smuggled in from Montreal to New York. As the opening credits roll, the woman arrives in New York, sees someone who frightens her waiting at the terminal, and quickly hands the doll off to Sam. He ends up taking it home and then it goes missing.To reveal anything more than the basic setup would be unfair; this is a hell of a good thriller, with great performances all around by the entire cast, especially Hepburn and Arkin, who face off in a final showdown in the apartment that will literally have you jumping out of your seat.Hepburn was only thirty-nine when she made this, and looked easily ten years younger, but as a final bow, this is a film the lady should have been very proud of.",

            "content": "Limited thrills and suspense in this film version of the Knott play with Hepburn playing a blind woman who is terrorized by three crooks in pursuit of a doll that has heroin inside of it. Arkin is slightly menacing as the psychotic Harry Roat, while Crenna and Weston blandly portray the other crooks. Zimbalist turns in for two or three scenes as Audrey's love interest, a photographer. Audrey was Oscar nominated, but I didn't fully buy her blind bit. The ending was too rushed and lacked excitement. Lee Remick and Robert Duvall starred in the original stage production of the play, while Mira Sorvino and the oddly cast Quentin Tarantino (as Roat) starred in the much criticized revival a year or so.",

Arkin overplays his part making his character seem almost cartoonish at times.  Hepburn is the one that makes the picture.  Her keen ability to project her characters slow realization of the terror that is out there is what really creates the tension.  Well choregraphed with creative use of lighting.",

            "content": "This is a movie I have seen probably at least a dozen times, but I'm ashamed to admit that it's taken me that long to really understand the nuances of the 'evil plot'. For those of you who - like me - may not absorb each detail of a complicated scheme with multiple people involved -- this review is for you.When I first watched, I LOVED this movie. So, I will start by saying: even if you don't understand the scheme of the criminals, you will still find this movie captivating.It becomes much more interesting to really understand the plot, because it brings an appreciation for how much weight Susy (Audrey) carried in her role as a recently-blind woman.Facts: Susy was only recently blind a year prior to this set of events. She also found her husband AFTER she was blinded, so she theoretically has never had her sight while with him. They live in a brownstone (i think) in NYC, and he is a professional photographer. She goes to blind school.The first thing that struck me was the scene; NYC is the perfect gritty backdrop for criminals who prey on Susy and husband Sam's home as the location of one very-wanted doll. The doll in question means nothing to Susy or her husband, until it becomes so valuable that both of their lives are at stake. A side role, Gloria, is played by a talented actress who also starred in the stage version of this movie. She is the sassy - but important- little pre-teen who lives in the same building with her mom.All of this background is helpful because you'll begin to see a revolving door of criminals, with fake disguises, plus many presumed inferences that are expected of the audience.My advice is: Watch and listen from the start. Pay attention to actual names, relationship references, timelines, and motivations. Listen to each word that the bad guys say, even if it seems unimportant.Remember that Susy is not a fool.And finally, expect to appreciate that no one is an island. Even if we have all of our 5 senses and our wits, we can be outsmarted, and the least likely people to help us often do.Best aspects of this movie: the properly 60s decor, the curated wardrobe from Ms. Hepburn's own closet (for herself), the inherent hilarity of the bad guys, and several audience-shocker moments.",

            "content": "(some spoilers)Wait Until Dark is a wonderful suspense film, which explores different modes of sensation. Having a blind woman as the central character allowed Terrence Young lots of choices with angles and lighting. However, I believe that the sound in this film was carefully exploited as an identifying element and a tool for our blind heroine. \tRight away we are brought to the beginning of the crime and the origins of the very valuable doll. The radio heard in the background is the main audio element on the shanty apartment where the package is constructed. Through the noise we can tell the setting in somewhere in France, therefore establishing an international drug plot. The radio sets up the size of the playing field, and later the ambiguity regarding all of the major players.\tLater on when Roat (Arkin) goes back into the closet, the opening of the door reveals Lisa (the doll's transporter) stuffed in a body bag, hung from a coat hanger. She is clearly dead, but her lifelessness seems to be the focus of this shot. As Roat starts to fiddle with the bag, the next cut shows Suzy in her living room listening for clues. We hear the body tumble from the hanging position with a thunderous thud. Although we do not witness the body falling, this technique creates an audio point of view. We hear (and see) what the main character does, in turn we can infer the severity of the situation. \tIt is interesting to note that Hepburn's character totally relies on smell, touch and noise to comprehend and communicate. The surprise in the film is that, in many instances, information is withheld from the audience so we can appreciate the struggle this character endures. We only notice the squeak in Roat's shoe after it is mentioned, but we remember that Young used cut way shots on the shoe and Suzy's reaction before she divulged this discovery. The blinds are used as a way of communicating silently to the van across the street, but Suzy later reveals that she was suspicious of its constant use. When she finally knows that a van is outside, Suzy breaks down in terror with a sense of pity. It would seem that she almost feels sorry for herself for not knowing this element sooner. We do not expect her to feel this way, but her diligent husband might expect more from `the world's champion blind lady.'A dark, seedy thriller.*** (of ****)",

            "content": "Harry Roat Jr, from Scarsdale, is a bad man who is after a doll loaded with drugs which has inadvertently wound up in the Manhattan basement apartment of Susy Hendrix, an innocent blind lady. Roat enlists some criminal associates and devises an elaborate scam to steal back the doll, but doesn't count on Susy's intelligence and resourcefulness.To paraphrase Sophie Tucker, a good villain is hard to find. Sometimes a really great villain lifts a film up and up beyond its potential (Lee Van Cleef in Il Bueno Il Brutto Il Cattivo, Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, Martin Sheen in The Dead Zone) and Harry Roat Jr, from Scarsdale, is one of these rare breeds. Arkin captures just exactly the right mix of ruthless intelligent psychopath and heartless thug, and literally everything he says and does in this movie is both captivating and horrifying. Kudos also to Hepburn, who gets both her extreme physical and emotional performance bang on; it's her helplessness that sells the story's tension, but she's never one-dimensional or stupid. The supporting cast all fit snugly into their parts, allowing the complicated who's-fooling-who scenario and the sharply observed dialogue to flow (one of my many favourite lines is when Crenna asks Weston where Arkin is and he replies, \"Who knows. Out beating up old ladies.\"). This is a thriller which starts slowly but methodically cranks up the pressure to boiling point as layer upon layer of horrors are piled upon poor Suzy. Henry Mancini's score ties knots in your stomach and the photography by Charles Lang (an Old Hollywood pro who shot The Cat And The Canary, Ace In The Hole, The Magnificent Seven, countless others) is nigh-on perfect. The chilling shot of Arkin's blank face with his Teashade sunglasses emerging out of the darkness as he knifes Crenna in the back and pushes him down the stairs, is for me one of the most terrifying and memorable in all cinema. Brilliantly scripted by Robert Carrington, based on a great play by Frederick Knott (who also wrote Dial M For Murder). Produced by actor Mel Ferrer, Hepburn's husband at the time; she officially retired from acting after this movie to raise a family, but subsequently made a few more film appearances. Well directed by Young - best known for directing three James Bond flicks in the sixties - with a hair-raising final twenty minutes which are amongst the most nail-biting in any movie, and should be watched with the lights out.",

It's ingenious though overly complicated, and notable for some terrific moments, most notably in the final section.Looking like a beatnik gone bad, Alan Arkin gives a love-it-or-hate-it performance as a psychopath. I really liked him, he was strange and menacing and mysterious. My girlfriend's main reaction seemed to be, \"what on earth is that accent supposed to be.\" (I'd say outer New York or New Jersey, but who knows.)The story is convoluted and requires characters to be alternately smart and dumb, particularly Hepburn as the blind woman, who veers back and forth from obtuse and incompetent to clever and observant; sometimes all of that in a five-minute period. I was also really creeped out by her relationship with her husband. She was needy and pathetic and he seemed cold and demanding. I'm wondering if this is the result of the movie only being 90 minutes - the play was undoubtedly longer, and perhaps spent more time on the dynamics of the relationship, establishing why she grovels and why he seems borderline cruel, even in the final scene. On the other hand, maybe people were just so used to this dynamic in the '60s that it didn't seem strange back then.Overall, this is an entertaining suspense film of the sort Hitchcock made, and well worth seeing for all its flaws.",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn is such a sweet, precious concoction that it's hard to imagine her in a thriler. That is, it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to kill her. In \"Charade\" (a widely available hybrid romcom-thriller that epitomizes the 60s), the villains are so quirky and even cute in a Looney Tunes kind of way that you never really feel like she's in danger.In contrast, \"Wait Until Dark\" is a thriller that pushes that line. Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman, Susy, who's husband becomes implicated in a drug-trafficking scheme when a doomed mule passes him a doll with a stash in it. Like a Hithcock film, \"Wait Until Dark\" comes with its own meaningless McGuffin. A cold-blooded criminal (a young Alan Arkin fresh off his first Oscar nomination) enlists two fellow thugs to weasel the doll out of Suzy.With Suzy's impaired sense of sight, the film is simultaneously a psychological thrill ride while maintaining a light tone as the two parties (Suzy is aided in part by an adolescent neighbor) engage in a battle of wits. The film wrings out a certain dramatic irony to the situation as we are privy to more than Suzy's point of view but she is still the character we are most emotionally attached to.Adapted from a play by Frederick Knott, director Terrence Young milks the tension through keeping the play almost entirely in her apartment.",

            "content": "One of the best crime thrillers. The premise would seem to indicate a talky, claustrophobic hostage-with-hoods drama. Wait Until Dark covers that territory, but with a surprising amount of action and subtlety. Alan Arkin makes a great slimy creep as the lead crook Roat, in all his incarnations. Richard Crenna's Mike and Jack Weston's Carlino make suitably reluctant, though equally deceptive cohorts. At first it's hard to 'see' the point of having Audrey Hepburn's Susy be blind; that device turns out to be both a help and a hindrance for the criminals.Instead of meekly submitting to the criminals, Susy slowly but steadily figures out that these guys aren't her husband Sam's (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.'s) old Marine buddy, a cop, and an eccentric father and son. That they try such elaborate deceptions complicates their chances to retrieve the missing doll, but cleverly make it more plausible that she'll give it up. One thing they didn't count on was the neighbor girl Gloria (Julie Herrod) interfering, and acting literally as Susy's eyes. The fact that Gloria's had the doll for part of the time is one of those apparently meaningless events that frustrates the criminals' attempt to control everything.Susy's plan to turn the tables on these jokers is as good as their role-playing plan. Putting out all the lights in the apartment takes advantage of her blindness, plus she rigs up a nasty chemical in the potted plant. As many others have said, the long ending is chilling, incredibly tense, and visually stunning. The black-out sequences as Susy taunts the gasoline-soaked Roat with matches are eerie and wild. She's again vulnerable, as Roat, stabbed and dying, is able to lunge at her like a crazed zombie.It would seem that the criminals would've cut the phone sooner, but then they wouldn't have been able to communicate and coordinate their actions. The fact that Roat double-crosses the other two isn't surprising; they were planning the same fate for him. Since the doll could be anywhere, and in fact it's constantly moved in the course of the movie, it more or less forces a degree of cooperation between the criminals and Susy. Their little ploy to convince her that Sam is somehow mixed up with the recently murdered Lusa (Samantha Jones) is not very convincing. On the other hand, we learn that Susy hasn't known Sam long enough to know all possible skeletons in his closet, not to mention that their short romance and marriage gives Mike plausibility as Sam's old friend. Sam is kind of a jerk--he condescending to Susy--in an odd way, Mike almost seems more appealing.Some things do strain the suspension of disbelief. I see why Lisa hands the doll off to Sam; but how does Roat find out that she did? And how does he know that Sam lives in Lisa's old place? I guess he doesn't know until he goes there to find Lisa...I probably missed something. Anyway, although Gloria fits into the plot well, why doesn't Susy have her go home and call the police? The three criminals can't be everywhere in the apartment building. Despite some plot holes, Wait Until Dark is an excellent suspense thriller, unique, and well worth a bunch of viewings. 10/10.",

In JFK airport, the woman, knowing that she is being followed by her partner in crime, hands the doll to a stranger that she met on the airplane, telling him that she will fetch it later. She intends \"going into business for herself.\" The stranger, NY photographer Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.), takes the doll to his basement apartment, where he lives with his blind wife Susy (Audrey Hepburn). Before long Sam cannot locate the doll. So we have the setting for the story: there will be attempts to recover a lost doll stuffed with heroin.A short time after, two small-time crooks recently released from prison, Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston), are contacted by sinister Harry Roat (Alan Arkin, Jr.) to meet at Sam and Susy's apartment. When they arrive, Sam and Susy are obviously not there. After showing them Lisa's body, which he stowed inside the bedroom closet, he convinces the two to help him find the doll for $2000 each. They leave the apartment. Throughout the rest of the movie, they enter when they please. Inexplicably, the front door is rarely bolted, if ever.After Sam and Susy are introduced together, Sam has to leave on a short business strip to New Jersey. Also, Sam and Susy's neighbor Shatner leaves for the weekend. Susy is alone. The three men \u2013 Roat, Talman, and Carlino \u2013 variously attempt to deceive Susy by means of false identification, but to no avail. She of course knows nothing about the drugs. Only later do we learn that Susy's young teen neighbor who lives upstairs Gloria (Julie Herrod) \u2013 who has been paid to help Susy on errands \u2013 has \"borrowed\" the doll. Now Gloria can be troublesome, although she will show her usefulness later. Meanwhile, with Gloria's help, Susy sees through the motives of the three men and hides the doll. She refuses to reveal its whereabouts to Talman, but he, respecting Susy's courage, decides to give up and go away, along with Carlino.Soon the psychopath Roat kills Carlino, and intent on getting his hand on a fortune in illicit drugs, stabs Talman to death in Susy's apartment. The telephone wires having already been cut, he confronts trapped and blind Susy alone. The woman, expecting him, has evened the odds a bit by breaking all of the light bulbs and pouring a chemical into a flower pot that she will shove into his face. Her blindness has given her an advantage in darkness. Despite all of her actions, Susy is eventually overcome by Roat and allows him to take the doll after he promises not to hurt her in any way. Savoring his victory, Roat cuts open the doll and stuffs his pockets with the heroin powder packets. Meanwhile Susy arms herself with a butcher knife, just in case it is necessary. Instead of leaving quietly with his treasure, creepy Roat breaks his promise and says that he is going to take Susy into the bedroom. In the subsequent struggle, Susy stabs Roat in the stomach. He appears to die, but as Susy stumbles across the apartment, Roat leaps and causes Susy to trip. In the darkened apartment, with no light except that of the jam-opened refrigerator, Roat, pulling out the knife that was used to stab him, staggers toward Susy, intent on murdering her. In the tensest of moments, she cowers helplessly behind the opened refrigerator door, trying to pull out the electrical cord to deny Roat any light. She screams as Roat dies and police sirens are heard. Sam, Gloria, and the police rush into the apartment.The climax is as memorable as they come. No question about it, the film is indeed a nail-biter, a superior suspense drama. Lee Remick had the prominent lead role in the 1966 NY Broadway stage play of the same name (which this much younger writer attended in the front row). Attractive and classy, Audrey Hepburn looked younger than her years. The dearly-loved Dutch-English performer was a master at playing vulnerable women. Note Hepburn's performance with Cary Grant in \"Charade\" four years earlier. Before that the multi-lingual actress starred in such films as \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), \"Sabrina\" (1954), \"The Nun's Story\" (1959), \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), and \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). She received an Academy Award nomination for her role as Susy Hendrix; she had won the Award for \"Roman Holiday.\" Italian-American Richard Crenna was known for his TV work, especially as Lucas McCoy in \"The Real McCoys\" (1957-1963). His work outside of TV included his role as Trautman in the \"Rambo\" movie series. Efrem Zimbalist Jr., who is nearly a century old, began his movie career as Tony Monetti in \"House of Strangers\" with Edward G. Robinson. He starred in the TV series \"77 Sunset Strip\" (1958-1964), and \"The F.B.I.\" (1965-1974). Multi-talented Alan Arkin, who had several Academy Award nominations, finally won for his performance in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" (2006).",

There are three people who are looking for the doll. The man is Audrey Hepburn's husband. She is a recently blinded woman. Her husband has to go out on some pretext. The three goons come up with a diabolical plan to get the doll from her. Will they succeed? This is one of the most gripping and original movies I have seen recently. The story twists and twists and the viewer is totally mesmerized. Alan Arkin who plays the ring leader is chilly as a cunning murderer who is hellbent on getting the doll. He is ably assisted by Richard Crenna. But the movie belongs to Audrey HepBurn. As the blind woman, she is absolutely brilliant. Her mannerisms are spot on and the credit for this should also go to the writer who has written her part so well. The end sequence is terrifying and brilliant. the best part is that the movie is 45 years old but still feels refreshingly new. 4 out of 5 for Wait Until Dark. Don't wait. watch it ASAP.",

My mom, who hates the thrillers that are out these days, suggested I watch \"Wait Until Dark\" with her.  It was on TV and she told me that it was a thriller that scared her when she was my age.  Knowing the movie wouldn't have the action packed sequences like \"Scream\", I sarcastically said to my mom \"It must be an exciting thriller.\"  And indeed it was.  In fact I think I enjoyed it more than my mom did. This movie has a well written script.  I bought Hepburn's blindness. I especially liked Arkin's performances with the three different characters. I also thought Arkin's smooth talk was a nice touch as well as his sunglasses.  Gloria was a good comic relief from the suspense that built-up inside me; I still can't get over that \"girl scout cookie\" line.  I never get tired of seeing this movie whenever it airs on AMC.  They definitely don't make this kind of movie anymore and I wished they did. There were about 2 confusing scenes. And at times, Hepburn would get too worked up in being blind, that she'd have a delayed reaction on her hearing as well. But there is no doubt that she did an incredible performance. I don't think I have yet seen a thriller that was so smart, sly, and sassy as this one.  \"Wait Until Dark\" is a thriller with class -- something thrillers these days are missing out on.",

            "content": "The set-up of this movie is pretty interesting- a group of criminals (led by the extremely nasty Harry Roat - Alan Arkin, in a terrible performance) have to find a dope-filled doll which accidentally ended up in the hands of a young woman.  The catch is, she's blind- so as long as they can get her alone, and concoct a story, they can look all they want for the doll.  It was originally a play, and boy is that obvious- all the action takes place inside one apartment.  Actually, all the action is locked inside one apartment.  There is a definite claustrophobia to this film; its essentially just a series of people going in and out of the place, enacting a ludicrously overcomplicated plot to find the doll.  The movie is basically relentless exposition, and the only thing that staves off boredom is the knowledge that Something bad is going to happen.  No script could get away with such tedium and not deliver a payoff, and this one doesnt.  The infamous \"shocker\" ending so many people talk about is nowhere to be found. I imagine the ending would be much more effective live onstage, though I cant imagine sitting through the entire thing in a theater.In any event, Audrey Hepburn's performance is very very good, as is Richard Crenna as another of the criminals; but Arkin's misses the mark completely. And noone is helped by the amateurish script, which is long on plot machinations but short on realistic dialogue.  Really, the only good scenes are the first- a brilliantly conceived scene in which Hepburn walks around her bedroom not realizing there is a dead woman hanging in her closet- and the last, in which Hepburn and Arkin do battle in near-darkness (lit only by the refrigerator light.)  But again, I was sorely disappointed that the payof- promised by the film's very atmosphere- never came.  (I would have been much more interested if Hepburn's husband turned out to be one of the criminals, and he killed her after the police left.)",

            "content": "The surface of Wait Until Dark presents an emotional, becoming performance from Audrey Hepburn, a wonderfully entertaining villain by the great Alan Arkin, the perfect urban atmosphere distinguished in 1960s cinema, and very tense and extensive scenes of suspense. Also, on the surface of Wait Until Dark is a glaring mess of a script. How did the laughable, almost Pythonesque logical errors of this movie whisk by us? Imagine if the Mona Lisa turned out to be smiling with her mouth open all these years and we missed it? That's how my last viewing of Wait Until Dark felt. I felt stupid. And that's what we all are, because we all loved this film when we first saw it. But watch it a second time. Ask yourself the following questions.Why, when this woman is blind, do these men need to physically disguise themselves? These men, these hoodlums, try to convince Hepburn through a laborious scheme that her husband has been implicated in a crime and the only way to protect him is to surrender the doll which secretly contains heroin that they are striving to get, so why do they disguise themselves in any way at all? She is blind. If they took care of the doll situation quickly by knocking on the door, subduing her, finding the doll and leaving, she wouldn't be able to implicate them no matter how hard she tried. Once again, she is blind. If you wear gloves and don't leave any fingerprints, she hasn't a chance. The two hours this film spends on their scheme is two hours wasted. The young girl of course can't identify them because of their disguises, but then again what would she see anyway if the thugs took care of the situation in the way I just explained? It would take a few minutes and they'd have their doll!Also, the staging of this film is very laughable. For instance, near the beginning, there is a stand-off between Alan Arkin and both Richard Crenna and Jack Weston. They grab blunt objects throughout the room like chairs, bottles, and tripods. Crenna finds it to be even more threatening by swinging a camera by its strap in the air as if it were a lasso or a mace. Come on. Is this West Side Story? Or no. Is this the Batman series with Adam West and Burt Ward? The actors are horribly uncomfortable in this scene, and the scene has zero effect. There is another instance in this film of a couple of scenes where people walk into the apartment already talking to whom they expect to be in it without even setting eyes on it and when they do witness the room after walking into it, they are taken aback by something. Do any of you readers walk into a room blasting your voice before you've even opened the door more than a crack anyway?Wait Until Dark may be directed and acted with assurance, as if it were a seamless thriller, and the climax is actually quite a breathtaker whether you realize the gaping Godzilla footprints in the plot and staging, but why has this film, and the play it's based on, gone on to gain notoriety and acclaim? Are these glaring, screaming flaws actually hiding in plain sight?",

The opening shot is just fabulous, in which Samantha Jones leaves her downtown Montreal place with a dope-filled little doll, intending to smuggle it to New York. After we hear Henry Mancini's eerie title tune, and we are already in New York, we are certain that something, is indeed, going to go wrong for one of the characters. Jones sees a mean looking, scenery-chewing, cool ol' Alan Arkin watching her ... she runs to this man that she met on the airplane, and gives him the doll, bumbling some senseless excuse, and runs off to encounter her cruel destiny... That's when we meet Jones's ex-partners in crime, con-men Weston and Crenna, going to this New York apartment in St. Luke's Place, thinking they will meet her again - but they meet Arkin, instead, who is eager to find the doll and will stop at nothing to obtain it. Both are invited by Arkin to work for him, in finding the doll. They accept, only to find that that was not Samantha's place at all, that was the apartment of the man in the airplane - to whom Samantha gave the doll away - and his blind wife Audrey, and Samatha was dead inside the couple's closet! Weston and Crenna try to escape, but Arkin blackmails them into doing the job, since their finger-prints were all over the place. So, they quickly concoct a complicated plot to make Suzy give the doll away, while her husband's at Asbury Park, working. What follows is a gathering of great performances, and a series of truly frightening moments, building up to the shocking, nail-biting, right-up-the-wall driving climax.

            "content": "Wait Until Dark (1967) is a thriller about a recently blinded woman Susy Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn). She is learning to live with her new lifestyle in her and her husband's apartment. One day when Susy's husband Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) returns from his commute, he unintentionally ends up being a drug courier. When Sam goes to another trip and leaves Susy alone, the drug criminals start to seek the drug load. All they know is that the drugs are hidden inside a doll. The leader of the gang (Alan Arkin) starts making up disguises and different characters to get to Susy's apartment. The only help Susy's getting is from a little girl next door, Gloria (Julie Herrod).The film's milieu is the apartment in New York, where Susy lives in. She can't see anything, but she knows the place, which gives her an advantage. But then, the criminals have their sight, which gives them an advantage. The whole movie builds around the blindness of Susy. The criminals wouldn't be able to fool her, if she wasn't blind. All the scenes about this were brilliantly built. The director of many Bond films, Terence Young achieved to bring a lot of sympathy to the milieu as Audrey Hepburn did to her character.You can't call the plot the most original one out there. A lot of movies have used blindness as a way to bring sympathy to the character. Usually other senses like hearing, are stronger with these characters, for example Daredevil (2003). But still I found this the best \"blindness-film\" I've seen. It's well written, directed and acted, it's about all an entertaining film needs. The excitement is built brilliantly as we follow Susy's attempt to survive. Wait Until Dark's suspense grows until the final duel, (where the audience actually gets blind as well) which is one of the most unforgettable ones in the history of cinema!So if you're looking for an exciting thriller, this is a really good choice. Even that it has its minor flaws, which I don't even care to mention, it holds your interest much better than thrillers of today do. Perhaps the content of the film could be a little trickier or sophisticated, but it can't even be compared with the garbage you see from Hollywood today.7.5/10 High class entertainment! I would give it 7.5/10 but IMDb doesn't allow that. You won't be disappointed with this.",

The story basically centers around a recently blinded lady living in Grenwich Village and a missing doll that becomes the hunt for a group of unsavory individuals.The doll ,which is very valuable-having stiched inside a much sought-over recent shipment of heroine.The kind to kill for. In the hunt are 2 almost world-weary mutt and jeffish characters in the form of Richard Crenna and Jack Weston,wonderfully paired together as thieves who just so happen to pick wrong apartment for looting job.And along comes the never better cast and arch villian of sorts to render his interpretation of how to proceed with action and how to offer up con game for thrill of the hunt.None other than Alan Arkin,cast against type and totally in control of situation and circumstance of his character and beyond.Whereas Crenna plays a believably concerned and somewhat compassionate thug,and Weston a street-wise and untrusting co-hort to Crenna,Arkin steals the show.Arkin is diabolical,cunning,clever and manages to outwit and out act with a snidely dervish sense of self,never felt from him since.His Scarsdale toughness and devil may care pitch to nasal voice ,gives an abundant meanness and sociopathic quality to character.Hepburn is not far behind in creating a character that evokes a rapid and intense following to.She,very believably creates pathos and inner charm from her dissability and opportunity to exploit,for our instruction and our acting appreciation.The viewer really develops a concern for her character in all its vunerability and ease of access. Since virtually all of the action centers around coming's and going's of apartment and builds with each new developing scene,we start to feel her predicament,more and more. With a cat and mouse plot that ravels and unravels right before our eyes,we are more than privvy to things that even our heroine's # 1 blind lady can neither see but can still feel,having enough senses to know when but not exactly where,that danger lurks.And danger is the name of this tense,nail-biting thriller,sure to envelop one with a menacing sense of blind accuracy.Or hopefully so.  5 out of 5 star  or 10/10 for an unparalleled look into the eye's and mind of fear.Dig Daddio's.",

It's hard to be seriously frightened when what the bad guys are doing is impossible to believe.Would real drug dealers go to such lengths for what appears to be perhaps a quarter of a kilo of heroin, street value $20,000, tops? Would serious bad guys engage in elaborate measures, including costumes and play-acting, in an attempt to fool Susie into revealing the location of the doll? In real life, one of them would put a knife to her throat in scene one, and that would be that.Other things just misfire. Would a bad guy intent on terrorizing Susie splash gasoline all around, and then light a match, virtually assuring self-immolation just to scare her? For that matter, how many New Yorkers would leave a front door unlocked, with a note, no less, telling anyone who comes by that the door is unlocked, come on in? That's how Mike and Carlino get in so easily at the start, and how plausible is it that Carlino, instead of participating in the search for the doll, raids the refrigerator and lazily fixes himself a sandwich? That's the weakness of this movie, in this modern era: it's so implausible that it's not convincing, and hence isn't particularly frightening. We know much more, I'm afraid, about drugs and drug dealing and drug dealers, than we did in 1967.",

All the little movements/motions she does help make her blindness seem real; I'm almost convinced she wore opaque contacts for the filming; it's that good. The plot (having a blind woman defeat the bad guys by being brave/clever) is pretty original, and would have been great in the hands of someone like hitchcock. Unfortunately, most of the other actors fall short; it's not bad acting, but next to Hepburn they just seem ordinary. Another thing that pulls the movie down is how quickly Hepburn's character falls for the scheme of the bad guys (before she realizes who they).

Written by Frederick Knott (\"Dial M for Murder\") and directed by Terence Young of early James Bond fame, all of the gripping suspense occurs almost entirely within the very limited confines of a basement apartment in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. The high tension is enhanced by Henry Mancini's musical score, which generates much apprehension.Opening the film in frigid Montreal at the height of winter could not have been a mere accident. Immediately, the tone of cruel, unforgiving harshness within nature itself is established, which serves as a prelude to the cold hostility of the arch villain, played brilliantly by Alan Arkin, who dominates the action that follows. I felt chilly from the start, and the wintry atmosphere provides the perfect backdrop to Mr. Roat's icy demeanor.Roat's brutality is immediately offset by the vulnerability and gentility of his victim, Susy Hendrix, played superbly by Audrey Hepburn. I had read that Lee Remick, another favorite of mine, played Susy in the Broadway play, winning a Tony. As good as Hepburn is as Susy, I regret missing Remick on stage in this role because I can imagine her portraying the victim with just a touch of sassy Laura Manion in \"Anatomy of a Murder\", only one of many memorable performances by Ms. Remick, who was taken from us far too soon.Arkin and Hepburn were assisted very well by an excellent supporting cast, including Richard Crenna, Jack Weston, Julie Herrod, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. As someone who grew up with 1950's and 60's television, I was very surprised by Crenna's very serious dramatic skills a year earlier in \"The Sand Pebbles\" and again here as the reluctant, amateur thug who may have been falling in love with his attractive victim. Herod as Susy's nerdy but brave teenage neighbor is endearing and often overlooked in the reviews here. It's no mystery that she was picked to repeat her Broadway role.When I watched this film recently on tcm, the female host and female guest together strongly condemned the character of Sam (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) as being inhumanly cruel to his blind wife, placing a special emphasis on her alleged victimization by him. I didn't see that at all. I think that Sam's devotion to Susy motivated his demanding toughness in teaching her how to cope as a recently blinded individual living in the harsh environment of Manhattan, a place that can be exceptionally cruel and unforgiving even to sighted persons regardless of their gender. Unfortunately, I know this from years of personal experience.Hopefully, this notorious blabbermouth didn't ruin a very suspenseful film that can very easily be destroyed by too much information. With an abundance of caution, I still clicked \"spoiler alert\", just in case.",

I didn't like Sam's attitude all the way through the movie, but the end was the last straw.Perhaps his role in being so hard on her was to prepare her for the ordeal with the criminals.

There was likely some such purpose to his character, in order to make Suzy's manner believable.I actually visited IMDb.com tonight to see if other posters shared my sentiments, and no one seems to; this wasn't brought up in any of the several comments that I read.In spite of this, I also share most of the good sentiments from other posts. Wait Until Dark is a fabulous movie.",

Richard Crenna was terrifying, and had me on the edge of my seat for most of his scenes. I also thought that Julie Herrod was a very good actress, despite her age. The whole storyline was very clever, and very gripping. The ending was especially outstanding.I liked how most of the movie was based in the same place, it made the film feel especially tense.I'd love to see this film again, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "Our Beloved Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar-nominated performance, a rare genre piece in her filmography, WAIT UNTIL DARK officially bookends her salad days with a sterling turn into a terrorised victim in this Terence Young's almost one-basement-apartment-confined thriller, based on Frederick Knott's play.Susan Hendrix (Hepburn), became blind in a car accident one year earlier, now lives with her newly-espoused photographer husband Sam (Zimbalist Jr.) in NYC . Their life is quite placid, Susan goes to the blind school to adopt her new life pattern, while Sam is engaged in work, little they know, a doll sealed with cocaine is in their possession, just because Sam implausibly accepts it from the request of a complete stranger, a sultry blonde Lisa (Jones) in the airport when he travels back from Montreal. And more implausibly, Sam not only doesn't rise any suspicion towards the item, when Lisa wants it back, he even forgets its whereabouts.Soon Lisa is dispatched by her partner-in-crime Roat (Arkin) for trying to pocket all the smuggled cocaine, and he gangs up with Mike (Crenna) and Carlino (Weston), Lisa's former associates, two small-time gangsters, together they deploy a scheme to deceive the poor blind Susan into giving up the doll. One day, when Sam is away from an assignment in New Jersey, Mike pretends to be a friend of his and visits Susan, and gets her trust by being amiable and polite, then Roat stages a scene to implicate that Sam is in liaison with the dead Lisa, and Carlino's fake sergeant also shows up, all three manage to convince Susan, the doll is the key evidence can incriminate Sam with Lisa's death, so as that she can hand it to them. But, the core problem is Susan also has no idea where is the fricking doll! Until, in the midpoint of the taut narrative, it reappears in the house and it is Gloria (Herrod), a girl lives upstairs, who takes it and just in time to return it in the critical moment.After unwisely informing Mike she has the doll, Susan put her own safely in the danger especially when she realises all these three uninvited visitors are actually in the same league to retrieve the doll, how can she fight against them? Numerously missing the chance to ask help from the police, after wisely sending Gloria to meet Sam in the station, she finds out the telephone line has been cut off, so her life is hanging by a thread. Luckily there is a silver lining under the desperate situations, which is the ill feeling among the three criminals, Mike and Carlino never trust the cunning Roat, but the latter turns out to be even more insidious and callous than they can ever imagine. Eventually, it advances into a face- off between Roat and Susan, where an edge-of-the-seat episode of battling in the darkness makes Susan our reluctant heroine in the end.The film gathers some strong dissonance of its glaring dramatic license, which tempers real-life authenticity in favour of its theatrical manipulation (all the why doesn't she lock the door complain, why she doesn't call the police or ask Gloria to call the police?, etc.). Most obviously is that blind people don't need light, but what is behind her decision to light up matches during the confrontation in the dark is truly baffling. Yet cinema is the art where vision is its most direct receptor and lightning is one integral part, audience cannot stand a long-spell of pitch black while all the happenings are sheer unseeable. Although, in the climate of experimental cinema, it would be an innovative attempt to defy our usual viewing habits.Be that as it may, Hepburn's acting alone is worth your ticket, seldom seen in such a terrified state out of her comfort zone, not to mention she nails a competent emulation of a blind person. Undeniably, there is a morbid thrill to watch those top-notch actresses being put into a victimised cul-de-sac (one major reason why we love WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? 1962), is it a natural inclination? I hope so. Also, a convincing victim needs an equally relentless perpetrator, Arkin, only in his second film, is mesmerisingly menacing and utterly abhorrent to watch, a brilliant villain makes one wish there would never be anyone like him, as in reality, Susan would have no chance to survive in his merciless hands. Crenna's Mike, brings a whiff of conscience when he becomes more emotionally invested in his role-playing, not an out-and-out scoundrel, but all the same, has no chance to become the hero who saves the beautiful girl.Immensely entertaining, a great career-turn for Ms. Hepburn, which reminds us how great if she would take on more diversified roles in her mature years, trademark score from Henry Mancini, WAIT UNTIL DARK might not be the year's best, but not deserves all the backlash as well.",

            "review_title": "Audrey Hepburn Leaping in the 'Dark' Makes for an Exceptionally Tense Thriller!",
            "content": "Terence Young's Wait until Dark, based on Frederick Knott's gimmicky stage play, is as an exceptional suspense drama - a perfect example of how mood, atmosphere, music, and direction can overcome plot contrivances.The plot lurks around Suzy Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn, in a superior performance), a recently blinded NYC housewife whose husband Sam is determined to make \"the world's champion blind lady\" out of her. Although she can handle most of her daily chores alone, she still requires some help from Gloria, the dorky pre-teen girl who lives upstairs. Unbeknownst to her, Sam has accidentally played into the hands of heroin-smuggling mole who plants a dope-loaded doll in his possession. It doesn't take long for Suzy to get herself in trouble when a group of con men grease their way into her apartment in an elaborate plot to locate the doll. Two of them are merely petty con-men, but their employer Harry Roat (Alan Arkin who is unbelievably creepy) is a sinister monster. From there on, the movie ruthlessly tightens the screws of tension, all leading up to the nail-biting climax, as Roat and Suzy come face to face in her pitch-dark apartment.The film makes little effort to overcome its origins as a play, as the majority of the action takes place in Suzy's apartment. Though some of the more contrived elements of Knott's play are still intact here, Terence Young's presentation of Suzy's cloistered surroundings trumps the script's far-fetched tendencies as he manages to create a paradoxical environment of civilization devoid of human life. Also, Young makes the smart decision of setting his thriller inside a basement apartment, the cave-like arches of which have the unsettling effect of positioning Hepburn in a nondescript underground (the windows only look out on the feet of passersby, emphasizing Suzy's disconnect from her neighborhood). Terence Young's remarkable ability to create a believable oppressive locality in Wait until Dark obscures plot holes and irrationalities right up to the film's extended final showdown. By the time Suzy realizes she's completely and hopelessly alone in her apartment, the cumulative effect of Hepburn's palpable desolation and Arkin's ruthlessness, combined with Henry Mancini's overpoweringly harrowing score, bring the film to a justly celebrated climactic bacchanalia, complete with one of suspense cinema's first and most effective shock leaps.Once seen, Wait until Dark will never be forgotten. But be wary if you watch it alone. In fact, watch it with someone who likes to scream!",

Terrence young-who was better known fro directing two James Bond films-and the cast, who are better known for being in romantic comedies, show they can also perform a straight thriller.The plot is simple: would-be heroin dealers harass a blind woman looking for a heroin filled doll in her apartment while the husband is away.  Hepburn isn't a hot teenage bimbo, naive housewive, or other such annoying character we would all care less about being done away with (as is the theme in a lot of the annoying thrillers of today).  She's a happily married woman-not fiercely independent nor overly reliable on her husband (unlike most horror lambs for slaughter)-who is trying to cope with her recent loss of sight, which more or less forces her to trust other people.  The antagonists aren't the one-dimensional slashers of today and show they can be creeps and jerks without also having to be perves (another setback of contemporary youth-obsessed Hollywood) and one of them (Crenna) is sypathetic from time to time.Young's direction and Manicini's score heighten the suspense emphasizing the cold, darkness, isolation, and claustorphobia Suzy (Audrey) feels in her predicament.  And the writing is also superb as every thing we deem insignificant-there's no back door, the neighbor left for the weekend, Sam telling Suzy to figure out for herself how to use the refrigarator-comes back to haunt us.This movie will stick with you, the climax most of all.",

Two small time con artists are called on by a mysterious man named Harry Roat to help him find a doll filled with heroin. It's inside a small apartment which belongs to a man named Sam Hendrix and his wife Susy(played by Audrey Hepburn). Sam is going away on a business trip leaving Susy alone in her apartment. The con men try to convince Susy that her husband is involved in an illegal drug trade. Any ordinary woman might be able to see through these men's lies. But Susy is not ordinary... she's blind. She begins to suspect what the men are telling her isn't the truth and her suspicions grow as she is able to hear them searching her apartment and can hear the footsteps of Harry Roat even when he is pretending to be someone else. The only company she has is a little girl named Gloria and soon the men begin to loose their patience and try to find the doll by force. Susy must fend for herself and level the playing field by turning off all the lights in her apartment. But what happens when she's left alone with the most dangerous of them all?Wait Until Dark is a brilliant suspense film. What makes it work is that most of it is set in a small apartment and there's only a few shots of the outside neighborhood. This makes you feel trapped inside the house much like Susy. The casting is great as well. In whatever role Audrey Hepburn plays the audience will automatically love her. This makes us care more about her character and make us down right terrified due to the position that she's in. The man who steals the show is Alan Arkin in his role as Harry Roat. He does several tactics to scare Susy such as brushing a piece of cloth against her face and pulling her neck using a cane. It's quite heinous. The best part of the film comes at the end, where all the lights have been broken by Susy and we're forced to imagine what is going on in the dark.All in all, this is a great suspense movie. Don't be surprised if you have to sleep with a light on after finishing this.",

Dial M For Murder wouldn't work today dependent as it is on telephones being in a fixed place in the home; Wait Until Dark is still feasible but despite a nominal 'opening out' it still betrays its stage origins being largely confined to one room. At the same time things which don't matter/wouldn't be noticed in the theatre stand out like sore thumbs on film. For example Hepburn lives in the heart of Manhattan yet anytime the camera ventures outside her apartment - day OR night - there is no traffic in the street, yet miraculously the moment Efrem Zimbalist steps into the street - having been lured away by the bad guys - a cab comes around the corner. Apart from these cavils the suspense builds reasonably well and Audrey Hepburn is a masterly choice for a female in danger as more than half the world, both sexes, was in love with her and empathised with her plight. The trio of heavies are competent without being memorable and it's a good watch.",

It's later when Roth & Lisa went to Hendridx's basement apartment in Greenwich village that he murdered Lisa in order not to split the take, the heroin, with her. The big mistake that Roth made was not realizing that in her not trusting him Lisa had earlier given the doll to the Hendrix's next door neighbor 15 year old Gloria, Julie Harrod! It wasn't until Roth murdered Lisa that he realized that the doll had disappeared from right under his nose! Now concocting a plan to get the doll back Roth gets in touch with two convicted con-men Mike Talman & former NYPD Sergeant Carlino, Richard Crenna & Jack Weston, to do all the leg work, in finding the missing doll, for him. What Roth Talman & Carlino never expected is who in the end was to do them all in! Sam Hendrix's blind and barely 100 pound dripping wet wife Susy, Audrey Hepburn! It's Susy who in the end would use the one thing she had over the trio to her advantage to put them out of commission: The Dark of Night!Great performances all around especially by Audry Hepburn as the blind confused and finally heroic Susy Hendrix. Being blind the three con-artists tried to trick Susy into handing over the doll to them in telling her that without it, as an alibi, her husband Sam would be implicate in Lisa's murder. With Lisa's body being placed by the trio a block away they came up with this cock & bull story about Sam having a secret love affair with her that went sour where Sam ended up murdering her! This sham of Roth Talman & Carlino worked for a while until Susy, with the help of her young friend Julie, got wise to them. The big roadblock in the con-artists plan was that Susy had no idea where the doll was! That's until late in the movie when Julie told her! And by then all bets were off, in Susy finding out the truth, in her giving up the doll to Roth Talman & Carlino. That's in Susy knowing that Roth who eventually murdered his two partners, Talman & Carlino, will never let her live to \"see\" the light of day after he got his hands on it! ***Spoilers*** Nail biting final with Susy fighting for her life as Roth starts to bear down on her, with a match and can of gasoline, in trying to find out where she had the doll hidden. Knowing that only the dark can save her the sightless Susy knocks out all the lights in her apartment to even the playing field with the by now, in being frustrated by her at every turn, deranged and psychotic Roth! The final few minutes of the film are really heart stopping with Roth, like Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, coming back to life to get a last chance to finally put Susy, with the kitchen knife that Susy stabbed him, away for good! It's a good thing that in this instance Susy was blind! If she could see the shock alone of a crazed madden and what seemed like dead Roth flying at her would have been enough to have her drop dead from fright!",

Three thugs plot to enter her home without her suspecting their motive. They hope to take advantage of her handicap but she is smarter than they expect.This movie has a lot of potential because it has a good central idea and is well cast. However, it is severely let down by what appears to be a hastily written screenplay. It is full of gaping, in-your-face plot holes. The three thugs walk in and out of Suzy's home like it is their own. She never locks the door. Even after an hour into the movie when she understands the dangerous nature of these men and when the tension is building up, that door is still unlocked. I am sorry, but it is difficult to get completely involved when your brain is screaming \"Lock that damn door, lady!\" There are other inconsistencies too. Gloria (Julie Herrod), Suzy's occasional companion, leaves Suzy's home without the thugs noticing her and uses a telephone but Suzy does not do the same when her own telephone is disconnected. At one point she douses the lead thug, Roat (Alan Arkin), in gasoline yet she drops the matchbox from her hand instead of threatening him with it.The script also suffers from poorly written supporting characters. Sam and his goal of making Suzy the champion blind lady are obnoxious. Mike (Richard Crenna), one of the subsidiary thugs, appears to appreciate Suzy better than her husband. Roat is caricature-ish and inspires no fear in us, the audience. That is not to say the movie has no positive points. Audrey Hepburn's Suzy is charming, smart and surprises us many a times with her resourcefulness. The increased acuteness of her other senses due to the lack of sight, is well portrayed. Ms. Hepburn is always a delight to watch and it works for the movie that she is on screen for about ninety percent of the run time. Gloria is a likable little brat and it would have been nice to see more of her. Ms Hepburn and Ms. Julie share a good chemistry between them.The building up tension towards the climax is done well. The trapped feeling of the lead character is well captured because almost the entire movie is shot inside a small apartment. The darkness in some of the scenes is also well utilized. However, it is somewhat marred by the above mentioned plot holes. This is a movie that could have been one of the best ever thrillers but falls short.",

Alan Arkin (who played drug dealer Harry Roat Jr) was hot in this film despite the fact his character terrorizes Audrey Hepburn, he should of had a Oscar nomination for his role. Audrey did a great job portraying a blind character. The theme music at the start of the film is one of my favourite movie theme tunes. I have to say I didn't get scared watching this film and thought Psycho was scarier. Richard Crenna and Jack Weston were great supporting characters. If they ever remake this film I think Johnny Depp should play Harry Roat Jr.",

The little girl in the movie with glasses is a perfect side character. Most of a standout is fabulous Alan Arkin playing several roles and showing incredible skill as an actor at a young age. I can't think of many movies I've enjoyed better. The mood is set from the very intro. The set design is first class. Richard Crenna brings a kind sensitivity to the movie which was unexpected.",

Alan Arkin is fantastic as the ruthless drug dealer who schemes with a couple of characters played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston to trick Hepburn into letting them into her home, in search of a doll that was used to smuggle heroin and which ended up in her husband's possession. The film is not 100% convincing and you'll probably find yourself pointing out a few plot holes, but it's convincing enough, and I liked how taut the story-telling was. What could be more eerie than thinking you're alone in your apartment, but have three men with you in the room? We feel for this vulnerable blind woman and pull for her as she begins to figure out what's happening by paying attention to her other senses (and getting some help from a neighbor girl), and there is real tension as she does. You'll have to suspend disbelief a little bit to enjoy it, but it's certainly worth watching.",

            "content": "The first time I watched this movie was on TCM in 2017. It is about a young woman Lisa ( Samantha Jones) who gets involved in a smuggling ring. She is getting ready to board a plane with a doll full of heroin. When she boards the plane bound for New York, someone is watching her. He is on top of the roof making sure she has the goods, I believe the man is Roat ( Adam Arkin). When the plane arrives in New York, she gives the doll to Sam Hendrix ( Efren Zimbalist, Jr.) Sam is a photographer who is married to Suzi Hendrix ( Audry Hepburn). I believe Sam knows her, because later on he is suppose to take pictures of Lisa. She never shows for her photography session.When two men come looking for Lisa in a New York neighborhood, the apartment Lisa sends them two is not hers it's Suzi and Sam's. They look around for a while, then there is a knock at the door. It is Roat who has a plan for Mike ( Richard Crenna), and Carlino ( Jack Weston). The two know each other because they were just release from prison. Roat tells him about the job, but the price goes up. Mike and Carlino do not trust Roat, but decide to come in on the job. Mike wants to see whats in the closet, but at first Roat declines. After a small altercation, Roat gives him the key. When Mike looks around he discovers Lisa in a clothes bag. They realize they have to get rid of her, so they can look for that doll. When Lisa gave it to Sam, they know the doll is in the apartment somewhere.\nWhen Suzi returns they hid, but at first they have no idea she is blind, until she calls Sam. When she calls Sam they relax some, but are still guarded. Suzi knows someone is in the apartment, but thinks it's Gloria ( Julia Herrod). Gloria is a teenager who lives upstairs, and helps Suzi. She also has a thing for Suzi's husband. After she talks to Sam she leaves, Roat, Mike, and Carlino now get their plan together. When Suzi gets home Mike is at the door, he claims to be a friend of Sam's. Suzi thinks he is innocent as mike plays the part well, in fact she befriends Mike. When Night falls, the terror begins. Roat and Sgt. Carlino come in, I don't know why they call him Sgt. though? They try to get her to tell them where that doll could be, but she doesn't know? Roat who plays Roat Sr., and Roat Jr. comes into play, he comes into the place looking for something and takes Suzi's wedding photo. \nThe Three of them continue to harass her from a phone booth across the street. Suzi is starting to get suspicious, especially when Roat Jr. comes in. She asks Gloria for help. She tells Gloria about the police car outside, but Gloria tells her there isn't one. She knows the two men aren't who the say they are, but still thinks Mike is a friend. She turns to Gloria and tells her she needs her help. If she she's any of the men she saw today, to call her, but just let it ring twice.\nSuzi finds out the men are not who they say they are, but still thinks Mike is her friend. So she calls him and tells him she's got the doll. As soon as Suzi hangs up, her phone rings twice. She realizes Mike is in on it too, and has to hide the doll. Then things go from bad to worse, Roat shows up again kills Mike and goes after Suzi. Suzi fights back, by knocking out the light bulbs in the hall/apartment. She stabs him in the end, and is found behind the door of the refrigerator.\nThis is an exciting movie, it came out in the 60's and is somewhat dated. If you like thrillers, I would recommend seeing this gem. I 'm sure they have it on DVD, but maybe You can get lucky and discover it's playing on the TCM channel.",

I also think she is a very beautiful woman. Few women have an elegant yet sexy beauty at the same time, and she does. Now this might not sit well with many, but I think this movie would be a great re-make. I am one who thinks there is not enough originality in Hollywood today, and everyone is doing the re-makes. But I think this is an exception. Now in the 2006 re-make, the bad guy would flip open his cell phone instead of the refrigerator.

Instead of periodic screams followed by quiet (or humorous) scenes, the script slowly increases the dread experienced by the audience, so that when it's time to scream, the audience needs to scream to release the emotional pressure.Think back to the movies that really scared you: Alien? The Exorcist? Jaws? Note that they all hold off showing what scares you, releasing little bits of info or images that heighten the dread. Contrast this to \"horror\" movies of today, like the recent remake of \"Dawn of the Dead,\" in which you're shown the zombies in the first 10 minutes before you have time to care about the characters.So don't let the dated nature of the material deter you: see Wait Until Dark and re-discover what constitutes true suspense.",

Also working for director Terence Young, a British paratrooper Hepburn had bandaged up as a teenager nursing volunteer during WWII in Holland, these combined reminders of past traumas were so strong she insisted on playing the blind Susy with no eye prosthetic devices. Perhaps she was correct in thinking her \"thousand-yard stare\" evoked by the twin devils of the script and her personal strife would suffice to imply blindness for the more naive movie-goers of her time. No doubt the censorship code which prevailed into the early 1960s in the U.S. convinced the naive film fans of yesteryear that they \"could not handle the truth\" when it came to violence, gore, and an accurate depiction of physical disabilities. However, in 1963 Patty Duke WON an Oscar for portraying Helen Keller in the 1962 movie THE MIRACLE WORKER by ACTUALLY LOOKING BLIND, something the Oscar voters who stranded Hepburn as an also-ran in 1968 for DARK may have thought the self-costumed Paris fashion-clad designer-clothed fashion icon did not try hard enough to achieve. Susy asks her husband early on in DARK, \"Do I have to be the world champion blind lady?\" Evidently, the notoriously insecure Hepburn thought she had to be the world champion EVERYTHING, resulting in her divorcing a husband who did not make her feel like the world champion wife a year after their DARK collaboration. She would lick her wounds for the next nine years, prior to entering Sherwood Forest as an aging Lady Marion to Sean Connery's Robin Hood in the 1976 flop, ROBIN AND MARIAN.",

            "content": "Wait Until Dark (1967) :\nBrief Review -Indeed, a Classic \"One-Room-Thriller\" that nobody made after Hitchcock's 'Rope' by playing Blind. Audrey Hepburn in her career best role will make you forget many great thrillers of 60s. I must confess that this film has remained way underrated and compared to Alfred Hitchcock thrillers in 60s such as 'The Birds', 'Marnie', 'Torn Curtain' and 'Topaz', this one is far far ahead. I haven't added Hitchcock's early 60s classic 'Psycho' as i believe it's a great Classic Thriller. Well, Wait Until Dark isn't any less then. I must say that Hepburn's two thrillers in 60s 'Charade' and this one 'Wait Untill Dark' are so Hitchcockian that Hitchcock himself couldn't make. When i saw his 'Rope' starring James Stewart, i was shocked that it had remained so less known than his popular works which were actually not at all close the cinematic aspects of that film. I even wonder how 'North By Northwest' can get so much acclaim and not Rope and Charade and even Wait Until Dark? So, Wait Until Dark is \"Blind\" thriller with an extra \"Eye\" to every single detail. You just can't get over it. I know this formula from Comedies and Revenge Thrillers made in Indian cinema but the way Wait Until Dark has used it is way beyond masterwork. Every single frame, every single moment and every single movement in the film becomes unmissably important after first 20 minutes. Once Hepburn enters into the picture, there is no escape for you as an audience. Those next 85 minutes take you on a ride and how. That atmosphere, inteligent conversations, planning, detailed analysis everything about this film is worth watching. They don't make thrillers which are so real now days, i mean the probability of happening such things in real life is highest for any thriller. So, my final words are, DO NOT MISS IT AT ANY COST! You just can't afford the lost as a movie fan.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "From Terence Young, inspired in a play written by Frederick Knott. There's no need to argue, it's an awesome movie. Staring Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna, it's about a blind woman (Suzy - Audrey Hepburn) that is married to a man who was given a doll which both of them didn't know it contained cocaine. They lose the doll for the girl supposed to help Suzy with her homework when her husband was away. A group of three criminals discover that the family possessed the doll and invade the apartment when empty but fail to find it, so they plan to persuade Suzy to give it away, building a whole lot of lies to turn her against the husband and get the doll. And the plan was good, but Suzy's competence was hugely underestimated. Tremendous scenes, terrific screenplay and awesome cast. That's incredible how Terence Young can turn a movie that near all of it is set in a single living room into a breathtaking and suspenseful drama. There are some flaws though, concerning Suzy's blindness, as she'd be able to notice the presence of other people in other apartment, especially when she passes near them, because of the smell or even other capabilities the blind gain. Apart from that, and against many people say, there ain't no plot holes and this movie is one of the deepest I've seen. There are two points that mustn't pass unclear. The first one is related to one conversation Suzie has with Sophie the girl helping her, when the Suzie's inability and Sophie's lack of beauty meant nobody can have everything, when nobody feels sorry for the ugly and everybody feels sorry for the blind. The same goes for the second point. This movie comes with a very strong message, a message of strength. I mean, what's a blind lady, with a fragile body like Hepburn's, against three strong armed men? She uses her blindness as her biggest weapon. Spectacular. 10/10",

            "content": "Solid thriller adapted from Frederick Knott's 1966 play, about blind housewife Hepburn being tormented three thugs (Arkin, Crenna, Weston) looking for heroin in a lost doll. Deservedly put Arkin on the map, and every spook seems to hit the right spot at the right time. Well-paced, but takes a good half-hour to really get going and much of the story is driven by dialogue rather than action. Also, a little more could've been done with Crenna's character who also delivers a great performance despite not having an overly interesting character. Very cool climatic sequence where the viewer--and characters--are forced into blindness. Very worth it.***\u00bd (out of four)",

            "content": "I realize Wait Until Dark is a classic, but after you've seen it three or four times, it tends to lose its magic. You realize the dialogue feels very play-ish and stilted because, after all, it was almost literally transcribed from the Broadway production. You get over the shock and see it's hardly more than a regular cheap thriller from the 1960s. And you start to criticize Audrey Hepburn's over-the-top performance until you realize that the melodrama is only partially her fault: she shouldn't have been cast in the first place.Audrey Hepburn is the epitome of grace, class, and composure (which is why she was a terrible choice for Eliza Doolittle). As a recently blind woman, she's supposed to still be finding her way while feeling a little helpless and lost. You're supposed to feel sorry for her and afraid that something bad will happen to her. Instead, Audrey looks as though she just stepped out of the beauty parlor and doesn't have a care in the world. Her hair is coiffed, her clothes are clean, pressed, and matching, and her composure calm. Just imagine if the lead were played by Shelley Winters. Shelley would have had messy hair, clothes in disarray, and a constant snivel and warble in her voice. She would have made the character vulnerable and nearly pathetic, so the danger would have seemed real. Nothing could ever happen to Audrey Hepburn!However, villains Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and Jack Weston certainly try their hardest, and there are several scenes that are eerie, intense, and frightening. The first time you see this movie, you'll shriek and scream and have a marvelous time. I've just seen it too many times. And as my famous phrase lingers on, it really should have been Shelley Winters. Efrem Zimbalist Jr has a horrible character as Audrey's husband. He's nearly cruel, and downright unsupportive of his recently blind wife. He thinks tough love will be helpful to her, but the way his lines are written and delivered seem as though he can't stand her and find her new handicap irritating and bothersome to his daily routine. Thankfully, he's hardly in the movie so it doesn't ruin anything. Alan's tour-de-force is a role that countless actors covet when the play is produced on the stage. He's creepy, cold, and nearly unrecognizable. If you've never seen this classic, try it out close to Halloween. It's very fun.",

So many suspense movies rely on a person's fear of monsters or demons (or such) and use disgusting scenes of 'blood and guts' to horrify the viewer, rather than developing a powerful story with real suspense to involve the viewer. In contrast, this movie is incredibly suspenseful while focusing on real human motivations and misdeeds. She's such a spunky, warm, and believable character - you'll get caught up in her plight and in the cunning manipulations used by the bad guys. And the story is clever and innovative: Hepburn finds herself trapped with very little chance of getting help from the outside world, and she must rely on her resourcefulness and quick wits to survive. Many movies have since used this type of setup to create suspense, but this is the best of all.",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn clearly didn't fit the classic Hitchcock profile of a mysterious blonde but that didn't stop her appearing in two of the 60's better Hitchcockian thrillers, \"Charade\" and this, Bond director Terence Young's \"Wait Until Dark\". Nowadays I'm sure there'd be all sorts of woke outcry about a sighted person playing the part of a blind woman, but this was back then and the bigger question is whether Hepburn can convince the audience that she has indeed lost her vision, especially as the production doesn't have her wearing shades or otherwise make up her eyes in such a way as to convey her situation.I think she plays her disability well throughout. We're told that she only lost her sight a year ago which explains her relative familiarity with the surroundings of her New York apartment, a definite asset if a knife-toting psychopath who's already murdered three people comes a-knocking.Said psychopath is Alan Arkin who really gets to ham and almost camp it up as Mr Roat, who will kill and kill again in order to lay his hands on a child's doll containing a load of smuggled heroin. This doll came into Hepburn's apartment via her husband, the wonderfully-named Efram Zimbalist Jr, to whom it was passed by its frightened mule, Samantha Lee, who bumped into him on an aeroplane flight.Now, with hubby sent chasing across town by Arkin on fool's errands, his wife is at the seeming mercy of the ruthless villain and his two recruited henchmen. In the end, our heroine will have to show courage, adaptability and ingenuity if she's to survive the night in this adult \"Home Alone\" situation.The crux of the film is the extended sequence at the end when it's just Arkin and Hepburn facing-off in her darkened apartment and director Young certainly heightens the tension as Hepburn strives to even up the odds, the better to boost her survival prospects, by breaking all the lights in the room.There's an interestingly discordant soundtrack by Henry Mancini to further identify the viewer with Hepburn's plight and I liked Young's bold idea to black out the screen for more than a few seconds at a key point. Otherwise it's a relatively conventional if still enjoyably entertaining twist on the old damsel on distress theme, lit up by the closing encounter between Hepburn and Arkin.",

Arkin's gang doesn't want to make a scene if they don't have to - they're just after the dope-stuffed doll that fell into her possession - but patience wears thin as their con act falters and she continues dodging questions.It's a promising setup, if a little dull in practice, but neither of the against-type primary roles really click. Hepburn is sweet but stiff in her central role, out-of-place in an unfamiliar genre, while Arkin's twisted erudite hipster is more of a hand-wringing silver age comic book villain than the dark, gritty, street-level threat he's obviously meant to be. A crafty final showdown between the pair levels the playing field, smartly ratcheting tension in a string of almost pitch-black struggles over a knife, a fridge door and a can of gasoline. That scene was the subject of much promotion during the film's original run, aided by a gimmick that had theater-owners extinguish all lighting (even the exit signs?) to enhance the effect. The white-knuckled climax works well enough, and I'm sure the atmospheric bonus would've been a neat wrinkle, but it's insufficient compensation for the half-cooked hour of water-treading that precedes it.",

And that's fine since our attention spans are shorter and we've become more impatient, but it's nice to have a film that takes its time leading you up and freaking you out until you get to those final twenty minutes. I first saw this film in high school, recommended by my graphics teacher who was older than dirt, in our Reels movie club. He was so excited about the film and even did all the effort of darkening the room so that we'll have \"the full effect.\" I must say, the movie freaked me out so much and the little jumpscares dotted in the movie scared me more each time until the final one had me and my classmates screaming and gripping our seats. After the movie, we all talked about it and some of my classmates wondered how such an old movie could scare us more than the newer movies being released today. And it's all in the plot and build up. Many movies today lack a certain amount of build up or a decent plot to hook onto. Wait Until Dark will have you watching the entire time. The thing about the movie is, you go in thinking it's some simple plot about a blind woman who's going to get robbed, but it's more than that. The criminals aren't your average \"Sticky Bandits\" types who go in guns blazing, no, they're the type that love to toy and mess with their victims. Well, it's mostly just Roat (Alan Arkin) who's calling the shots, but his sidekicks are also part of the trickery (but they get their \"fair share\" towards the end). The movie is complex, very complex. It requires the viewer to pay attention to props being used, to the sounds heard, to the words spoken by the characters. It's not something you can just watch and follow along. If you don't pay attention, something will happen later that will have you giving the infamous \"huh\" look. Then towards the end you get to see brilliant lighting techniques, camera angles, and how the director literally blinds you so you're eyes are wondering around trying to catch a glimpse of what's going on, what's happening, what fell!! It's amazing.I recently watched this movie again (in the dark, alone in my house) , since I'm more older and mature, and I still screamed and jumped. Even when I knew what was going to happen! That's how you know this movie is timeless. Plus, it deserves a second watch so you can catch anything you missed, such as how I missed key plot points about the doll, but caught them the second time around. I recommend this to anybody, young and old, and I'm going to have my friends watch it in the dark like I did so they can experience it too. Very fun and very thrilling.",

Wait Until Dark is a slick thriller that keeps you interested and the suspense never lags. Audrey Hepburn plays (Suzy Hendrix) a recently blinded woman beautifully realized by Hepburn's skills. Her husband Sam (Zimbalist) is her newlywed husband who has inadvertently received a toy doll at the airport from some random woman. Unbeknownst to him it is filled with narcotics. Alan Arkin (Roat) is the main schemer and he wants that doll. Roat employs the help of Richard Crenna (Mike Talman) and Jack Weston (Carlino) to confiscate this valuable doll from Suzy once they realize it is in her possession. Roat devises a sleazy plot to fool our blind and lovely heroine into believing they are there to help her. But their scheme only lasts so long until Suzy, with the aide of her neighbor friend (Herrod), put two and two together and realize the duplicity in the three con men's plan. What we have is a pretty engaging thriller that makes you worry about our vulnerable and sweet Suzy. She may be delicate and soft, but she proves to be no cream puff when she comes to the final showdown. The performances are good. Arkin plays his Roat cunning and slick with a slight creepiness. Crenna gives a solid and gimlet eyed performance. Weston is good as the fumbling flunky of the three. But it is Audrey Hepburn who captures our hearts and makes us feel the real sense of isolation and fear with her vulnerable and wonderful performance. The final scene is very sweet and touching. This may not be everyone's idea of a top-notch thriller, but if you watch this movie and don't fall in love with Hepburn, something is wrong.",

Nonetheless, thoughtful movie enthusiasts will enjoy \"Wait Until Dark\" as a classic example of late-1960's suspense films for the quality of it's production values. While not a \"cineast,\" I still recognize and appreciate the style of direction, lighting and editing of this movie for being typical of it's time; many others will too. It's worthwhile watching for this very reason. Compare it to 1968's \"Rosemary's Baby;\" One movie is truly suspenseful and gripping to the end, one is, well, not. Both have a similar style though, a style common to many late-1960's dramatic films.An additional, though perhaps frivolous, reason to watch \"Wait Until Dark\" is seeing both Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna in earlier movie roles. If you enjoy watching an actor's development over the years, you'll enjoy seeing Arkin and Crenna as younger actors in somewhat minor supporting roles. Audrey Hepburn, on the other hand, is a waste in this movie; had it been made thirty years later, it would have starred Markie Post and been shown on Lifetime.On the whole, \"Wait Until Dark\" is worthwhile solely as a period piece; it's amusing (an maybe interesting) to watch at two in the morning, but not worth renting.",

            "content": "I'll mention my objections, then why I love this movie anyway.1) New York City, specifically Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan: A van is able to park on a near-deserted street in the middle of the Village- it is used by the three villains in the movie. Nearby, they also have a sedan parked in an equally untrafficked parking lot. In New York City, in one of the most crowded areas of Manhattan. A girl approaches a man, offering Girl Scout cookies, and the sidewalk is otherwise deserted. Does this Friday night Greenwich Village exist in some alternate universe?A 12-year-old girl, whose parents have split up and is living with her neglectful mother, is ostensibly precocious and streetwise, as one would expect such a New York City latchkey girl to be. Yet apparently she is unfamiliar with vans (never mind vans' ubiquity as delivery and cab vehicles in the city) and refers to one she sees a \"a kind of squatty truck.\" Really?2) Stupid behavior by ostensibly smart adults. A blind woman and her husband live in an apartment in the Village- not just an apartment, but a basement (also called a \"garden\" apartment by savvy real estate agents) apartment, the kind most susceptible to break-ins. Yet they nonchalantly go about their business without locking the door to the apartment. Are we in New York City or Mayberry?A professional photographer, returning to New York from Canada, agrees to accept a doll from a woman, a perfect stranger, on the basis of a made-up story as both clear customs at JFK International Airport. Savvy, experienced New York City dwellers accept packages for safekeeping from strangers all the time, right?A pair of ostensibly streetwise veteran con artists wander into previously mentioned unlocked apartment, casually putting their fingerprints everywhere, on the basis of a typed note from previously mentioned doll-woman, who is their former partner in crime and whom they've been led to believe is the rightful tenant of said apartment, taking a full 10 minutes to realize that she has no typing/secretarial skills and that they've laid themselves open to being set up.3) The blind woman goes back to apartment while the three hoodlums are there, yet doesn't detect their presence.4) Timeline. Said blind woman was blinded in accident just over a year before the action in the film, yet in that time has met and married previously mentioned photographer, and they've established a pal-around routine as if they'd been together for years and she'd been blind for far longer.5) Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. To put it mildly, his presence in the film (mercifully brief; confined to a few scenes) is not an asset. He plays a thinly-altered variation of the steely-jawed, high-school-football-coach-spouting-rousing-clich\u00e9s, all-American hero he played concurrently on the popular TV series \"The FBI,\" a right-wing weekly propaganda outlet for J. Edgar Hoover and his PR department. The scenes between him and Hepburn as his wife are cringe-worthy \"you can do it!\" kitsch, a stereotype of the crusty-but-heart-of-gold man acting as savior to the ill and/or disabled (but typically still fully photogenic) woman. As always, Zimbalist's emotional and acting range are between A and A. Ugh. This guy's supposed to be a highly-sought-after art and professional photographer in Bohemian Greenwich Village? Ronald Reagan would have been just as convincing.6) Several murders take place on or offscreen in this neighborhood, yet do not bring the police nearby or arouse any interest of the (apparently invisible or non-existent) neighbors. But then, as I said before, this is one strangely underpopulated, nearly deserted New York City.OK, now I've gotten all that off my chest, I can discuss why I love this movie anyway. First of all, it is, outside of Hitchcock (\"Rope,\" \"Dial M for Murder,\" \"Rear Window,\" the last of which shared with \"Wait Until Dark\" the same playwright, Frederick Knott), the best claustrophobic, within-one-small-apartment thriller in cinematic history (I'm referring to films where all or almost all of the action takes place within a tiny confined space). The pacing (aside from aforementioned, exposition-setting cringeworthy Zimbalist/Hepburn scenes) and the slow building of suspense to an unpredictable climax are simply superb.And the acting is, Zimbalist aside, outstanding. Richard Crenna as a veteran con artist does well stepping out of the nice-guy persona he had created on the TV sitcom \"The Real McCoys,\" and Jack Weston as his oafish partner in crime Carlino is appropriately thuggish but still likable. Julie Herrod, repeating her Broadway performance, does a nice job as bratty-but-sympathetic Gloria, the tween-age girl helping the blind woman. Samantha Jones is skilled in her brief role as a glamorous and beautiful drug mule smuggling heroin across the Canada-U.S. border.Audrey Hepburn was not really exploring new acting territory (for her) as the frail and vulnerable innocent in danger (she played very similar roles in \"Charade,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" and, to a certain extent, in her lead debut, \"Roman Holiday\"), but her performance as blind woman Susy Hendrix at the mercy of three desperados is still a standout.But the biggest kudos has to go to Alan Arkin as chief bad guy Harry Roat, a.k.a. Harry Roat Sr., a.k.a. Harry Roat Jr., a cool, stiletto-toting hipster in shades and a black leather jacket who will scare the bejesus out of you. It is tribute to Arkin's range as a comedic and serious actor when you consider the three roles he played in two years' time: as the sympathetic but humorous executive officer of a Soviet submarine in the Cold War-confrontation comedy \"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming!\" (1966), as the scary but entertaining sociopath Roat in \"Wait Until Dark\" (1967), and as the sweet, tragic, deaf watchmaker John Singer in \"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\" (1968).",

            "content": "This movie is extremely well done and just an overall enjoyable experience. Some may complain it is a little slow at the beginning of the movie, or for most of it, but it is supposed to be like that. I loved the casting as Audrey Hepburn and it actually added to the character. There are very few times when I like identifying the character with the actor, but in this case because everyone loves Hepburn so much, the love passes to the character quite easily. She of course does a phenomenal job and I loved seeing the character grow through out the movie. Alan Arkin was brilliant and I loved seeing this side of him. I have not seen many of his movies, but this one is such a stark contrast from what I am used to it kind of floored me. Of course the last 15 minutes of the movie left me literally on the edge of my seat, and out of breathe. I was not sure how it was going to end and not even sure if she would survive. I thought the movie kept enough twists and turns in the plot and kept one rooting for Hepburn through out whole movie it was never slow for me. What surprised me was learning that this was first a play. I can usually pick that up, but the movie kept me in the moment so well I was not able to pick it up. Looking back it is obvious, but not during the viewing. I do wish that they showed the warning at the beginning of the film instead of leaving it in the special features. Hopefully on later releases they will put the warning in because that is the whole point of the movie. Luckily I had an idea of what has going to happen so it was fine, but those who do not know what they are getting into when watching the movie it would make a big impact seeing that warning. I would recommend this movie to movie fans, but not everyone. A very well executed movie with a great cast.",

            "content": "'Wait Until Dark' is the scariest movie in the history of cinema. It puts to shame the slash and gore garbage which is imposed on us by modern day Hollywood. Audrey Hepburn, maybe the most beautiful and classiest actress to ever appear on screen, plays a blind woman to perfection. Her husband, played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr., inadvertently brings home a cocaine-filled toy doll from an overseas trip. Three drug dealers create a clever scam as Efrem's 'buddies' to worm their way into Audrie's below-ground-level apartment to get the doll. Every second of this classic reeks of suspense and fear. Alan Arkin is absolutely ferocious in his drug-dealer intensity portrayal of an evil man who will stop at nothing, including killing his companions, to get the doll. Arkin is perfect in this role; he 'inhabits' it from head to toe; he is more 'real' in this role than real drug dealers in the real world. If you bumped into Arkin's character on the street in the real world, just his physical look, his world-weary face, his droll yet threatening speaking would have you shaking in your boots; evil has never seen a scarier portrayal in American cinema. During the last 1/4 hour or so of the movie is the single scariest scene to ever come out of moviedom. If it doesn't make you jump out of your seat, you must be clinically dead. This thriller is an absolute 'must see' before you die. Hang on!",

Arkin does a really chilling psychopathic killer, and Hepburn is vulnerable -- but not too vulnerable.  Probably the most memorable scene for me is nearing the climax when Hepburn's apartment is completely dark -- except for one small light. The woman sitting directly behind me stood up and screamed as if it was she who was being attacked by Arkin.  Very convincing.",

If that makes me a wimp, then so be it that's what truly happened. I was, in fact, so frightened that it was about 10 yrs before I ever saw the ending! With that being said, this movie is a viseral twisting thriller that will not disappoint and will stay with you for a time.

The doll was given to him and is stuffed with heroin - unbeknownst to him.  One way or the other, Suzy is by herself and thus the movie is full of suspense. It really follows its theater version. It unfolds mostly in the apartment - which increases the drama level but also gets dull. Wished they made use more of film tools. For example, we never see the world from Suzy's perspective, which is a pity; it would add a lot to the drama of the movie. In any case, one can well imagine her angst. The series of events would unsettle anyone despite their sight. Her husband's response  to her blindness is a bit cold, coming from the place of you can do it, and now you can\u2026 a bit odd. The girl who lives upstairs is apparently all by herself - they covered that too, coming up with some silly excuse for that. Anyway, it's a good movie despite some flaws in the story",

            "content": "Chilling atmosphere with eerie music, and haunting direction.\n\nIrish director Terence Young's horror crime thriller Wait Until Dark (1967) is still unnerving. Young lets his suspense thriller breathe with characters constantly reacting to every little sound and movement during this tense home invasion film. It's a very unique and specific story about a blind woman getting gaslit by two robbers and a murderer as they want to search her home for a little doll. Young makes Wait Until Dark get scarier and scarier until you feel like Audrey Hepburn is trapped.\n\nWriters Frederick Knott, Robert Carrington, and Jane-Howard Hammerstein create an enthralling horror narrative that makes you feel so nervous and sorry for Audrey Hepburn's lone woman trying to figure out this brewing mystery as she's being lied to by everyone around her. I'm impressed that Wait Until Dark is so meticulously detail oriented about every clue and hint about what happened to this doll and where it could be as these robbers frantically search and manipulate their way into this home.\n\nIt's neat seeing all the Montreal and New York sights in the backdrop and 1960's fashion everywhere. Producer Mel Ferrer really got Young neat locations. He cameos as the voice of the Canadian radio speaker too! George Jenkins' art direction makes a quaint New York apartment look sinister and a menacing place to be. George James Hopkins & Ward Preston's set decoration provides all these cute knick-knacks for Hepburn's home that looks like you could live there.\n\nYoung's direction is fascinating with his chilling atmosphere and intimate feel like you're right there. Wait Until Dark is similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Rope all in one location and features killers maneuvering around Gene Milford's artful cuts that keep you in suspense with these seamless cuts that flow from room to room. 108 minutes pass by in moments. Charles Lang's cinematography goes from sweeping panning shots outdoors to these sharp shots indoors that hold your attention on the necessary details. The unique way Wait Until Dark is shot lets your eyes linger on every detail of this home as the mystery unfolds. \n\nAudrey Hepburn is delightful and sympathetic as Susy Hendrix. Her acting as if she's blind is really entertaining and moving. You feel her frustrations and fears, while admiring her acute sense of hearing, space, and movements. I found Hepburn very charming and engaging as you're always aware of when she's picking up on when she is being lied to by these three criminals. Audrey Hepburn was so pretty and captivating in every second of Wait Until Dark.\n\nAlan Arkin is captivating as the mysterious Roat with his unnerving manner of speech and knife Geraldine. He plays multiple roles with a real sinister malice to his villain Roat. Richard Crenna is intriguing as the enigmatic Mike Talman. He plays the two-faced crook who is directly gaslighting Hepburn with such ease and confidence. Crenna looks like an evil Roger Moore. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is good as Hepburn's often absent husband Sam, who can be both dispassionate and caring. Jack Weston is fun as the suspicious and self-serving Detective Carlino. He's very forceful and eager as he lies and intimidates his way for information.\n\nSamantha Jones is lovely as Lisa. She's the spitting image of Sharon Tate. She pulls off her doll handoff very well. Julie Herrod is excellent as the young girl Gloria. Her tantrums and casual observations are a nice juxtaposition to Hepburn's graceful composure. Jean Del Val cameos as the old man who makes the doll for Jones' Lisa.\n\nComposer Henry Mancini's creepy score is simply haunting. His dissonant chord stab and eerie piano melodies plucking away. He goes from diabolical sounding classical pieces to softer jazz passages at times. I love the music throughout Wait Until Dark. Sound designer Everett A. Hughes' very particular use of sound really emphasizes just exactly what Hepburn's blind lady can hear. Every mistake the crooks make is noted by her through her hearing. Gordon Bau really gave Hepburn a natural glow with his make-up too.\n\nIn short, I thoroughly enjoyed Wait Until Dark. It is an underrated suspense thriller that's often forgotten, but well worth seeking out. If you've ever liked Hitchcock's pictures, then Terence Young's Wait Until Dark has something special in store for you.",

Arkin's gang doesn't want to make a scene if they don't have to - they're just after the dope-stuffed doll that fell into her possession - but patience wears thin as their con act falters and she continues dodging questions.\n\nIt's a promising setup, if a little dull in practice, but neither of the against-type primary roles really click. Hepburn is sweet but stiff in her central role, out-of-place in an unfamiliar genre, while Arkin's twisted erudite hipster is more of a hand-wringing silver age comic book villain than the dark, gritty, street-level threat he's obviously meant to be. A crafty final showdown between the pair levels the playing field, smartly ratcheting tension in a string of almost pitch-black struggles over a knife, a fridge door and a can of gasoline. That scene was the subject of much promotion during the film's original run, aided by a gimmick that had theater-owners extinguish all lighting (even the exit signs?) to enhance the effect. The white-knuckled climax works well enough, and I'm sure the atmospheric bonus would've been a neat wrinkle, but it's insufficient compensation for the half-cooked hour of water-treading that precedes it.",

            "content": "1967 film Wait Until Dark, adapted from Frederick Knott's 1966 play - and that is a considerable amount, given that it's one of the greatest movie thrillers of its generation - my first question is this: what on earth goes through Audrey Hepburn's mind when she's asked to appear in this movie? You have here a woman whose screen persona is completely built around her classy Continental elegance, whose personal life was marked by serious-minded humanitarianism, and you drop her into a horror-thriller about a heroin dealer antagonising a blind woman - it all seems so incomprehensible that Hepburn's seventeenth starring role should be such a grubby, grotty turn from all of the princesses and doe-eyed gamines and society women . Well it payed off big .\nAudrey Hepburn received her fifth (and last) Oscar nomination for effectively playing a blind woman in this well-executed thriller based on the Broadway smash hit; equally good are the villains, played by the young Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna. . I would go so far as to say that Hepburn's blend of weakness and fortitude is the key ingredient to everything else in Wait Until Dark, providing exactly the correct note of nervous ambivalence that makes this such a superlative, viscerally effective thriller.",

            "content": "Wait Until Dark: 4 out of 10: A filmed version of a play about a blind woman who is terrorized by a trio of thugs when her husband accidentally acquires a child's doll filled with heroin.\n\nThe Good: Richard Crenna is actually quite good in this. Unfortunately, I really wasn't a fan of the other actors. Audrey Hepburn was okay as the blind woman (an Oscar nomination really?) but Alan Arkin really does ham it up as the chief baddie (more on that below). The biggest offender, however, is Samantha Jones as the child upstairs that helps out. There is no acting quite as bad as an overacting child actor and we definitely have a culprit here.\n\nI am sorry I am supposed to be talking about the positives here. There ending is a hoot and there are some quality jump scares in the film.\n\nThe Bad: Wait Until Dark would have worked a lot better if it took place in suburbia or on a farm. Many (not all) of the glaring plot holes are simply because it takes place in the city. Roger Ebert liked the movie overall but spent the entire review wondering why a newly blind woman alone in a New York basement apartment leaves her door unlocked over and over again even after she feels in danger. You were not alone Roger, you were not alone. \n\nThe Ugly: Let's talk Alan Arkin for a minute. Part of Wait Until Dark's reputation is that Alan Arkin is such a devilish bad guy. He does play a complete bastard I will give you that. He also hams it up like he was in a Pink Panther film. He is so in Pink Panther mode he enters the apartment each time wearing an elaborate costume and makeup doing exaggerated movements to really sell the con... to Audrey Hepburn's character... who is blind. \n\nThis movie has a great reputation and I have no idea why. I would love to say it is seeing tiny Audrey Hepburn going around her apartment blind threatened by these bad men. Why are they threatening her? There is zero reason for them to threaten her. The entire plot is based on a premise that simply doesn't pass go. Since neither she nor her husband thinks the doll is anything more than a child's toy that needs to be returned why not just knock on the door and ask for the doll. And if they can't find it right away ask them to look for it and check back later in the week. \n.\nI mean the movie is full of these conundrums. Roger Ebert also wondered why Audrey Hepburn sent the upstairs girl to the Port Authority Bus terminal instead of to the Police to get help. I like to think she was trying to get that horrible child kidnapped by a pimp (It is New York City in 1967). Indeed who sends a young girl with the emotional maturity of boiled cabbage to the Port Authority on a very wild goose chase unless one has dark motives. \n\n\nIn Conclusion: If you want to see a one-room play done right with no tricks see Dial M for Murder which actually shares the same playwright (Frederic Knott) as Wait Until Dark. One can have a movie swimming in plot holes if the action onscreen holds ones attention just as one can have a slow talky film as long as the story and script keeps one invested. Unfortunately, a very slow talky claustrophobic film that allows the audience to start questioning everything that happens on screen is in for a world of hurt. The ending is effective though I can see why people remember the last fifteen minutes. It is just getting there that is such a drag.",

While it is structured around Audrey Hepburn as a blind woman and a group of crooks trying to get something out of her place, I didn\u2019t realize they were going to have this elaborate ruse. I do like the con game and it has some tension in it since we know the truth, but it took a long time until I was actually worried about her safety. Richard Crenna plays his role so amiable that I didn\u2019t think he would do anything to hurt our leading lady. This works for his character, but doesn\u2019t add to the drama of the story. Alan Arkin was the curveball in the entire narrative. His slightly unhinged and deranged performance was exactly what I was looking for out of this movie, and his final scenes brought the thriller aspect that I was expecting to feel throughout the film. It\u2019s undercut a little when he takes on the costumes and accents of other characters, but I don\u2019t mind because the setup in the beginning made him threatening enough to overcome a little silliness. There were even a couple of scenes where they used complete darkness, and that was a great way to keep you holding your breath in tension. On reflecting I can\u2019t help wondering if Wait Until Dark would have worked just a little better if they had structured it without the opening sequence so we didn\u2019t know what was going on, and we were experiencing the mystery with Susy. I know they would have needed to tweak a few things in the script in order to make that a viable way of telling the story. I just wonder if it\u2019s best for us to be worried about her from the beginning or puzzled and confused with her, trying to figure out the mystery. Either way, I did enjoy the movie and thought the way Susy pieces things together is engaging. It might not have quite lived up to my personal hype, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was flawed. I\u2019ll try to watch Wait Until Dark again sometime and I think without skewed expectations it will work even better.",

            "content": "As a teenager, I used to take the subway into Manhattan Saturday mornings and go to the movies. One of the most memorable of these films was without a doubt 'Wait Until Dark'. This taut thriller still stands far above other more recent entries into this genre. The reason for this persistence in excellence is this film does not depend on the typical slasher flicks special effects. These blood and gore scenes are good for a moment but soon become old. Wait Until Dark depends more on the human mind, a technique that can thrill far more than any fake blood and dismembered body parts. Susy (Audrey Hepburn) is a young woman who lives in New York City, is married to a successful photographer (Efrem Zimbalist Jr), and she is blind. While her husband is on a business trip, a beautiful blond slips a doll into his belongings, one that conceals a large quantity of heroin. The blond winds up dead (in Suzy's apartment), and the doll is also somewhere in the apartment. The main crook Roat (Alan Arkin) is determined to get the drugs back and deceptively enlists the aid of two other criminals, Mike (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston). The three men will pose as police officers to deceive the poor blind girl into letting them into the apartment where they can search for the drug right under her nose.\n\nWhat ensues is a brilliantly orchestrated cat and mouse game largely between Roan and Suzy which itself sets this film above the typical Hollywood thriller. Rather than sitting back and surrendering to gory effects the audience is expected to think, to truly care about Suzy and root for her survival. Suzy is not the usual hapless damsel in distress; she is bright, resourceful and perceptive, more than a match for the clever Roat. Being blind turns out not to be a disadvantage to Suzy. It gives her the ability to notice little things the sighted would have overlooked. Things like furniture slightly moved the constant playing with the window blinds (a signal between the crooks) and the movements of the men throughout her apartment. It dawns on Suzy that something is amiss and she begins to prepare for the worse. While not a criminal mastermind Roat devises a plan that seemingly is brilliant. He underestimates how easy it will be to fool the blind woman but the manner in which he manipulates the other two men is inspired. The ending is shrouded in darkness. When I saw this film in my youth, the gimmick was for the theater to dim the house lights to the edge of the legal limit to accentuate the tension. It did, and I remember it now several decades later. You might want to try this at home.\n\nOne of the factors that help to propel this film to the heights it has achieved is the cast. Audrey Hepburn takes a character that normally would be considered helpless and turns her around into a sharp and incredibly bright young woman. Her performance lulls the audience into accepting her as determined but physically helpless only to watch her inner strength and determination forced to the surface. There is a spectacular beauty to how Hepburn places the character development of Suzy carefully, gradually allowing the audience's empathy to grow. Little hints to the self-reliance given from the start but as the film progresses we see just how strong she is. Arkin gives the performance of his lifetime here. He plays three characters in his plot against Suzy, Roat, Roat Jr. and Roat Sr. the subtle difference in how he plays each role is an exhibition of how an actor should approach a character. What impressed me most here is the amount of control these two leads display. They take the time and effort required to allow the audience to get to know these people, what motivates them and what is behind their reactions. Crenna and Weston give solid performances as the ancillary characters here. Each of these two men is capable of strong performances, and they give them to us. As low-level crooks, they are baited by Roat, manipulated and controlled by him. Their desperation is visceral; the audience can feel the emotions these men hold just under the surface.\n\nDirector Terence Young knows how to please an audience. He is responsible for three of the early (and best) James Bind films, 'Doctor No,' 'From Russia with Love' and 'Thunderball.' You may wonder if a director used to such action-oriented films can handle a far more cerebral thriller, the answer is a resounding yes. His control of the all important pacing is gifted. While most thrillers seem to feel that an initial shock required at the start of the film, Young give the audience time to acclimate to the situations and characters. He develops the plot slowly, like a fine dinner left to simmer and merges the flavors. He exhibits the same control of the lighting. Due to the specifics of this film, this is even greater than usual. As the ending approaches the lights dim, one by one, darkening the theater reinforcing the events on screen. Shadows become something out of a nightmare as our concern for the plight of Suzy increases. Young manipulates the emotions of the audience to perfection.\n\nThis film is an astounding example how actors, each great in their right, can interact with such amazing perfection that the synergy derived by the cast is nothing short of brilliant. Mr. Zimbalist and Mr. Weston were so brilliant in their portrayal of the soldier villains Mike and Carlino that a substantial baseline established the foundation for the coming terror flawlessly.\n\nIt is the cat and mouse game between the ruthless, expertly driven criminal and a young blind woman that takes the suspense and escalating terror to heights beyond any expectations the audience might have brought into the theater. Overall the mastering of this Blu-ray is excellent. Considering the age of the source material, you can expect some variation in the balance of light and dark scenes. The slight grain found in the previous DVD release was eradicated during the 'upgrading process' to high definition. The source material had to be a near pristine 35mm to achieve such a crisp video. Especially appreciated is the greater clarity in the many dimly lit scenes. The nature of the story requires the set be in nearly total darkness. On the DVDthe figures are little more than dark gray blobs, now transformed into discernable characters. Among the strongest reasons I had driving my excitement to receive a copy of this release for preview was the thought od experiencing a favorite film with video and audio superior to my initial viewing so many years ago.\n\nPresenting the soundtrack in its original mono format is always appreciated by film purists. Altering the video's aspect ratio is tantamount to heresy, but fewer cinephiles are that concerned with alterations to the audio. The source material didn't provide a lot of sound elements to process, but the transition to DTS High Definition Audio allowed for a robust spectrum of the audio. It comes across as a bit more oriented to center stage, reinforcing the overall feel and look which emulates a live stage performance. There are no extremes in bass or treble here. On the plus side, it does give a live stage feel to the film. I watched this film bypassing the bit stream audio and using the Prologic 'Live' mode for more a theatrical feel to the experience. The extras are interesting. There is a stroll down memory lane by Alan Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer detailing just what went into the making of this classic. There is also a little featurette chronicling how this adaptation of this work from the original stage production. Rounding out the extras are a few trailers. Don't 'wait,' get this one Blu-ray even if you already own the Blu-ray and enjoy a great film experience.",

Alan Arkin is fantastic as the ruthless drug dealer who schemes with a couple of characters played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston to trick Hepburn into letting them into her home, in search of a doll that was used to smuggle heroin and which ended up in her husband's possession.  The film is not 100% convincing and you'll probably find yourself pointing out a few plot holes, but it's convincing enough, and I liked how taut the story-telling was.  What could be more eerie than thinking you're alone in your apartment, but have three men with you in the room?   We feel for this vulnerable blind woman and pull for her as she begins to figure out what's happening by paying attention to her other senses (and getting some help from a neighbor girl), and there is real tension as she does.  You'll have to suspend disbelief a little bit to enjoy it, but it's certainly worth watching.",

            "content": "Many horror movies play on our fears of what goes bump in the night, or what is hiding in a dark basement. Wait Until Dark takes those fears to a new level, when it takes the premise of a main character being newly blind and being stalked by a thug in her own apartment. Audrey Hepburn does a fantastic job as a blind woman who is being pushed around, conned, and forced into letting a man into her apartment while her husband is away, all because her husband brought her a doll, which unknown to both of them had drugs inside. Alan Arkin is terrific as a bad man who will stop at nothing to get his drugs, even stooping so low as to trick a blind woman. The fear and terror that sits at the heart of Wait Until Dark is simple, if you can't see, you can never be certain your truly alone, and that is a fear that most people can easily understand. For the most part the acting in Wait Until Dark is very good, with Hepburn standing out as usual, but Arkin was very good as a bad guy, which I never would have thought possible as he is always seen as a kinder gentler character for most of his films. It does drag a little in the middle, and the kid gives a regularly bad kid performance, but on the whole Wait Until Dark is a well put together thriller that hits the right notes for most of it running time.\n\n3.5 Beards Out Of 5",

            "content": "A chilling film, even by today's standards. This is a masterfully crafted thriller about three crooks who manipulate a blind woman to recover lost smuggled goods. Audrey Hepburn is fantastic in the lead role, while Alan Arkin makes a terrifying villain. This superb drama filled with spell-binding tension has not lost an iota of its considerable impact, even 40 years after it was made. Audrey Hepburn is mesmerising as the blind woman whose quick thinking is more illuminating than the brightest of lights. Audrey Hepburn received her fifth (and last) Oscar nomination for effectively playing a blind woman in this well-executed thriller based on the Broadway smash hit; equally good are the villains, played by the young Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna. Director Terence Young uses darkness, shadows, sound and music to fully immerse us in the terror that Susy faces. Like Susy, surrounded by darkness, we cannot see the danger, nor can we predict what lies ahead. Wait Until Dark is that rare example of a film which is just as tense and frightening today as it when it was originally released. It might be hard to picture Alan Arkin in the role of a sadistic villain, but he's also terrific here, taking a rather cartoonish character and making him genuinely terrifying. Wait until Dark, based on Frederick Knott's legit hit, emerges as an excellent suspense drama, effective in casting, scripting, direction and genuine emotional impact. Audrey Hepburn stars as the not-so-helpless blind heroine, in a superior performance.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\r\n\r\n\"Oh you must be so bored with me, everytime you come in here, I'm in absolute panic. \"\r\n\r\nWait Until Dark is a film I had never heard of until quite recently. After enjoying some other thrillers starring Audrey Hepburn, especially Charade, I knew I had to watch this film. And while I was skeptical of the films direction upon first glance (as it was directed by the same guy that directed three James Bond movies; Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Thunderball, great films, but was not picturing Terence Young to direct a suspense thriller), it turns out that Wait Until Dark is not only well-made and well-acted, but it's definitely one of the most entertaining suspense thrillers ever made.\r\n\r\nMeet Susy Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn), a housewife that's still learning to cope with blindness that was the result of a recent accident. She has a loving but always away husband (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and has a strong friendship with young neighbor Gloria (Julie Herrod). Things get complicated when criminals, led by the sadistic Roat (Alan Arkin), break into her apartment, going after a missing baby doll that she may or may not have, a doll that the crooks used to smuggle heroin into the country. Alone and with her husband away, Susy has to use her resourcefulness and her knowledge of her small apartment to get out of this situation alive.\r\n\r\nThe film also stars Richard Crenna and Jack Weston as the other crooks and Samantha Jones in a small part as Lisa, the woman who first had the doll.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what I was going to think of Wait Until Dark when the opening credits started rolling. The beginning was a little slow and a little complicated to follow and Audrey Hepburn doesn't even appear until 25 minutes into the picture. But it turns out, the more the film progresses, the more engaging the plot is and the more suspenseful the mystery is. My other fear on this film was that the crooks were going to be these one-dimensional characters who end up raiding the house, the end, good bye. But what makes Wait Until Dark innovative is how the crooks manage to do their plotting. They don't just raid the house, no (and this is a mouthful) they take the nicest talking crook, make him like Hepburn as a friend, gain her confidence in getting him the doll, making the leader pose as two real insane nuts, and using the rough sounding guy posing as the police in order for Hepburn to just give them the doll. And all I have to say about this is... brilliant. An engaging plot like this causes Wait Until Dark to be as psychologically complex and shocking as an Alfred Hitchcock movie. \r\n\r\nEven more unique about the film is its cinematography. Rather than the average thriller where we're treated to rich, exotic locations and over-the-top action, 98% of the film is set in the apartment, giving the film more of a claustrophobic look, and it works fantastically. My favorite moment camera wise is a shot where Hepburn is upset that the crooks cut her phone line, and the shot featuring stair railings makes her look like she's locked up in some prison cell somewhere. But nothing can be more suspenseful than the 20-minute finale in the dark. I was told that the ending was one of the most frightening, psychologically insane sequences ever, and guess what? I was told well. \r\n\r\nAlso making the film work well are its acting performances. I was skeptical of Alan Arkin playing a sadistic crook, as I'm used to seeing him in goofy, comedic roles, but Arkin surprisingly nails his character. It's probably the best you'll ever see of Arkin, as this is likely the only time he played a role this complex. Another surprising performance is Julie Herrod as the girl Gloria. I thought she would be this obnoxious brat (as her opening scene would suggest), but I applaud the filmmakers for making the character feel more natural in what a child would do in tense situations. But it's Audrey Hepburn who gives the best performance as Susy the blind housewife. In something that was groundbreaking for 1967, we are treated to one, self reliant, independent, and resourceful woman. And Hepburn plays a role unlike any other character she's played, and was deserving of her Best Actress nom.\r\n\r\nIf Henry Mancini did not score Wait Until Dark, I'm not sure if the film would work in the suspense department. It's chilling, it's eerie, and the odd-sounding chords are just downright creepy! It's safe to say that this is one of Mancini's best scores, along with The Pink Panther, The Great Race, and Charade. \r\n\r\nWait Until Dark does what a great suspense thriller should do. It's highly entertaining, the performances are outstanding, the score is chilling, and the filming techniques are the most innovative I've seen in the world of suspense thrillers, creating the psychological, claustrophobic look that sums up the greatness of the film as a whole. If Charade is considered the greatest Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made, then this would be the second best!\r\n\r\n\"No discipline... Bad news... Leads to anarchy.\"",
