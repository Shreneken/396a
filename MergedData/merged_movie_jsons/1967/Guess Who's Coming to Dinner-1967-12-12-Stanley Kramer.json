The story seemed so obvious and clich\u00e9 to me, having grown up decades after the film was released. Of course a family would react poorly when they see the racial difference of their daughter's chosen husband. But, I underestimated the whole thing.The film is more complex, because as it turns out, the family is not actually racist -- at least not in theory. And this film allows theory to meet practice, which may be harder to overcome than they thought. Luckily, they have the advantage of the black man being a world-renowned doctor. Had he just been any old schmuck, the family might not have been as welcoming. It is a whole different story.The two things I found most interesting about the film were: one, that the two people most opposed to interracial marriage were both black. That seemed quite the opposite of what you might expect. And two, I found it odd that the biggest problem was supposed to be the racial difference. The 14-year age gap and the fact they wanted to get married after only 10 days of knowing each other was largely ignored. I find that to be the much bigger problem -- how do you commit to a lifetime after only 10 days?",

Set in the 1960s, this was definitely topical. We are treated to first class acting from Sidney Poitier who is arguable one of the greatest and most dignified actors to grace the screen. Great performances from Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn who play shocked and concerned parents. This film also focused on the important issue of walking the talk, righteous people who preach certain ways of living but we see it put to the test when they themselves are in that situation. The parents who raised a unbiased and open minded daughter must deal with her choices. Spencer Tracey's speech to his daughter and Sidney is one of the best in film. He passes on an important message of understanding and righteousness to not just his daughter and son in law to be but the rest of America watching. A showcase of brilliant acting and messages in a film that was ahead of its time.",

            "content": "A 23 year-old lady (Katharine Houghton) brings home a surprise house guest--her black fianc\u00e9 (Sidney Poitier)! While today such a thing isn't all that unusual, her liberal-minded parents are thrown by their decision. Not surprisingly, his parents are equally stunned. Can these two manage to get their parents' consent and live happily ever after.I think that much of what \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is as a picture is lost on younger audiences. Today, the idea of interracial marriages isn't what it was back in 1967. Back then, it was so novel and so controversial that I doubt younger viewers could comprehend it. After all, just before this movie was released, it was against the law in many US states for such a marriage! Crazy, but true. So, while the reactions of everyone to this marriage might seem quaint today--back then it was truly an explosive issue. But even if this makes the film seem a tad dated, it is a marvelous film from start to finish because it features some of the best acting I can recall having seen in a movie. While Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn (who won the Oscar for this film) are the people we think of today in the film, Beah Richards and Roy Glenn (as Sidney Poitier's parents) were simply dynamite. Together, this cast represents one of the higher points of the 1960s--not just for its social message but for its amazing acting. And, of course, the great dialog and direction made this a possibility. Simply terrific...just make sure to keep some Kleenexes handy for this one.By the way, as a father of two daughters who are old enough to marry, what stunned me today about this couple was NOT the interracial angle but that they had only known each other for 10 days!! Now THAT was the crazy part to me!",

Joey was raised with a liberal education and intends to get married with Dr. John Prentice that is a black widower and needs to fly on that night to Geneva to work with the World Health Organization. Joey invites John's parents Mr. Prentice (Roy E. Glenn Sr.) and Mrs. Prentice (Beah Richards) to have dinner with her family and the couple flies from Los Angeles to San Francisco without knowing that Joey is white. Christina invites also the liberal Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway), who is friend of her family. Along the day and night, the families discuss the problems of their son and daughter. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a witty dramatic comedy about interracial marriage in the racist USA in the 60's. The theatrical story has magnificent performances and dialogs and has not aged after all these years. This is the last movie of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, who is the aunt of Katharine Houghton, has never seen this movie because of the loss of her friend. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Adivinhe Quem Vem Para Jantar\" (\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\")",

This film is one of the first to address the issue and it is not tame. When the young people go to the home of the white folks, there is a moment when a nuclear explosion may hit. Spencer Tracy always had a slow burn and he utilizes it well here. Still, it is too much for him at the beginning. One has to wonder if even the more liberal viewers of marriage knew that this was a road to a difficult life. Even today, it's a hard road to travel at times. One thing I appreciated was that we got the perspective from both sides, especially Sidney's father. Racial issues aren't always a one way street.

            "content": "People have, over the years, accused this film of making Sidney Poitier's character so flawless beyond a reasonable doubt that there would be no other way to accept his impending marriage (in the movie) to Katharine Houghton without making it a racial issue. The thing is, most people forget -- had Poitier been just a regular guy who had a less than stellar job, and been less than beautiful, this story would have ended up in the recycling bin. Just as gay people or Hispanics today, in order to create positive stories about themselves, have to idealize their characters to a god-like level, the same thing had to be done back then. And it was also appropriate to have not one, but two confrontation scenes: one with Poitier and Roy Glenn -- father and son -- and one with Beah Richards and Spencer, more subtle but equally poignant. GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is a film that resonated back then despite its deadline plot and tidy ending because it came at the right time and needed a positive resolution. I doubt audiences back then would respond to any other. Although it would not shock me if people then would be thinking Hollywood had finally lost its edge with this one. It was a keen decision to have Kate and Spencer be the leads because in doing so they were assuring not only box-office draw -- people would be returning to watch their favorite unmarried couple bicker, lovingly, yet again -- but a strong statement. After all, these two have the biggest subtext in the entire film: they had had their own iconoclastic relationship, it was coming to a close, and one only had to see Kate's expression just to a side of Spence's shoulder as he gave his closing speech. She was sitting at the right of the screen, her eyes glistening with tears, feeling the time was close, knowing just how much they loved each other even to the end. On this element only -- the final, lingering shot of Kate and Spence embracing each other, getting ready for dinner and an uneasy future, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is perfect.",

The pair are perfect together in their last film, their acting is so good and convincing as is everybody else's(especially Sidney Poitier as John Prentice) that the whole film is well worth watching for the acting alone. The ending may hold no surprises as such, but overall, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a smart, intelligent and touching film. It has a well-constructed story about a married rich couple whose liberal principles are tested by the proposed marriage of their daughter to a black doctor, and the writing is intelligent and smart. Some touching moments don't go amiss either, while the cinematography is crisp, the score is nicely done and the direction from Stanley Krammer is efficient. Overall, if you love Tracy and Hepburn, I think you'll be in for a treat! 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I loved it but it felt strange to me because my grandmother after 22 years of widowhood, had remarried to an African American man. He had become a blessing in my grandmother's life and in ours. How could Spencer Tracy of all people be against the union? After the movie we went to dinner and my grandmother answered all my questions with a single answer that's been with me always and that sometimes explains absurdities like Charlottesville 2017 - \"Society, humanity doesn't evolve all at the same time\" Of course Grandma', you were right. Watching Guess Who's Coming To Dinner in 2017 was an experience. Is not that Spencer Tracy is against their union, - Tracy was only worried to what his daughter was going to face 1967 - He was thinking like a father and not like a thinking, evolved liberal. On the other hand, Roy Glenn, Sidney Poitier's father objects to his son marrying a white girl. Sidney Poitier stops him by saying \"Dad, you see yourself as a colored man, I see myself as a man\" Was it as didactic as it sounds in 1967? Who cares? The message was delivered - I also was so moved to see Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy together for the last time and they knew it was for the last time. Sidney Poitier is superb as the messenger who points at the absurdity of racism. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a delicious document of its day.",

            "content": "It's probably fair to say that Sidney Poitier was the most influential black actor to confront racial barriers in his early film career. He spent most of the 1958 picture \"The Defiant Ones\" shackled to Tony Curtis, challenging movie goer perceptions of black/white antagonism in a man to man relationship further compounded by their role as escaped convicts. My personal favorite is 1967's \"In The Heat of the Night\", where his character Virgil Tibbs returns a slap to the face of a bigoted white man, demonstrating what he proclaims to his father in THIS film - \"I think of myself as a man\".Some reviewers decry the fact that Poitier wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here, citing an aggrieved sense of injustice based on racial grounds, but I don't know if I'm buying that. He actually WAS nominated for a Best Actor with co-star Curtis for \"The Defiant Ones\" nine years earlier, a film in which he had over the title billing in his first lead role. Then again, Cecil Kellaway was a Supporting Actor nominee here with less screen time and less importance to the film, so who can say. You just can't figure sometimes.For those who find the film dated, as many reviewers on this board have, I would like to offer that lemon a chance to make some lemonade. As a time capsule reminder of where we've come from as a society, it's interesting to note that Joanna (Katherine Houghton) uses the term 'Negro' and 'colored' to describe her fianc\u00e9e, and those descriptions come up elsewhere in the story. It's only Monsignor Ryan (Kellaway) who refers to 'blacks' as a race. Interesting to note, as his character was a Catholic priest who had the most enlightened approach to racial relations of all the 'older' characters, including Dr. Prentice's parents. While the Drayton's and Prentice's were examining their own racial attitudes, the Monsignor had already leaped that hurdle, never batting an eye when first introduced to Dr. Prentice.But like a number of reviewers, I do have some issue with the character of Joanna Drayton. Her character was written with so much goodness and light that she came across as fairly one-dimensional, and a definite lightweight compared to her fianc\u00e9's accomplishments. This was probably the main thing that distracted from my enjoyment of the picture, as Joanna could be counted on to present a happy face to everything, even though her situation presented profound obstacles to struggle through and overcome. Even if love conquers all, the challenges could have been more pronounced to make the effort more worthwhile.What's undeniably true is Spencer Tracy's observation to the Monsignor on the state of black and white relations from the standpoint of the picture's original release date. While bemoaning the fact that his daughter marrying a black man would have no impact on the attitudes of millions of people at the time, he was also prophetic in stating that it might take 'fifty or a hundred' years to reach that point of acceptance in society. Well it's almost fifty years, and a lot of the stigma presented in the film has been dealt with and overcome. On that basis, the film did knock down some barriers on the way to racial harmony, even if the country has experienced some bumps in the road along the way.",

Interracial marriage is an issue with people here in 2019 so you can only imagine it 52 years ago. Even if the movie took place in San Francisco-a bastion of liberality-old customs die hard.My feelings about the movie oscillated throughout. I watched from a guarded position in order to brace myself for the impact of ignorance and cultural insensitivities. I took a few blows as they showed themselves in varying degrees.Although John Prentice (Sidney Portier) was very much a successful and sensible man his chosen mate, Joanna \"Joey\" Drayton (Katharine Houghton), was very much the Pollyanna optimist. Her optimism crossed over to naivet\u00e9 which made me wince only because I felt she was setting herself up to be clobbered by reality.Mr. and Mrs. Drayton were pat enough characters with Christina Drayton (Katharine Hepburn) being a very supportive and understanding mom.Then there was the maid, Tillie (Isabell Sanford). Every scene she was in just darkened the movie with ignorance. She is the mother to Stephen (Samuel Jackson) of Django Unchained. Her indignant ignorance was appalling. It wasn't that she was against this interracial couple for the sake of the couple's wellbeing, she was against it because she saw Dr. Prentice as a black man trying to \"get above himself.\" If that wasn't the most self-hating, pessimistic, slave mentality thing to say. As though a black man marrying a white woman is him getting above himself. Never mind that he was an accomplished doctor and never mind that no race is truly superior to another that is how she saw it. That was probably one of the more degrading and upsetting parts of the movie.Finally, John's parents entered the fray. They were much like Joey's parents: supportive mother angry father.As my feelings about the movie rose and fell I found enough nuggets in there to actually like the movie. It was brave, it was risky, and all-in-all it was good.",

            "content": "... and although some of the films on the list seemed pretty obvious, my first reaction to this one was - Seriously? I've seen this several times and it treats everybody with dignity.For anybody who doesn't know, the film is about a liberal white couple (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as Matt and Christina Drayton) who learn that their 23 year old daughter is returning from vacation with her fiance that she has just met while on that vacation. And that fiance just happens to be black. When the Draytons were bringing up Joanna and teaching her that all people are equal, they probably did not imagine this scenario. The weird thing about all of this is that when the fiance arrives -Sidney Poitier as John Prentice - he tells the Draytons that they must consent to the marriage or he will not marry their daughter. I'll get to this weird ultimatum in a minute.If I were one of the parents I'd have tons of problems even today, and none of them would be about race. They are:1. Age difference. She is 23 and he is a 37 year old man who travels a lot for his job. Maybe to places she cannot go safely. She may have to be home alone quite a bit.2. He is a widower she has known for exactly 10 days. When a spouse dies it doesn't matter what problems they had, the dead spouse becomes enshrined in the widow/widower's mind as somebody who did no wrong when they were alive. And as the live spouse this is the standard by which you are measured.3. More on the ten days issue - They are still in the honeymoon phase of their relationship. What happens when all of those hormones calm down?Now back to the weird ultimatum thing. At age 23 Joanna didn't legally require her parents' consent, but women in the USA at the time (1967) were still treated as so delicate that they had to move from their father's care to their husband's care. That was changing rapidly in the 60s, but it was still a norm. This is probably at least part of what is going on with the permission issue. The changing independence of women in American culture was happening at the same time that the civil rights era was beginning to yield real fruit, so this is an interesting mix of issues.I think the only thing that made me wince just a little is when Spencer Tracy introduces Isabel Sanford, the maid, as \"a member of our family for 22 years\". No, she works for you. When she gets too old to work for you does she get a pension? Did you remember her in your will? If not, she is an employee. Do not sentimentalize this relationship however much you might like and respect her. And then there is the issue of - when Joanna and John kiss in the cab - making sure that the audience cannot actually see them kiss - it is a reflection in a mirror, and even then it is hard to see. Who knows, in 1967 that might have made the film illegal in 17 states.I also think it is odd when John's mother is talking to Joanna's dad (Spence) out on the patio. She says that men forget all about love and passion when they get old and forget about sexual things. Seriously? Do men ever actually forget about sexual things? Isn't remembering sexual things when they are in no shape for that kind of activity what puts a double digit percentage of them in their grave?The best scene - John is talking to his dad, a retired mailman. They have it out, father and son. And John says the defining line of the film \"You think of yourself as a black man, I think of myself as a man\". Because that is really what the civil rights era boils down to. Looking at people without race as an issue.This film has aged a bit - it's been a culturally busy 54 years. But it still holds up quite well.",

It remains relevant today, even if not to the same degree. And even though I'm almost thirty years old, I can say with mixed emotions of embarrassment and vindication, that Spencer Tracy taught me a better way to tie a tie. Who's says movies don't teach you anything?The film is dated, to be sure, by many things, from clothing to music, cars and expressions. At times the dialogue seemed a bit hokey, and others, simply brilliant. I swear, I half expected an entourage of go-go dancers to spontaneously burst through the streets of San Francisco. And if I never hear the \"Story Of Love\" ever again in my life, it would be too soon.But I can't help but think that the more things change in thirty years, sometimes they remain the same. Certainly there's more examples of interracial couples today than thirty years ago, and therefore a greater degree of tolerance, but for a lot of narrow-minded individuals, it's still as controversial or \"appalling\" as it was thirty years ago.Some of the lines actually had me laughing out loud, enjoying the moment as it follows into another well complimented scene. I'm speaking in particular of the scene where Katharine Hepburn fires her employee for her prejudicial views, and basically everything that follows that scene for the next five minutes.I try my best to imagine what it would be like to be in the shoes of any character in the film, to appreciate what it might've been like for them, in that time, and while I think I can muster an inkling, I don't think my creativity is up to a challenge of that nature.

            "content": "Continuing to review films featured with people of color in chronological order for Black History Month, we're once again in 1967 with Sidney Poitier's third film in release that year: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Here, he's Dr. John Prentice who, after spending vacation time in Hawaii for 10 days with one Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton), is engaged to her and is meeting her parents for the first time in San Francisco. They're Christina (Katharine Hepburn) and Matt (Spencer Tracy) and they're both a little shocked when they meet John despite both being liberal people. Christina gets over hers while Matt takes a while. Their maid Tillie (Isabel Sanford) isn't thrilled at all while old friend Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway) approves and is bemused by all the reactions including those of John's parents (Beah Richards, Roy Glenn) when they arrive. I'll stop there and just say that while I'm sure the whole thing was made to provide such a mostly perfect representation of the black race for public consumption in presenting Poitier's characterization, he's still allowed to be a little human whether talking back a little to his father or saying he'll call off the marriage if his fianc\u00e9's parents have any reservations without consulting Joey first. Many of the funniest moments come from Ms. Sanford's Tillie during her outbursts about \"black power\"! There's also some nice moments concerning Tracy and Hepburn on screen together especially when one knows that this was Spencer's final movie before his death. Why, seeing Ms. Hepburn cry during her longtime loving partner's last speech on set is perhaps the most touching thing here. But let's not cut the lines of Ms. Richards and Mr. Glenn short here. Roy makes the then-pertinent point of how his son and fianc\u00e9 would be considered criminals in at least 16 states (actually 14 during filming) if their relationship was known. But Beah herself is the one who gets through to Spencer about how both him and her husband seemed to have forgotten what it was like when they themselves were young and impulsive. It's that part that got her the worthy Oscar nomination. In fact, Cecil Kellaway, Ms. Hepburn, and Mr. Tracy all got worthy nods with Hepburn a worthy win (though I admit that with the exception of Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark, I haven't seen the other nominees for Best Actress that year). I'm not so sure about the Best Picture nomination but it's not as embarrassing as that for Doctor Doolittle (though I'm basing that more on reputation since I've yet to see that one in its entirety). In summary, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is still quite entertaining even with the obvious liberal point-of-view. P.S. Two other African-American players worth mentioning are Barbara Randolph (daughter of Lillian Randolph who's in my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life) as Dorothy who does a groovy dance with a white delivery guy and D'Urvile Martin who as Frankie gets his car accidentally hit by Spencer's automobile when the latter backs out of an ice cream parlor.",

            "content": "It would be completely understandable if anyone criticized this movie for playing it very safe after taking some severe risks at the beginning, and that in doing so the story not only became progressively formulaic; but the characters appeared to be stereotyped and, worst of all, self-contradictory and inconsistent.That said, the acting here is undoubtedly more than enough to overcome these issues and redeem them, nay, to totally justify these seemingly nonsensical changes and alterations that happened to some of the characters, most noticeably Matt and Christina Drayton. I have seen a lot of great performances that are able to elevate the characters and even the entire movie in general. But, frankly, I have never seen any performance, no matter how superb it may be, that can convince me of what I considered an unmistakably major flaw. What makes me appreciate the acting, in particular, in this movie is that it opened my eyes to some hidden underlying themes of the movie's story, which are more than fundamental to understand the movie properly. If the fabulously realistic and sincere performances, somehow, didn't do the same for you, I suggest you try you figure out some key themes to consider them as you're watching the movie. Two of the most important themes are; the late resurgence of the inherited awful traditions and beliefs, and the undiscovered hypocrisy. Yes, that's how profound this apparently simple film actually is! Of course, the shift in Matt Drayton's attitude could have been executed way more smoothly and maturely; but the abrupt nature of the changes could be fairly, if not quite easily, taken as a reflection of the character's disorder.Spencer Tracy, in his final role, gave, for lack of a better word, a mature performance that made his character surprisingly believable despite its outwardly incompatible attitudes that made the character of Matt Drayton seem to be immensely problematic. Sidney Poitier's performance, as the handsome African-American Dr. John Prentice, is solid, steady, committed, engaging and relatable at the same time. Katharine Houghton captured the rebelliousness, impetuousness, and also the innocence of her character, Joey, so perfectly. She reminded me quite a bit of another Katharine; Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson in The Graduate, which was, also coincidentally, released at the same year, 1967. But it's Katharine Hepburn who stole the show here with her Oscar-winning performance that I personally consider as one of the best low-key performances in a leading female role I've ever seen in film!I would be lying if I said that I found the second half of the movie half as entertaining and riveting. Nevertheless, the dialogue was much better at the second half (the final monologue is simply remarkable!) as it was at the first, which is noticeably elevated by, once again, the incredible acting.The movie is decidedly filled with stereotypical characters, but the only one that bothered me is the maid, Tillie, whom I didn't find to be funny at all; actually she is quite annoying. Her character's motivations and attitudes are justified, though.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is an essential classic 1960s film, and one of the best films that examine prejudice and racism; it tackles its weighty themes with surprising depth, humor and breeziness. It's also very relevant nowadays. And there is no doubt that it has major influences on hundreds of movies that came after it, especially today's.(8.5/10)",

            "content": "Risky film that could only sport the biggest and most respected names in Hollywood at the time. Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton have fallen in love and are all set to get married, but Poitier is African-American and Houghton is white. Get the picture? The couple's parents (Roy Glenn and Oscar-nominee Beah Richards as Poitier's parents and Oscar-winner Katharine Hepburn and Oscar-nominee Spencer Tracy as Houghton's) try to cope with the situation as the two seem determined to be together. Poitier knows the complications while Houghton seems really naive and innocent about the whole situation. Catholic priest Cecil Kellaway (also Oscar-nominated) tries to get the parents to understand what their children are feeling. A film that spawned controversy and more controversy in 1967 and still a film that strikes a nerve in many circles even today. The film just added to the excellence of Hepburn and Poitier while Houghton became more of an outcast in Hollywood. Many say that the movie drove Tracy to an early grave as he died shortly after production and did not even get to hear that he had received an Oscar nod. Stanley Kramer's striking direction and the Oscar-winning screenplay are both right on target. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a production that tackles interracial relationships in a frank and intriguing manner. The film is not kind to the older generations and it is also not kind to religious figures getting caught up in non-religious affairs. A strong film that stands strong with the other great films of 1967 (\"In the Heat of the Night\", \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"The Graduate\", \"In Cold Blood\"). 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner takes place during the course of one day as two families struggle to overcome their concerns about the interracial marriage of their children. This film is a treat for the eyes with lovely sets and beautiful people. It also has a nice 1960's feel that is reinforced by sophisticated wardrobing and an \"easy listening\" soundtrack--featuring The Glory of Love as the signature tune. The film relies very heavily on the use of dialog and reflects the elegance of a time when people were entertained by stimulating conversation. The San Francisco backdrop also is the perfect setting for a movie that challenged racial convention.But there are a few serious flaws. This is an introductory role for Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece) who plays Sidney Portier's fianc\u00e9--Johanna Drayton. Her inexperience is apparent, particularly in comparison to heavyweights Portier, Tracy and Hepburn and as a result, she is unconvincing in the part. Moreover, her character is not well-written or well-developed which makes it difficult to understand why Sidney Portier's character--John Prentice-would fall in love with a woman who appears to have so little to offer intellectually --given his significant professional achievements as a doctor. One also must ask why it was necessary for his character to be cast as a doctor in order to be seen as an acceptable partner for a young white woman who had not really accomplished anything accept being born into a privileged family. The answer is simple. Making Prentice a doctor-and not just any doctor-but a world renowned expert in tropical medicine, made the interracial relationship more acceptable to white audiences during the 1960s.The other cast members are outstanding and the on-screen chemistry phenomenal. Katharine Hepburn (Christina Drayton) and Spencer Tracy (Newspaper Publisher Matt Drayton) deliver brilliant performances as Johanna's parents. John Prentice's modest working class parents are played with great dignity by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glen. Mrs. Prentice and Mrs. Drayton favor the marriage and both characters provide passionate, articulate arguments as to why their husbands should agree. But their husbands voice serious objections and the families spend the evening in intense discussions over the issue, accurately reflecting the racial fears that existed 40 years ago. Prentice's father reminds him that in many states interracial marriage is illegal and that he is \"getting out of line.\" There are also a number of very memorable and funny lines. In the scene in which Matt Drayton wonders why \"the colored kids dance better than the white kids\", Portier's response is classic--\"you dance the Watusi, but we are the Watusi!\"(For readers under 40, the Watusi was a popular dance in the 1960s and also an African tribe). Cecil Kelloway, who plays friend of the family, Monsignor Ryan, deftly brings a sense of humor and moral guidance that is effective because it is not \"preachy\". He challenges Matt Drayton's liberal credentials and suggests that Drayton's misgivings about his daughter marrying a black man reveal his hypocrisy. Isabel Sanford (\"Weezy from The Jeffersons TV program) plays the feisty maid of the Draytons.It's been said that in the final scene Tracy--who was very ill at the time and who died shortly after the movie was completed--delivered one of the longest soliloquies in American film history, in only one take. Katherine Helpurn was clearly so moved by the scene that it's hard to believe that she is just acting as her eyes brim with tears.Although the some of the sentiments are dated, this film is highly entertaining, and provides a rare opportunity to experience outstanding performances from six gifted actors who bring compassion and depth to Stanley Kramer's film. Its' angst relative to interracial marriage also reminds us of how far we have not come.",

            "content": "I wrote a review for IMDb about the film Saratoga which I got some bad criticism for. It was obvious that Jean Harlow was seriously ill making this rather pedestrian film about folks at the racetrack. No serious drama of significance here, why wasn't the poor woman getting medical attention.Looking at Spencer Tracy it also is obvious he's in pretty bad shape, but he at 67 was two generations older than his co-star Jean Harlow at MGM in their salad days. And this final film of his and final screen partnership with Katharine Hepburn had a lot more of a significant message than Saratoga did. It's enobling in its own way to see how much faith Spencer Tracy had in the project.Oh, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is certainly dated now. But back in 1967 it was daring enough. Tracy and Hepburn who for the fourth time in their nine films play a husband and wife from the start, get the news that their daughter Katharine Houghton is getting married to an older man who is a widower. Oh and by the way, she's marrying Sidney Poitier who's a doctor.Getting a doctor for a son-in-law would be reason enough for celebration in most homes, but interracial marriage was still a daring topic. As Roy Glenn who is Poitier's father reminds him, he's still breaking the law in 1967 in about 17 states. The film is about how Tracy and Hepburn and Glenn and his wife Beah Richards deal with the news.Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film and she's the character on screen most of the time. Her best moment comes when she fires Virginia Christine who works for her and rushes to Hepburn's side to express \"concern\" for her.One of the things that made Spencer Tracy the great player he was, was that incredible ability he had to make the audience feel he was listening. My favorite scene of his in the film is when Beah Richards is alone with him on the porch and she compares him with her husband how the two of them have forgotten all about romance. As she speaks the two of them are profiled against the screen, Richards to the left and Tracy to the right. Though Richards is in the foreground your attention is completely on Tracy and is reactions even though we're only seeing half of his face. Stole the scene without speaking a word.I know so many people who profess liberalism in all things, but never can quite walk the walk when necessary. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is about that, putting your money where your mouth is.Watching my VHS copy of it again this evening, the scene with Glenn and Poitier brought home something else to me. Just like Poitier and Houghton were illegal back in 1967 in some parts of America, it was only until 2003 that gay people were illegal in and of themselves in several states. And even now same sex couples battle for marriage rights and equality. Maybe Guess Who's Coming to Dinner isn't quite so dated at that. And maybe Brokeback Mountain is the closest thing that gay people have to a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner right now.But can you see in a few years a man or a woman bringing home a partner of the same sex to Mom and Dad and announcing they're getting married in Massachusetts?Now that would be a great film.",

            "content": "Hmmm. I'm torn about this movie but I guess overall I find it too out of balance to work as other than as an historical piece.The things I like about it? The sound-stage version of an outrageous San Francisco home. (A bridge to bridge view from the patio, which is not to be confused with the separate garden. Filled with expensive art. If such a place existed what would it cost today? $10 million? $15 million - but when the parents go out for ice cream they drive what would be a sort of old looking small to mid-sized car. Ah, Hollywood!) Seeing Isobel Sanford in something that doesn't involve Sherman Helmsley. Katharine Hepburn going through four slightly-oddball costumes over about 9 hours of movie time. (And what is with her and her choice of hats?!?) The bizarro, off-kilter scene with the dancing delivery boy.The things I don't like? Well first and foremost the fact that this movie is set up so as to eliminate any sense of the REAL complexities of life. Poitier's character is not just a great guy, he is a physician. Wait, no ... not just a physician but one who has been on the faculty of some of the best medical schools...AND who has devoted his career to public health AND who is internationally well-known. Gosh, you think, is there ANY white man that Joanna might ever meet who could be as well-credentialled as him? And Joanna, we are told, has always been HAPPY!!! as a baby, as a child, as a teen, in college. Why, she's just the most perfect thing. Her parents? Unabashed liberals. Generous and kind to the help (even giving a $5000 bonus to an employee being fired.) His parents? Sober and hard-working. Sacrificing for their son. Kind and loving.Wouldn't it be nice to see at least one of the parents being SOMEWHAT unpleasant? Kramer just sets things up in a way where there is no real tension in the movie. We know Tracy and Hepburn's characters are too good to turn into bigots and that they are such great parents that their daughter's happiness is all that will matter. They may be friends with a Catholic monseigneur (though a point is made to say at least twice that they aren't Roman Catholics, what's that about?) but he is the most liberal happy-go-lucky priest that existed in the 1960's and raises not a single objection to interracial marriage (uncharacteristic of the Irish priests I knew of from the 60s --- but maybe it's because he's so busy drinking Scotch -- if you'll excuse THAT offensive Irish stereotype in a movie about prejudice.)The look and feel of the movie is a little odd, because of the juxtaposition of real locations (SFO, the ice cream store) with the very \"faux\" stage set style used in scenes like the driveway in front of the house. For a movie that is supposed to be exploring the gritty reality of racism in America, seeing someone drive a phony delivery truck past the fake plants outside the fake house seems particularly jarring and inappropriate.And of course, everyone is rich or well-to-do. Even the retired postal worker and his wife can afford to fly up to SF on a last minute airfare (which were even less cheap back in the 1960s than they are today) and, we are assured, can afford to fly to Geneva for the wedding? So ultimately their \"problems\" about love and marriage seem less important, because we don't really worry that John or Joanna's lives will be seriously crippled if they don't marry --- they are both so VERY charming, successful, self-directed and fulfilled that we know that they would find someone else if it came to that.(For that matter, no one seems too bothered by the more substantial problem, which is that people who fall in love \"in 20 minutes\" and plan to marry only weeks after meeting, are quite likely to find themselves unhappily stuck with a person they knew nothing about -- regardless of their color.)And poor Sydney Poitier, who I think was probably a good actor but seemed to have to sacrifice his talent on the cross of being the first great cross-over black movie actor --- always playing someone who is whiter than the white folks around him, usually better spoken, always smarter, always having to deliver the over-written, didactic speech about how times are changing for the black man, and never allowed to use a contraction in a sentence, lest he sound too ethnic. I find his acting to be terribly mannered most of the time, but I think that is mostly because of the straight-jacket forced on him by the types of roles he played in the 1960s.So the movie just feels very manufactured --- structured so that every point of view or objection will be raised but rationally batted aside and that -- less than 12 hours after they show up, the couple will head off to Switzerland with a family united behind them and the audience can all leave the theater feeling that love conquers all and dealing with racism is just a matter of having a good conversation over drinks.",

But its subject matter and the way it deals with a pretty - if needlessly - controversial topic is noteworthy and a plausible entertainment diversion. In current times, few other controversial films about risqu\u00e9 subjects are this amusing to watch unfold.The plot: Joanna (Katharine Houghton) is your typical, all- American white girl, pure, innocent, and smiley. She is vacationing in Hawaii when she meets Dr. John Wayde Prentice Jr. (Sidney Poitier), an intelligent black doctor with a laundry-list of accolades. The film opens with them returning to San Francisco on a whim to meet Joanna's parents. She doesn't believe they'll be surprised; her parents (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are known to be very liberal people (so liberal there's an image of FDR on her father's desk). He, on the other hand, knows for a fact they'll be shocked. Sure enough, they are - her mother can barely keep her jaw closed when John is in her house. Her father is a tad more optimistic at first, but when his daughter drops the bomb that they plan on marrying asap, both her parents must come to a decision over dinner. Anyone for cocktails?This is the perfect example of a film that doesn't age particularly well. The United States of America in 2013 has evolved greatly from very close-minded notions/attitudes about race into a very accepting, liberal state of mind for the most part. Few stop and stare on the streets when they see a white woman join hands with a black man or vice-versa. The mindset and the notions in the 1960's of interracial relationships and are understandable now, and calling the attitudes of the characters in this film unrealistic is a critique of culture - not the film. Their attitudes are simply akin to that of people in the respected time-period; in this case, the late 1960's during the ongoing Civil Rights movement in America.It's also obvious this is totally a plot set up specifically for a film. It's realistic in a sense, but even some instances are carried a bit past believability. However, the way Guess Who's Coming to Dinner questions your ethics and plays with your emotions is an admirable rarity. It allows one to ask themselves if they had a daughter who dated outside her race if they'd consent to the relationship. How long would it take you to come to a decision of whether or not to allow them to do it? Do personal achievements and accomplishments of your daughter's partner come second if he's not of your race?Moreover, when it comes to these race-parables, acting can really make or break the film and its subject matter. Thankfully, A- listers such as Poitier, Houghton, Hepburn, and Tracy make this a bearable affair. It clearly too a reasonable level of comfortableness to get adjusted to the material provided here, allowing the actors their ability to express and convince, and thankfully the immediate awkwardness wears off rather quickly.The biggest problem with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is its very sanctimonious and often plays like a statement from the \"Why Can't We All Just Get Along?\" committee. However, strong performances, some truly great memorable longs, and constant questioning of ethics make this film stronger than it may have initially been. Race is a subject that constantly shifts focus in terms of how we view it, how we portray it, and how we accept it. If current films age as poorly as this one, I'm curious how I'll view films like Do the Right Thing, ones I currently hail as audacious masterpieces.

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)This is so manufactured a piece, with characters molded to make such polite, socially charged statements, and with their interactions calculated in such detail, it's hard to appreciate just how this movie touched nerves and raised expectations in the late 1960s. Most of us now see the problem of interracial marriage as a common one, if not widely accepted or accomplished, and the discussions about it don't necessarily boil down to love triumphs over all.Seeing Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn together again is a treat, and you might actually see something of the real pair here (they were both easily this wealthy and polite and sophisticated). Add the poise and beautiful ease of Sidney Poitier and you already know this will not be a shouting match, no matter what the stakes. The point, of course, is that Poitier plays a man who is going to marry the daughter of our starring couple, and they (and we) learn of it in the first few minutes, and the movie deals with everyone dealing with it for the rest of the film. They never even get to eat.The parade of conversations, in groups and in almost every combination of two and three people, each touching on different social or personal aspects of the problem (they do call it a problem), allows us to see what were the prevailing views and worries of greater American society, 1967. But only among rich, educated, liberals. The back and forth is smart, balanced, and reasonable. And of course the result is a given from the get go. People have complained, sadly, that Poitier never represented \"real\" blacks in America, and if they mean he wasn't an angry or streetwise or ghetto poor or isolated Southern repressed or racist or whatever other stereotype you have in mind for African Americans, that's true. He's a man who speaks and talks like any other Ivy League person. And that might be fair enough. He is what he is. And there are and were a lot of African-Americans who were like him, at least in the broad view. He also provided a less controversial kind of symbol of the American Black male, so that the problem for White America wasn't an exaggerated fear of a stranger very different from them, but more specifically a confusion about someone who was rather like them. Except for some \"pigmentation,\" as the father in this movie says at the end.I think the bigger problem, if there is a problem at all here, is that Hepburn and Tracy don't represent \"real\" whites. They're too easily eager to be accepting. In a way that's part of the point--even for people totally open to mixed marriages, it gets difficult when its their daughter about to marry a \"negro,\" which is the word most used in this film. So this is a very limited microcosm. All of my offhand thinking here proves how really valid the film is today. It's not just a window on that time, for a specific subset of people, but an echo of other racial situations then and now. It makes you think it through without resorting to knee-jerks and dismissals. It's fast and convincing and everyone in their own way is admirable.One last fascinating aspect. The woman and daughter (Katharine Houghton) in this young mixed race couple speculates that their children will one day be president. The man and future son-in-law (Portier) hesitates and thinks maybe just Secretary of State. Amazingly, if they had had children then, they would be not far in age from our own mixed-race president. And Condi Rice happened a few years ago. The timing and prescience of this movie is right on. And if you just want great acting and a high level of honesty in the making of this set-piece drama, you won't be disappointed.",

The niece is played by Katharine Houghton, real life niece of Ms. Hepburn, and Sidney Poitier. I wonder how Ms. Houghton got the part as she was rarely heard from again after this picture.Cecil Kellaway is the priest. I guess that any family- liberal or conservative-would need a spiritual leader after such news.The fun really gets going when Poitier's parents come. Mother is Beah Richards, a lovely middle class woman, who sat on the couch and was just mouthing her words. Why a best supporting Oscar nomination for this? Richards was equally effective in \"In the Heat of the Night\" that same year.Tracy's speech towards the end of the film is great. It sums up the hope of every parent-especially those who are tolerant of inter-racial marriages. He gives them their blessings. His Oscar nomination was deserved, though he lost to Rod Steiger for \"In the Heat of the Night.\" Hepburn is Hepburn. As usual, she put on those magnificent tears and was granted an Oscar. Sorry folks, this was completely undeserved in a year that we had Faye Dunaway for \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and Anne Bancroft for \"The Graduate.\"Overlooked in performances was the Tracy-Hepburn \"maid\" played well by Isabel Sanford. Confronting Houghton, she is not exactly for the marriage.Sanford brings comic relief in her role as the maid. Poitier's parents are equally apprehensive but all coalesce after Tracy's dramatic speech. Had this excellent film been made years ago, Hepburn would have easily had the Houghton role. We see America at a crossroad in the film. Times are changing despite the fact that it is mentioned about the governor of Alabama. Remember George and Lurleen Wallace? They sure epitomized bigotry in those days. I believe that the film would have even been a better one had the parents not been given the ultimatum of approving or disapproving in one day. The subject matter was difficult to begin with; setting deadlines would make it even more difficult. American was changing. Poitier even makes reference to his future children being Secretary of State. Guess what happened in 2008?A definite film for the socially conscientious. Will it change minds regarding inter-racial marriages? Methinks not, but it is worthwhile seeing.",

            "content": "Younger viewers may not \"get\" this film, because they don't know an America where miscegenation was illegal in many states (anti-miscegenation laws were overturned by the Supreme Court right about when this film was released). I was 18 when I went to see this film, and because it was starring the late Spencer Tracy (he died just days after the film was completed), my grandmother asked if I would take her. I won't say she was appalled, but she had extremely mixed feelings about the topic. I remember when she later visited me when I was then living outside of Washington, and we would go downtown, I would hear her sighing whenever she would see a mixed race couple...and that was in the mid-1970s. But she was from a different era, and from a western New York town where there were no minorities.So, for the young people who view this film, it's a good history lesson. For the older viewers, it's a good reminder of how far we have come, but make no mistake, the emotions found in this film are still around, just muted, and now more in the minority.Katharine Hepburn (the mother) looks wonderful in this film, and it's interesting to compare her to Katharine Houghton (the daughter), who was, in real life, Hepburn's niece. Hepburn does wonderfully here, and I think she was deserving of the Academy Award she won for her performance.Spencer Tracy was -- although the public didn't know it at the time -- dying. There were doubts he could even finish the picture...but he did, and he turns in one of his finest performances in a career chock full of fine performances. He was deserving of his Academy Award nomination for this film, though he lost to Rod Steiger (although Hepburn always said her award was for the both of them, and it probably was). Tracy looks surprisingly vital here, but then again, there were many accommodations to film around his illnesses, but he is resplendent in this wonderful role designed especially for him. about half way through the film there is a comedy scene of Tracy and Hepburn at a drive-in restaurant. If you think Tracy looks sick here, he was. This was actually the last time he ever appeared before a motion picture camera. The scene was left until last because if he had been unable to complete it, the film could still have been completed without this segment...though it is a treasure.Sidney Poitier is so good here. He acts so much with subtle gestures -- just as does Tracy -- that you see the nervous husband to be...not the swagger of a world renowned doctor.One of the most charming performances in the film is that of Cecil Kellaway as the Irish priest and friend of the family. Perhaps because of his age, according to the new Spencer Tracy biography, Kellaway -- like Tracy -- was having some problems completing his work for the film, although he went on to quite a few more films and television appearances.Another gem of a performance here is that of Beah Richards, who plays Poitier's mother. A fine actress, this is one of her most notable performances, for which she received an Academy Award nomination.Part of the brilliance of this film is how Kramer crafted it. Did he choose White parents who were bigoted? No, although that would have gotten more laughs...but then again, although there is humor in this film, it is really a drama. Instead, Kramer chose to make the White parents liberals, whose deepest beliefs were then brought into question by the situation.And then there's the climactic scene at the end of the picture where Spencer Tracy delivers his soliloquy. Some have said that the scene was filmed without stopping, but in the new Tracy biography we learn that in actuality it took 5 day to rehearse and film. Poitier described Tracy's performance in this scene as \"making magic\". Kramer captured the raw emotion of Spencer Tracy actually speaking about his life with Katherine Hepburn, and her tears and the catch in his voice is unmistakable. Yes, Poitier was correct, this scene is film magic.As a long-time fan of Spencer Tracy, the best thing about this film is that he was able to finish it. Tracy was considered by many to be the finest actor of his time, and he a number of notable performances in his later years -- \"Judgment At Nuremberg\" and \"Inherit The Wind\", for example. Then the comedy \"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\". And then the icing on his professional cake -- \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\", and although he didn't live to know it, his $4 million dollar film ended up making a $66 million profit...not to mention rave reviews from most critics. A fitting end to a stupendous career.I don't see this film as being any more outdated than any other film. Yes, some of our language has changed (\"Negro\", for example), prevailing attitudes have changed, but the issues remain more than many people today realize.Bravo to Stanley Kramer. Bravo to Spencer Tracy. Bravo to Sidney Poitier. Bravo to Kate Hepburn. A rare \"9\" and a place forever on my DVD shelf.",

This is a kind of a comedy I haven't seen maybe for years.I felt the characters and the situation so alive and close to me, it is incredible. It remembered me when I had to make that first visit at a girlfriends house, meet the parents, be friendly to some completely unknown people, act as an adult, as a man, when there are four parents around... And there are scenes with a flip I will never forget, like Spencer Tracy eating his ice cream and changing his mind over it, Hilary being fired or the two fathers settling about the situation as 'the only reasonable people in the boat'.The film also started me to think over how I would react as a parent in such a situation. Today, marriage between races is not that shocking, but I can easily imagine for my future daughter someone, who would shock me with his proposal. It easy to see others on screen struggling to break down their own walls and prejudices, but in real life it is so much harder. It is so true, what Mahatma Ghandi said - 'You must be the change you wish to see in the world'.It's just a funny twist from life, that I've seen 'Kinsey' a few days ago, where Katharine Houghton also appears as Mrs. Spaulding, almost 40 years later (2005).This movie became one of my favorites - 10/10.",

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) **** (out of 4) Parents Matt and Christina Drayton (Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn) are in for the shock of their lives when their daughter Joey (Katharine Houghton) shows up with a black man (Sidney Poitier) saying that they are about to be married.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is a film that certainly wanted to deliver a message and like the greatest work of Stanley Kramer it does so without having to be preachy or beat the viewer over the head with that message. The film was certainly try to show people that love is more important than race and it delivers that message in a great way. As a film buff, it was also the last of nine films that Tracy and Hepburn would make together and in fact it earned her an Oscar. As for Tracy, he would pass away seventeen days after he finished filming so his final speech in the movie is all the more powerful.In a lot of ways the Oscar-winning screenplay plays out like a courtroom drama as we've got a group of characters that throughout the film break apart and have a variety of conversations with other people. This includes the parents of the black man as well as a black maid who objects to everything going on. Throughout the running time each of the characters are thrown together as they try to play out their objections to what is going on while also trying to tell the other why they are right or wrong.What I love most in movies is great acting in a good drama and that's exactly what we get here. Tracy, Hepburn and Poitier are three of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen and to have all three together just makes for some truly great moments. There's no question that Tracy and everyone around him knew that he was dying when this was filmed so it's clear that he came out of retirement for a reason. He's simply wonderful here and there's no doubt that he steals the show and especially with his fiery delivery at the very end. The tender touch between he and Hepburn during this scene is something magical to watch.All of the performances are wonderful and I thought they really brought the screenplay to life. There are some great, fully developed characters here and I thought the situation that they are in was perfectly executed. Are there flaws with the film? Sure. Critics slam the film because the black man is perhaps the greatest and most successful black man in the history of Earth. Would audiences back then have objected more to the film had the male lead not been played by Poitier is the most loved black actor in history? Perhaps.But with all of that being said, the film's power still packs a great punch fifty-years after it was released. It really does show what a good story and great acting can do.",

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, according to Stanley Kramer, he portray the interracial marriage and show the idealism of two couple difference racial. Therefore, the movie itself does not give a chance for the couple to know their love, for-example there is only one shot that shows lips of Dr. Prentice and Joanna meet together. However, in 1960s it was a period political movements of racial segregation, though it was lawful for interracial marriage. Eventually, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, came on the prep time and when the couple plan to meet there future in-laws they believe it might be difficult for the family to accept there relationship.

            "content": "Here's a great way to spend an afternoon: watching some of the greatest actors of all time in a film that still has relevance today. Such a cast! Hepburn is wonderful as always, very energetic, with no trace of the shakiness of her later years.Tracy, gruff, the way most probably remember him - sort of a ratcheted up version of the roles he played with Hepburn in earlier years. His ill health is obvious though to the careful observer: voice a little weak at times, and Tracy's step missing the \"spring\" of his earlier films. The fact that this his last film was so memorable, and of such quality just adds to his legend.Potier of course turns in a great performance, impeccable as always.Watch for Isabel Sanford, (\"The Jefferson's\") particularly the one memorable scene where she explains to Potier's character just what \"black power\" really is.Cecil Kellaway sparkles as Monsignor Ryan, and Beah Richards and Roy Glenn, as the parents to Potier's character, mirror Hepburn and Tracy.Indeed, there is so much real honest-to-god acting talent concentrated in this movie, it seems almost unfair, what I'm about to say: Katharine Houghton, as 'Joey' is the only character with only 2 dimensions. She's the ever-smiling, but clueless daughter and object of Dr. Prentice' affection. She's such a Pollyanna, and remains oblivious to the drama going on all around her, and everyone else conspires to keep her in the dark throughout the entire film. (No wonder her father is concerned.) I think it's fair to say that Houghton's character is the one weak spot in this otherwise excellent film.That said, this is a wonderful film that I will always watch when it comes on. It's such a treat to watch these legendary actors at work. I highly recommend it.By the way, there's no glass in Spencer's eyeglasses during the ending monologue, is there \u0096 he's wearing only frames, right?",

            "content": "This film is of course dated in many portions but still remains a powerful motion picture over thirty years after its release. Superb acting and dialog is what overcomes the dated aspect. Hepburn and Tracy are Matt  and Christina Drayton a wealthy and successful couple who have a daughter named Joey played by Katherine Houghton who comes home and tells them she has met the man of her dreams. The only problem in the story is that he is of a different race. Sidney Poitier is John Wade Prentice a successful individual who is the man of  Joeys dreams and is of  the different race.  The Draytons are people who in theory  hold no prejudice toward any one regardless of their race, color or creed but now have those same views put harshly to the test when it's  their own daughter involved. Sort of like the NIMBY philosophy \"YES YES build more prisons, build more nuclear power plants, build more missile silos  but Not In My BackYard! \" Sure I believe in interracial marriage as long as it's not my daughter\".John Wades parents essentially share the same views as  the Draytons. However Johns parents particularly his father played by Roy E. Glenn Sr. seems more realistic when speaking to his child about the situation  than does Matt Drayton. He tells his son the way it really is and most likely will be. \"You'll even be illegal in some states\" he reminds his son.  The two couples eventually come to grips with the fact  that no matter what they say they will not be able to prevent their two children from going through with their plans.  Spencer Tracy throughout his film career  delivered many powerful lines of dialog. The final moments of this film he delivers perhaps his greatest. Which also turned out to be his last. AFI ranked this film number ninety-nine on their list of top one hundred. Because of it's powerful story and social issue it deserved to be higher.  Other films that deal with interracial marriage to see are 1956's GIANT and 1961's Bridge to the Sun.",

            "content": "I suppose in 1967, this was a breakthrough in terms of dealing with race issues.  The movie pads its own chances of not offending Joe Bigot in Alabama by casting Sidney Poitier, the King of Hollywood at the time, as the 'problem' (he is called that at one point) and Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy as liberals who have to deal with this as best as they can while not alienating the white audience with too much tolerance and not alienating the black audience by respecting Sidney's character.  In point of fact, Sidney is the most credible character in the movie.  He transcends the material, which is so incredibly one-sided that its embarrassing at times, and the direction, which amounts to people getting up from the couch, strolling around the room, and at the end, going off into tag-teams.  Why is everyone so concerned with how the liberals are going to react, and the hell with Sidney's parents?  Why is their opinion not important?In terms of character, Sidney is it, but in terms of acting, Tracy is superior to everyone.  He can make a throwaway scene like ordering ice cream memorable, and when he's contemplating the entire situation and comes to a realization and says 'I'll be a son of a bitch', he makes it so natural that you actually see the realization on his face.  His final speech is an much a love letter to Kate as it is a cry for tolerance, and he delivers it perfectly.  Why he didn't win Best Actor is questionable, but why Hepburn did win Best Actress is even more questionable.  One of the least demanding parts she ever had to play, her competition was particularly fantastic and how she emerged victorious is anyone's guess.  Maybe hers was for the both of them.",

            "content": "Dr. Matt Drayton, played by the late Spencer Tracy, believes that all men are equal. So when he's introduced to Dr. John Prentice, Sidney Poitier as the man who wants to marry his daughter Joey, he asks him a simple question. How would their children live in a country where interracial marriage was still forbidden in many states or at least frowned upon? Poitier, playing again an elegant and well-spoken man, explains that Joey believes her kids would define the values that America stands for, so much that they would be the most likely to rule the country. They could even have a future President as a son, and that they met in Hawaii makes the coincidence even scarier.A visionary moment? Yes, in the sense that it knew the right direction History would take, foreseeing the fact that in 1967, a breakthrough year for USA, and then for movies, American society was needing changes, if not in actions at least in perceptions. The idea of a Black President was mentioned, as a silly possibility because it's too optimistic but that was toward this 'silliness' that society had to tend to. 40 years later, America did it, but the pleasant irony is that Sidney Poitier makes it obvious and natural even in the film's context: he's so close to perfect that it goes without saying that this man could be a President regardless of any racial consideration. After \"To Sir, With Love\" and \"In the Heat of the Night\", Sidney Poitier embodies the fight for human tolerance by playing a man who was beyond all the archetypes related to his ethnic background, who carried his heritage with pride but also struggled to show that there's more than a pigmentation to define him.All came in three with Stanley Kramer's directed \"Guess Who's Coming to the Dinner\", probably the movie where Poitier delivered his message in the most explicit way, notably in the climactic moment when he confronted his father, with eyes burning with rage. Roger Ebert wondered why Poitier adopted this attitude toward his father, almost accusing him of carrying the weight of the past, while he was ready to accept the refusal of his to-be father-in-law. The question puzzled me but then I compared the three roles that Poitier played in 1967. Whether it's in \"To Sir, With Love\" or \"In the Heat of the Night\", he never had to confront one of his 'own', he was the Black man struggling with the Whites, he was like carrying his community's flag and forced despite himself to justify his actions, because he knew that no matter what he believed, people would see the colored man before the man. Yet when it comes to his father, he can't stand it and needs to express the anger he repressed for years.Yet no matter how inspirational is the message, the film is imperfect in the 'deliverance' process. First, there's so much to be against in this marriage beyond the racial issue: Joey and John knew each other for 10 days, they almost give an ultimatum to their parents who must give their blessings, Joey's character was too blinded by her love to John that she couldn't figure one second what her parents went through. Matt Drayton didn't dislike John but hated the way they were forcing him to make a decision before he could even put their relationship into perspective and realize that it's definitely a problem of skin. Indeed, it's not a class issue since John is a well-educated man with a bourgeois lifestyle, so the problem is between Matt and himself, the film reaches a very intelligent point, the idea of being unconsciously racist, which compensate others moments where the film dangerously drifts to mindless comedy (I could have done without the camion driver and the foxy chick, unless it was supposed to say something) but overall, the film redeems itself through some powerful moment.The chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy, who loved each other in real-life, is the soul of the film, here are two parents put in a tricky situation, confronted to their principles with the very idealism they inculcated to their daughter is thrown at their faces. Yes, they taught her to respect minorities, not to consider Whites superior, but they simply forgot to mention that she shouldn't marry a Black man. It's an intelligent move because sometimes people realize that they're more conservative than they think, that's 'unconscious' racism. The film also reaches the right emotional moment when John's parents come to dinner to express their disapproval, not one-sided as we'd expect. But the voices they expresses diverge too, the father is upset while the mother, Beah Richard, can see in John and Joey, something simple called passion. The film does give the fathers the bad roles, as if it's the very rationality of men that prevents them from acknowledging the supremacy of love beyond any consideration.Although the transition can seem a bit abrupt, it's when confronted to this thought, while John expresses his rejection of the old Black vs. Whites dichotomy, that Tracy sees the light and invites everyone for a poignant speech, the last cinematic moment of an actor, who died 17 days after the filming. The film makes very powerful statements, with the most emblematic addressed to John's father: \"You see yourself as a colored man. I see myself as a man\", it does feel staged but when it's done by such great actors, the flaws are superfluous, and the film turns into an insightful and profoundly human experience that can be seen and seen again, without losing its relevance. By the way, an IMDb user suggested that now that interracial marriage is not a taboo anymore, the film should be remade with a gay couple. I believe a remake with a Muslim person would be more appropriate regarding the current political context.",

            "content": "On the surface, one would expect this movie to be hopelessly dated. It deals after all with an issue - inter-racial marriage - that's pretty commonplace today, and that few people would bat an eyelid over. One has to acknowledge, of course, that in the context of the era in which the movie was made - the mid-60's, when racial tensions in the United States were very high - this was a courageous movie. Strangely, considering how much the world has changed since 1967, the movie still packs a punch. Inter-racial marriage may not be a big deal anymore, but society still does - and probably always will - deal with the problem of acceptance of those who are different in whatever way, and of how easy it is to be accepting when one is only dealing with the problems of trying to get others to be accepting.That's the real tension of the movie. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Heburn play the Draytons, parents of Joey (Katharine Houghton). The three are a well to do, white liberal family. Mr. Drayton is a newspaper publisher whose paper has crusaded for liberal causes forever. Suddenly, their zone of liberal comfort is put to the test when Joey returns home from a Hawaii vacation with John (Sidney Poitier) - a successful black doctor - and announces to her parents that they're going to be married. Suddenly, being liberal isn't a matter of ideology anymore - now it's personal. Added to the mix are a black housekeeper who doesn't like what she perceives to be John marrying above himself, a Catholic monsignor who's totally understanding, and John's parents, whose reactions for the most part mirror those of the Draytons. The performances in this movie are absolutely first rate. No one could be criticized, and there are a number of powerful moments as the various characters interact with each other. The most powerful line of the movie - to me, at least, as it demonstrated the dream of society transforming - was John saying to his father \"you think of yourself as a coloured man. I think of myself as a man.\" Throughout the movie there are several of those thought-provoking moments. Interestingly, while dealing with a tough and delicate subject, the movie also managed to be quite light- hearted at times, especially the scenes in which John tries to \"break the news\" to his parents but can't muster the courage to do it.Spencer Tracy's closing monologue, as Drayton announces his acceptance of the marriage, is perhaps a bit too preachy (although well-stated) and, frankly, I could have done without the \"dancing delivery boy!\" However, this is truly a fine movie. 9/10",

It has a certain elegance to it, and three towering performances by Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier.It's easy to denigrate the movie for not being bold enough in its dealing with the deeply ingrained racial discrimination in American society, but in 1967 it certainly packed a powerful punch. Its plea for racial equality is still potent.Watching \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" some 40 years after it's making one seems to be more effected by the final Tracy/Hepburn coupling than by the film's main storyline. Tracy died shortly after which makes his appearance all the more poignant.

The premise is simple: an affluent middle-aged white couple is rather shocked when their 23-year-old returns from Hawaii saying she plans to marry the 37-year-old doctor she met out there, after knowing him for only ten days. What really challenges them, of course, is that he's black, even though they've professed racially progressive views their whole life. When the doctor's parents show up, they are similarly taken aback.Both fathers point out the trouble most of their fellow Americans will have with this marriage, how in 17 states the marriage would be illegal (this was right as Loving v. Virginia was being ruled on), and how the couple and their children may struggle - and yet it still feels like it's being a little too soft on the topic, maybe because no one in the inner circle of the film is actually racist - they're all incredibly tolerant, the elderly Catholic Priest especially (what a wonderful character he was). On the other hand, in making the young woman's parents liberals, and in scenes where Tracy thinks out on the patio, tormented, we see a real challenge to those who might think color bias exists only in redneck America, as well as one to practice what one preaches, something that may have required a little soul searching.The film is not without its flaws, and one of the early things which annoyed me was the black maid's vitriol, which was hard to believe. It was also hard to believe the doctor, after a very nice little speech to his father, when he tells him \"Let me tell you something. I owe you nothing! If you carried that bag a million miles, you did what you're supposed to do!\" (which was brilliant btw), ends by saying that \"you think of yourself as a colored man, and I think of myself as a man.\" That's hard to fathom coming from a black man in America especially in 1967, and feels like the white screenwriter signaling an overly-optimistic view where color really doesn't matter. Overall the film feels very much like what it was, a liberal white person's attempt to grapple with societal wrongs - racism and the taboo/illegality of interracial marriage - all with the best of intentions, but still betraying his whiteness in the script.Would I have loved it more had it had a more authentic African-American viewpoint, one where the black parents aren't sitting mutely at the end while Tracy opines? Yes, I would have. But bless Stanley Kramer, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy for making this film, for what it meant to have suave Sidney Poitier playing a character confronting these issues, and for how incredibly progressive it was in its day.The film was heading for an even higher rating from me, but loses some of its momentum in the talky deliberations leading up to dinner, culminating in Tracy's overlong final speech. Then again, there is real emotional power when he says \"Old, yes, burned out, certainly, but I can tell you the memories are still there - clear, intact, indestructible, and they'll be there if I live to be 110,\" with Hepburn looking at him with tears in her eyes knowing it was his last film, and that he died just a couple of weeks after filming completed. The two of them are brilliant here, as is Poitier, and Hepburn's real-life niece, Katharine Houghton is somehow charming even when she mouths lines like \"It never occurred to me that I would fall in love with a Negro, but I have, and nothing's going to change that\" with a wide-eyed expression (at which point I believe I actually chuckled). Anyway, calibrate yourself to being a liberal in 1967, and I hope you'll appreciate this film for what it was trying to accomplish.",

            "content": "GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is one of those movies considered controversial at the time of its release but is today quite tame. But that has minimal impact on its entertainment value as an impeccable cast brings to life a tale whose central message is timeless.Katharine Houghton is a pretty young blonde who has just brought home the man of her dreams -- widower doctor Sidney Poitier. The fact that the good doctor is an African American is of no consequence to Houghton, nor should it be to her progressive parents, portrayed memorably by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. But when confronted by the unexpected situation, the parents find their open-mindedness put to the test.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is based on a stage play, and the film certainly has the feel of live theater, right down to the top-notch dialog. Though as lighthearted as the subject matter will allow, the movie is surprisingly emotional on a visceral level. The viewers are constantly asked what they would do and how they would react. One's heart goes out to Poitier, who is once again masterful as a dignified black man in a largely intolerant society.As mentioned, this Stanley Kramer drama is tame... maybe a little too tame. The film doesn't shy away from the racial tensions of the time or the immense bigotry the happy couple will surely face. But nor does it face those issues as directly or forcefully as it should have. We never see the naive Houghton have to stand by her man outside of the safe four walls of home. Exploring this angle would have been a meaningful addition.Nevertheless, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER remains a stimulating mid-tier classic. It's an honest, well-made film mature that filmgoers should enjoy.",

The daughter of a wealthy white family bringing home her African-American fianc\u00e9e is certainly more widely accepted today than it was in the 60s, but the cultural opinions on the subject aren't vastly different between 1967 San Francisco and the some parts of the South today. The reactions of her family are very telling, they are shocked, but the only person truly offended is Tillie, their African-American maid. Her prejudices are more intense towards her own race, then the views of any of the white characters. Everyone's real desire is to maintain the status quo, and it takes a lot to get them to move past that and embrace a relationship that upends that.The entire cast excels, particularly Spencer Tracy as the father trying to do what's best for his daughter and Katharine Hepburn as the supportive mother. Beah Richards also is very strong as Mrs. Prentice, another mother seeing the love between them are realizing it is stronger than any of the difficulties they will assuredly face.",

            "content": "The 60s were a time when racial tension was highly prominent in the States as the likes of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and many others fought for equality among humans. Then comes Stanley Kramer's splendid film about forbidden love. The subject itself may feel dated today but it's always interesting to go back in time and understand how things were different then and how they have changed since. That said, the reasons for watching 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' are plentiful. Not only does it show how the idea of a black man marrying a white woman created tension within the family but it demonstrates how easy it is for Joanna to have fallen in love with John. Joey's parents do not oppose the relationship because John is black but, like any good parents, they were concerned about the safety of their child due to the high racial hatred. These were the times when interracial relationships were banned in a majority of the states.This is also actor Spencer Tracy's swansong. He was dying when he shot for this film and this is the last film where we witness him on screen with his love, Katherine Hepburn. I wonder how much of it was acting for these two greats because it really looked like the strong love that they had for each other was merely reflected on screen rather than being acted out especially in the priceless final sequence where Matt tells of his love for Christina. Katherine Hepburn's reaction appears very natural and spontaneous. Needless to say both actors were spellbinding. Sidney Poitier has a strong presence. He is superb as the charming, sophisticated, caring and independent Dr. John Wade Prentice. The scene where John tells his father that he identifies himself as a man while his father sees himself as a black man is another memorable moment. Cecil Kellaway and Beah Richards are simply wonderful. There is a beautiful scene between Richards and Tracy where Matt realizes that love is worth risking it all. Isabel Sandford is adequate and Katherine Houghton is competent.There are a few minor quibbles like the suggested romance between Tillie's daughter and the delivery boy. The ice cream sequence also felt a little out of place. However any sequence between Spencer and Katherine is worth the watch.Even though it has an underlying serious theme 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' is a delight to watch. With solid direction and a dream cast of actors who deliver nothing short of excellent performances what's not to enjoy?",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming Home to Dinner is an old-fashioned, but heartfelt and endearing drama with a weighty topic (for the 1960's and even in some regard today). That topic is the theme of interracial marriage. The 1960's was when the African-Americans were fighting for their civil rights and eventually succeeded in getting them. But the white population were wary of them, even the liberals who supported their cause. This movie has such a strong premise, so strong that it has been known the principal actors signed on to the film without reading the screenplay. This was far from low-key because these actors happened to be major names like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, two of Hollywood's greatest stars ever to be seen on the big screen. This controversial premise, interracial marriage, was seen as a positive factor in the film and that was a rarity for Hollywood productions back in the day.Despite the use of the big theme, there is nothing new about the film hence me describing the film as old-fashioned in my opening sentence. William Rose's screenplay is rather predictable and the characters, especially the minor ones were given the usual Hollywood stereotypes. We have the black maid who is seen as a mother figure and knows how to whip up a fine meal. There is the Irish monsignor who acts very Irish with those twinkly eyes and hearty laughs. Because the central premise is a black man marrying a white woman, of course each one's family will vehemently oppose the marriage due to being different colors. But despite these predictable tropes and stereotypes\u0085..the film won me over in a big way. The story is very charming and the performances are wonderful and they have even have a sense of poignancy thanks to the rapidly failing health of Spencer Tracy during production. Even the cheesy moments were charming, such as the opening song performed by Frank DeVol and the dance sequence by the milk delivery boy that was utterly pointless, but somehow brought a smile to my face.Now the plot revolves around interracial marriage, as mentioned previously. Joanna Drayton (Katherine Houghton), a white 23-year old daughter of a liberal newspaper editor, Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) gets engaged during her Hawaiian vacation to a black man named Dr. John Prentice (Sidney Poitier). Everything is perfect about Prentice\u0085..except his skin color. Joanna or as her friends and family call her Joey, decides to introduce her fianc\u00e9 to her family. The problem is, they want her parent's blessing in one night because he has to fly to Geneva for a WHO conference. Joey's mother, Christina (Katherine Hepburn) immediately agrees and takes the situation rather well. On the other hand, Matt doesn't take too kindly to be given a single night to come up with a decision. Christina decides its a good idea to invite John's parents (Beau Richards and Roy Glenn), who were flying a short distance from L.A to San Francisco, to dinner. At the dinner table, along with Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway), Joey and John try to convince everyone why they should get married.I loved all the performances in the film, which shouldn't be too surprising because of the talent of the actors. But in a way, these performances come across as emotional not only because of the timely themes, but this would be the last role Spencer Tracy would ever do. He died only two weeks after production ended, and you can tell he was hurting during the film. But he delivered a powerhouse performance and an incredible speech at the end. He was the first actor ever to receive a posthumous nomination at the Academy Awards, but he did not win. Nonetheless, he delivered a very strong performance. He shared the screen in this movie with his long-time lover and co-star Katherine Hepburn, who assisted Spencer with this movie because of his ailing health. Hepburn delivers a mighty fine performance which was awarded with a Best Actress win. She was past her prime looks-wise, but her talent never left. One of the emotional scenes of the movie is the glistening tears she produced when Spencer gave his heartfelt speech. You could tell this would be the final hurrah for Spencer, and Katherine knew that. Miss Hepburn also got her niece, Katherine Houghton to play Joey. She did an okay job, although you could tell she hasn't been around acting for that long. The final powerhouse performance was from Sidney Poitier, as the perfect John Prentice. His character was handsome, intelligent, has a good career, and graduated from a top school, but his skin color raised questions. Poitier, coming off massive box office successes, does incredible work here. It felt like his performance were overshadowed by Spencer and Katherine's performance, but don't overlook his performance. Finally, I also liked Cecil Kellaway's supporting turn as Monsignor Ryan. The old man was funny and I loved his rogue Irish personality.Despite all the flaws, I very much liked Guess Who's Coming Home to Dinner. I guess timely themes and the combined star power of Tracy and Hepburn are enough to turn mediocre movies into great movies. Despite some serious undertones, the film has a light atmosphere thanks to the fluid direction of Stanley Kramer. Kramer had an idea what to do with this movie from day one and he succeeded in making that movie. The film has accomplished its purpose in taking a stance with interracial marriage. Not only that, but it is very entertaining. It is one of those films that will make you laugh and will make you cry. In that regards, that is where you can find the term \"old-fashioned.\" Some scenes are cheesy (dancing milk man, anyone?), and some are mighty powerful (Spencer's speech). The film proves love has no bounds and you can marry whomever you want, no matter the skin color.My Grade: A",

            "content": "This landmark classic of the 1960's Civil Rights era brought to light the controversial issue of interracial marriage. Its ongoing relevance lies in viewers examining their own hidden prejudices and considering their personal response to an offspring bringing home a fianc\u00e9 of a different race. While I applaud the theme, it's not at all effectively presented in this absurd situation.The story revolves around a liberal, upper middle class white couple, Matt Drayton (a newspaper publisher) and Christina Drayton (who owns an art gallery). Their assumed anti racist attitudes are put to the test when their daughter, Joanna, brings home a widowed black doctor, John Prentice, and introduces him as her fianc\u00e9. She has met him during a 10 day trip to Hawaii, and they must jet off that very night to Geneva, as he has a post with the World Health Organization in Switzerland. Joanna seeks the blessing of both sets of parents, so John's working class parents from Los Angeles are also invited to dinner. They are no more pleased than the Draytons that their son has chosen a white fianc\u00e9e, the prejudices operating both ways here. Thus, the memorable dinner party is set up...The Drayton parents are played by those beloved stars, Spencer Tracey and Katharine Hepburn. Personally, I feel the movie is totally over rated due to a sense of nostalgia for this pair. The film addresses the whole issue of hidden prejudices in those who pride themselves as anti racist. The Drayton couple, who have an African-American maid, are nevertheless very open minded for their day. Christina has even fired an employee because of her prejudiced views. Hepburn is cast in her typical independent, feminist, feisty role as the proudly liberal Mrs. Drayton, whom I personally found irritating with her superior airs.Personally, I much preferred the ordinary working class Prentice parents to the affluent, fashionably liberal, and agnostic Draytons. I think 1960's audiences would have related better to a more typical white suburban couple from middle America than to this rather atypical pair. How many mothers of that era operated an avant guard art gallery? It might actually have imparted greater depth to the story if these parents had been trying to reconcile their formerly buried, but now surfacing prejudices with the tenants of their faith. A Catholic priest (family friend) does give his opinions on the nuptials, but he's a goofy rather than wise or inspiring character. By the way, is there some implication here that the agnostics of that era were a more enlightened lot than all the religious, church attending Christians?As for myself, the movie is most notable for the on screen presence of the handsome Sidney Poitier. This is probably his most memorable role as the polite, respectable, well educated fianc\u00e9 doctor, who has risen above his blue collar roots. The annoying daughter, played by Katharine Houghton, doesn't seem to have much of a role. Even though it's all mainly about the parents, her character could surely have had a little more depth. Skin color notwithstanding, I could hardly picture the perky, clueless, dewy eyed Joanna and her serious, intelligent, older (late 30's), and infinitely more mature fianc\u00e9 having much in common, now that they've left their tropical Hawaiian paradise and are back in the real world.My major problem with the film is the hokey, unrealistic drama of it all. The couple must leave for Geneva that very night for their imminent marriage. No time to get accustomed to the fianc\u00e9 or make plans, all very dramatic. But especially, the whirlwind...and I do mean, whirlwind... ten day courtship. These 'intellectual' parents aren't exhibiting much intelligence in their priorities here. I cannot imagine any parents, now or even back then, more upset with the color of the fianc\u00e9's skin (supposing it was purple) than with the fact that their daughter had known him for such an incredibly short period of time...distinguished, Yale educated doctor or not. Balmy tropical nights, swaying palm trees, and tall cool drinks rather than getting acquainted with each other in daily routine life. It's unbelievable, absurd, and outrageous, removing all credibility from the film. This movie proved dull and disappointing, the scenario totally ridiculous. However, its theme is certainly thought provoking, causing a personal examination of conscience in the viewer. Even though interracial marriage is common and quite acceptable in many (not all) circles today, this is a definitive, though woefully flawed, piece of cinema that put the title phrase in everyone's vocabulary.",

            "content": "Spencer Tracy gets to act along with his lover Katharine Hepburn for the last time in his final film, and his performance was not lost on me. As a practicing liberal who finally must test his bleeding heart when confronted with the announcement that his white daughter will be marrying a black man she only met several days ago, Tracy does a fine job in his role and is the best actor in the film; he should have won the Academy Award instead of Kate Hepburn.That's not to say that the other performers aren't good, too; Sidney Poitier is strong as the intended bridegroom, especially in the big scene when he tells his father off when he tries to live his son's life for him. Cecil Kellaway is delightful as usual in the role of the open-minded Catholic monsignor, a friend of the family for years who's invited to supper even though his hosts don't really have any religious beliefs. For those who grew up watching television shows like ALL IN THE FAMILY and THE JEFFERSONS, there is a little touch of that on display here at times, with Isabel Sanford (pre-Mrs. Jefferson) in a supporting part as the family maid with an outspoken attitude worthy of Sherman Hemsley's old Weezy herself. Ms. Hepburn is decent, but she's pretty much just doing the \"mom\" thing.This is a slight film, but nevertheless a good one. I don't tend to think that movies really ever become \"dated,\" because even though some might feel old fashioned by today's standards, they should be viewed within the time and place setting in which they're supposed to take place. This film certainly is very old fashioned and more of a time capsule from the 1960s, but keep in mind that the people, places and story are supposed to be happening in 1967, not the 21st Century. The real issue for me in the film wasn't necessarily that an interracial marriage was on the horizon; it was that any two people of any race should probably take more time to get to really know each other before committing. Certainly more than 10 days, at any rate. *** out of ****",

            "content": "With a cast like this, you expect the movie to be a treat but this movie did strike some deep chords over 45 years ago, as it does today. At one point, Spencer Tracey, as liberal publisher Matt Drayton said, in 50 years this might not even cause a ripple of controversy. Well, in less than 50 years, his character was absolutely correct because the \"problem\" of inter-racial marriage no longer causes much of a stir. In fact, most Americans would be delighted to have a 23-year old daughter marry a 37 year-old black medical doctor with a resum\u00e9 that could knock the socks off a million other marriage prospects. By the same token, few parents of African-American descent would object to the marriage of their son to the well-mannered, intelligent and sensible young woman we see here. The social attitudes have come so far that the old barriers of race, or religion no longer exist. Barriers are more likely to be social rank or education. The movie also uses terms like \"colored\" and \"Negro\" that have long since slipped into obscurity. Nonetheless, the viewer can still appreciate the acting of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as Matt Drayton and his wife Christina. Sidney Pottier is also outstanding as Dr. Prentice, the love of their daughter Joey, played by Hepburn's niece Katharine Houghton. She is young, and blissfully in love.\u00a0Joey seems like the perfect daughter, all too ready to embrace this marriage. This is how Matt and Christina raised her. Still, she was spunky enough to call for a quick decision, which meant her parents had to support her or reject the love of her life just because he is black. Her major ally was a family friend Msgr. Ryan, performed by Cecil Kellaway.\u00a0A stereotype of the Irish Catholic priest, he was Matt's golf buddy and liberal alter ego...and the perfect one to point out Matt's flaws. Kellaway is a competent actor no doubt but someone less jocular such as Pat O'Brien, would have been more credible. Also, the actors in the roles of Mr. and Mrs. Prentice seemed lightweight for such a formidable son. I think actors such as Morgan Freeman in the role of the father and Diahan Carroll as the mother would be a better choice. But these choices would have been impossible, given their ages at the time. No matter, Tracy and Hepburn shine as the parents torn between liberal ideals and parental realism. Despite the changing times, the viewer can appreciate how these parents struggle with their sense of responsibility and their own liberal convictions. Following some discussions, Tracy's final summation makes all the right points and allows life to resume, albeit with some adjustment.\u00a0\u00a0We have come a long way since 1967 and despite its flaws, this movie is great entertainment, particularly with the two major stars.",

Whenever any filmmaker accomplishes the undoubtedly tremendously difficult task of actually getting a film made which has something to say about a hot topic, like racism, and that film manages to actually produce a profit, Hollywood then falls all over itself patting itself on the back and usually honoring the film in a way all out of proportion to its artistic merits. For example, this movie was nominated for an astounding 10 oscars!  Ten oscar nominations for a movie with all the style and artistry of a tv sitcom!\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is an impossibly sugar-coated pitch for racial tolerance and inter-racial relationships.  Nothing wrong with its intentions, but the script is so terribly self-congratulatory in its liberal piousness, and everything just gets tied up in such a nice, neat, totally unreal way.  The film's characters all seem to live in a self-contained and sheltered environment that the real world comes nowhere near.  Then, to advance their cause, the filmmakers all but put Sidney Poitier in a red cape with a big \"S\" on his chest!  He is so incredibly handsome and noble and pure that Strom Thurmond wouldn't object to him as a son-in-law, let alone those bastions of liberality Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn!  Pure malarkey...I also have to say that Katharine Hepburn's oscar has to be one of the least deserved in the Academy's history.  She is her usual self here, but its such a nothing role!  All of the other actresses nominated in 1967 - Audrey Hepburn, Dame Edith Evans, Faye Dunaway in \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and Anne Bancroft in \"The Graduate\" - were each far more deserving of the honor. (Don't get me wrong, I like Kate - but she was much more deserving of the honor in 1962's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" and 1968's \"The Lion in Winter\".)",

            "content": "It's so easy to criticize this film. The soundtrack from DeVol is *awful*. The film is incredibly dated and there are some scenes, (the scene with the delivery boy and the ice cream shop), that are unbearable, like something out of a Gidget film.Of course the other problem with this film, 33 years after its  production, is who in the year 2000, would be upset about their daughter marrying a Yale educated Doctor?However, despite all this, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a great film. The film is wonderful because it was the last film made by one of Hollywood's greatest duos, Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.This film was made while Spencer Tracy was dying.  Spencer had to put his entire salary in escrow in order for the film company to allow him to do the film.So why did Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy agree to do this film, without immediate payment? Because it's a film about forbidden love, it's a film about loving someone no matter what society thinks, or what the rules are. This is something Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn knew a great deal about.What makes this film outstanding is, by the end of the film you realize, Kate and Spencer are not even acting they are relaying their feelings about each other, through the film. Once you catch that, the drama of the final few scenes is just unparalleled and Spencer's final speech, about his love for Kate (Christina), can drive even the most twisted soul to tears.A few things to catch in this film, watch Kate's face when Spencer recites the line, 'screw what the rest of the world thinks about your love'...those are real tears. Watch Spencer Tracey as he paces back and forth on the terrace near the end of the film. He realizes he is about to begin one of the last scenes he will ever film. He's line 'well I'll be a son of a bitch'...is more a realization he's about to make his last grandstand on the big screen, in his entire career.Spencer Tracy is one of America's greatest actors. This is his last triumph. For that reason alone, it's a true cinematic treasure.",

            "content": "When Katharine Houghton returns home to San Francisco from a ten-day Hawaiian cruise, she's deliriously happy. She's fallen in love, wants to get married, and has brought her intended home to meet her parents, Katharine Hepburn\u2014her aunt in real life\u2014and Spencer Tracy. On paper, everything's perfect. He's a doctor, a humanitarian, morally respectful, and in love with their daughter. When they meet him, though, Kate and Spence are a little surprised. Their daughter wants to marry Sidney Poitier, and while they raised her to be as color-blind as possible, they're not particularly thrilled that she's chosen to marry a black man in the 1960s.If you haven't seen Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, you're missing out on an iconic piece of American cinema. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, taking home the gold for Best Actress and Best Screenplay, and it's one of the most defining films of the decade. While Sidney Poitier was universally ignored for this film during the awards season, and for the other famous film he made that year, In the Heat of the Night, his role and performance were etched in film history. There's a line Sidney says after Spencer voices his concerns about the difficulties of raising bi-racial children, and at the time it was merely considered cute and full of wishful thinking: \"Johanna feels that all of our children will be President of the United States. . . I'd settle for Secretary of State.\" Watching the film now gives that line an entirely different meaning.While all the performances in the film are wonderful, watching Katharine Hepburn and her longtime love Spencer Tracy is bittersweet. In their ninth film together, Spence's health was failing drastically. He died seventeen days after filming completed, and Kate never saw the finished product because it would have been too painful. He gives a very famous speech about true love that brings tears to the audience's eyes, not only because it's a well-written speech, but because it's clear he's speaking about his on screen and offscreen partner.Each character has his or her own fondly remembered lines and speeches in the film: Kate's unforgettable recitation of the title; Spence's Oregon boosenberry ice cream scene and \"that's everything\" monologue; Sidney's \"get off my back\" speech; Katharine's \"Isn't it just!\" exclamation; and Isabel Sanford's line that proves she's clinically blind, saying Sidney Poitier isn't good-looking. I remember watching this movie as a kid, not understanding why anyone would have a problem welcoming Sidney Poitier into the family, and of course being terribly jealous of Katharine Houghton. I've had a crush on him ever since, but whatever reason you watch the film, for the Americana, acting, writing, or eye candy, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer will probably never be recognized as one of the best American directors of all times - or even of the 60's. But watching films like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Inherit the Wind and The Definat Ones it's clear that, although Kramer's directorial work was very safe and by-the-book, few directors had his chemistry with actors. And while having wonderful actors like Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier on board certainly doesn't harm, Stanley Kramer drew incredible amounts of passion and feeling out of them, and helped them create complex and realistic characters in a film that could have easily been a dull tirade against racism.The great thing about this film is that it isn't really about racism. Unlike more modern films like Jungle Fever and Far From Heaven that tried to make a global point about racism and race relations, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner - which, amazingly, was released much earlier than those films, when interracial marriage was still very much a taboo - tackles the subject on a much more subtle and more human level, and it's not about the struggling interracial couple, but about their parents - not parents who are Archie Bunker-like close-minded bigots, but modern liberals whose liberalism is put to the test when the issues they've been fighting for are brought to their own front door. Tracy and Hepburn (and also Roy Glenn and Beah Richards in a much smaller but remarkable performance) play the parents as intelligent, liberal, fallible human beings with a lot of complexity that give you a feeling that there's a lot going on beneath the surface. Tracy, in the last performance of his lifetime, delivers some of the finest acting in his distinguished career.And though a lot had been said about the allegedly poor acting of Katharine Houghton as the young bride to be, and the flatness of the characters played by her and Poitier, they fit right in - had Houghton been replaced with a stronger, more grounded woman, she might have been the focus of the film instead of her parents; but her sunny and naive optimism is a wonderful statement about the ridiculousness of the racial barrier; while it's clear to us as viewers that her outlook is far too simplistic and that she's blissfully ignorant of reality, we can't help but admire - even envy her for not even seeing that the barrier is there. She's as close to a child as we have in this film.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a gorgeous film about society's growth, about dealing with change and facing up to our own fears and prejudices. It's also a dialog driven character piece, a lovely reminder of the days when a mainstream hit could have consistent of almost nothing but smart dialog and spectacular acting. A classic well deserving of a spot on any film-lover's shelf.",

Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy play affluent liberals whose social beliefs are tested when their only daughter brings home a man she met two weeks ago that she plans to marry.  Of course the clincher is, he's Sidney Poitier \u0096 I mean, and he's black.  As an extremely socially liberal-minded person myself, I always revere this movie because the personal journey that Hepburn and Tracy take in the course of mere hours is remarkable to witness.  I have heard many people say that this film is dated, so in watching this film again I kept that criticism in mind.  Ultimately, however I think that the underlying message is just as valid now as it was almost forty years ago.  Of course, it was more controversial in 1967 than it would be in 2003 but it is no less important. \nBeing Spencer Tracy's last film, it is of course sad to witness his final performance, but his final speech is so incredibly heartfelt (and obviously pertinent to Tracy and Hepburn's relationship as well as the film's theme) that it is still unbelievably emotionally effective.  Along with To Kill a Mockingbird and Gentleman's Agreement, I think this film should be added to the list of required viewing for anyone.

Thus at one fell swoop Rose eliminates 90% of the possible objections that would obtain had the girl fallen for a working stiff who happened to be black, making it that much harder for parents who are already noted for their liberal creed, to object. That being said the film is well written and superbly acted right across the board. Serious film buffs found a lump in the throat at Spencer Tracy's final great speech in which he speaks of his love for screen wife (and long-term off-screen lover) Katherine Hepburn, who sheds real tears in the same scene. In fact Tracy died a scant seventeen days after the shooting. Inter-racial marriage is totally accepted today in most cultures but this is a classy way to remind us that this wasn't always so.",

            "content": "Certainly it has some dated and some heavy-handed elements, but it's a much better film than many suggest. It rests on its many fine performances. Hepburn and Tracy in their final film together (Tracy, of course, died shortly after the film was completed) are wonderful as the liberal parents whose beliefs and prejudices are challenged when their daughter comes home with Sidney Poitier, also giving a wonderful performance. The daughter is played by Katharine Houghton, a newcomer who often takes the brunt of criticism of the principal actors, but I thought she did well playing the very optimistic girl. She's not stupid or na\u00efve, as some have suggested. I think she's just an idealist; she knows what she and her black husband will go through, but, as it seems to me, in her mind, they can defeat it together. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is one of those math problem social issues films, where there is a contrived problem of social import set up that has to be solved in a limited amount of time. It reminds me a lot of Gentleman's Agreement and 12 Angry Men in that way. I think the issue is very important, of course, and, though some elements of the film are dated, this issue has hardly gone away. I don't think the problem is solved in the film, but one value it does have is to challenge the prejudices of each viewer. Spencer Tracy's big third-act speech won't solve the deep-rooted racial issues the United States has, but I think the film probably did open a lot of eyes in 1967, and it still has the power to do so today.\nThat was a perfect way to end my review, but I must say that I found some of the depictions of the emerging youth culture in the film to be very interesting (it takes place in San Francisco, after all). My favorite scene in the film really seems to be little more than a throwaway, when Spencer Tracy goes to the drive-in restaurant and orders a sherbert. The actor was very old at the time, and director Kramer juxtaposes him with a vaguely disrespectful teenage waitress. The parking lot of the restaurant is filled with young hipsters. This scene represents a final goodbye to the previous generation, and with it Hollywood's golden age and, very unfortunately, Mr. Tracy. Goodbye, Spencer! 9/10.",

But in lieu of the plot, John (Poitier) and his white-skin trophy wife-to-be Joey (Houghton) have to recede to a morally-low position, William Rose's script has proffered all the possible (and impossible) approaches to dramatise the situation (a 15 years age difference) and pressure the judgment call should be resolved within the meagre time span (half day at most). Thus, the entire climax is the father of the bride Matt's (Spencer Tracy) decision (it seems a bit racist their black counterpart has little saying in this condition), the professed liberal white man's crucial decision is the game changer seeing that his wife Christina (Hepburn) has capitulated long ago and \"completely sympathetic\", has firmly chosen her side of her mollycoddled daughter. So Matt's ultimate 8-minutes soliloquy (prefaced by a self- affirmation \"I will be a son of b****\") not only has its power of wisdom and appeal to be an excellent showpiece of ethical preaching, a cordial and visceral performance merits standing ovation, but also in the nonfictional life, Tracy's ailing health and his fervid love for Hepburn (out of marriage) are tangible and heart-wrenching, in the coda of his swan song, it reaches a pinnacle by his declaration of love and it is an impeccable curtain call both on and off screen (Tracy died weeks after the filming). However, it is Hepburn, won her third Oscar together with Rose's Best Adapted Screenplay win (out of its overall 10 nominations) while Tracy's posthumous recognition come unstuck. With a borderline leading role among a peerless cast, Hepburn's win might be an overrated adulation, nonetheless it is no slander could smear the performance itself, it is her competency is shortchanged. Houghton, the real niece of Hepburn and a d\u00e9butante in the film business, tackles with an unsympathetic role out of her naivety, she is reckless and selfish enough to put her parents into such a difficult situation, but it is what the storyline requires, so what left for her to subjectively interpret is very limited. Supporting players are also commendable, Kellaway and Richards are nominated as well (the stereotyped good persons with high moral conscience, admirable and amiable), but Sanford's biased black maid's opinion behooves much more introspection towards the innate frailty of human race, love guides us and love blinds us too.This almost one-apartment cramped family drama even now has its pertinent social reference, which is a sad truth to accept, just wish Tracy and Hepburn will not be disappointed up there in Elysium.",

It is a perspective from an America, deeply involved in fixing these silly human differences and that the fight still goes on to make things even better.Being a film that is over 50 years old and given the fact that even today we still face these daunting issues, it is very refreshing to see how hard America fought, early on, in the fight for more equality and acceptance. It reminds us that, we should keep fighting, until the words racism and discrimination are gone from the discussion. That skin color isn't even part of the dialogue anymore. It is the message in this film, that really tells us how silly we are about something that shouldn't even be an issue, especially when love is involved. The film tackles the subject of inter-racial marriage. It came out in theaters, the same year that laws prohibiting inter-racial marriage were struck down by the Supreme Court, just six months before the release of this film.This is a simple, humorous drama and is basically a film about two families coming together for dinner to celebrate the proposed marriage of their respective children and it all culminates into a dinner hosted by the daughter's parents. What no one knows, other than the husband and wife to be, is that the bride is a 24 year old white woman (Houghton), named Joanna and the husband is a 37 year old black man (Poitier), named John.What I was really surprised to see is they were so preoccupied by skin color, that no one even cared that there was a 13 year age gap in there too, something that also seems like an issue for some people, even for today. In fact, they gloss over it like it meant nothing. I was surprised by that, but it also showed a certain maturity by the characters, when it comes to age. We are than reminded, that this film has a much bigger issue to tackle, than worrying about age difference.This is a great film. It is another classic from Stanley Kramer. It also features the amazing acting of legends, such as, Spencer Tracy as Joanna's father, Katharine Hepburn as Joanna's mother, Isabel Sanford, Cecil Kellaway and of course, Sidney Poitier. There is a sad note here though. Unfortunately the legend himself, Spencer Tracy, would never see this film released, because he passed away at the age of 67, just a few months before the release of this film.It is refreshing just watching these performers act out a scene. That part of the film is incredible enough, but when you hear the message and remember the silly reasons why this film even had to be made, it is definitely a must see film. We should always pay attention to those who are in love. The film also reminds us, that we should all be treated as equal.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Yet it excels with the performances. Hepburn gives an empathic performance, while Poitier (even if it is obvious his big speech to Hepburn and Tracy was delivered without them present, due to the actor's nerves in their presence) is charming as always.It's overwritten in places, almost naively so, and the final speech from Tracy is so saccharine-coated it's an incredibly difficult pill to swallow.

It stars one of Hollywood's most famous couples in Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy as the white disapproving parents of the girl. It was Tracy's last performance before passing on. It's hard to believe but while it was being filmed, it had still been illegal in 17 states for people of different race to be married.From the moment Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton come home to break the news to the parents you can see the toll it takes on them. Hepburn's immediate reaction defined the entire generation's thinking. Tracy took a different approach. He went through his ups and downs of disbelief to understanding to complete disapproval to finally his closing speech. I think out of everyone, it was Tracy who had the best performance. Adding to the fact that this was his final film, his ending speech was just pure cinema. It was such a fitting way to end his film career and I couldn't have thought up a better way to go out.As for the couple itself, I thought the acting was fine but I didn't think the chemistry was there. Poitier also had a memorable speech but I didn't feel that he clicked with Houghton for whatever reason. The scenes I enjoyed most were the constant transitions to a new dynamic among the household. Once Poitier's parents get there, almost every scene involved a different interaction than we had before. Everyone got their time to shine which is why I felt the screenplay was just brilliant. I thought it was interesting that these were parents who supported the rights of other races but when it came time that their daughter had affection for one of them, they were very hesitant. It's one thing to say you support them, it's another thing to do it. This film is incredibly ahead of it's time which is probably one of the reasons it has stood the test of time all these years.

The film features such poignant performances and it holds the mark as the last Spencer Tracy film before he passed away. The screenplay is magnificent and it features some outstanding moments of dialogue. That speech in the end by Tracy shows both what an outstanding actor he was and what a powerful script he was given to work with. Stanley Kramer's film is about a colored man named John and a white girl named Joanna who decide to get married. But they decide to visit Joanna's parents and ask for their permission, challenging the views long held by Christina and Matt Drayton. This is Spencer Tracy's final film and it was one fantastic role for the dying man. His eloquent speech at the end nearly had me in tears. Katherine Hepburn, perhaps the greatest actress of all time, delivers another tearful performance. The chemistry between Tracy and Hepburn was so realistic. I've been told that the emotions displayed near the end were very real, as we see Tracy deliver his big sendoff. Sidney Poitier was marvelous as Dr. John. But I'm not entirely sure I can say the same for Katherine Houghton. Overall, Guess Who Has Been Coming to Dinner is an excellent cinematic experience and a relevant film that took place during an eventful historical time, a time where racism still prevailed. There are some outdated scenes, mainly the scene with the dancing delivery man. The less said about that, the better. But this is one of the few films that gave interracial marriage a positive outlook during the 1960's. This film is just worth it if you want to see the final pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. My Grade: A",

            "content": "I remember seeing GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? when I was a kid and being very impressed by what I was told was a groundbreaking film about race relations. But as the years have passed, the strength of this film is not as solid as I once thought. This movie brings up a lot of interesting questions but instead of thoughtfully exploring these questions, the movie looks for quick fixes and easy answers that you would normally find in 22 minutes of situation comedy. For instance, Matt and Christina Drayton (Tracy and Hepburn)are forced to come to immediate conclusions about their daughter marrying a black man because they are planning to leave the country. I wonder if their feelings would have been the same without the time constraint. I think screenwriter William Rose also made the story easy by making Sidney Poitier's character a wealthy, widowed doctor with a million degrees doing groundbreaking research to help the underprivileged. I wondered what this movie would have been like if Katharine Houghton had brought home a drug dealing pimp instead of an important doctor. But the film is still worth seeing if for no other reason to watch the screen's most divine screen team, in their final film together. Tracy commands the screen whenever he is on it, but Hepburn has her moments too. My favorite Hepburn moment is when her assistant from the gallery, played by Virginia Christine (\"Mrs. Olsen\" from the Folgers commercials)makes veiled racial remarks about John and Joey and Christina calmly and very politely tells her to go back to the gallery, write herself a check for $5000, take everything out of the gallery that would ever remind Christina that she was ever there and to go. It's classic Hepburn and that scene is worth the price of admission alone. GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? is definitely showing its age, but the still stylish and intelligent presence of Tracy and Hepburn still makes it worth watching.",

Her and Spencer Tracy were wonderful on-screen together. I did not care for Joey's character so much. She seemed dim-whitted and slightly annoying. I really loved Matt's character development. The Monsignor was my favorite character, however. I thought that this movie captured a very real problem in that time period and probably helped sway many people's opinions of the issue. The ending speech by Spencer Tracy was beautiful and eloquent. The women persuading their husbands by making them remember how young love felt when they had it between them was touching. Regardless of racial, social, or cultural differences, love is universal and knowing how it feels should be able to change anyone's mind about socially unaccepted love between two people.",

There are plenty of reviews here and elsewhere that laud this film from the roof tops and beyond, I just can't bring myself to praise it so high, it doesn't {to me anyway} stand up well to scrutiny.The screenplay doesn't call for much from all involved, a series of discussions about the pros and cons of love between mixed races drags on for what seems an eternity. Only briefly does the film lift itself out of it's melodramatic overkill, and even then it's purely because Hepburn & Tracy have earned the benefit of our doubt. Hepburn has acted better than this in her sleep, yet the academy bestowed another Oscar on her for it. Spencer Tracy does his best with the material, and gets to close the film with a modicum of respect via the always expected speech. Sidney Poitier, Cecil Kellaway, and Beah Richards are all solid enough, but Katharine Houghton is far to shiny happy to draw the viewer in fully to the mixed race pot boiler she is involved with.It drags on and on to the point I cried out for a titanic twist to surface, and I firmly believe that if it wasn't for the talent on show this film would not be considered a classic of its time, 6/10 for Tracy's efforts and Poitier's charisma.",

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner shows the relationship between different ethnicity's, similar to the movie Do The Right Thing; another great film of the 60's. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner feels a little fake at times, and often like it's filmed on a stage. The mother and father take on typical roles, the father is stubborn and careful with who his daughter marries, but her mother is more able to understand that her daughter is in love. The substance of the film shows that it is okay to be in an interracial couple. This was very controversial at the time, but films with this kind of controversy often become classic films, as this one did, and retain their popularity for decades.",

So why the mediocre rating by this reviewer and many others? I mean we have the great Sidney Poitier, as well as Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. We have the decent director Stanley Kramer (who did On the Beach), we have the great era of the 1960s and we have a controversial theme. Well the key to the mediocrity lies in a very weak script by William Rose that doesn't ring true in many ways.John Prentice (Poitier) wants to marry Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton) and all hell breaks loose between the parents (Tracy, Hepburn, Beah Richards, and Roy Glenn). Problem is the script tries to be politically correct while ignoring any semblance of reality or non-nerdness (to coin a word).For example: a 2-faced employee wishes the couple well with whispering asides to Hepburn (in a WAY over the top cartoonish manner for both the well wishes and the asides). Joey says \"Mom, she was well, RUDE!\" actually she wasn't rude at all, she was 2-faced...big difference lost on the writer. And to get the lady out of their collective hair Hepburn gives her $5000.00. Not much of a punishment for being 2-faced.Then we get this wacky priest who drinks, sings \"We can Work it Out\" in the most pretentiously hip unhip touch of the film, and thinks its funny that Mr. Liberal (Tracy) has such a problem with the marriage. As far as Poitier's speech to his father, \"You think of yourself as a black man, I think of myself as a man\", I have this to say: I'm sure men have thought that, but I doubt they ever said it, i.e. it came out of the writer, not out of reality. And I have no idea why they left that scene in where Tracy rams a black guy's car and the guy yells \"There oughta be a law!\" It didn't make sense, it didn't fit into the film, and I suppose it was just an ill-concieved joke by the writer.And Tracy's speech at the end is supposed to be so touching, and it reduces Hepburn to tears...but really it's big on schmaltz and low on substance. This film is TV movie quality and made it into the AFI Top 100; hey AFI, ever hear of this other Poitier film from 1967...a little film called In the Heat of the Night? Such is my BIG GRIPE. How does this film make it while one of the best films of the decade doesn't? Answer: Politics. This one was about subtle middle class racism, that one was about blatant Southern racism. Well all I can say is see both films and YOU decide.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer did love message pictures. We have seen that before with ON THE BEACH in 1959 and JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG in 1961. Now he takes on interracial romance, in a film with a lighter touch than his previous work but a message that still comes through loud and clear.Spencer Tracy, in his final film, and Katharine Hepburn (who won an Oscar) are Matt and Christina Drayton, an upper-middle-class couple, lifelong \"liberals\" who are about to have their ideals challenged.Enter their twenty-three-year-old daughter Joanna (Joey) Drayton (Katharine Houghton, Hepburn's real-life niece), returning from a vacation in Hawaii with a new suitor in tow; they met, fell almost immediately in love, and are planning to marry as soon as possible. But here's the thing: Joey's fianc\u00e9, a highly respected doctor with the World Health Organization, is an African-American (Sidney Poitier, more handsome and dignified than he has ever been), a fact that, to say the least, leaves the Draytons fumbling for words.I don't need to go into the minutiae of the plot here; suffice it to say that by the end of the film the dinner guests have all finally arrived: Poitier's parents (Roy Glenn and a brilliant, Oscar-nominated Beah Richards), and Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway), a family friend who has finagled an invitation (translation: invited himself).This movie has to be seen and experienced. Remember that this was 1967. Interracial marriage was illegal in many states. In fact, a contemporary reading of this film draws many parallels to today's battle for same-sex marriage.Much criticism has been leveled at the Poitier character for being \"too perfect.\" A brilliant, successful doctor, after all, is a man any girl would consider a good catch. But again, this was 1967, and Stanley Kramer knew how to get his message across.Most of the cast is pitch-perfect, including Isabel Sanford in a hilarious performance as the family maid who deeply disapproves of Poitier and makes sure that the whole household knows it. Houghton, unfortunately, is the film's weak link; she does not have anywhere near the talent of her aunt, but she is young and lovely and very appealing, and the work of the actors around her brings her performance up several notches.Then there are Tracy and Hepburn. Tracy died a mere two weeks after filming wrapped; both he and Hepburn knew this was his last film, and it brings their scenes together a deep poignancy that warms the heart and brings tears to the eyes.Altogether a classy finale for Tracy, and while the film has dated a bit, the message is still valid.",

            "content": "This admittedly is the gold standard of all films dealing with interracial couples. More of a drawing room comedy adapted to film rather than a true cinematic experience, it still has great lines and great performances by legendary actors and actresses; some of whose dialogue I can recite word for word.MY DINNER WITH ANDRE it is not, simply because the subject of interracial marriage is so highly charged we never get to see what's for dinner or even the families having dinner together. People find it tame by today's tastes and roll their eyes that they only get to see Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton kiss in the rear view mirror of a cab driver's automobile. But what I liked most on subsequent viewings was the way the couple worked their respective families around to accede to their wishes; showing that they had made up their minds and were already working as a team.Spencer Tracy, struggling with emphysema, diabetes and a weak heart, still manages to step up to the plate and hit a grand slam out of the park one last time. He would be gone seventeen days later after this film wrapped, and whatever you may think of a devout Catholic having an open marriage that included his life long affair with Katherine Hepburn, his courage and talent in this film are beyond question. It is easy to understand his position as the harried father beset on all sides to exorcise the bigot in him and find liberal understanding in this most unconventional surprise situation.The dialogue is standout here and Poitier has a great face-off as John Prentice with his father, Roy Glenn as Mr. Prentice, that is the heat and passion of this drama in many ways. But Beah Richards is a revelation here as Poitier's mother Mrs. Prentice, and gives a stirring speech to Tracy's Matt Drayton that is the trans formative moment of this little story. It stops Matt Drayton in his tracks as he must deliberate between the passions of the glands and the spirit and comes to find himself secured in his own certainty.I have read that other reviewers related that their favorite scene was when Katherine Hepburn as Christina Drayton summarily fires one of her employees for making pejorative statements concerning the partnership of Poitier and Houghton. It is indeed classic Hepburn, who has played Queens and all manner of feisty, upscale women in the past. That sense of high self mastery is on full display here, and rings true to the Hepburn hallmark. Isabel Sanford also stands out as their maid Tillie and goes JAWS at Poitier for his attempt to hustle his way into a wealthy, upright family of good, white people. So it should come as no surprise when I tell you this is more a character driven drama than it is one involved with the tight pacing of plot.But what a cast of characters! Cecil Kellaway as Monsignor Ryan is a beautiful bit of Irish Catholic whimsy and trades verbal punches with Tracy as a jocular priest in a most memorable fashion. Perhaps the person with the most difficult role is Katherine Houghton playing Joey Drayton. There is little for her to hold onto with her airy performance of a liberal Pollyanna without a prejudiced, racist, bigoted bone in her body and the feeling that she comes to understand that she is the product of a privileged, sheltered upper class existence is not all there albeit hinted at from time to time.Nowadays with interracial relationships somewhat more common, I have read here that people are a little more astounded that this couple would be all gung-ho for getting married after only knowing each other ten days rather with respect to their different colorings. Truth be told, I would have liked to have seen a few scenes of their back story meeting and becoming involved with each other. I also would have not minded seeing them in Africa working together to set up and run clinics for the World Health Organization. As the film started, it seemed like Sidney was giving a fan a date out on the town that she had won in a sweepstakes more than taking her to her parents to ask for her hand in marriage.This theme of forbidden love still has a lot of potential that has not yet been fully explored or exhausted, and I look forward to ever new interpretations of this fascinating and exciting concept. One thing is for sure, though, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER has made its mark and will certainly be a reference point for any further cinematic attempts in the future.Now, what's to eat?",

Three of the lead actors had seven Oscars between them (Hepburn 4, Tracy 2, Portier 1)and Beah Richards who plays Portier's mother was Oscar nominated for this movie.  My guess is that made her only the third or fourth black woman to ever be nominated for an Oscar by that time (Hattie McDaniel and Dorothy Dandridge are the only ones I can think of before Richards).  Katherine Houghton is overwhelmed in this movie as the Drayton's lovestruck daughter but she is pleasing to look at and has an uncanny resemblence to Hepburn which wasn't surprising since she was Hepburn's real-life niece.Great movies are also ones that get memorable performances from even the bit players.  I always have gotten a kick out of the dancing delivery boy who is a riot in his 2 minute scene.  My eye is always caught by the actor who plays Peter, the boyfriend of Joanna Drayton's best friend.  He's in a very short scene when Joanna and John are meeting her friends for a drink before they pick up his parents from the airport.  The two women are jabbering on about the wedding and John is getting more and more uncomfortable. Meanwhile Peter is obviously enjoying John's discomfort and egging the women on.  Peter and John make eye contact a few times and their glances convey a thousand words.  John knows that Peter is enjoying it all but is being so funny about it that John can't be angry with him.  It would be easy to imagine John and Peter becoming good friends down the road and the two characters are able to convey that connection in a very short scene. \nThe rest of the movie is more or less a collection of speeches but still well done.  Tracy's last speech about how he loves his wife is terrific and he and Hepburn aren't acting in that scene, they're conveying how they really feel about each other.  They were lovers for years but Tracy, being Catholic, wouldn't divorce his wife.  They also knew that Tracy's health was shot by then and in fact he died shortly after this movie was completed. \nLastly, this movie completed a tremendous trifecta for Sidney Portier.  The same year this movie came out his movies \"To Sir, With Love\" and \"In the Heat of the Night\" came out.  No actor before or since has nailed as many tremendous performances and movies in a single movie year.",

The only minor concern is that the Draytons are white and Dr Prentice is not \u0085Whilst it might seem a little dated by today's standards this was an extremely important film of its day, and its intimate little family drama still has bite, wit and philosophy. Matt is forced to confront his prejudices, but more importantly to balance his instinctive desire to protect his daughter with his trust in her judgement. The fact that John is in so many ways the perfect husband and a potential son-in-law to be proud of only makes things harder. All the characters and performances are rich, and as the drama cranks up with the arrival of John's parents, Kramer exploits the nervous undercurrents and tensions of the setup perfectly. For such a slight and tender story (it all takes place in one day in mostly one house) it is also richly photographed by Sam Leavitt, who makes all the emotional closeups count and has a fine eye for a scene - the sunset sequence where Hepburn walks across the terrace and looks at the bridge is simply exquisite. Poitier is sensational here, Hepburn is gentle and measured, Houghton (Hepburn's real life niece) is perky, Kellaway and Sanford steal their scenes as a daffy vicar and melodramatic maid respectively, and Glenn and Richards give fine dignified performances as Poitier's parents. The best of all though is Tracey as the calm, thoughtful Matt, somehow finding a balance between cool logic and emotional strength. His final summation at the end will make you laugh and cry and sadly it was his final film - he died only a few weeks later. Nicely written by William Rose (The Ladykillers), with a great sensitivity for the subject matter but also a fine balance of comedy and pathos - both he and Hepburn won Oscars. Stanley Kramer is perhaps a little underrated as a director in historical terms, but he really tried to make a difference and raise awareness with his movies (On The Beach, Inherit The Wind, etc), and often succeeded with superb style, as in this timeless drama.",

Also featured was pretty, black, new kid on the block, Sid Poitier.The movie is well directed. All of the technical features mesh well. The star players give excellent, almost flawless turns in their respective roles. They really are a joy to watch and hear.By 1967, race was still a very pertinent issue in society, both black and white. I believe there were still some American states in which such relationships were illegal. They were legal in Britain, but still discountenanced. Despite the excellent star turns, and the commendable script, the movie reflects the rather simplistic take on race that was prevalent on the cusp of flower-power. Society was extremely naive. Given a little understanding, everything would be fine.Both the fathers are presented almost as positive-negative images of each other's intransigence, whilst the mothers can see no further than the affection of their children and ooze matronly understanding, as if racial intolerance was an exclusively male construct. The family-friendly priest is equally fulsome with empathy, both families being Christian. But I wonder if he'd be quite so munificent if the black family were Muslim, and the daughter doomed to change religion.For its time, the movie was apt to the moment. The in-depth cultural complexities of race were largely glossed over, despite the clever script. Things were - and still are - never so straightforward as the idealists would wish. The truth is; today, ethnic groups in the west are far more racially 'aware' than the white tribes. And not just the west; we see the irony of this in Zimbabwe today. It is interesting to remember how much left-wing political brou-ha-ha was aroused by the South African apartheid regime. There was an almost permanent large and vociferous demonstration outside of the Embassy. Cruel Whites making blacks suffer... Where's the equivalent demo against Robert Mugabe...?Worth a watch as a feature of its time and an excellent vehicle for the starring roles, but the arguments it raises now resemble those of a student's union debate.",

At that time there were sixteen states with such laws on the books, so interracial marriage was controversial in 1967, perhaps not unlike the topic of gay marriage in 2006. The story is of Joanna and John (Katharine Houghton and Sidney Poitier) showing up unexpectedly at Joanna's parents' house to announce that they are to get married. Joanna's dad Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) is a wealthy, liberal newspaper man and Christina (Katharine Hepburn) is his intellectual, progressive wife. John's parents enter the picture as well as a priest and the Drayton's black maid. There are concerns all round about this proposed interracial marriage and, in an interesting twist, it's the maid who is initially the most vocal about it. But ultimately it's the fathers who are the final hold-outs. Things may have changed a lot in the last fifty years but I think that, without much modification, the situation in this movie could happen today. In fact I found the most dated thing in this movie to be the score. We get some generic 60s happy-music-for-film and the sappy \"The Glory of Love.\"This movie has the feel of the filming of a stage play with most of the action taking place in the Drayton's house. The characters conveniently move in and out of the action leaving two or three people in a scene at a time for pivotal dialog.I can understand someone's ripping into this, but I stopped tallying the plot holes and being put-off by the stereotypical roles and just sat back and enjoyed it. Poitier is not called on to do much more than be a model citizen, but, as usual, Tracy and Hepburn are delightful together (Tracy was dead by the time this was released).The theme of occasionally having to actually live up to your principles in challenging situations is an interesting one and Mr. Drayton is forced to face that dilemma here, though his anguish is a bit sugar coated. No big surprises with this, but it's entertaining and not without content.",

The matter of race is the thinnest of veneers here, and isn't seriously treated at all, even by 60's standards.No, why this picture fails is because what we have here is a clash of film and theater cultures.A major thread in theater is to moralize, indeed our tradition of English drama began that way, and it is only because of the extraordinary influence of Shakespeare that we have anything else. Many, many dramas moralize, and this has continued in the film world when the movie is merely a filmed play. That's exclusively the case in action films and films for children. Nearly always the bad guys get their due. But many times, the conventions of moral theater are more obvious and that's the case here. The climax is the hackneyed gathering of all the characters into the main room of the home for a speech which contains the moral. All else is contrived to set up that speech.So on the one hand, we have here the culture of moral theater which perpetuates itself with an unkillable memetic tenacity. What's the other culture?Romantic film. This is a child of the romantic pulp novel which invented the common concept of `love.' This kind of love now lives exclusively in film. This kind of love supposes that there are fore-ordained couplings, and that when these two first meet, there is an instant irresistible bond. This is a love everlasting (but it could be forgotten) -- there is no other kind to come. This is an escapist dream world that moviegoers cannot cleanly sort out from the richer real world. It has its own memetic drivers, even stronger than the theatric preaching. Redhaired women are often associated with this world.Some theorists convincingly argue that many of the woes of modern nations stem from what we have piled into this unrealistically romantic film world, once we allowed it is is real, and confabulated it into our own existence: matters of race, `rights,' destiny...In this film, we have the clash of these two cultures which co-exist in film: on the one hand, we have the irresistible tendency to locate a problem, crystallize it, fabricate a rousing speech, and then all sit down together in a Calvinist harmony. On the other hand, we have the even greater tendency to imagine a world of personal love that trumps all matters, ALL matters. Guess which world is coming to dinner?

Sure, this may seem dated today, but do they have any idea how extremely daring this film was for its time? If it seems a bit over the top and unrealistic (the wealthiness of the parents, the perfection of Poitier) it's because it had to be. There was probably no other way to make it happen then. And consider this--making Poitier's character such a paragon strips it down to essentials--the only thing anyone could object to is his race; therefore we get to the nitty-gritty immediately. I actually think Katherine Houghton's performance seems better today than then. With her Blithe unconcern for the matter of marrying a black man and her open-hearted willingness to take on the problems without a second thought, she actually seems to be a prediction of what the world is closer to now. The essence of this film comes from Cecil Calloway--\"They are this country, Matt. They'll change this stinking world.\" Maybe not enough, but there have been changes.

But most Americans -- black and white -- saw interracial romance, let alone marriage, as being something completely off the charts in the mid-'60s (it was still illegal in many places). So doing such \"threatening\" material in such an nonthreatening way was probably why it worked as well as it did or could, given the standards of the time.If they'd done the film in an edgier way, Hollywood wouldn't have green-lighted the project, and the audience who saw it would have either already agreed the film's message or turned even more against it.That said, I kind of like the film. Yes, it's largely B.S. But it's late-'60s media B.S.: nostalgia in the face of cultural upheaval and change. And that's always been kind of nostalgic in itself.

            "content": "**May contain spoilers** \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" is a truly wonderful film about a young woman who comes home early from her vacation and introduces her black fianc\u00e9 to her perplexed parents. Everything in the movie seemed to have happened in just one day. Their initial plans were for the guy to fly to several places and for the girl to meet up with him in the following couple of weeks, but a couple of the girl's friends suggest that they both leave on the same night. Sidney Poitier does an excellent job playing the young fianc\u00e9, Dr. John Prentice as does Katharine Houghton,(who is the real life niece of Katharine Hepburn) playing the doctor's bride-to-be. This movie has some funny moments, but also has some poignant drama mixed in as well. The film also includes Isabel Sanford, who appears as the live-in maid for the girl and her family. She was great in this role. (I especially like the scene where she knocks on the door of the guest bedroom and walks in while the doctor is changing his clothes and tells him off. Whoa!!) It also includes actress Beah Richards as the doctor's mother. This movie did not do anything for civil rights (from what I learned) and was very controversial when it first came out in 1967 (this may also seem to apply to \"In the Heat of the Night\"). This was also the last movie that Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy would star in together during their careers, as Tracy died just several weeks after filming wrapped. And, for those of you who may not know, this is the only movie that Hepburn played the role of a mother in. The reactions of the girl's parents are mixed when she brings the guy home to meet them. Her mother approves of the mixed union, but her father does not approve, as the guy's parents are against the mixed union as well. I first saw this movie on video years ago and thought it was incredible and outstanding. It deserves to be around for many more years to come as it is worth watching.

            "content": "\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a wonderfully acted period piece that probably had more impact 50 years ago than it does today. Upon watching it, it was no surprise to learn that it was nominated for all 4 acting categories at the Oscars.My favorite part of the movie was easily in the beginning. Watching the young couple, John and Joey, spring the major news on her parents. Their initial reactions were downright hilarious. Then again watching them spring the news on his parents. Then again springing the news that the two families will be having dinner together that night. I doubt I was supposed to find it as funny as I did, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud a good 5 or 6 times during those exchanges. Katherine Hepburn's blank stare and Spencer Tracy's double take were great. Some of the best moments I've seen in cinema in a long while.As for the discussion on racism, some of it is as relevant now as it was at the time. Interracial couples still get looked at strangely. If that couple were real and did get married in 1967, they'd be very old now and would have been dealing with that type of racism their entire time together. In that way many of Spencer Tracy's character's worries were totally correct.There's a bit of a lack of suspense to the drama part of the movie though. It seemed obvious that the characters were too smart for their initial doubts to also be their final decisions. And given enough time that they would all come around to, at the very least, tolerance.If you enjoy fine acting, or need a bit of a history lesson on social norms of the time period, then Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is probably the best movie you can watch. It may not be action packed, but I enjoy anything with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn acting as well as they did in this film.",

            "content": "I don't know if anyone born after this movie was made can fully understand the cultural context it was made in. With enough understanding of history, one can imagine it, and, sadly, with the remnants of racism, it might not be too difficult.The tricky part is that with society changing so quickly, each year of the Sixties was culturally distinct. (The only thing that might come close would be the Forties, because of the war and post-war period.) By 1967, this movie was undoubtedly shocking for some, particularly the older generation. But for me, a white teen, it seemed a natural expression of the way the world should be, if not today, within the next decade. And the world, for the most part, did change.I think many intelligent people began to treat interracial marriage and relationships with at least polite respect and tolerance, if not full approval. And some of that change could be traced to this movie. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a classic example of how Hollywood movies have helped give social change a nudge or shove.As I recall, the most surprising element of this movie was how strongly the blacks objected to the marriage, particularly Tillie and Mr. Prentice. With all the struggle for equal rights, I expected them to applaud the engagement. Part of it, as shown in the movie, was the embedded sense of inequality, part was the knowledge, which I in my naivet\u00e9 lacked, of what could happen, not just hateful racism, but possibly murder. But as Poitier says to his father, he doesn't think of himself as black, but as a man. That, not simply equal rights, was the true goal.The movie was not such a shock because earlier movie had already broken the color barrier, and there already was some integration on TV shows. Poitier had played a key role, starting in 1958 with The Defiant Ones.But more important was Lilies of the Field in 1963, which I remember seeing with my parents, not the most liberal people in the world. Yet how could anyone not like and admire Poitier as Homer Smith? And here was a black actor playing a man, not a black man. There was almost no reference to race in the movie. It is a beautiful, moving film, and can be seen on youtube.By 1967, America had made significant progress in moving away from racism, at least outside of the Deep South. In 1967, there was a wonderful optimism in the air that reasonable people could create a better society, reflected in this movie. But by 1969, with the election of Nixon, some politicians began to stir up racial animosity, a tactic we have seen revived in the past decade. I don't think America ever fully regained that optimism, and now it is nearly dead.So this movie is less about shock, than about expressing hope for an ideal of inequality where people, regardless of race, would think of themselves simply as people, and be viewed by others as simply people. Despite all the problems in America and some lingering racism, as well as animosity towards Hispanics because of the illegal alien problem, many people have reached such a race-neutral attitude. Some of that is reflected in the election of Barack Obama, which was eerily predicted by a remark in the film.The acting is great all around, though it had more impact the first time I saw it. Stanley Kramer wisely avoided over-dramatizing it; now I see the subtleties of the performances. Poitier is the center of the story, and his portrayal gives it believability.Spencer Tracy's performance is the most challenging, because he must go through some complex, difficult changes. His final speech is a blow to the gut of racism. It is one of the great finales of a film career, along with Burt Lancaster's disappearing into the corn field.I was puzzled to see that this was the first film role for Katharine Houghton, because she looked the classic American actress of the 50s and 60s. Then it dawned on me, she reminded me of Hope Lange, particularly her role in Pocketful of Miracles. There is a point where Hepburn is about to break the bad news to her, but is interrupted, which echoes a scene in Capra's Miracles. Houghton conveys the same innocent purity as Lange; interestingly, both were raised in Connecticut, as was Hepburn.And then there is Isabel Sanford. What would the movie be without her portrayal of cynicism and fury? It brings the story back to reality and gives it a gravitas that otherwise might be lost in a saccharine ending of sweetness and light. Cecil Kellaway shows what race neutrality looks like from a white, that it is genuinely possible, and not just some cant or platitudes. I had recently watched him as the psychiatrist in Harvey. They are two quite distinct performances, the mark of a fine actor.Younger viewers might dismiss this movie as ancient history. It holds up well because of the tensions in the complex interplay among the characters, and how they are resolved. It is good to watch this to understand where we were and how far we have come. It is good for foreigners to watch this to learn from our mistakes, and to see how we worked to correct them.But most of all, it is good to watch this movie to remember a time of optimism when there was no problem too great that we could not solve if we worked together as reasonable people. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a great movie that deserves a place among the classics as long as people are around to watch movies.",

            "content": "It must have seemed like an incredibly daring and controversial concept at the time. Take Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, two of the most venerable Hollywood stars, pair them with exciting young African-American actor Sidney Poitier, and place them in a quality film that tackles the serious subject of racism. Tracy and Hepburn portray a liberal older couple whose house is turned upside-down when their daughter Katharine Houghton shows up with her handsome physician fianc\u00e9 Poitier \u2013 who she just happens to neglect to mention is African-American. Naturally, there is a lot of pontificating, hand-wringing, and misunderstandings, which only get worse when Poitier's parents arrive to discover their son's white fiance\u00e9. With all of this talent and the subject matter, it is truly sad that the first adjective one can think to describe it is quaint. For a film that consistently makes Top 10 Lists, either Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is not aging well or has always coasted on the talents on its cast and subject matter alone. There are a number of things glaringly wrong with the film, chief among them the film's insistence to play everything safe. Any time there is a risky moment, the film pulls its punches and glosses over everything with a wink and a smile, and then pats itself on the back and asks for a warm fuzzy for its effort. Racism is a very ugly subject, but no one would know that watching this film as everyone is just so darn rational and good at heart. Barring a very minor character \u2013 a co-worker at Hepburn's art gallery who tries to be snarky about the relationship while disguising it as concern \u2013 everyone is eminently reasonable. And even that woman is relatively tame, so that Hepburn's knee-jerk reaction to fire her rather than give her a simple tongue-lashing seems a bit over-the-top. How interesting it would be if of the respective parents that one of the women were dead set against the union. Yet the film plays it safe with both women (Hepburn and a dignified Beah Richards) almost immediately falling into support, while those stubborn dads just have all the issues. It seems strange that an Oscar was wasted on Hepburn for this performance in this year, which basically just requires her to smile and look beneficently on the couple with dewiness. Tracy fares much better although even he has limited notes to play with this role. Poitier has a powerful scene where he stands his ground against the antagonism, but naturally it is not to a white person (with whom he shows chronic respect) but to his father \u2013 depicted as the most unreasonable of the bunch. Speaking of Poitier, one really must credit him that he is saddled with a character so ludicrously perfect and noble, and yet still manages to deliver a first-rate performance. In the year that he also gave us career highs in this, In the Heat of the Night and To Sir With Love, exactly why did he not warrant an Oscar nomination for any of them? Cecil Kellaway shows up as a friend/priest, and how interesting it would have been to see a representative of the Church preaching against the union (as many Southern pastors did), but naturally and predictably he is the spirit of support. Watching this film one would think that racism was an issue of great rarity. Even more damning towards the film is that the \"brilliant\" daughter played by Houghton comes off as a total dolt. It seems inconceivable that supposedly intelligent young people in the late 1960s in a relationship would never mention to their respective parents that their intended is of another race and would fail to anticipate the reaction of an older, less enlightened generation \u2013 yet that is what the film would have us believe. Tracy does make a strong point in that his concerns rise from whether his daughter has truly given thought to the obstacles an inter-racial couple would be facing \u2013 an issue with some merit since Houghton often comes across as mentally challenged. Any successful interracial marriages of the period certainly started with couples who knew the many obstacles facing them, but Houghton does not seem to acknowledge ANY obstacles, seems oblivious to the environment surrounding her and appears to have sprung that morning from a hermetically sealed bubble. It is incredible to imagine that she has engaged in any kind of serious discussion\u0085on anything. So what we end up with is a quaint, pleasant film about racism with a tone so light and frothy that it about floats away featuring idealized people whose inherent prejudices can easily be overcome by the sight of two youngsters in love. Even in the 1960s it seems that only on another planet could this be characterized as daring.",

The movie also had exceptional shots and cinematography. The acting was also very well done. The movie was very simplistically played out, primarily taking place within a home the entire time, but the arguments, discussions and ideas between both sides were so intense that the movie was naturally very entertaining.",

Katharine Hepburn is fairly good in an Oscar winning role as a woman who finds out that she is not so unprejudiced as she may have thought, but the best of the cast is Spencer Tracy as a man who even campaigned for equal rights but who is unsure if he has double standards or if he is just worried about how they could cope with the xenophobia of others. The film is a bit claustrophobic and looks sort of like a play, and the heated interactions in these small spaces bridge on melodrama that is not too suitable for the story. The maudlin music offers no help, and the ideas (even if new in 1967) seem dripped in lame sentiment. The performances are still worth watching for, with not only Tracy and Hepburn, but also Houghton, Poitier and Kellaway in top form too, even if the content is somewhat familiar and the ideas less relevant today than in the 1960s.",

Spencer Tracy well portrays the common man, who discovers how the integration can arrive so close to him. First, he's against the wedding (even if he's very liberal), but with the help of his wife he will understand the reasons of love. Tracy, unfortunately at his last movie, is great as the funny but resolute Matt Drayton and Katharine Hepburn walks on the screen like a queen. Then is right to remember the 3 great supporters of the movie: Cecil Kellaway, the comprehensive Reverend Ryan, Beah Richards as the sweet mother of Sidney Poitier and Isabel Sanford, which is great as the racist Tilly.

The storyline for this is well paced and unfolds well. The cast is brilliantly selected and the script is very well written.

Once I realized that Guess Who was actually a remake of the 1967 movie Guess Who's Coming to Dinner I was very curious to watch it. The time span of the movie, being basically just one day, kind of felt a little cramped and unrealistic to me. Very interesting story plot though. Joanna is a white women who brings home her new African American doctor fianc\u00e9. The surprise and well disacceptance by Joanna's family carries the comedy scenes in this movie, and that's the best parts of the movie. There's time where the witty banter and comments back and forth well make you laugh out loud. A little more action would of definitely held my attention more, im not talking car chases and exploding bombs here, but maybe a car ride, outings, something to brake up the manonity. For example like the scene when Tracey (Matt) backs into the car. The ending of a father realizing that all that matters is if his daughter is happy, and who gives a hoot what others think, touched my heart. Katherine Hepbirn, is of course fabulous in this movie, as always. I had heard of Sidney Poitier before but couldn't recall having seen any of his work. I must say he did do a great job portraying John. His dry sense of humor throughout the movie helped to make his character very realistic in my opinion.Definitely worth the watch, especially since its so worthy It has even been updated and remade.",

Sidney Portier, as always, does an amazing performance as Dr. Prentice. I will say though, as far as African Americans were viewed during this time period, his performance was that of a very intelligible, educated and well dressed doctor. In other words, he was a very \"white acting\" black man. I feel this sent across the intended message without \"shocking\" the audience at the time.

Moral of the story and love triumphs being at the heart of the story. Though the complete amazement at seeing a mixed race couple was incredible enjoyable to watch.Seeing the reactions of the family members to the happy couple as they were astonished. It was as if a war had just been declared. It seems ridiculous that people could behave like that but back then such ideas were common.In hindsight though for a family that claimed to be supportive of civil rights the so called liberals were neither very liberal or tolerant. They acted like an old family suddenly learning of a dangerous secret and they were forced to accept their daughters ways.In this movie only the young couple come out of this looking good. A thoroughly good movie, making a mockery out of prejudice but also reminder us of the importance of caring families.",

But I noticed when I commented on it that it was a remake of the 1967 classic \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\". I saw it over at Hollywood Video and figured since there were such great actors starring in it, I would give it a shot. The interesting thing to me is the fact that I'm not sure if this movie would be considered \"acceptable\" in today's world because it would be considered too \"edgy\". But I'm extremely glad that I had the opportunity to see this film because it was so beautifully done and very well handled by it's cast and crew. It actually made me cry because I don't think our society has changed much. But the story is a very important one.Joey and John are two young people who are very madly in love, so much so that they want to marry right away. But John wants Joey's parents approval, he's a respectable young man: intelligent, kind, polite, and extremely handsome and also a black man. That's right, it's a biracial relationship in the 60's, where a marriage between these two is actually illegal in some states. Joey's parents have always taught her to respect all races and that she is just as equal as them, but they never mentioned how hard it might be to be married to a black man. John's parents join in for the dinner proving this to be an extremely hard time for the couple's happy future.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a fantastic movie with extremely moving performances from every actor in the film, I mean, they couldn't have picked a more perfect cast. The dialog was so extremely moving and at times humorous. I liked the scene where the delivery boy leaves with the maid's helper and they just dance their way down the drive way.

Everyone's so perfect, so lefty- Hollywood-acceptable in their jabberings; Everyone's so wealthy, and so well-connected; Everyone's so \"With It\" in the lines they deliver, and so materially successful; Everyone's so happy (even when they're sad or mad) and either anti-faith or \"Christian-lite\"; Everyone's just so resistably plastic. GWCTD reeks of plot lines and 2-dimensional characters yanked out of sitcoms like Father Knows Best and light teenage flicks like The Parent Trap. From the first two scenes, we can tell that ersatz-profound speeches will eventually be heard in the final act, the music will come up, love will conquer all and they'll all live happily ever after -- lighting from one success to another, keeping their cheerful demeanor at all times, with the happy couple inevitably producing incredible children who'll go to Groton, Brown, Haavaud, Columbia or some other such gawdawful place and will make the inevitable remarkable contributions to western civilization and to cultural diversity. Can't we see people as they really are, at least in a movie that pretends to be serious? Nobody can make a flip or nasty remark. No one can doubt another's sincerity. No one has vices. All we get is what a Hollywood hack-writer considers to be meaningful dialog. We're embarrassed for both Tracy and Hepburn in this being their final movie. No wonder Hepburn cries real tears in the last scene, having to witness the horribly-dogmatic speech Tracy is forced to spew...after he had delivered so much fresh and timeless dialog in his professional life, to be reduced to recite so many hackneyed phrases in one sitting must have been torture for Hepburn to witness as his final act. \"Judgement at Nurmburg\" it ain't. We're also embarrassed for Poitier, following his raw and realistic work in such great movies as \"Blackboard Jungle\" \"In the Heat of the Night\" and \"A Patch of Blue\" this part must have been a disappointment to a great actor. Unlike some other reviewers here, I like most of Poitier's early work; he's usually portrayal of a successful black man who has more redeeming qualities than most of the whities he encounters, and most audiences cheer his various portrayals as both believable and sympathetic. But, to here portray a powerful and brilliant guy who's asked a girl of a different race to marry him, and then promise to her dad to abandon his commitment if her folks object just breaks his character down to nothing. The maid's part borders on junk, as well, not just because her dialog is shallow, but we also have to witness Tracy deliver the dishonest line that she's a \"member of this family\" when neither the daughter or her folks do or say anything that convinces us that she's considered much more than a servant. Scenes with the Catholic Priest are quite hard to buy, as he offers nothing from the Christian perspective to a situation that will require commitment far greater than mere conjugal love. Many people who don't like part of this movie fault Katherine Houghton's performance for being false and airheaded. Her character is just emblematic of what's wrong with the whole picture.",

In a lot of ways I can understand it being stirring though it is more of an idea movie, a message movie shall we say. The trouble comes when you start to technically break the movie down.This movie is made very much in the style of a 1950's film. This is the same problem many point out with Alfred Hitchcock's 1969 effort Topaz. It is very striking when you watch this one now. Tracy & Hepburn pretty much recap performances from films past here and despite the closing speech by Tracy, the film does not rise above that.It is a feel good movie for the upper class that they would confront this issue in 1967. The fact is society already had passed this point in 1967 thanks to trail blazers Sidney Portier, Bill Cosby, and Martin Luther King who is mentioned in the film. The important point here is that the media had not gotten past it. Sadly that is still true today.All I have to do is point out the treatments given to people in the media still. This movie has the guts to approach both sides of the issue in 1967, but does it for show. The script fails to produce the \"beef\" of this issue. Sidney Portier, one of the great actors of all time is reduced in this one to very few lines to make room for Tracy and Hepburn, an obvious 3rd banana. It is a shame. The script lets the viewer down, it could have been so much more.The movie did get awards, and that is because of the feel good mentality that Hollywood had of itself that they had confronted a difficult issue. The fact is girls in 1967 were starting to break this ground by starting to accept others than their own race. The script here makes it seem like a shiny new penny. The only reason it was still an issue by this time were parents still stuck in the past. The film does get and A Plus for pointing that out.Still, the movie could have been so much more if the meaning had been pointed out more strongly. It took a generation of youngsters starting in the late 1960's to get past this point and start finally over ruling parents. Even though this film confronted it head on, sadly parents of both races still refused to accept it. The main stream media still does not accept this. I am glad people do now. I know plenty of mixed marriages and they work very well. What has happened with the main stream now is they have allowed money to become the discrimination factor instead of race. If this continues we are a few years from a much bigger issue. Money has not changed but when it is used to bring down people's self-worth as it is now, it becomes a much bigger issue than race ever was.",

Although, John is a doctor he is still looked down upon as an individual based on him being black.The gathering of the families for \"dinner\" turns into a gathering of conversation of how each feels about the interracial relationship and how they themselves need to change how they personally feel about it.The moral of the story is that true love is color blind.",

            "content": "It's the late 1960s, a period of extreme unrest in the United States.  The status of women, blacks, gays, college students, and draftees is being questioned and examined.  But the unrest doesn't seem to have invaded the lives of the characters portrayed by Katherine Houghton and Sidney Poitier. She's a carefree early-twentysomething whose debut bow was probably the most strenuous moment of her life, and he's a widowed doctor in his late thirties who has risen above his humble beginnings (as the son of a mail carrier and, I presume, a housewife) to become internationally renowned.  Oh, yeah, and she's white and he's black.  And they met ten days ago in Hawaii.  Oh, and they want to get married.  Like, now.  Is that okay, Mom and Dad?Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (in his last film role) portray Houghton's parents.  Daddy's a newspaper publisher, and Mom toys around with the arts ... oh, piffle, she owns a gallery, nothing serious.  Just pin money.  They live in a mansion in the San Francisco \"gentry ghetto\" and are lovingly cared for by Tillie (Mrs. Jefferson didn't take no lip even back then) and Dorothy, the mod young thang in the psychedelic minidress.  They are fashionably agnostic, although they cultivate the friendship of an affable old priest, and up until now, their laissez-faire outlook on social justice has never really been put to the test, as their priest pal observes with not inconsiderable amusement.Roy Glenn and Beah Richards portray Poitier's parents.  Pop's not too keen on the impending nuptials, and says as much in no uncertain terms, prompting Poitier to blithely retort that Pop's many sacrifices in raising his son to have a better life than he himself did were no more than his (Poitier's) due.  That one scene put a bit of a tarnish on Dr. Perfecto for me, although he had also annoyed me thoroughly throughout the movie by pronouncing his ladylove's name as \"Joanner.\"  How veddy veddy blueblooded of him.Anyhoo, this was Hollywood's take on the \"miscegenation\" issue in the turbulent late sixties, and since we know they had to be CAREFUL, it's not too surprising the way this story went.  Everyone spent a lot of time baring their souls, climaxing with Beah Richards (the best part of the movie in my opinion) calmly asserting to Spencer Tracy that he must have forgotten what it's like to be in love, or he wouldn't be so worried about racial disparity.  True enough, but in his place, I daresay I'd have worried about ANY daughter of mine wanting to marry someone after knowing him only ten days.  But I digress.I see from reading other comments that Spencer Tracy had to jump through quite a few hoops to even get to be in this film at all, and so I assume he was pleased with the way it turned out at the end -- he gets to make everyone shut up and listen to his long, blustery speech on his feelings about the whole situation and how he's decided that, doubts be damned, the happy couple should be given the blessings of all and let's all fly to Switzerland to see them married.  Neatly tying up the film (except for a few teary shots of Katharine Hepburn, meant to bronze forever this final screen pairing of the long-term illicit lovers) and steamrollering over any other objections, then, everyone troops in to dinner.  The benevolent Caucasian patriarch has spoken, and that's that.Others have commented upon the overall \"weirdness\" of certain scenes -- the one of Dorothy dancing with the delivery boy, the visit to the drive in for ice cream, and Katharine Hepburn's dressing down and firing of Virginia Christine (poor Mrs. Oleson!).  I have to agree that these scenes tend to stop the film cold and leave you wondering why they were included at all. Virginia Christine's appearance at the beginning of the movie made more than clear what her opinion about Poitier's and Houghton's even keeping company together, much less marrying, was.  To bring her back as the great WASP avenger of young white feminine purity was a bit much.So much more could have been done with this film, and it's rather sad in retrospect.  The time when it could have been made effectively is gone forever, which is good for the most part.  People take interracial marriages for granted today.  That is as it should be.  And I'm sure that this movie had at least a small part in influencing the change in thought and perspective.  But it could still have done so much more.",

After a 10-year gap between collaborations, Tracy and Hepburn appear together for the ninth and final time and of course they are quite believable as the married couple. Hepburn, who is perpetually misty-eyed here, won an Oscar for this but she gets to do little more than gaze at Tracy with admiration.",

I think the fact that this film was in color certainly helped for the intensity of the difference in skin color.

It was good to see how people can overcome a color and be happy together no matter what someone says. I liked how this film took place over one day, although maybe a weekend would have been more fitting. I loved the dialog and script. It was humorous at parts and serious at other parts.

It was a little overpolished and refined, but that's just the type of film it is. I thought the acting was very good. However, I didn't particularly car for Katharine Houghton's performance. I thought she was really bubbly and her voice was too high pitched and sounded childish. She came off as ditsy and naive; not the kind of girl you would assume a super successful and intelligent doctor would be interested in. I think the film might have benefited from a more believable couple. It wasn't necessary to have her character be so effervescent just so they could say things in the film like \"oh... she's always been such a happy girl, but I've never seen her more happy\" and \"she was laughing out loud at six months.\" For a film like this I think it's crucial for the audience to really be able to believe that the relationship on screen is genuine and strong. It didn't happen for me; I didn't see very much chemistry at all.There isn't a whole lot to say about the film; It was mostly straightforward. It was very well made, flowed smoothly, and all of the events were clear and understandable. I liked a lot of what was said by the characters, and the story was interesting.",

That seems like a realisation that would fit in better towards the end. From that moment on there was no conflict for me between Joey and her parents anymore, because they've just destroyed any objection they could ever have possibly had. Even the grievances of Mr Prentice could have been swept aside fairly swiftly with a simple 'You can't control who you fall in love with!'. There's not much of a story unless you have really entrenched beliefs to push back against.

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner deals with an issue that's a non-issue today: a black man, John, falls in love with a white woman, Joey, and the two wish to be married. Most of the film deals with the emotional struggle and aftermath of this news being delivered to both sets of parents. Set in its time of racial tensions and civil rights strife, such a plot becomes compelling.I was worried going into this film that it would be far too dated to take seriously. For reference, I'm 31 and not the biggest fan of classic movies. There are some cases where even the most progressive characters sound dated (like when John talks about how marriage obviously means children, like parenthood isn't a choice). But this is a sign of its time. The film demonstrates its time period well, allowing insight into racial tensions in the '60s even among the most open-minded of folk. Furthermore, the film remains highly relevant in modern standards. In an intense rant that made me a fan of Sidney Poitier as an actor, John tells his father that children don't owe their parents anything, even explanations for their choices, while parents owe their children everything for bringing them into this world. And he also expresses frustration over the dated mentality of his father's generation and speaks the truth that some biased judgments only die with the people who hold them. Both these arguments struck a chord with me even now in 2020 and made the movie feel far ahead of its time despite its main plot.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is full of enjoyable moments. Whether it's watching Katharine Hepburn tell off a busybody with the confidence of a madwoman, enjoying the bickering and banter between the film's two main couples (Joey and John, and Joey's parents, Matt and Christina), or laughing at the absurd spontaneous dancing scene between two rockin' teens. The faux backgrounds were rarely noticeable because the content in the film was so engrossing. The dated ways of speaking never irk, both because it's natural for the time and the actors delivering lines are all great (particularly Poitier and Hepburn, though Spencer Tracy is also fantastic). Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is an important piece of cinematic history that now serves as an enjoyable blast from the past that still has plenty to say.",

Instead, there is just basically two people from highly-educated, successful, good families that are not very different after all. Would have been far more interesting if there was a clash of cultures. This movie begs to be re-made today.\nThe Bad:1. Katherine Hepburn looking 'dewy-eyed' scene after scene, enough!. Was here whole career success due to the ability to well-up tears in her eyes on cue?. 2. The actor playing the half-witted daughter was just awful, not only annoying, but who could believe that the Poitier character would find her interesting or that they could really be in love?. 3. Is this the worst set design ever in a movie?. 4. Tracy can act, but this is just a one-note narrow performance. Good actor wasted with a stupid script. 5. I deeply resent the male-bashing undercurrent of the movie. Women are just vessels of virtue and wisdom, while the men plod around dragging their knuckles and acting on prejudice.The Good:1. Hollywood's out of touch depiction of the 60s culture is always great for unintentional laughs, and this movie is full of them. That delivery boy should have gotten an academy award, not Hepburn. 2.

            "content": "Somehow this 1967 film classic still works perhaps because it's not as dated as one would hope it would be. I was motivated to see this film for the umpteenth time since I recently saw the rather toothless partial remake, \"Guess Who\" with Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. The plot is fairly low-key taking place mostly in the upscale San Francisco home of Matt and Christina Drayton, a crusading liberal newspaper publisher and his art gallery-owning wife. That's the set-up for their daughter Joey's surprise return from her vacation in Hawaii with an unexpected fianc\u00e9e in tow.The fact that the Draytons are white and the fianc\u00e9e, John Wade Prentice, is black provides the focus of the plot, but make no mistake that the casting of screen legends Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as the Draytons and Sidney Poitier - then one of the most popular stars - as Prentice alters the reality of the situation considerably. There are also several plot contrivances that seem suitable for this story but not in real-life, for instance, the increasingly imminent departure of the young couple to Geneva, Prentice's statement to the Draytons that a marriage will not happen without their approval, Joey's constant impulsiveness and her seemingly cavalier attitude toward the sensitivities of others.Yet what continues to be surprising is that the film's glamorization of interracial romance among the wealthy does not detract from its sheer entertainment value. Despite the seriousness of the subject, especially at the height of the civil rights movement, director Stanley Kramer - in his typically socially conscious mode - and screenwriter William Rose have fashioned mostly a drawing room comedy that turns heavier and more significant with the last dramatic scenes.Because this is more an ensemble piece, it barely feels like a Tracy-Hepburn film, especially since they look very settled as a long-ago married couple. They do have a few scenes together where you can strongly feel the natural on screen rapport that had lasted for 25 years - the Oregon boysenberry scene, the walk through their patio as she cuts the flowers, the lasting stare between them at the end. In his last film finished a little over two weeks before his death, Tracy looks far older than his 67 years but still does masterful work as Drayton, a man who unexpectedly finds himself at odds with his values with his daughter's sudden announcement. His famous climactic monologue is the film's understandable high point, but he also does wonders listening to everyone else's thoughts and opinions.Hepburn imbues her trademark independent spirit in what seems to be an observational role. Considering she was in-between her morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" and her vengeful Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"The Lion in Winter\", her seemingly passive role here hardly seems worthy of her time except for the way she looks at Tracy or Katharine Houghton (her real-life niece) or in a couple of meaty confrontation scenes - the first with her bigoted gallery manager whom she tells with contained fury to \"get permanently lost\" and the second an ultimatum in the bathroom to Matt should he not condone the marriage.Poitier seems comfortable portraying an incredibly accomplished man but really does not catch dramatic fire until the last half-hour when he confronts his own father about his feelings. Houghton, relentlessly perky to the point of strangulation, has a relatively thankless role as Joey as she is the catalyst for the plot machinations but has no scene which allows her character to respond verbally to the groundswell of problems the situation has caused for those around her. This may have been intentional, but it creates an odd, somewhat selfish imbalance to her character.Beah Richards has a few quietly powerful moments as Prentice's mother, who accuses Drayton rather vicariously of forgetting what it's like to be in love. As her retired postal carrier husband, Roy S. Glenn provides bluster to his role, but his character is given short shrift especially in his non-response to Poitier's memorable tirade near the end. Not all the roles are noteworthy though - Cecil Kellaway seems to have walked in from a Bing Crosby movie as the wise, twinkly Monsignor Ryan, and Isabel Sanford from a sitcom set as the Draytons' sassy maid Tillie. The DVD has a clean print of the film but only a trailer as an extra.",

            "content": "Sidney Poitier was one of the first prominent black actors and in much of his films racism is an important theme.In \"In the heat of the night\" (1967, Norman Jewison) it is explicit and violent racism. In \"Guess who's coming to dinner\" the racism is of the upper middle class type. More implicit and hypocritical. Of course the liberal couple Matt (Spencer Tracy) and Christina Drayton (Katharine Hepburn) stands well above any form of racism, but when their daughter Joey (Katahtine Houghton) falls in love with a black man they are upsett anyway. In the film this black man (John Prentice played by Sidney Poitier) is so perfect that any rejection of him can only indicate racism. After some thought Matt is able to justify his objections. Of course he is not a racist himself, but other people are and therefore his daughter will be having a hard time marrying a black man.\"Guess who's comming to dinner\" is one of the few films about this upper middle class form of racism, and it deserves credit for that. That this theme is still relevant today is proven by a film such as \"Get out\" (2017, Jordan Peele). All the same the more explicit and violent form of racism gives more action and tensity in \"In the heat of the night\".There are some other remarks to make about \"Guess who's coming to dinner\", both positive and some more critical.Positive is that the film is also about what I would call reverse racism. The parents of John also have their doubts. Is marrying a white girl not too ambitious?Negative, because gender role confirming, is in my opinion the fact that mother Christina is the first one who takes sides with her daughter in love.I did have mixed feelings for the happy end. It relativized too much the venom inherent in implicit racism. On the other hand the final speech by Matt is really beautiful (and beautifully acted by Spencer Tracey). I had the same mixed feelings with the speech at the end of \"The great dictator\" (1940, Charlie Chaplin).This final speech also makes clear that \"Guess who's coming to diner\" is not the film of Sidney Poitier but the film of Spencer Tracey. It was his 4th film with Stanley Kramer and his 9th with Katharine Hepburn. Tracey was already in bad health and died 17 days after the last shooting day. His bad health caused not only logistic problems (he could work only a few hours a day), but also made the financing of the film difficult. The wages of Kramer and Hepburn were initially deposited on a blocked bank account as a security right for the financier.",

Look at it from another prospective: What reaction would a young, white woman get today from American parents if she introduced them to an Islamic-Muslim-Arabic man that she was going to dash-off with, in a few hours, to their repressive countries? \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", at its original release, showed us a very real treatise on inter-racial marriages - no matter what they were. Admit that even some white-on-white, black-on-black or any other race would cause a stir, more so if it is the daughter who has made the choice, between the different \"classes\" of any given race? \"WHAT? They are not like us!\" Those people who are in denial of this basic characteristic apparently have never heard of Islamic daughters being murdered by their own family-members, on the mere suspicion they had had sexual relations pre-marriage - even within their own culture. If today's society cannot understand that Americans are disliked all over the world, then they are doomed to many misconceptions.I went to Hawai'i in 1967 and found that black-and-white relationships, especially by traditional Hawai'ians, was frowned upon - regardless of how long African-American soldiers, sailors and all other branches of the military had been stationed there. I lived in Honolulu, not the same city as Waikiki, and saw very few African-American people there. In fact, some of the darker Polynesian races are called \"popolo\", which means black.I agree that Poitier was overly \"cleaned-up\" for this role. Just what IF he had been less credentialed, as some other posters have asked? I would like to read/see/hear how members of HIS race felt about this role: I KNOW how they feel about actual inter-marrying. I'm from the deep South, but have found the clich\u00e9 on marriage to be pretty-much the same in every place I've been in in this country. To me, Poitier was the one to take the biggest risk on appearing in this movie - I've never seen/heard any comment by him WHY he did......did he \"take the money and run\"? Even in Hollywood - I live there - you just may be stretching it by inter-racial affairs. Someone wrote-in to one of the gossip-mongers here, asking why certain Black celebs always seemed to date white ladies. The reply was, \"Because they can,\" most likely because of their fame and handsomeness, and - yes - their wealth....not even considering their rightful choice. Even \"Crash\" has an African-American actor telling his mother he could not talk to her right then, because he was having sex with a white woman. Did anyone faint over that? Poitier HAS made some definitive Black films: \"Blackboard Jungle\" and \"Raisin in the Sun\", to name a couple.I, for one, am very happy that we've become, to a smaller degree, to judge people less on their skin-color than their suitability. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" WAS a trifle contrived, in-that the white family was wealthy and thereby could somewhat separate themselves from the general population. The African-American parents were rightfully concerned. The mixed-race couple, in the movie, could also insulate themselves to some degree because of the doc's work.....their kids? whoa!!I wouldn't be surprised if the home the film was shot in is actual - it's not unusual, and wouldn't have been in 1967, for wealthy people who live in the hills above San Francisco to have a view like that. Beverly Hills has almost as many Islamic residents in LARGER estates, today, than the \"stars\" do. Why? \"Because they can.\" Isn't that what this country is supposed to be about? All of the actors in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" were superb. I don't think the action dragged at any point, nor do I feel the dialog was cryptic. That it was fairly well-known this would be the final picture with Hepburn and Tracey, the emotion in Hepburn's face undoubtedly was a true one. As mentioned by several posters, their romance was a great controversy here.....Tracey was married. The entire production of the film was tasteful, indeed money being invested in established stars to insure the returns would be profitable. A film with the same theme, but without being designated to that social strata, would be very interesting, indeed - even today.Therefore, let's accept it as a wonderful statement toward being more tolerant, allowing those who truly love chose their own loves. How much better-off we'd be! Compassion is a fabulous characteristic.....try being a white, gay female impersonator....Bravo for this film ! I'm going to have them ALL over for dinner, because I am going to watch it again FOR dinner....",

            "content": "I first saw this 1967 film on American Movie Classics or it could have been Tuner Movie Classics and was genuinely impressed though I do have some criticism. The stellar performances by all the principal actors are nothing short of outstanding. Spencer Tracey won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but in my opinion only because this was his last role in a film. He died within two weeks after making this film. His monologue at the end of the film is moving and poignant and the stuff all great actors should aspire to. Sidney Poitier once again performs Oscar worthy material and as Dr. Wade Prentice, he is full of dignity, grace and inner fire, a perfect contrast to his tender, elegant and soft-spoken girlfriend played by Katherine Houghton, Katherine Hepburn's niece. Katherine Hepburn also won an Academy Award for this performance as the supportive, well-bred mother but while I enjoyed her part, I didn't consider it worthy of Oscar when keeping in mind she had already won Oscars for even greater performances in movies prior to this one. The premise to this film was a tad shocking and controversial in the time of its release. In 1967 (and keep in mind the idea for the film had to have been conceived at least a year or two earlier in 1965 or 1966) the US abounded with racism and tension. The Civil Rights Movement spurred Riots and protests in the South at the time of Martin Luther King's famous sermons. The idea of a white woman and a black man defying their parents, eloping and marrying each other in a time when interracial couples didn't really exist must have raised some eyebrows. Now, of course, interracial couples are everywhere and this can only be viewed as a product of its time. The very powerful message of love is evident throughout the film, especially in the confrontation scenes with Mrs. Preston and Mr. Drayton. How the couples' respective families deal with the issues of a sudden marriage (which involves both of them moving out of state on account of Wade Prentice's career) is very touching to see. When they finally make peace and sit down to dinner and the catchy jingle \"That's the Glory of Love\" plays it's a very fine finale to this ..well period film. It should be viewed in Humanities classes and Social Studies Classes in High School or College/University Level that study the time of the Civil Rights in the late 60's.",

But it is still interesting to watch how it is talked out, and how some of the characters change as the result of their interactions with each other.A movie not to be missed.",

It's somewhat tense, packed (with different individuals and \"groups\" of people) and has the viewer watching with batted breath to see how this will all be handled, and if the couple we've come to love, Dr. Prentice and Joanna, will find acceptance and if that acceptance remains an important factor prior to marriage. The common themes of counterculture and prevalent throughout. The elements of race, how Joanna openly talks about sex with her mother (we see her mother go red in the face, yet Joanna behind her is totally unfazed. A great use of framing here). Also, there's an okay amount of swearing, conflicts between the older and younger generations (where the younger generation isn't immediately reprimand as they would have in earlier films).",

There should be no problems- except the race issue in 1967. I was surprised to hear that there were still laws against interracial marriages in 1967.Basically comedy is interlaced with situational comedy. Poitier looks great and plays off the situation. Isabel Sanford, as the maid, looks at him as a slick con artist, not believing he is a doctor. Tracey is gruff and reflective. This was his final film. He is very touching as a father wanting the best for his daughter, concerned about the grandchildren, how the world will treat them. Hepburn is really just a decoration, the loving mother excited for her daughter. She has a few memorable scenes such as when she tells her racist art gallery friend that she is fired.There is one amusing scene as Tracey and Hepburn drive off to get ice cream- he remembers 'Oregon boysenberry' and gets the same thing, which is different from what he remembered. Then he likes it anyway- change can be okay... Then he gets in a car accident when he accidentally backs into a young black man. His expressions of non-verbal frustration are rather funny.Spencer Traceys speech at the end is worth most of the movie; he only wants what is best for the young couple- I wondered why Poitier's parents didn't get more of a say as well. Beah Richards, as Poitiers mother does have a few comments for Tracey; she reminds him as an old man that he should try and remember what love was. Some of the lines Poitier has are the best, after his father tells him he has made a horrible mistake, and owes him something. He tells his father- you did what you were supposed to- you brought me into the world....Poitier is excellent as always.Overall the movie holds up although it could certainly have a stronger female player opposite Poitier. Katharine Houghton does appear a bit saccharine sweet, even anemic at times. Poitier steals the show. Overall a good film that may be due for a remake.",

The title is also witty, and a bit humorous. I think that this is a great example of the New Age of Hollywood. The director is using the film to get a point across. He artfully crafts the movie around a big social message, one that is extremely relevant during 1967. The inner conflict between white and black in America was absolutely huge, and I think that as a film maker, you have a voice that is way greater than that of any political leader. As a film maker, you have an unmatchable influence on the masses. In the case of this movie, I believe that the director does an absolutely wonderful job in stating his social message.",

They are showing that multi race couples are not common during this time. This film had many different characters, but I think that every character was perfect for their role, and it would not be the same if they were to cut one or two from the film. Each one of the characters had their own way of standing out. There were definitely characters that were flat vs others that were completely round characters, the well balanced characters I think help shape the movie to what it is.

            "content": "Starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn as a liberal couple who one day are shocked to return home to find their energetic daughter Joey with her arm around a black mean, Dr John Prentice, played by Poitier, with whom she wishes to marry. The young black man, understanding of the racial tension associated with intermarriage, tells the in-laws-to-be that he will only marry their daughter if both of their parents approve without any hesitation. Poitier, as always, comes off as noble. While he loves their daughter, he understands the limitations and boundaries of his skin color and with a sort of feudalistic sense of morals, he must set the feelings of the girl's father above those of his own. The film, taking place almost entirely in the San Fransisco home of the parents in the span of one afternoon, is pretty simplistic in its structure but it draws the audience into the central focus of the movie, and when that is something as provoking and controversial as intermarriage, in 1967, it's worth watching. Some of the scenes, like when Tracy's character orders the wrong flavor of ice cream but ends up liking it, as a metaphor for the entire movie, while a bit obvious is kind of cute. That's how the movie works, it's highly focused, it's not subtle it sends the message loud and clear, the cast is small, every character is there to represent some point of view on this marriage and all are highly conscious, in terms of making a statement, the movie no doubt accomplishes that goal, and many movies do fail at that. However, in terms of story, the movie wears a little thin. The movie failed to keep me engaged into what was happening, partly because very little was happening. This movie relies too heavily on star quality and interesting dialogue to push its way through a couple of hours. The movie is like an escalator, the opening montage shows the love-struck couple making their way joyfully through the airport to pick up their bags and into her house, where she is greeted by her mother. Joey tells her mother about the man she's in love with but refrains to mention two things: that she bought the man home and that she's a Negro. Joey, who is portrayed as giddy and careless, then sends her mother into shock when she discovers these two things. The same thing happens over and over as the  tensions build up toward a climax where Mr Drayton, who's been kicked around all day gives a dazzling speech in which he bring out into the open every single unsettling thing and threatening comment he has heard that day and announces his decision to give his daugher his blessing. That speech was the movie's most memorable scene in the movie because of the parallels to back-door attitude of race in this country, and moreso because we're rooting for Mr Drayton. In my mind, Tracy delivers the standout performance of the film. Poitier and Hepburn are two of the greatest legends ever to grace a screen, but Poitier just played Poitier and Hepburn gave us Hepburn. It was Tracy, who was giving us something unexpected. He seemed to be the only complex character in the movie who was grounded more in reality than a set of racial stereotypes.",

Hilary's expression of shock at the upcoming marriage, even if it implies a degree of prejudice, is nevertheless understandable given the sudden revelation of the impending marriage. The firing seems irrational and unjustified. Hilary's lack of hesitancy in expressing her sentiments to Mrs. Drayton implies that the latter has expressed similar sentiments, herself (why else would Hilary, who has known Mrs. Drayton for some time, be so candid with her if she didn't feel she was addressing a sympathetic ear?). Mrs. Drayton's action is really an overreaction. The Dr., in fact, earlier tells Mrs. Drayton that she looks as if she's going to faint when the news of the marriage is broken to her. Mrs. Drayton's actions vis-a-vis Hilary shows her willingness to punish others for her own feelings, real or imagined; this caused me to lose a significant degree of respect for her for the rest of the film.

Katherine Houghton plays the role of a bubbly rich girl, Joanna. Bursting with excitement about getting married to Dr. John Wayne a black man she just met 10 days ago in Hawaii. Joanna believes that what she is doing is right, and out of love and doesn't want people's opinions. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a very well put together film with a strong storyline, dialogue and camera work. Dr John Wayne (the fianc\u00e9) is very nervous to meet the family, and scared to tell his own family about his \"white\" fianc\u00e9. While Joanna on the other hand doesn't have a care in the world on what others may think. The acting throughout this film is marvelous and very memorable. With some great actors and actresses with really shine with realism on what is going on. There isn't very many scene changes during the movie, as it mainly takes place within the Drayton's home. As the film unravels the interracial problem becomes less and less awkward and less feelings of wrongness.All in all I believe this film was so nicely put together, and very strong.

            "content": "\"They call me Mister Tibbs!\" thunders Sidney Poitier in In the Heat of the Night, a classic, monumental line from a film that would later win Best Picture amongst other accolades. The cynicism in some may attribute this recognition as a sort of over-compensation and apology. In this film itself Poitier even references the phenomenon, remarking how he (jokingly) thinks he has advanced his career so quickly at such at young age because no one in his way wanted to seem prejudiced. It is easy to fall victim to this mindset of Poitier's various roles in the 50s and 60s as the black saviour, the Negro that steps into the white man's position flawlessly and rights their wrongs. He is no different here; Kramer has gone to great lengths in giving not an inch of breathing room or hesitation at our judgement of Dr. Prentice. The Yale educated doctor is polite, well-spoken, courteous, sensitive and worldly. He has stepped into the best possible outcome of his modest upbringing and is striving to do even more good for those without the opportunity to succeed like he has. Never are we allowed to have any doubt that this would be a man you would be proud to have marry your daughter. Some may see this as an easy cop-out, to make Prentice so unequivocally perfect that we cannot object to his character other than to point to the colour of his skin. Looking back on this move it seems a flaw, and yet a necessary step in order to bypass other distractions and get to the core of the issue itself. Prentice has fallen in love, in a mere 20 minutes, with the much younger Joey Drayton. It seems to be an intentional drawing of her character to create the perception of a naive and vulnerable young woman, almost child-like, against the much older Prentice to give the impression of a mismatch, of the black man preying on the innocence of the white girl. Kramer's film is full of these points that are supposed to subconsciously allow the audience to address and re- consider their own biases. We are positioned like the 'phony' liberal Drayton couple, who have been adamantly outspoken against racial discrimination, but hesitate when it is a matter concerning their own daughter. Would we make the same decision? Of course this does seems dated to the modern viewer. But just consider that these overt racist actions and behaviours have merely taken a step back and become deep-seated concerns rather than being blasted out of our mouths. The Drayton's think along that old line: \"I've got nothing against Negroes, but would you want your daughter to marry one?\" In this day and age it has merely morphed and taken on a more subtle approach, by beginning a sentence with: \"I'm not racist, but...\"Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are of course the stand-outs. We have all heard of the health issues that plagued Tracy right through the shooting of the film, so much so that it becomes apparent that when he monologues about a youthful love long, long gone from his past Hepburn's misty eyes are not a hundred percent acting (we now know of their secret love affair that spanned twenty six years). They both have key scenes where we are forced to confront that perhaps their fashionable liberalism is not so easily applied to close, more sensitive topics. Hepburn is lik a crying stone at first, stony- faced and silently furious at the sight of her daughter's choice. Later, in a sweeping damnation that would have even the hardest-hearted cynic cheer out, she fires a racist employee for daring to question Joey's decision. Tracy's pleasant nature turns confrontational as he realises what is going on, and we can see the inner wrestle with his values. Later, in what seems like a contrived accident, he hits a negro's car and the resulting scuffle and argument unearths some deeply buried hostilities. What Kramer has show us here is how momentary bursts of anger and passion can make even our most concealed biases surface and rear their ugly head. Spike Lee would later perfect this realisation. Of course there are flaws. The time limit that is forced upon the parents is arbitrary and contrived, each day more and more resembling a dramatic device. Poitier's saviour role did not exactly sit well with many of his fellow black citizens, but as a sell-out. It is perhaps a bit too much to ask of the audience to believe in this perfect negro here to revolutionise and cleanse our racial biases, even if it was a necessary move for its time. Prentice Senior remarks that even with the law on their side they would face strong opposition from both races. The black maid's role is seldom more than to add sass and dismissive one-liners here and now again, as if to reinforce the disapproval of the black community too. But Kramer is correct; the law does not always mean a quick and easy turning of public moral opinion. We see this even today.",

            "content": "As far as significance goes guess whose coming to dinner unarguably tackles the idea of race, interracial couples, and identifying a generational gap. The acting in this movie is what shows viewers what the significance is. When young Christina brings her fianc\u00e9e home to meet her parents it is as if she doesn't even notice or at least acknowledge that being he is black. Having grown up in a racially segregated America her fianc\u00e9e John attempts to address his concern for what both of their parents will think about the arrangement, but he does not see why it cannot work. Christina's liberal parents are confused, hesitant, and taken back by the idea of their daughter marrying a black man. In addition, John's his father completely objects the idea of his son marrying a white women. Here we see the significance of the generational gap that racism caused. The younger adults appear to disregard the idea that skin color should be a deciding factor in companionship. For the older parents this is one of the most standout things they notice about a person. Even though both appear to be perfect for one another their parents cannot surpass the idea they are different races. In they end, they allow the marriage and begin to embrace the idea that color does not matter, only love does. In my opinion this film does something that is seldom done in films that have a race sensitive subject matter. For my own sake I am going to mention it in this review although some may find it insignificant I think it is pretty powerful. In most cases films revolved around black and white racism depict the white people as the clear, dominant, and only ones who have any prejudices against race. Guess Whose Coming to dinner illustrates an inconvenient truth that this is not the case. John's father, a black man, is just as if not more unwelcoming, objective, and angered with his sons desire to marry the opposite race. In fact the white father is willing to think about the idea and holds an open mind whereas the black father does not even consider it when told. He immediately voices his disapproval. The film exhibits the fact the division among races is a two- way street in America. There is not only white people that do not like black people but also black people who are intolerable of white people. Nowadays this truth is entirely disregarded in films regarding race. The significance of this being that the film paints a picture of what real racism in America consists of, it is more than just one against the other but instead a select number of both sides refusing to tolerate each other.",

At the time it held no particular meaning for me, after all I was only 10 years old and had no concept yet about the topic of racism. To me people were just people and skin color meant little. Watching it now and remembering various items through the history of our country I can see where at the time it would have been highly controversial. What I didn't realize until now was just how funny the movie is as well.The story revolves around a young couple, Joey Drayton (Katherine Houghton) and John Prentice (Sidney Poitier), who have met in Hawaii and immediately fallen in love. The only issue is the fact that Joey is white and John black. While that might seem normal today in 1967 it was still controversial. The thing is Joey thinks that her parents will have no problem with this.What she discovers is that her parents while tending to be liberal are what has been termed \"limousine liberals\". That is to say they are well off, preach one thing and then do the opposite. The shock on their faces as each finds out is both interesting and hilarious. Joey's mother Christina (Katherine Hepburn) is perplexed at first but seeing how filled with joy her daughter is soon accepts her choice.Joey's father Matt (Spencer Tracy) is another matter. Matt has supported causes all his life as the publisher of the newspaper The Guardian. Now that one of these causes has arrived on his doorstep he's not quite as embracing. He knows the uphill battles the two will experience when exposed to public scrutiny. His reasons are not bigoted at all when looked at but more one of concern. Or are they? This is something that he must wrestle with on his own terms, confronting the possibility that he does harbor some sense of racist attitude.Not only are Joey's parents faced with this in the most sudden manner but their acceptance is put on fast forward. John, a world renowned doctor, is on his way to Geneva to work with the World Health Organization. They only have that night with them and John tells Matt in private that without his blessing there will be no marriage. All weighs on Matt's shoulders now.If this weren't enough another fly is tossed into the ointment. While talking to his mother and father on the phone Joey interrupts and invites them to dinner at her parent's house that night. What she doesn't know is that John hasn't told his parents about her yet either and he's not expecting them to be as accepting as hers are which is strained at best.There is plenty of support around the main theme here to provide plenty of both laughs and insight. Isabell Sanford as the Drayton's housekeeper offers her own opinions asked or not throughout the film and sees it as something wrong. Cecil Kellaway as longtime family friend and golf partner for Matt Monsignor Ryan also weighs in from time to time. Each of the characters brings to the table a different perspective to the situation.What was once thought of as a problem now seems common place. So when watching this film you have to place yourself in the mindset of what was going on back then. It shows how far we've come in 50 years. And at the same time with the number of racial issues coming to light in recent years it shows how we still have far to go. Perhaps not as far as in 1967, but there is still room to grow.What surprised me most while watching the film was that they've taken a hot topic for the time and made it one of the funniest things I've watched in some time. The theme itself isn't funny but the reactions of all involved create some of the funniest moments ever put on film.One special note on the film is that it was Tracy's last. During production he was seriously ill and many takes were done in short spurts in an effort to help him. He gives a tremendous performance here with a final speech that is filled with insight and affection from his character for his daughter. Both Hepburn and director Stanley Kramer put up their salaries in escrow until he completed his scenes to since the insurance company on the film had such a high premium on him. He completed his last scene on May 24, 1967 and died 17 days later on June 10th. He received a posthumous Oscar nomination for best actor that year and actually won for best actor at BAFTA.Twilight Time has done a great job with this one as they always do. Not only are we presented with a clean looking print there are plenty of extras on hand as well. Those include an isolated score track, audio commentary by Karen Kramer, Steven Spielberg, Tom Brokaw and Quincy Jones, A LOVE STORY FOR TODAY featurette, A SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE featurette, STANLEY KRAMER: A MAN'S SEARCH FOR TRUTH featurette, Stanley Kramer accepting the Irving Thalberg Award, the 2007 Producers Guild Stanley Kramer presentation to An Inconvenient Truth and the original theatrical trailer.As with all Twilight Time releases this one was pressed with only 3,000 copies available. This is a movie that should be on every film fan's shelf so pick up one immediately if you can.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of the classic 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad world'. So when I started watching 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' directed by the man who gave us the above comedy classic, Stanley Kramer, and featuring Spencer Tracy I expected a full length comedy. Astonishingly it is a serious drama, with a lighter tone. The film showcases the dilemma of a family whose daughter arrives announced with a 'Colored' man and tells them that she plans to marry him. This starts a set of troubling questions to all involved, except the girl. The father worries about the inter-racial marriage and the consequent problems; the mother is worried about her husband disapproving of their daughter's choice and making their daughter unhappy; the man in question, beautifully played by Sidney Poitier, decides not to marry his love if her parents disapprove of this match; His father worries about his son getting into a whole lot of trouble marrying a 'White' girl. So they all debate, discuss, convince each other over a period of a day up until Dinner, when it all ends well.The strength of the movie is not to overdramatize the sensitive issue of the 'race difference'. Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier bring life to the movie with their performances. Sidney Poitier delivers a powerhouse performance in the scene where he confronts his father in the study room and Spencer Tracy takes all the applause in the final scene. Stanley Kramer excels in handling such a sensitive issue with finesse. This is one classic which is a 'must watch'.",

I felt it could get a little dull due dialogue being the driving force behind the plot and the entire movie was a shift from conversation to conversation but it really makes you wonder. Now, being 19 I wasn't alive during the time period in which the subject matter would've been complete taboo but this film is very thought provoking. When viewing this, think about the fact that interracial marriage in a good chunk of southern states was completely illegal! It wasn't until the latter half of '67 that we saw Loving v. Virgina allowing interracial marriage in these states so you can imagine the stir this movie caused. The film attacks stereotypes and racism using Sidney Poitier as a very well educated, well spoken African American doctor. This made it so the only real objection people could have to the union of John and Joanna would be that John was black. This film also serves as the final showing of the duo of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy and they provide their usual great performances. Ultimately the film gets a little boring due to the constant use of dialogue but even today it makes you wonder how your own family would react in this situation and this contributes to the longevity of the film.",

It is in my opinion, and experience, that this is true, and it was nice to see this portrayed in a film.

            "review_title": "A Noble Effort, and That's \"Noble\" with a Capital \"N\"",
            "content": "\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is the kind of liberal feel-good movie Hollywood frequently specializes in, and it's easy enough to like even if one would like to choke on its aura of self congratulation.Director Stanley Kramer had a very tough time making liberal-minded movies without making them preachy, and that's his problem here. The screenplay consists of numerous carefully-crafted speeches practically designed to remind everyone at every moment of what a noble enterprise this film is, and it's hard to ever warm to the characters or the drama when everything remains so schematic. This is the rare movie that feels like it would be more at home on the stage even though it was originally written for the screen.The cast pulls this movie through any rough patches, though. Spencer Tracy and Roy Glenn stand out the most, as two fathers, one white and one black, whose children want to get married. Sidney Poitier plays the black son, saddled with the kind of righteous black man role he could never seem to escape. Of course, just to make sure we all get the point, and agree that a black man can be good enough for a liberal WASP family, he has to be incredibly successful (he's a doctor), educated and articulate, making you wonder why he wants to marry Tracy's dingbat daughter in the first place. Katharine Hepburn plays the mom of said daughter, and though she's in the movie a lot, she doesn't really do much but stand around, and this is one of the only Katharine Hepburn movies I can remember coming away from without even really remembering Katharine Hepburn. Beah Richards, as Poitier's gentle mother, gets a couple of sweet, nice moments. Really, she and Tracy feel like the only two characters who aren't ram rodded into the storyline just to make a point.This is a harmless movie, and at the time of its release a quite daring one, but it's message about race relations seems so quaint now as to be nearly irrelevant.Grade: B",

You can sense it was such a timely film that captured the zeitgeist at the time (late 60s civil rights movement, Martin Luther King etc) and the conversations that were being had at the dinner tables about the changing perspectives in America towards black people and interracial relationships. Despite the difficult topic the film handed it with such nuance and maturity while also maintaining a lightness and humour which makes the film enjoyable as well as intellectually stimulating. What's interesting in 2022 is how the conversation is not too far away from where it is at today so it still feels extremely relevant. A masterfully crafted film that handled an extremely difficult topic so well. I can imagine so many people, particular of the older generation, in the cinemas at the time really having their beliefs and perspectives uprooted by the way this film delivers and tackles the conversation. Sidney Poitier is a big part of what makes this film so successful (as well as the other actors - Spencer Tracy, Katherin Hepburn etc), because he maintains such a charm and humour and playfulness throughout the entire film. He is not bitter nor attempts to be the victim, he represents dignity not victimhood.",

The brilliant trio showed greatness through their portrayal of characters interpreting where everyone has their own opinion and perspective. The decision left to Tracy to make is not an easy choice, and in the end he gives a speech for all of us, not just for the characters in the film, something similar we've already seen from him in Judgment at Nuremberg.

No. It was more a matter of the age gap between doctor John Prentice and rich girl Joanna Drayton that made me have serious reservations about whether, or not, this union between these 2 would be a blissful, long-lasting success, in the long run.With John being 37 (and Joanna, 23), I'd say that this guy was, pretty much, robbing the cradle, so to speak. And it didn't help the situation much that Joanna, a flighty and flaky brat, struck me as being the kind of girl who did most everything on a whim (including considering marriage to a black man who was almost old enough to be her father).This film also lost itself some significant points on account of the Drayton's irritable, loud-mouthed, black maid, Tillie. Not only was she portrayed as being some sort of a modern-day Aunt Jemima, but, she was the only one to use the forbidden \"n-word\". And it was spat out in anger in a deliberate attempt to insult black-man, John Prentice, who was there as a guest.To say that this film's premise of heated squabbles over interracial etiquette got real stale, real fast, would truly be an understatement.And, speaking about the likes of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn - This would be their 9th film together, and, if you ask me, I thought that the rapport and chemistry between these 2 Hollywood legends was downright awful, for the most part.And, finally - It really shocked me to find out that for her irritating, watery-eyed, clipped-speech portrayal of Christina Drayton, Katharine Hepburn actually won an Oscar for \"Best Actress\".",

A white woman bringing a black man home for dinner with the parents, it's rather laughable. But what holds up about \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", how it remains serious is how deep it goes into its subject matter. About more than just prejudice and racism, this story dives into concepts like liberalism and romanticism, about letting go of the old for the new, without getting too far ahead of itself.And all that narrative depth is backed up by some great performances. Sidney Poltier is compelling and relatable as Dr. John Prentice. Every time his wife-to-be Joanna pushes their relationship just a little farther, his worry is clear, not about going through with it, but about ensuring everyone's approval. Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn as the parents are fantastic to watch; Hepburn is amazing with her expressions, portraying her emotions with subtlety and allure. Meanwhile, Tracey gives a heartfelt performance, serving as the most conflicted character throughout the story.The movie isn't too serious though; it has enough a sense of humor that it's never boring or melodramatic. There is a point near the end where it gets somewhat heavy-handed with the points and themes, but it feels deserved and it's still enjoyable to watch. Aside from a couple parts that felt unnecessary, and a situation that pushes on the surreal at points, this is an exceptional movie.

However, it's not really bad. I like the way the actors portrayed the characters, the settings of the film, and the closing statement by Matt Drayton. The closing statement of the film was interesting and inspirational. I have to give a lot of credit to Spencer Tracy, the man who was Matt Drayton.

The title is also witty, and a bit humorous. I think that this is a great example of the New Age of Hollywood. The director is using the film to get a point across. He artfully crafts the movie around a big social message, one that is extremely relevant during 1967. The inner conflict between white and black in America was absolutely huge, and I think that as a film maker, you have a voice that is way greater than that of any political leader. As a film maker, you have an unmatchable influence on the masses. In the case of this movie, I believe that the director does an absolutely wonderful job in stating his social message",

Someone who fights for the spirit of mankind, for truth, and it comes out of his every pore.All the tears were real, on both sides of the screen.Tracy took professional pride in getting through the monologue without fluffing a single word.

That some people were outraged and disgusted while other's where impressed and celebrated the film in hopes of changing some persons views.

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is not a well directed movie, and had a cast that shouldn't of even taken a second look at the script before signing on. Then again I shant fault the actors too much, as they (with some notable exceptions) are the only possibly redeemable aspect of the movie. What makes it often unbearable is that beneath its ham-fisted \"message\"- yes, we get it, interracial marriage, not a bad thing, fine, don't beat us over the head with a shovel anymore- is a premise that is just flat out incredulous. Maybe Stanley Kramer, the quintessential \"MESSAGE\" producer/director of his day who could be clever as a producer but barely ever as director, believed William Rose's script. Kramer neglected to see that the premise is truly unbelievable, as are many of the characters in a context that makes them seem dated EVEN FOR 1967! The essential problem, is the conditions of and the interaction/history of the two lead characters played by Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton. Potier plays a brilliant doctor who, as we're told, has gone through more training and schooling than most doctors get to by the time they're 45, let alone 37. The girl he falls in love with and decides to marry *over the course of 10 days* is practically a twit who decides to tell her parents (Tracy and Hepburn) about eloping and marriage plans on the first meet-and-greet at the parents home. THEN, without telling the future Mrs. Prentice, he tells the Drayton parents that it's up to them, over the single course of tonight's dinner, if they want him to be their daughter's husband.It's not about interracial marriage as the subject that is troubling about the film, albeit that is handled with a kind of solemnity and, dare I say it, boring attitude that I blame mostly on Kramer. It's about a basic romantic premise that doesn't hold a drop of water, and is even sexist to a fault while trying to promote racial tolerance (whether it's equality I can't say for certain). Had they been a longer term couple, maybe there would be more to see in the angle of the interracial marriage. Call me crazy, but it was something that I could not get by, and it kept holding up the characters' own internal logic.And did I mention Rose's clever little bits to try and make comparisons to how the characters act or feel? The trip with the Drayton's to the ice cream parlor, and Mr. Drayton's response to the 'new' ice cream, would be so laughable if it weren't meant to be taken dead-seriously (one hits a hand over the head in seeing the ineptitude). Or that supposedly soul-stirring speech Tracy gives in the last scene that goes against his logic earlier on (and don't say that 'well, he was a racist', since this is the movie's primary manipulation on the audience). And some scenes are just written with an agenda that, liberal, conservative, alien, is so obvious as to seem riddled with problems from page one; it's simply one of the biggest 'what-the-hell' moments of the Academy's history awarding it best original screenplay.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was not something I dreaded seeing, far from it. I heard the hype, I like the actors, and I was hoping that it could go hand-in-hand with the really amazing In the Heat of the Night as another great \"statement\" movie. Suffice to say, at least the actors tried a little. Poitier is charismatic, compelling, and in one scene with the character's father is close to dynamite (if, of course, never as good as in the Norman Jewison film). Tracy, in his last gasp of a performance, does what he can with dialog that suits him well. Hepburn and especially her niece Houghton, however, are often not very good at all, pouting or putting on less than one emotion for a scene that's required (Hepburn, like Tracy, also tries to give it some spark here and there, while Houghton pretty much got on the ticket probably as a favor from her aunt since, clearly, she is not a good actress).But, at the end of it all, it's overrated pablum that speaks to its core audience- guilty white liberals- while trying to reel in the country which, at the time, were adverse to the idea of black and whites marrying. And it's not that an interesting movie can't be made on the subject or something similar (even, yes, today when the subject seems to not be as much of an issue). What Kramer has fashioned, however, is a work with so much importance that the subject itself clouds the judgment of better film-making and storytelling and character development and all those things that make good movies. The 2005 Paul Haggis film Crash, which had more than its share of unbelievable contrivances and melodramatics on a \"heavy\" subject, looks masterful in comparison.",

Her parents played by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy are both people who have supported equality of races, but when they are faced with the reality of their daughter wanting to marry an African American their views get all mixed up. I think that Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were both fantastic in this film. The way they reacted during the movie was very real and not over the top. I think that this added to the movie because I think it showed really real and possibly actions that would actually happen.

He plays his character so classy and believable that it makes you wish you were the one marrying him. Another amazing actor in this movie is the person who played Joey's father. His reaction to Sidney and the many speeches he makes throughout this film are on par with Sidney's deliveries.

            "content": "Though I haven't questioned it in my lifetime (despite never even having a girlfriend), the thought of entering into an interracial marriage has crossed my mind, but never with the caution that soon-to-be newlyweds Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) and John Prentice (Sidney Poitier) have. When it came out in 1967, America was already primed for the worst. Farrakhan had predicted the \"revolution,\" Malcolm was gone and so was JFK, Bobby Kennedy and Martin were next in line to check out the following year, young black men were being drafted into the propagandized \"white man's war\" of Vietnam, and Black America was in dire need of positive leadership. But \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" takes a slightly more optimistic picture of the times by injecting a biracial romance into the fray. Over the years, it's come under fire for being \"too liberal\" and if the filmmakers really wanted to start serious discussions, Poitier's character could have been something more blue-collar like a construction worker or truck driver. I think what they miss is that black people were just starting to be portrayed in a more positive light in Hollywood circa '67 (with Poitier leading), so WE needed all the good press we could get. Being a sucker for romances, I could care less about the film's racial politics and subtext and just instead be moved by a great love story, and that's what I get here in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" As the film opens, John and Joanna have just arrived back in Joanna's hometown of San Francisco after some time getting sun in Hawaii. It was there she met the good doctor John Prentice and the two are talking marriage, but they first have to break the news to their respective parents, which is easier said than done. Joanna's parents, Matt and Christina (the belated real-life lovers Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn \u0096 Houghton is her niece), are both liberal about this sort of thing but still need to work around their underlying prejudices and be happy with Joanna's decision. With John's parents (played by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glenn, Sr.), it's going to be a little bit harder since they grew up with the in-your-face hell of hatred towards interracial couples. In the mix to watch the events unfold, are the Drayton's housekeeper Tillie (Isabel Sanford), who's highly suspicious of (what she thinks is the high-yellow) John, and family friend Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway). True there is a lot that dates Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and our society has grown more tolerant of interracial romances, but we have to remember when and where it's all coming from. Future entries into the genre would include Spike Lee's \"Jungle Fever\" (1991), \"Something New\" (2006) and even this film's remake \"Guess Who,\" which came out last year with a reversed agenda and no, I do not wish to see it. Directed by Stanley Kramer and written by William Rose, I cannot help but shower praise on \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" and Poitier's charming performance here amongst other acting legends, all of whom are white. Though it's billed as a comedy, it has qualities of a dramatic stage play with a tense undercurrent of social commentary. There's something genuinely moving about Tracy's closing monologue, the last great work of a truly great actor, who passed shortly after production ceased. He states the discrimination and outright hatred that John and Joanna are sure to face will mean squat, if their love and marriage are true, and nothing \u0096 nothing will stop it \u0096 and he's right. Lastly, if I could ever land a date with a lady of another skin tone, I might pop this in and maybe we could watch it together.10/10",

I like 'time capsule' films of the period, so I gave it a try.The scenery and settings are enjoyable, the soundtrack typical of the period. The acting of Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier was very good. So were his parents and Katherine Hepburn. The portrayal of the daughter was somewhat stereotypical of a liberal early-mid 1960s upper class bay area girl.Tillie (future 'Weezie' of 'The Jeffersons') gave a great performance both as an individual, but also as a member of any group who sees one of their peers move beyond what they were told they were allowed, as well as a genuine protectiveness toward 'Joey'.The most disturbing question of the film was briefly addressed by Spency Tracy's character - why present this as an all or nothing ultimatum that has to be settled in a day? The answer was given as 'we love each other, why wait?'. But if he really loved her, he would have given both sets of parents a little time to absorb something so important. This would be true even if they were the same race. Why force someone to accept or reject someone for life within the first hour of meeting them? I suppose it had to be done this way for the dramatic effect.By glossing over this very important question, the rest of the film become an axe grinding message for me. If you are for them right now, you're good, if you question it, you're a 'bigot'. Real life isn't that simple. Were they planning to 'play chicken' with everyone for the rest of their lives after they got married? How would that affect their children, vs choosing the timing of their battles a little more carefully? What a terrible message to send to anyone choosing that path in 1967.It was also disturbing to see someone who's presented as so perfect (Poitier) display such ingratitude, disrespect and rejection of his own father in such a self righteous manner, without any apparent judgment of Poitier from the filmmaker.There's not much to say about Tracy's closing, it was easy to see coming a mile away, and a relief to get it over with.",

From an entertainment standpoint, this is a great movie to just watch without really thinking about it. Because the second you do, it's obvious that there's some major flaws that are hard to overlook. They succeeded in making a film about interracial marriage, but left common sense at the door!First of all, Joey and John as a functioning couple? I think not (plus she's just so damn annoying, but that's an opinion). Secondly, race aside, who realistically gets married after only ten days? And third, I realize they're trying to make a point, but everything else about the story aside from the main conflict (which didn't cause that much conflict) was too perfect and unrealistic. I dislike that they felt the need to make John as important as possible, as if they were trying to \"overcompensate\". What if John had another, or less respected profession--what would have happened then? The couple is met with some parental opposition, but it's obvious right away that everything will iron out by the end. I would have liked to see some realistic opposition, characters, motives, anything realistic actually. These aside though, the film did convey its intended purpose, and got the audience to think in the right mindset about interracial marriage. Formally, it didn't feel like the camera and cinematography aided the story at all, which bothers me. They were mostly utilitarian; everything was so focused on the story. Decidedly late '60s feeling to the color, which was lovely.",

In reading the various reviews here one of the criticisms that is repeated is the fact that Sidney Poitier's character seems to be too good to be true. I think if Stanley Kramer is guilty of anything related to this character it is in trying to sell tickets. You have to understand that during that time period many non-blacks would expect, or should I say require, the character to be perfect. Ironically, some blacks were critical of the character having to be so perfect. In my opinion, the only heavy handed scene was when Katherine Hepburn fired her bigoted assistant. All of that aside, I thought the movie was excellent. The acting, obviously, was outstanding across the board. I wondered if it was a coincidence that Katherine Houghton's character sounded so much like her real life aunt Katharine Hepburn. And, as previously noted on several occasions, Spencer Tracy's speech in which he seemingly addressed his love, in real life, for Katherine Hepburn was ironic knowing he died shortly after filming was completed. And 1967 was a career year for Sidney Poitier. In addition to this movie he also starred in In The Heat Of The Night and To Sir, With Love.

            "content": "With three huge hits in 1967, Sidney Poitier claimed his reign as the biggest star in Hollywood, over Redford, over Newman, over McQueen. No actor took on such films with social consequence and won both scorn and admiration for it. Controversy loomed because white audiences loved him, and for some black moviegoers considered him an \"Uncle Tom\". But if only a handful of bigoted white people came out of seeing a Sidney Poitier movie seeing an actor and a man rather than a black actor or a black man, then he made just as much headway in the civil rights movement as the marches did.Coming out just as the supreme court legalized interracial marriage, thus tackles the subject head on. Perhaps its too polite, too upper middle class, too clean cut, but there it is, an attempt to tackle a topical subject, and it opened a conversation where the answers are completely all over the map today.The beautiful Katherine Houghton comes home with a surprise for her \"nice\" parents, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, decent people but stunned by the news. Actually, Hepburn is more open to the idea, as earthy and understanding as husband Tracy is old school. When Poitiers's parents arrive, the discussion comes to a head, and like Hepburn, Poitiers's soft spoken mother (Beah Richards) is more open to the idea than Poitiers's frightened father (Roy Glenn) who is old fashioned elegance and proud, but locked in old ideals.Isabel Sanford, as Tracy and Hepburn's housekeeper, represents the outsiders point of view from the black angle, while Virginia Christine is the uppity white person's point of view, deliciously told off by Hepburn. Grwsr moments in the script often make thus feel too \"plotted\" in every deal, with few awkward moments to represent the real life. But certain moments, such each of the major character's individual speeches (highlighted by Richards and Tracy's climactic viewpoints) are each brilliant in their own way. It's emotional to watch Hepburn and Tracy working together for the very last time, so being manipulated by the sentimentality can take over the soul while watching it. Still, as directed by the legendary Stanley Kramer, it comes out to be an important historical document on race relations, although in some aspects, it seems quite dated.",

A white person dating or marrying a black person is not shocking at all in today's society as it was thirty short years ago, and if the movie were to be made to today with the same script (updates here and there), it would be a pretty silly looking film.I do have a major problem with the movie though, and that is the script gives the Sidney Poitier no character flaws at all, he is the perfect gentleman with an education and is basically a good humanitarian. Nothing wrong with that, but I felt the script was yearning for my acceptance of this character by glorifying him as a saint, and not a human being. Wouldn't the script have been more challenging if Poitier was the manager of a shop and liked to kick back and relax every now and than? Why must he be this prestige doctor with credentials a mile long? I think a real challenge would have been to make him more relatable to people by making him simpler and not superman. Same thing goes to the Spencer Tracey and Katharine Hepburn characters, why are they living in a huge house and are so important? Couldn't they to have been written with a more simple tone so people could relate to them as people, and not just the situation? More people with modest incomes and simple lives will more likely watch the movie, since not everyone is a well to do citizen.But that aside the performances are extraordinary and the dominating theme that love conquers any challenges that arise out of life is inspirational. The love and commitment that exist between Poitier and Katharine Houghton is wonderful all the way through, they act like to kids in a candy store when they are onscreen together and I think that just binds their relationship tighter. I think it was wise to have them not threat over the life their children will face in the future was also a good step in the script, because two people in love are always ready to face anything head on. Katharine Hepburn is always glorious in her performances, and though she was not worthy of an Oscar win for this one (Anne Brancroft or Faye Dunaway should have been one of the winners that year), she still shines bright, especially since she is once again sharing the screen with her long time love, Spencer Tracey, in his final film performance.",

It has been riffed many times since even in a science fiction film such as Star Trek VI when the Klingons arrive to eat.The film has dated, the groovy dancing by the delivery boy and the housekeeper's daughter is laughable and the title song seems unsuited at times when it mingles with the film's score.Still director Stanley Kramer tackles the issue of forbidden love by casting Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn who had their own ongoing forbidden love affair spanning several decades.They play the wealthy liberal, open minded parents of Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) who arrives early from a Hawaiian holiday by bringing her new fianc\u00e9 after a whirlwind romance to introduce to her parents, John Prentice (Sidney Poitier) a widowed, black doctor.The issue is will they accept him and give the marriage their approval. The parents are flabbergasted and shocked. The local Catholic priest (a golfing buddy) drops in and is surprisingly more supportive of the union. Their black housekeeper thinks John Prentice is trying to get above his station.Tensions mount when John's working class family fly in for dinner with the Drayton and they get to hear the news of their son's engagement for the first time and they have concerns over an interracial marriage (still illegal in some states at that time.)The film at times can be clunky and John Prentice is just too good to be true. A top educated doctor working for the United Nations, although he has a rather testy scene with his retired postman father who counted the thousands of miles he walked in his working life so his son could have a good education and a better life.Maybe that is how the film had to present its subject matter at the time, a black doctor had to be better, more educated and nobler in order to be deemed by the audience to be suitable for this middle class white girl.",

The film deals with an \"elephant in the room\" situation where interracial marriage may seem frown upon to some but not others. Director Stanley Kramer does a fantastic job with this film and his ability to grab the audience in such a way is perfect. I felt that a few scenes did not seem to fit into the story and could have run smoother if left out but still a great film. Katherine Hepburn also does a great job and her character is priceless. The facial expressions Hepburn uses really makes the film fun. Great film and worth watching.",

The acting was excellent, the actors really sucked you into the plot and made you either love them, hate them, or just wanted to talk them out of decisions. They made the film very funny and also very emotional. Speaking of plot, it was a very thought out story line. It was good because it kept you wanting to keep watching to see what happened. It was very strong themed, too. It had such a cultural significance to how much trouble interracial couples have especially in this time period. On the other hand, though, it also showed that regardless of color, you should be with someone who loves you as much as you love them and everything else shouldn't matter. The camera-work was great, too, it didn't just stick to the couple, the camera moved with the other characters so you got to have multiple perspectives. A very good movie, overall.",

I had heard it was dated, boring, and slow from several different sources, but I decided to see it anyway, since it's such a classic. It turns out that it deserves its classic status, and it confirms the fact that Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were two very fine actors.This movie could have very well been very bad, given the subject's tendency to melodrama, but the actors create characters so real that the inherent melodrama comes across as real drama. They create moments that struck me as both touching and very true, and kept me engaged in the tightrope that is this movie's plot. There are times when my eyes began welling up with tears at the truth in some of the lines, because it was poignant; and there are others where I laughed at the truth in some of the lines, because it was ironic. Stanley Kramer created a movie that touches on many different issues, and it always feels like he's just this side of cheesy schmaltz, but somehow the movie succeeds anyway. You can tell Kramer and his actors are walking a fine line here, but they're always on the right side.I like this movie. Oh, it's not perfect. There are definite and obvious flaws, but the fact that it moved me and that I believed every moment of it outweighs those flaws.",

            "content": "This film was released in 1967, the year I graduated from college, and during the time when segregation was being addressed all across the country. I saw it quite a few years ago and had the opportunity to see it again recently. It was done very gingerly, and making sure to point out that the couple had not experimented yet with sex in their brief romantic relationship.The key characters are Sidney Poitier as 37-yr-old physician John Prentice. He had been married and had one child but both his wife and child were killed a few years back in an accident. The character was written with almost perfect qualities, educated at the best institutions and doing volunteer medicine in third-world setting. The girl was Katharine Houghton (incidentally Hepburn's niece) as 23-yr-old Joey. She and John met in Hawaii just 10 days earlier and fell in love quickly. He is on his way to Geneva and stopped off in San Francisco with Joey to meet her parents. Most of the movie takes place in the family home, a beautiful place with a nice view of San Francisco Bay. Dad is a wealthy newspaper man.Dad is Spencer Tracy as Matt Drayton and his wife is Katharine Hepburn as Christina Drayton. A key figure also is Cecil Kellaway as family friend Monsignor Ryan. Naturally the parents were surprised and shocked when their daughter brought home a black man, even though both parents were liberals and often spoke in favor of equal rights and the ending of racial discrimination. What this fictional story wants to show is how difficult it is to accept this kind of diversity when it hits home at your own doorstep.And, when the Prentice parents came over from Los Angeles to meet everyone they were equally shocked. The title of this movie actually refers to the black parents coming to dinner. So the movie plays out with just about every combination of two of the 7 people discussing the pros and cons of the issue, fully realizing that the two single people are adults and ultimately will make their own decisions. But it is always nice to have all family members on-board and happy.The movie also is careful to make this two-way, not just a white family accepting a black son-in-law, but also the difficulty of a black family accepting a white daughter-in-law.This is a classic movie, not everyone will enjoy it, but it has great actors and tells an important story.",

            "content": "The most appealing aspect of this film is its overt, shameless portrayal of an issue that was completely and utterly taboo at the time of its release...interracial marriage; however, the film itself is only moderately entertaining.Spencer Tracy's performance was very good, especially when considering the complexities of his character (a liberal journalist who finds himself resenting the fact that his own daughter plans to marry someone of another race), and there were a few other notable performances (I especially liked Monsignor Ryan, played by Cecil Kellaway). The writing was one of the stronger aspects of the film as well, mostly because of the utter straightforwardness about a topic that would make many Americans in 1967 cringe. By showing on screen the shock that each family member received when initially aware of the marriage allowed for an equally shocking effect on the audience, and the reactions seen on screen were probably similar to those of many Americans at the time (and, unfortunately today as well).By having the Prentice family over for dinner at the end, the families are forced to look beyond whatever prejudices they might have and interact with people that are virtually foreign to them. In this sense, the movie carries a great message with it...and this message is still very applicable to today's society.The biggest problem with this film was the believability of the issue. Due to Katharine Houghton's (Joey's) bubbly, overacted performance, it was impossible for me to believe that these two were actually as deeply in love as they said, especially when you consider the fact that they have only known each other for 2 weeks. In addition, I thought the \"forced\" nature of the necessity for approval from the parents was completely unrealistic. In essence, some of the major plot points and details are flawed, keeping a movie that could have been great just so-so. Nonetheless, it is worth watching at least once, especially if historic context of the film is considered.",

John has this little smirk on his face when he makes comments to her mother about their differences. This brings in comic relief to a somewhat serious and uncomfortable situation. Her mother is almost visibly shaking with anger. Mrs. Drayton's eyes are watered up as if she could not believe her eyes. Joey is somewhat naive and thinks that her parents will not have a negative reaction towards their inter-racial dating. It is funny how excited her parents are to meet a doctor. They were not expected him to be an African American. This shows stereo-typing in which everyone assumed a doctor to be a white man. John's family when talking to their son seems to be a lot more grounded on the topic although both families are upset. Chemistry and love can be shared amongst people of different races. That is what this couple show. Throughout the film her mother starts to smile at the idea that her daughter has fallen in love. Mrs. Drayton's body language and actions are much more warmed up to the idea as the film progresses. It may have taken her father longer but he does realize that their love is genuine despite their \"pigment problem\".

We see him start on a plane and land in San Francisco. What makes this film controversial is that John is African American and when he arrives in SF he meets up with his very recent girlfriend (Joey Drayton), who is white. The plan is that they want to get married right away. When Joey's parents discover it they are quite unready for their daughter to get married so quickly. Of course race is a factor, because at the time it would be breaking the social norms. But, the parents later agree and same for John's parents. The cinematography in the film is quite alright, but just about how I'd expect it to be in a film that basically takes place in a home. The lighting is very good always seems like it's changing especially throughout the day at the home. The editing is natural with no weird cuts or anything. The film ended on a great note showing what new cinema was going to be in the near future. Breaking away from the old generation's ideology and forming a new one. This film is a great example of that. All around I think a 7 is quite suitable for this film",

I felt a lot of the plot revolved around the unintentional racism, rather than the perceived threat from the public about an interracial marriage. the one great piece of irony about this film comes from a scene about the potential children, and how one might become the President of the United States. i will leave that research to you, but the irony was not lost on my end.

            "content": "After meeting in Hawaii Joey Drayton and Dr John Prentice fly back to San Francisco so that John can meet Joey's parents. Joey (a white woman) is nervous about introducing John (a black man who she intends to marry) to her white parents. In order to restore some balance, Joey invites John's parents to her parents for dinner, but John's parents believe that Joey is a black woman. John and Joey are deeply in love (despite only meeting 10 days prior) and must convince their respective and somewhat sceptical parents that they are right for each other despite being from different ethnic backgrounds...One thing that's refreshing about Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is the way that the story unfolds; it would have been very easy (particularly given the era the film was made) for this film to be a one-sided pro-white film which to be honest wouldn't have been particularly pleasant to watch nor would it have been particularly insightful. The film is much more balanced and although Joey's parents aren't totally sold on the idea of their daughter marrying a black man it seems to be more out of concern of how society will react to them being a married couple (the prejudice that they are likely to encounter day in and day out will be tough going for them) so indirectly this could be interpreted as parents looking out for their child's welfare.Another thing that is interesting about this film is that the black maid seems to more against the idea of John marrying a white woman than anyone else; I suspect that this is because she has been a servant to rich white folk for a long time and perhaps feels that black people are inferior to white people and cannot accept the idea of an articulate, educated black man being superior to her - that's just my thought anyway.Whilst I mostly enjoyed Guess Who's Coming To Dinner it has to be said that it is far from a perfect film; as I've already mentioned the concept is a little dated now (although sadly racism is still a problem across the world so it isn't entirely irrelevant even in 2021). The direction is sluggish and I found the film to be a little repetitive; it seemed to just go round in circles covering the same ground and only really stepped up a gear when John's parents arrive.Spencer Tracy's speech at the end was quite something though and it's hard not to be a little moved by it - even if it was a little jarring when you look at everything that preceded it. Still many films focusing on race that have followed this film have been heavy-handed, one-sided and preachy and thankfully Guess Who's Coming To Dinner for the most part doesn't fall into those traps which is impressive considering it was made in the 1960's. It's worth a look, but it's not a film whose praises I would sing from the rooftops - it's reputation is a tad flattering if you ask me.",

I think what makes the movie so interesting is that it is so normal in every way, that it speaks to the turmoil that ripples though the plot. The main characters, an interracial couple, are the epitome of a normal couple that is happy and in love, but chaos and confusion and upset is all around them in very much the same way. What makes it so interesting is that the plot and technical elements mirror each other.

            "content": "GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER might have been daring, in terms of 1967 mores, in tackling a 'taboo' (interracial marriages), but director Stanley Kramer, long a champion of social issues, actually made this film to give dying friend Spencer Tracy an on screen 'Last Hurrah', resulting in a script that was more a showcase for the actors than a truly honest examination of the issue (the leads are all brilliant and noble and 'too good to be true', thus making any question of whether Tracy would give his blessing to his daughter marrying doctor Sidney Poitier ridiculously easy to predict). That William Rose won an Oscar for his simplistic screenplay is NOT one of the Academy's finer moments, but in terms of performance, Spencer Tracy would prove, one last time, why he was America's finest film actor.The backstory of the film is fascinating; by 1960, Tracy's health had become so poor, after a lifetime of alcohol abuse, that studios were unwilling to hire him. Stanley Kramer stepped in, and courageously cast the actor in INHERIT THE WIND, JUDGMENT IN NUREMBERG, and, finally, in IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD. Sadly, Tracy's deteriorating condition was painfully obvious in the 1963 comedy, and he soon suffered a series of health setbacks that left him nearly bedridden. Katharine Hepburn put her own career on hold to nurse the ailing actor, with whom she'd had a relationship for over twenty years, and she watched as the enforced inactivity slowly killed him. Going to Kramer, the pair worked out a scheme to get Tracy back on his feet and acting again, knowing that while the effort might kill him, it would let him 'go out' in the manner he preferred. Kramer visited the ailing actor with the script for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, explaining how his part could be filmed with a minimum of risk to his health, with his beloved 'Kate' at his side, and her niece, Katharine Houghton, making her film debut...and that he had already cast Sidney Poitier, the greatest black actor in Hollywood, to co-star. He then visited Poitier, showed him the script, and told him he'd already gotten Tracy and Hepburn to commit to the project! The ruse worked, with both Tracy and Poitier agreeing to make the film.There was still a last hurtle to cross; no insurance company would underwrite a film with Tracy, because of his health. Kramer and Hepburn worked out an agreement, that both would sacrifice their salaries, if Tracy died during the production. The underwriters agreed to those terms, and filming began.It was a happy, if careful, 'shoot', with Tracy's biggest scenes, including the long 'testimonial' speech the film is best known for, shot first. At the completion of his last scene filmed (when he and Hepburn order ice cream, in their car), cast and crew gave the actor a standing ovation, and Tracy was visibly moved. He would pass away just days later, but Hepburn was right; he went out the way he wanted to, on film.Both Tracy and Hepburn were nominated for Oscars for the film; while his was certainly deserved, her role wasn't really that large or demanding. Yet on Oscar night, she won the statuette, which she graciously accepted as being for 'both' of them. A year later, she'd match Tracy's 'back-to-back' Oscar achievement, by winning for her brilliant performance as Eleanor, in THE LION IN WINTER.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is not a great movie, and it has not stood the test of time nearly as well as Tracy and Hepburn's other pairings. But as a last opportunity to see Spencer Tracy, it shouldn't be missed, and Stanley Kramer and Katharine Hepburn deserve praise for their courage in making this come to pass!",

My eyes were glued to the screen right from the start. I don't doubt that some of the dialogue and situations are dated but that isn't what matters. What is important is that the film has a way of making the viewer challenge their own thoughts about inter-racial marriage. I am from New Zealand and there is not such a big deal about inter-racial partnerships but since my arrival in the USA, I have learned about the history of the many races that call this country home. This film best represents a time when a nation was slowly awakening to a basic human right; that all races should be equal. At first, Katharine Houghton's Joanna seems naive and too perky but by the end of the film, I realised that that is her personality make-up and I feel that she isn't a light-weight, but adds a different perspective and balance to the other characters. One can see why Sidney Poitier's John Prentice has fallen for this bright, optimistic and determined lady. Beah Richards and Roy Glenn do a wonderful job of playing the worried parents of Sidney Poitier. Their statements about inter-racial love were delivered honestly and with integrity, not with the prejudice, I feel, that the American public of the time would have felt. Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey's portrayals of Joanna's parents' are fantastic. They are honest, torn, complex and handled with dignity. I am now most pleased that Katharine Hepburn won the Best Actress Academy Award for this performance. However, I truly believe that the film would not have been as successful if it wasn't for the focal character played by the intelligent, magnetic and graceful Sidney Poitier. Every word he spoke was filled with reason, fear, love and hope. The multiple facets of this character are portrayed with pure class. There were many times during the viewing of this film where I was genuinely on the verge of tears. This film is a thought-provoking catalyst for the equality of all human beings not only in America, but also in the world. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? is a universal beacon of hope for racial equality and cultural understanding.",

            "content": "Timely in 1967, and even more timely now. Just watched it again tonight, and am simply amazed at how relevant the overall message still is. Amazing, amazing cast. Sidney Poitier (so handsome) and Katherine Houghton (so beautiful) are absolutely tremendous as the two lovers. Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Roy Glenn and Beah Richards as their parents shine. Cecil Kellaway as Monsignor Ryan is pure delight, and\nso is Isabel Sanford as Tillie. Everyone is believable, the way they interact, the facial expressions --- so many pure, simple moments. I love this movie. Beah Richards and Spencer Tracy get me crying every time at the end of the movie...they both deliver very raw, emotional speeches...very powerful. Katherine Hepburn of course is just the perfect mother.....an electrifying, completely real performance.....her scene with Virginia Christine/Hilary at the house is simply one of my all-time favorites. All of the performances come off as 100% genuine, and there are many funny moments within all the drama.The writers were so smart to script/create the characters the way they did. Many people have said to me, \"Well, if they had made John Prentice a cook or dishwasher at a restaurant, it would have been a different story\". Yes, yes it would have. And that's exactly the reason why they created him as such --- he's the perfect man, everything from gorgeous, good-looks, down to his education and behavior. And same with Joey Drayton --- comes from a well-to-do family and is stunning and not a snob. Had they made either one different, it would have given the parents on either side to object, saying, \"Well, Joey, Mr. Prentice is just a dishwasher.... are you sure he's not just after your money?\", or \"John, Joey is from a middle-class family, are you sure you're not just hung up on her looks, and that she's not a gold-digger trying to hook her claws into any doctor that's available?\" By creating the two lovers the way the writers did --- John being an extremely successful, handsome doctor and Joey coming from a very well-established family -- there really is no other reason to object, unless you have an issue with the other's race, which both sides did. It made each of the parents have to self-examine themselves internally, to see why they felt the way that they did, as their son/daughter fell in love with truly the perfect person. The mothers on both sides knew the truth, and knew that true love would conquer all, and it did....happily so.But, this 59 year old white male found himself blubbering like a 10 year old girl at the end of the movie this time, more so than usual.....not just because it's beautifully made, not just because of it's message, but because I sat there, thinking, \"Wow, it's been almost 55 years since this was made, and it seems like our country has evolved backwards, not moved forward\"....and it's very, very disconcerting to say the least, and extremely sad and depressing. If you haven't seen this film, or it's been a while, do yourself a favor and watch it.....truly a valentine to the world from Stanley Kramer and everyone involved, with a very important message. Watching it again renews hope, so pass it on. Love prevails.",

I finally decided to see it.Besides the fact that I was embarrassed to be subjected to the scene with the delivery guy be-bopping and trying to represent the hipster generation, and besides the fact that it was a contrived situation to have a fabulously wealthy family whose happiness was never truly put to the test, I found myself quite moved by the powerful final performance of Spencer Tracy. His should have been the academy award performance of 1967. His emotion was real, and every word of his final speech was as relevant today as it was 38 years ago. And even though he was dying while making the film it was never apparent...his energy and conviction were genuine, and quite moving.Other performances ranged from excellent to possibly overdone, but maybe some of them were reflective of the times. Hepburn's performance was strong, as the academy also noticed that year. However, I think Poitier's performance might have been a bit overstated. Somehow, I've never completely bought into his performances...I think it's just the way he projects himself that makes him seem a little over the top to me. Nonetheless, he generally acquitted himself well and displayed no less than a passion and conviction for the material. The daughter (Hepburn's real-life niece) came off a bit too bubbly and energetic, I think, but she was acceptable. Isabel Sanford had a line that made me cringe...she actually states to Poitier's character her disdain for his attempting to marry ABOVE himself! That floored me that a member of her own race would make such a self-demeaning statement. Were attitudes really like that in '67? The scene with the idiot delivery guy should be excised from the film. It adds no comedy element, and only serves to frighten us into believing that once society must have thought that it was cool for kids to act this way.For the final speech alone, this movie gets a 7 out of 10 from me.",

I really enjoyed how much the film allowed you to sit with these ideas and hear it from all of the sides. It wasn't rushed, and it was more important to hear from these characters than to wow the audience with effects and plot twists. When we see that the contempt at the idea of an interracial marriage is not so one sided, we realize just how deep the institution of racism goes and the message of the film becomes even more essential. The shape of the movie reminded me a lot of The Birdcage(La Cage Aux Folles), though I wonder if that is mere coincidence given that it was a French play before it ever made it to The United States.Some of the acting was a little stale for my taste, but the message is strong and one that should continue to be discussed.",

It's easy to understand why hers are the words that open Tracy's mind.  When he says \"I'll be damned!\" -- what a wonderful moment!  The Academy thought so too.  She remains one of the few black actresses nominated for an Oscar.  (She should have been nominated for BELOVED as well, but alas.)In the end, though, this film will always be remembered as Hepburn & Tracy's last joint on-screen appearance.

The actors are amazing in their roles and it definitely was produced during a touchy time. Movies like this weren't widely spread in the 60's, especially in the south, so it really stands apart from others. Many refused to even watch it, but I think this movie definitely deserves a watch, especially during the times we are in right now.",

Films of this nature are supposed to help progress society into being more open-minded and force future generations to work in order to relate. It's truly unfortunate for everybody living, that modern audiences can watch Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and be capable of relating to it. I'm a big fan of single-setting films. Though Guess Who does venture off into a few other locations, a majority of it takes place at the home of the (Joey) Drayton's. This isolation puts the entire films focus on the relationship. Films of this nature don't rely on clever editing tricks or plot devices; it's all dialog and character development. I enjoyed the complex nature of each character's concerns and how despite the ending being predictable, I was very interested in seeing how each character would evolve by the film's end. It's fair to say the film's topic is prime for a remake with a more contemporary plot. (Ie: Gay Marriage / Gay Interracial marriage) though I'd be concerned it would receive the necessary attention to prevent it from being a cash grab and not a true attempt at social commentary.",

The setting definitely had a nice touch, the views and gardens of the home where most of the film took place was gorgeous. I also loved the fact that it taught a lesson, being if you as parents teach your child beliefs while growing up they carry on with them and you can't be surprised when they actually end up in a situation that you let them believe in.

No doubt it said things that American society needed to hear in the 1960s, but to a modern audience it sounds almost quaint. Tracy's speech at the end, for example, is not easy to sit through, but it's not just because of the rationalizations he goes through, it's just not a good scene. You might as well fast forward to this point if you want to know what the makers of the movie thought the message is supposed to be. The problem with this is that there are many layers and nuances in the first 90 minutes that are simply ignored in the final 20 (or so) minutes. The tidy package that Tracy's speech is supposed to wrap up doesn't, in fact, exist. It's as if the screenplay at this point is taken up years after the original was written and interpreted by the same people who came up with the adolescent documentaries of the 40s and 50s.The best performance comes from Beah Richards as Poitier's mother, who gives a nice speech about what love means. Poitier is good also as he tries to tread the line between a modest nice guy and a melancholy saint. I just wish this movie had lived up to his intensity and complexity.",

She acted like a air-headed the entire movie, and hardly was there chemistry between her and the male lead. The attempt at playfulness was like father-daughter. Now the mother, Katherine Hepburn who was expectedly shocked when her daughter brought me a black man (this is 1967). But all of that shock lasted but 5 minutes. After that the hollywood liberal became evident. Spencer Tracy was barely a tad more hesitant before giving in. Another thing wrong - this is the fault of infantile writers: the black man in question had to be Yale professor of medicine, and won honors internationally for his work in the WHO. A black man had to have these credentials to be palatable to white society ? What if he was only a sales executive ? No, he wouldnt have been good enough. The most interesting relationship was the dynamic between the black guest and the black maid.

            "content": "Imagine if you will the social climate in 1967 San Francisco. The Civil Rights act was in effect but society was still wavering on total acceptance of 'civil rights'. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner tested society in its acceptance of true 'civil rights'. Spencer Tracy (Matt Drayton) and Katharine Hepburn (Christina Drayton)were exceptional and convincing as a modern, liberal accepting couple. This is tested when their daughter Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) arrives home with her fianc\u00e9, Dr. John Prentice (Sidney Poitier). The Drayton's liberal beliefs are tested as their future son-in-law is a Negro (term used in film). Vital to the settings moral attitude of the 'church', Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Ryan) shows is uplifting support for the Joanna and John. Matt Drayton is not as supportive as his wife Christina. She sees the romance he only sees problems for their future. Then, when the Drayton's meet the Prentices the feelings are mutual. But nothing the parents say is going to stop Joanna as she is either oblivious or just doesn't care about any prejudices they may face. The ideas and social controversy of this film is unfortunately still evident in our modern society. The film also brought into play the long time controversial relationship between Hepburn and Tracy. In Tracy's final speech about relationships and what's important you could feel his emotion and can tell it came from his own heart and when he looks at Katharine she tears up. I could feel the emotion and love between them. The camera angles are detrimental in capturing the emotions and reactions in each scene of each character. When Christina is sitting out on the patio with Joanna and John the camera zooming in on her face focus' us on her reaction as well as pulling the viewer into her character. Another example where the camera angle was so important was at the end when Matt is walking on the patio thinking about his decision concerning Joanna and John's relationship. He stops under the tree, camera zooms in close on his face only, this draws you into his emotions at that very moment, and then he says, \"I'll be a son of a bitch\", turns around and goes into the living room and delivers this wonderful speech about relationships and love. Absolutely breathtaking! This was the last wonderful performance by Spencer Tracy and the last film by the great duo of Tracy and Hepburn. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a classic and a must see film for all.",

Released in 1967, the film portrayed the then controversial topic of interracial marriage. The film takes a liberal standpoint throughout and portrays Dr. John Prentice (the colored gentleman) as the ideal perfect man. Respectable, honorable and flawless, Sidney Poitier plays the character with such elegance and poise that any parent would want a partner like him for their child. Katharine Houghton (Katharine Hepburn's real life niece) plays Joanna Drayton, the lovely but naive interest to Dr. Prentice. The best performances however go to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn who play Joanna's parents. Both characters are complex and intriguing and the actors do a good job at portraying that even if it's just in facial expression. The writing is top notch and one of the movie's strongest points. Although it does not have the impact it had when first released, it can be seen why it's remained a classic over the years.",

Since I was only 4 when it was released, I had never seen it before, although I was familiar with the title and the overall premise which was considered controversial back then. So I decided to watch it. I figured a well known film with Sydney Poitier and Spencer Tracy trying to make a cultural point would be worth the time.But the believability failed on many levels. Spencer Tracy looked old enough to be the girl's grandfather rather than her father. All race issues aside, this couple wanted to get married and had known each other for less than 2 weeks. What was the point of the Monsignor Ryan character? He could have easily been written out without affecting the story at all.But the biggest problem is Hepburn. I'd think the real question on Prentice's parents mind wouldn't be, \"Why is my son marrying a white girl?\" Or, \"why is my son marrying a girl he just met?\" Or, \"Why is there a Monsignor in the script?\" Or even, \"Why is Weezie working here?\". The obvious question would be, \"What country is your mom from and exactly what accent is that?\".Back in the day, Sesame Street did a bit called, \"one of thee things is not like the other\". And while watching this film the question yells at you from the screen, \"What country is this lady from?\". Two American families, one with an American maid living in America... but Hepburn's fake accent throughout this film is like an eternal blaring cat pee stain on a hand woven rug. Bad enough her voice sounds like she sucked down a can of helium, but that accent is like finger nails on a chalk board. And, BTW, why does she keep shaking her head \"no\" all the time?",

I particularly liked this movie, despite many of the iffy things I have read about it. Sure, ten days of knowing each other and then jumping into marriage is slightly unrealistic, but it is not unheard of in our world.

Poitier never played a character more perfect than this, and usually, his characters are pretty perfect! He is a demi-God of all that is right with the world. A doctor who probably deserves the Noble Prize.Well, there are other things. But I won't sway too much on the negative. I did enjoy Spencer Tracy in this movie, and did find some moments funny. A film like this should be congratulated for putting an issue like this in our nation's conscience. Its just too bad it hasn't aged well.6/10",

As I believe all of us have been exposed to prejudice in one form or another this movie tackles a issue many parents have sometimes wondered about and sometimes faced, head on. What if my son/daughter wants to marry a white/black person. This movie addresses parents first reactions, second reactions and ultimate decisions when a black man wants the approval of his fianc\u00e9's white parents before getting married. Equally dismayed are his parents and in the space of 4 hours they need to come to a decision before the couple leaves for New York and then Switzerland. Love ultimately triumphs despite the prejudices the couple will face but you cannot help but cheering for them in the end and for the parents who were able to open their hearts to their future family. No surprise Sidney Poitier won an Oscar but be sure and have a box of tissues handy cause you'll need them.",

If only Hepburn had not insisted on putting her talentless niece in the pivotal role of the daughter it would have been a perfect movie. Her wooden and mannequin-like moves and performance and conversation put one in mind of a 22nd century android. No feeling, no emotion, but moves and talks. How strange she never got another role! For Poitier to act INTERESTED in her, let alone in love should have won him an academy award.

Spencer Tracy was also wonderful in this film. You could really see his character's internal struggle throughout the film. The entire message in the film about interracial couples was also wonderful especially considering when this film was made.

From the acting, directing, story line, and underlying message I can honestly say that that it was all impressive. Stanley Kramer made a bold move choosing to produce a movie that dealt with such controversial issues, but his risk was very worth taking. Civil rights were booming as African Americans were becoming to be seen as equal, well to majority, however they still dealt with everyday problems regardless of who they were or what they had accomplished in their life. Kramer did an excellent job illustrating that an African American man may be a prestigious person with an impressive background, but that is not going to stop anyone from judging him by his skin color. The love story is beautiful as well as it depicts two people falling in for each other for nothing else, and regardless of what any other person may say or feel they were confident in their love. Nothing is as remarkable as the ending though, as the two lovers are struggling with their parents approval Joey's father comes to the realization that is does not matter of John is black white yellow or purple, he Is the man her daughters loves and ultimately he wants her to be happy. Spencer Tracy's monologue at the end was breath taking as he speaks with such power and pure magnificence, not breaking character once as he brought real emotion to the movie and enforced the message that love knows no boundaries as it will conquer all in the end and it does not matter who it may be with because the true importance is finding love, that perfect soul mate, and not letting them go. I would absolutely recommend this movie as there is not one ounce of disappointment throughout this immaculate film.",

            "content": "This is the ultimate example of a film that should have been great but settled for safety, big box office, and mediocrity.  A pity.Consider the premise: It's the late sixties, a time of conflict, change and idealism.  A well-to-do San Francisco liberal couple find their commitment to their beliefs challenged and shaken to the very core by their daughter's sudden engagement to a black man.  There it is in a nutshell, and it's a beauty, rife with pitfalls.  It doesn't even hurt that the prospective bridegroom is a successful physician so that the girl's father (a judge) can't object that she's marrying beneath herself professionally.It's pretty much all downhill from there on.  Hollywood has to play it safe.Can't afford to offend the liberals out there in movieland.  Can't make them squirm in their seats in possible self-recognition as this couple are forced to reconcile their ideologies with an all-too-natural concern for their daughter's happiness.  The answer?  Cast Tracy and Hepburn!  Anyone who doubts for a moment how they're going to weather this situation or the conclusions they'll reach hasn't been paying attention.  And for the bridegroom?  Well let's play it safe all the way around and go with Sidney Poitier.  What the hey, George Wallace and Orval Faubus would probably pay him to marry their daughters!Sadly, Hollywood chose to portray itself as confronting a serious social issue rather than making a serious run at actually tackling the question head on.  To this day, 34 years later, I still wonder what elements Ivan Dixon (from \"Hogan's Heroes\"), say, would have brought to the Poitier role. And, just as a thought, how about Richard Widmark as the father?  The eventual outcome, I suspect, would not have been so predictable.And how about NOT ending the film with that smarmy \"The Story of Love\" playing endlessly as they all go in to dinner?  It's bad enough when a movie preaches, but when it preaches to the choir -- who already believe -- the result is . . .  a copout.",

            "content": "The film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a film with a theme that tackles the once frowned upon situation of bi-racial relationships, or moreover bi-racial marriage. Filmed in 1967, the director, Stanley Kramer, dared to touch on these issues during a very controversial period surrounding race and civil rights. One way he was able to take on the subject with phenomenal results was to involve some of the greatest actors of all time, Spencer Tracy as Matt Drayton, Katharine Hepburn as Christina Drayton and Sidney Poitier as Dr. John Wade Prentice.The story takes place over a 12 hour period and begins with Dr. Prentice, an older African American research physician, and Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton), the daughter of a liberal newspaper owner and an open minded art gallery owner, arriving by plane from Hawaii where they had met just 10 days prior. It is apparent from the onset, or at least the cab ride, that they are involved in a relationship much more than mere friendship. Their plan is actually to marry within the next month, but first they want the approval of Joey's parents before the doctor's plane takes off that evening.During the next 10 hours, many reluctant characters are introduced including Tillie, played by Isabel Sanford, the maid that practically raised Joey. This helped to show the resistance on both sides of the racial divide, and gave clear objectivity to the point that it was not just a parental objection, but one not embraced by blacks or whites as groups. After Dr. Prentice's parents are also brought into the film, it is appears that the families are split on giving their blessing; men against women.One interesting point in the film that the director used ironically was a scene where Matt and Christina get ice cream so that Matt can have a \"cooling off\" period to collect his thoughts. Matt orders a flavor that he thought he knew, and after he tastes it he realizes he had not had the flavor before. After a few tastes and some complaining, he realizes that he really likes the new flavor and wants to remember it for the next time he comes in for ice cream. This scene appears to use the ice cream ironically as a reference to Matt's feelings toward Dr. Prentice. He thought he knew how he felt about race, he was open and liberal, yet when faced with it being presented in his own family his experience turns out to be somewhat bitter. However, after he finds out more about the prominent doctor, he cannot help but like him.The lighting and sound effects used in this film give the soft sense of a light romantic comedy while keeping the controversial plot intact. The story, although often a touchy subject matter, is kept to minimal offense by light hearted music, elegant and friendly atmosphere filled with educated characters easily portrayed with slight comedic relief.This influential and daring film proves to be a great entertainment experience that touches on a once sensitive subject and still has some relevance today. This is apparent in the sparingly re-made version some 40+ years later in 2005's \"Guess Who\". However, this adaptation has an obvious spin that shows just how far things have come by sticking with a situation of interracial relationships, but reversing the roles where a black family has to accept a white man as their daughter's choice in a spouse.Well made film for it's time.",

One user commented that the movie doesn't sell out. I beg to differ.The movie is pure, total sell-out. It's a watered down fanciful tale where \"love will conquer everything.\" Generally speaking, I did not strongly dislike the film. There are some solid performances, particularly by the big three of Hepburn, Tracy and Poitier. At times it was funny. And one can not deny that it was fairly bold for its time. But taken in total, the film fails to truly deliver on what it promises.First and foremost, the movie is not about race. The film has about as much to do with race as The Cosby Show. Race is simply a stand-in for \"differences.\" The filmmakers \"sold out\" when making this film when they decided to make Poitier an affluent world-class doctor and when they portrayed his fiancee's parents as San Francisco liberals. Any cultural or class differences between the races are whittled down to the point that there is little differentiating Poitier and his fiancee. What the movie ends up representing is the absolute best-case scenario for interracial relationships.Another detracting aspect of the film is the predictable characterizations of the parents. The father figures, the \"reasonable\" ones, seek to stop the marriage from going through because they feel that their children would have \"special problems.\" The mothers, the \"emotional\" ones, want the marriage to go through because it's clear how happy and in love the couple is. In this manner the parents are pigeonholed into predictable gender-safe stereotypes with nary any complexity and without any true insight whatsoever into the notions of race and differences.All in all, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner disappoints because instead of an engaging discussion about race and the differing views on blacks coupling with whites, we are left with a \"love can conquer all\" message with little relevance to the issue at hand. Whereas other films since 1967 have engaged the true realities and complexities of interracial dating (most notably Spike Lee's far superior Jungle Fever), Poitier drifts through the screenplay aware that he is a \"Negro,\" but seemingly only in name and appearance. The film is spoon-fed harmless morality which is all talk and little substance. The only character who is even aware of the differences between the races and chooses to challenge their relationship on those grounds is one of the more annoying characters, the fiancee's maid. She at least attempts to face up to what the real issue is instead of dancing around it during the whole movie. Her views are scripted to be watered-down, uneducated and condemnable, which in all fairness they are. But at least she raises the issue.I ended up rating this movie a six. It's decent entertainment, despite its one-dimensional characterizations (Hepburn aside) and lack of true social force. But it's definitely not anything I'd put in the top 100 films of all time.",

They've grown up being more accepting than others, but were not exposed to the issue they supposedly supported.I didn't understand the black family's side too much, however. Maybe it's because I'm white, but even when they showed their perspective I was still feeling a little off about it. It dealt a lot with how blacks detested themselves and their skin color based on cultural and social opinion, which is still prevalent today and I completely understand why they feel that way (for instance: the father when being reprimanded by his son). However, I felt like we could have still gotten more out of the black family if they explained more as to why marrying a white person would be considered taboo. We all know why white families feel that way about blacks, but do blacks feel the same towards whites? Do they just hate them based on generational cruelty and hatred? Or a combination of the above? I feel so ignorant asking those questions, but I still struggle understanding since I am indeed a privileged white person and wish to treat everyone with respect.

            "content": "\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a drama/romance film that was released in1967. This film carried a strong cast, including Katharine Hepburn as Christina Drayton, Sidney Poitier as John Prentice, Katharine Houghton as Joey Drayton, and Spencer Tracy as Matt Drayton. This was the last film that Spencer Tracy made. Stanley Kramer served as director and producer along with George Glass, the screenplay was written by William Rose, and the film was edited by Robert C. Jones. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars, and won two for Best actress in a leading role, and for best written screenplay.The plot: While on vacation in Hawaii Joey Drayton meets, and falls in love with John Prentice. John is an Africa American doctor who is at the top of his field. Joey Drayton is a white female whose liberal father (Tracy) owns a newspaper company in San Francisco. The couple fell for each other so quickly and strongly that they decide to get married. Following the engagement Joey brings John to her parent's house for dinner, and to deliver the news of the engagement. This is when the drama begins.This film's theme challenges the social taboo of interracial marriages. During production, it was illegal for people of different races to get married in fourteen states. While not as relevant today, it was a controversial issue in the 1960's. Joey has brought John home, and with each person she introduces him to, we see how people react to the engagement, some bad and some good. The film represents how some people are stuck in the past, how some people envision a better future, and how some people are flat out racist. The film takes a beautiful twist, when a \"love conquers all\" theme becomes present. It reminds us of when we first fell in love with our spouses, how we started out with nothing, faced adversity, stuck together through the hard times, and finished with a love that was just as strong as it was in the beginning.\"Father you see yourself as a colored man, and I see myself as a man\", is one of the most powerful quotes from the film. John is confronted by his father on why he is marrying a white girl. His father believes in the ways of the past, that each race should stay within its own race. However John visions a better future. He knows that acting in the ways of the past will do no good towards the struggle for equality in the future.This film received a loose remake in 2005 with \"Guess Who\". This film featured Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana. In this film the roles were switched, with Zoe Saldana an African American bringing home her white boyfriend Ashton Kutcher. With the racial theme not as relevant as it was in the 1960s, the film took a comical spin, and lost it's since of drama.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The acting was superb. It has inspired me to watch more films my Sidney Poitier, such as \"In the Heat of the Night\" and by Spencer Tracy, such as \"Captain Courageous\". The film did not include and violence, sex or special effects, but still kept my attention from beginning to end. The language was mild, so I was able to watch it with my kids. However the subject matter is over their heads. For those planning on watching this film, and believe that this film is outdated, think about this. Think of the movement for gay rights. Think of the states that allow and do not allow same sex marriage. For those who want to know more history on the interracial marriage issue, look into Loving v. Virginia.",

But this film is so in love with the human race, one cannot but reciprocate. Whichever way you look at it, it is perfection. No, reality it isn't, but that's not what films are supposed to be. Champaign isn't reality either. All films are and should be highly artificial. Film is an art, preferably in search of beauty and wisdom. This film is both a love story and a riveting thriller. You know the outcome, but you want to know how the plot will be worked. And how beautifully and with what dignity it is worked out. It's the kind of rare film one wants to see twice in a row. The inspired writing inspires the performers. What more do we want from a movie? Not every film should overflow with realism. Give me cotton candy once in a while.

However, it is refreshing to see someone make a statement about such a controversy. In my opinion, it should not even be a controversy but sadly it is, inter-racial marriages even today are not always welcomed with open arms. So I was really happy to see a film that broke those boundaries and wasn't afraid to make a statement. I really loved the part where John says that his father is viewing him as a black man, and John himself views him as just a man. I also loved that the Catholic priest supports their decision to get married. I'm sure that ruffled quite a few of the public's feathers. All in all I just felt that the film had a great message- love is love, and that is all the matters in the end.",

This movie really shows how two different families of different race almost clash together by the love of the two \"kids.\" I really liked this movie because it was able to show the acceptance of Joey and John's love for each despite their race and how their families are able to accept it. This movie, even though it came out in the '60s, is still relevant today because race still seems to be an issue among people.

Out of this come a handful of memorable scenes - another speech for Tracy as per usual (fairly touching given the circumstances; he's clearly not well in real life and just watch Hepburn's eyes), there's the amusing scene with the socks; there's the quiet authority and dignity of Sidney Poitier's character.  Hepburn's niece, Katharine Houghton, plays their daughter.  She's ok, but nothing special.  Did this film deserve to be an Oscar-winner for Hepburn? Probably not, except for sentiment's sake.

Hepburn does not have to act, those tears are real because shortly after filming Tracy died. They all knew he was dying. He was sick during filming. As the characters sit down to eat dinner and we see a shot of Tracy sitting down with his back to us I realize just how much I miss him. I usually never cry during a movie but when you see someone achieve a perfect acting performance and know it's his last moment on screen you cannot help but cry. Tracy remains one of acting's best. He reminds me of my Dad, with a tough outside but loving and compassionate inside. Katherine Hepburn obviously loved him as much as he loved her. She outlived Tracy for many years.

In terms of how its made, there's nothing that really stands out about it (maybe the scenes when Tracy and Hepburn go for ice cream). When i think of New Hollywood my mind instantly travels to the creative new styles of people like Scorsese, Coppola, and Polanski. This film just felt like an Old Hollywood movie with a New Hollywood story. That's not a bad thing, though, as the movie seems to be pushing some buttons that older movies wouldn't dare touch.

The scenes of San Francisco (even if largely the product of a movie set) are nice. Hepburn and Tracy still show some chemistry.In usual Hollywood fashion, their take is essentially one of stereotypes. They do their best to portray Poitier as an accomplished doctor, while still giving him the \"angry black man\" persona that they thought was necessary to make the film relevant. His love interest, Katherine Houghton, is very hard to stomach. If Poitier's character is really so accomplished, it's hard to imagine what he sees in that spastic ditz! Nevertheless, we're able to somewhat plausibly believe that he is taken with her energy and optimistic (if naive) attitude.The plot is similarly contrived and unrealistic. The drama is given high energy because almost ridiculous circumstances make a decision by both sets of parents necessary within a few hours. Most parents would be much more uneasy with that virtual ultimatum, than with the issue of race. Nevertheless, we swallow it because it allows the unfolding of dramatic speeches. Tracy gives a winner at the end. Once again Poitier's angry discussion with his father, though dramatic, rings a little false. We might believe that, despite his apparent success, he would have resentment towards white society, but why, exactly, is he so mad at his father? We'll never really know, and the movie makers didn't really know either. It was really artifice for the sake of drama.Despite my misgivings about this picture, it has a warmth to it. The dialogue is intelligent. The lighting is flattering to all. Knowing that it was Tracy's last picture gives it a poignancy that the producers could never have imagined. We have no doubt that Hepburn's tears during the final speech were real. Despite the implausibility of much of the plot, this one's a good period piece, and an overall winner in my book.",

Although Dr. Prentice is a highly respected man because of his work through the medical field and an all around great guy, Joey's parents have objections as why these two should not marry \u2013 Dr. John Prentice is a black man, and Joey Drayton is a white woman.Joey Drayton grew up in San Francisco with her liberal parents, Matt (Spencer Tracy) and Christina (Katharine Hepburn). Although they loathe the idea of racism and made it a point for everyone to know this, they never suspected their daughter would fall in love with a colored man. Although her mother is shocked, but supportive from the very beginning, Joey's father does not come around so quickly. While a dinner was being planned for the four of them that evening, Joey invites Dr. Prentice's parents to come along, who fly 400 miles to meet their son's new fianc\u00e9, all the while thinking she is a colored woman, as well. Once they arrive and find out that Joey is a white woman, the two were in complete shock. After some persuasion, Dr. Prentice's mother, much like Joey's mom, supports the idea of her son remarrying, no matter the situation. His father, on the other hand, seems to have the same idea as Matt Drayton. Dr. Prentice makes it clear to Matt and Christina that he will not marry their daughter if they object to the idea; Christina thinks Matt is going to inform Dr. Prentice after dinner that he objects, but in the end Matt changes his mind and gives the couple his blessing.I believe the angles and lighting were just right for this movie. There were close-ups throughout the movie made it very intimate which held true to the theme of the movie. The lighting made the movie feel a little more cheerful, as well.The theme of this movie would be \"Love Conquers All.\" The parents overcome their feelings toward their children's marrying, because they know they are happy together and are in love.

As someone who is a religious conservative, let me dispel at once the theory that all conservatives would be opposed to interracial marriage.I like movies that tackle moral issues including prejudice and racism and was eager to see a subject like interracial marriage tackled in a movie with such prestigious actors, but \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" left me thoroughly disappointed.The premise of this movie is excellent and the cast is good except for Katharine Houghton (more on her later), but the movie beats you over the head with a lesson that is mostly just preaching to the choir. It  talks down to it's audience and doesn't really bring you along to see the subtle forms of prejudice in the way \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" does and it lacks the down to earth characters of \"To Sir with Love\". Unlike \"To Sir with Love\", race is so central that there's little room for anything else.The worst part of the whole production is a tie between the extremely wooden Katharine Houghton (it must have helped to be Hepburn's niece) and the abominable lines she was given to speak. This might not be an exact quote, but in one scene Houghton speaks, in her overly peppy voice, a line like,\"But mother, why would daddy be upset just because I'm marrying a negro?\"In all she must have said the word \"negro\" about two dozen times (or at least it seemed like it). It was just too hard to believe that Portier's character (a handsome well-spoken internationally famous doctor) would even be interested in this simple child.The last scene features a sentimental speech delivered by Tracy's character in the direction of Hepburn's character. The heart-string plucking undercurrent is that these sentiments are those of Tracy himself toward Hepburn. How romantic? I wonder if Mrs. Tracy's heart-strings were plucked by this tender scene.All in all, it failed even though I was really hoping it would succeed. It left me with the impression that I had to become a liberal in order to be on the right side of this issue.",

Over all, I enjoyed it for entertainment and for an interesting look into the society in which we still live in, although a few minor adjustments have been made over time.

As such, it's painful to watch the characters' superficial angst. Don't misunderstand: I've always liked this movie. It's just that lines that avow there would be no real marriage without children bother me, especially when only 30 years hence, many women will discover that bearing children won't be so easy; that 10 years hence, women supporting their husbands' career won't be considered good enough for Gloria, Bella, and their ilk; that a couple of years after this movie came out, women were expected to make their own individual mark and forget about any teamwork involved in making a difference with whomever. This perspective can be painful for those of us who did not achieve mainstream \"success.\" And certain fundamental beliefs of this movie--e.g., kids should expect their parents to be loving and supportive and provide them with every advantage--may not be realistic.

The film is well-written, competently directed, and boasts incredible performances from its cast. Katharine Hepburn steals the show as a worried mother named Cristina Drayton who becomes quite concerned when her daughter, Joanna, brings home an African American fianc\u00e9. Sidney Poiter stars as Dr. John Prentice, Joanna's fianc\u00e9, and Spencer Tracy stars as Peter Drayton, Joanna's father.One very interesting thing about \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is its ability to show the controversial issue of interracial marriage from the perspectives of both African Americans and Caucasians. The conflict in the film is tightened when Joanna invites John's parents over to her house for dinner. The audience can tell a clash between the two races is imminent and that the collision of wills is going to occur during dinner at Joanna's. John's parents also express concern once they find out that their son's fianc\u00e9e is white. As with Joanna's father, John's father is the one with the most intense concern. John's mother feels as though her son should be able to marry whoever he so chooses.It is also interesting that the main issue in the film doesn't concern whether or not the parents are supportive of their children's happiness but that they are concerned about what other people will think and/or do to their children if the wedding occurs. Mr. Drayton doesn't make any comments about Joanna and John looking odd together. In fact, he has the highest regard for John and all of John's remarkable achievements in the medical field. Mr. Drayton's issue reflects the racial tension that was present in the 1960s. He feels as though both his daughter and John are at risk and that they could easily be killed as a result of their different pigmentations. Mr. Prentice feels the same way, as his concerns are voiced to John in a very intense scene near the end of the film.At the end of the film, though, Mr. Drayton comes to the conclusion that Joanna should marry John on the grounds that a love worth fighting for is a love worth starting. In a moving and beautiful speech, he tells everyone, including John's parents, that marriage is a constant fight and that without the bad times the good times are unable to be appreciated. He reflects on his own life and his marriage with Mrs. Drayton. This scene beings a certain life to the film's conclusion that sums up the racial tensions in the film. It seems as though love is able to exist between two races regardless of the color of one's skin. If one cannot fight for that which he or she most longs, then exactly what is the purpose of life? Life is a struggle, a constant battle that one wages against one's self and the world. Mr. Drayton accepts the fact that his daughter will be placed in harm's way and that she will be subjected to ridicule and harassment, but he realizes that love is worth such impediments.In summary: thought-provoking and well-acted film that is quite fantastic.",

Sidney Poitier gives a solid, though maybe a bit too aloof, performance. Katharine Hepburn is good but Spencer Tracy seems too formulaic in his actions. Katharine Houghton is irritating as the daughter.Still, it tells a story that had to be told, and came out when not everyone in the US had the same rights and freedoms.",

As a result, the movie is little more than long PSA or preachy after-school special with better actors. Since its intentions are good, it deserves some credit. The script almost undermines the message with its almost excruciating tip-toey-ness. The movie's politeness makes it dry and lifeless. Poitier, Tracy, Hepburn, and Sanford do their best to bring depth to their characters. The only sore thumb in the cast is Houghton, exuding an odd brand of ignorance that has never been investigated, on screen or off. This type of ignorance, excuse my cynicism, is often referred to as liberalism. Plus, Houghton and Poitier have zero chemistry. Spike Lee's \"Jungle Fever\" offers a more realistic and far more urban view of the subject. Like \"Dinner\" it has its flaws too, but both films should provide interesting perspectives when seen together.",

Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy give wonderfully believable performances in a film about fear of societal intolerance and overcoming racial prejudice. Some characters are pointedly rounded, which is centrally important to the film's plot, but some are terribly flat and that's just something you have to get over. The overall photography isn't all that noticeable, but makes up for it with this important subject material.I had some issues with it by the end. The entire story takes place in one day, mainly just a few hours in the evening; I can only explain the nagging issue I had with that the movie was\u0085 'less than action packed'. I understand that this film would by nature lack explosions and battle scenes, but it unfortunately caused me to lose interest almost completely about two thirds of the way through. One particular speech towards the end of the film is so dragged out that despite its importance I wished it to be over. Half the time they're just standing around, talking about what's happening, and I'm not the type of audience who appreciates watching multiple conversations that play out the exact same way. Call me crazy.I valued the film much more when it was over, and I could look back on it for its overall subject material, rather than how I felt whilst watching it. My point is, if you're going to see a film about fear of societal intolerance and overcoming racial prejudice, think about whether this one is the right one for you, because that could alter how much of an impression the social message leaves on you.",

The premise may seem dated but it's the evolving of the characters that makes this such a relevant piece.The script was impeccable, unbelievable monologues that will invoke passion in even the coldest hearts. And the acting was wonderful..with the exception of Katherine Houghton who must have done some dirty deeds to win her a title role next to the likes of Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier.

Regardless of what one thinks of this basic premise, the film is a ridiculously stacked deck, contriving a situation where they're hit with the news out of nowhere and have only a few hours to process it before the young couple fly off to a new life together, such that even the most trustingly open-minded parent might feel a little anxiety at the speed of things. Given the film's almost complete isolation from the real world, it's difficult to assess the veracity of the recurring claims about the problems that would confront an inter-racial marriage; it's clear enough though that the couple under examination here would move within circles far more elevated and monied and connected than those of the average love-struck transgressors. Perhaps it's telling that the element that now feels most biting and provocative is the secondary character of the housekeeper, Tillie, referred to in rote manner as a \"member of the family\" but plainly not that in any real sense; she has the most viscerally negative reaction to Prentice's arrival, her enmity apparently rooted in a subjugation so engrained that any sign of progress elsewhere feels like a personal attack. But she's hardly at the centre of the film, her ultimate function being to sit quietly through Tracy's climactic \"glory of love\" speech, and then to get the dinner served. It's all interesting enough on some level, even if for every aspect of relative awareness and enlightenment, the film provides another one of timidity or cluelessness.",

One of the other important aspects of this movie was the relationship between the characters, and how they pull along through the development, especially when it came to Hepburn.

I enjoyed Hepburn and Tracy more than usual. Normally Hepburn's accent really annoys me and seems out of place in movies where she was really popular with other viewers, like African Queen, but I was totally enthralled regarding this movie.I felt the realism of the attraction between Poitier's character (John) and the daughter Joey was well done and believable from the opening moments. Joey came across as intelligent, open minded, full of life and youthful optimism, strong-minded and guileless -- just as her parents had raised her, which I felt the script capitalized on to address the issue of the \"only 10 days.\" When John said she made him feel like he came back to life after the years of widowhood, it was believable. Normally I can't sit through movies with women past age 15 portrayed as stereotypically ditsy and immature and so when I read a comment about her being flighty, I was was hesitant to watch the movie, but I did not get that impression of her. I do have to admit, she does come across to me as selectively impulsive: reserving her \"impulsivity\" to something she really feels strongly about and sticking with it. I did not get the impression she was randomly impulsive about anything that comes along and then bail out when the going gets tough, like some frustratingly impulsive people that have tried my patience in real life.The monologues were all very strong. I really got a kick out of Hepburn firing an employee and wanted to applaud after hearing Poitier's speech to his father.Ironically, the monologue most pivotal to the plot -- Poitier's mother (Mrs. Prentice) to Tracy's character -- was delivered by one of the weaker of the cast. Other than the acting by the maid and Mrs. Prentice, which I felt was so-so, I found the acting in this film among the top in quality of all films of the mid-20th century, causing me to enjoy this film way more than I expected.",

And in Europe that was considered interesting and exotic, but to the rest of this country it was an affront to God. And several major cities in the US had been burned in race riots - Watts, Newark, Detroit. So when this movie came out, I remember the controversy. Heck back then Bill Cosby wasn't even allowed to kiss a girl onscreen in any of the I-Spy episodes -- not even a Black one, if they could have found one in Hollywood in 1967.  See I have this theory that the only reason they made this into an interracial movie was because they only had so many Black actors.Enough of that though.  This film is about people, society and great acting. Tracy and Hepburn give their last magic performance together, set in San Francisco, my favorite city in the world.  (Imagine if this was set in say Birmingham Alabama 1967.)  They are standard brand liberals, but are shocked to the souls of their shoes when their little girl brings home one of Them, The Other.  And it takes all sides seeing the Other as an individual person to get through it.  The couple doesn't seem to have that problem.  They are a new generation, brought up by liberals, who while they themselves cannot jump over their own shadows, have raised their children to see the world differently.  Heck even George Bush acknowledges non WASP in-laws these days.  The fact that some change has happened in some places can be seen walking through the streets of San Francisco today, and seeing the colors of generation born after the making of that film, and the couples walking down the street there.  (This year SF no longer had one single ethnic group in the majority.  And I think the real reason those preachers from Kansas keep wanting to perform exorcisms there is that they cannot believe creaturs of different species can reproduce.)Great comedy when Tracy is trying to get away to think and encounters more of Them.  They're everywhere.  EEEEEEK.It's a funny heartwarming positive movie, set in a fantasy world that only exists in a few cities cosmopolitan enough to appreciate people who are different.  But since it is now \"politically incorrect\" to be shocked by interracial sex, the only thing that would compare today would be about a movie in which homosexuals wish to marry.  And we all know how popular that notion is.Is it dated?  Yes.  I think all movies are dated.  And some are better than others for dates.  This one is an all time classic.",

It has a cheesy, lighthearted tone to it, but it also broke new grounds for the modern age of cinema. Before this, movies about race were much darker. You had The Intruder (1962), To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), and In the Heat of the Night (1967); which are all amazing movies, but a little dark for the everyday moviegoer. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner deals with the issue of race, but it does it in a way that isn't intimidating, and it doesn't force the message on the audience. It's a lovable movie, and it has an amazing cast. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are amazing as the parents. These are two of my favorite actors of all time, and just like Bringing Up Baby, there's just a grand presence to seeing two legends work off each other. Sidney Poitier is perfect as the daughter's boyfriend; and I love how he's portrayed as the perfect man, but at the same time, he has that \"I can explain\" look for most of the movie. Katharine Houghton is amazing as the daughter. She's so energized, and so naive that it's hard not to love this character. One thing I really like about this movie is how race neutral it is. The parents aren't racist, they're just afraid of how their children will be treated in society; which is something I think a lot of people at the time can relate to. The times were changing, and this was the perfect movie to address this issue. It's funny, it's dramatic, it's touching, and it's smart; it's just an all around great movie. It may be corny to some people, but to me, it's a timeless movie that still holds up to this day. It's just one of those movies that brings a smile to my face, and reminds me of the important role movies play in all our lives.",

I can't help being sympathetic with Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy) because he had to make a very important decision \u0096 sentiment versus reason. Mr. Drayton was right in saying that his wife (Katharine Hepburn) was a romantic person who was completely carried away with her daughter's happiness whereas he himself had to worry about all sorts of practical problems. In face of difficult situations like this, he could only follow his heart in the end. Despite seeing the film nearly 40 years after it was released, I am still undecided about the issues raised by the film. Not all of them are about race though. For one, why should the decision be rushed? Why couldn't the proposed marriage be postponed? Even if the future son-in-law were a white young man, the parents had every right to have reservations until they knew the future daughter(son)-in-law well enough.Back to the theme of the movie: What if Dr. Prentice (Sidney Poitier) was not so prominent in his career but was just an ordinary black man with a modest job? Paradoxically, after all these years, we still don't see many mainstream Hollywood movies with a blossoming romance between a black person and a white person. Instead, a black actor is often teamed with a Chinese character. Jackie Chan's and Jet Li's movies are good examples.A few months ago, I saw Father of the Bride also starring Spencer Tracy. While that movie left me feeling happy for parents seeing their daughter (Elizabeth Taylor) happily married, this movie made me feel quite heavy. The speech Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy) gave in the last 5 minutes of the movie did not solve the issues brought up, it only marked the beginning of the many challenges the young couple had to face. Moreover, this was to be the last movie Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made and what a superb performance they pulled off. Hepburn was there all along watching and supporting her love on and off the screen. For those who admire Spencer Tracy and would like another movie of a completely different genre to lighten up after seeing this great but serious film, I recommend Father of the Bride.",

Well this is a brief plot of the film and looks interesting for sure even if you haven't seen the film but it is more interesting and intellectual when you actually see it. Apart from the marriage it tries to discover many issues like Racism, Cultural Hatred and traditional old thinking of old generation. Overall, it surpasses all the expectations and promises made by the brief plot because it clarifies many details in human drama mode. I was in tears 4-5 times while watching the film don't know why as i am neither American nor African. Cause it's about Human emotions and sentiments generated over the behaviour of society in general. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a great love story but moreover it is a path breaking film on Cultural differences carried by people for years. Somebody had to poke a nose, somebody had to raise a voice and that's what this film did. Coincidentally it came in the same year of \"In The Heat Of The Night\" which won Oscar and had the similar theme of White vs Coloured People and had the same actor, Mr. Sidney Poitier playing the black man. What a great performance Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn had given in this film. How did Hepburn managed to bring tears in her eyes so many times and every time felt different in emotions. Katharine Houghton was a surprise and Sidney was good as always. Most of the credit goes to Stanley Kramer for telling such an important story in likeable and engaging way. I didn't feel bored for a moment, i was so into it from the start till the end. This film deserves more viewers and more praise than some other overrated films.

Especially the black fellow who is an internationally acclaimed doctor AND lets his fianc\u00e9s parents decide his future AND he even didn't get intimate with her out of respect. Pretty amazing guy if you ask me. But the most glaringly obvious thing is, not that inter-racial marriage is acceptable, but that you don't get married to someone you know for 10 days. Period. No \"urgent flight\" should make it necessary for you to get married now. Also, the concluding speech from the girls father is plain wrong. Just cuz you feel a certain way doesn't make it the right choice.",

Though it likely wouldn't have fit the times so well, a family overcoming prejudice towards an average man who happens to be black might've been even better.

            "content": "In 1967, I was 4 years old. And a child of mixed \"ethnicity\", from both sides of my family. I first saw this movie in 1971. At that age, I understood it's message, it's metaphors and subtle (and obvious) symbolisms. From my young mind, it felt dated even then. Some of the comments posted fail to realize that any piece of art that tackles the topical, instantly dates itself. The \"bigger\" the topic, the faster the art will date itself.Spike Lee's attempt at such subject matter has also dated itself (and in the guise of telling the truth) allowed him to express the same prejudices (and his own disdain for his father's later marriage to a Jewish woman) that \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\"'s warned about. And I believe most of his films will ultimately be forgotten as grand-standing rants against what (good and bad) he and our generation (like the mindless dancers in the film) take for granted in 21st century America.The movie is a modern Fable. A morality play. And should be viewed as such. Not a historical document. Then it's importance, beauty and charm will be appreciated.There was no attempt at telling the story accurately from \"the trenches\" of the civil-rights movements. It was about two \"ideal\" representative families of middle-class America facing their \"politically correct\" philosophies, when \"forced to\" by their children. The parents (and the maid) ideologically represented the generation that lived through (and helped cause by action or inaction) such changes in America. The young people ideologically represented the youth that was beginning to take such painfully fought for \"changes\" for granted. There were many little metaphors about change and progress throughout this film, that had, on the surface, nothing to do with \"race\", but everything to do with people's love and hate of any kind of change.Any middle-aged or older person has had to deal with their personal computer oriented \"youngsters\" to understand what else this film was about.All of the main and directly supporting cast members gave fine performances from a very thoughtful and understanding script. Another thing to remember before criticizing the script itself, is that most American movies are scripted by white, middle class writers, aiming to have their product or art, reach the widest audience possible. And considering the turmoil of 1966-67 American race-relations, and quite possiblly the creators did not come from \"mixed ethnicity\", ALL involved, did an excellent job. Because so much of it's message is now taken for granted (proven by the overwhelmingly negative swipes by a few of the comments), the movie's initial importance is still here.",

The audience is continuously beaten over the head with anti-racism rhetoric until, eventually, the film becomes becomes annoying.

Some of the details in this film weren't thought out in my opinion. For example, John is basically portrayed as a saint, and I can see why Kramer would want to do that, but this made his relationship with Christina not very believable. She seems to be a child in comparison to him, how are they in love? Also the set design was comically bad at times, like when they are at Christina's parents for dinner and John goes outside to talk to Matt. That background is so fake and obvious its funny. I can absolutely understand it though, at the time, that was the norm so I won't judge too much.

            "content": "Nothing gets dated faster than a movie that seeks to be \"contemporary\" and \"relevant,\" and that certainly is the case with 1967's \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,\" a comedy/drama with all the best intentions and more than its share of maudlin melodrama as it depicts two liberal parents thrust in a quandary as they must suddenly come to terms with and give their blessings to a daughter who wants to marry someone they never met before who happens to have different skin color.The film stacks the deck against the objections of the father, Matt Drayton, played with subtle grace by Spencer Tracy in his final role, by making his prospective son-in-law an accomplished, renowned physician played by Sidney Poitier with typical sensitivity and accomplishment. His Dr. Prentice is not only Ivy-educated but graduated \"maxima cum laude\" a designation I never heard of but quite impressive-sounding. Dr. Prentice even declined the premarital advances of his lovestruck fianc\u00e9e, something she casually tells her mother, Christina, played by Katharine Hepburn. Dr. Prentice is a son-in-law any father should be proud to have, a point that gets beaten into the ground.While labored and contrived, the script does have its share of solid moments. I just don't think they're all the same ones the writer or director did.The nicest bit of business, which Ben Burgraff in his terrific review elsewhere on this site points out was the last scene Tracy ever acted in, is when he takes a ride with Christina and orders something called Oregon boysenberry sherbet. It's the one scene in the film that's not beating you over the head about the social implications of the main storyline. Instead, Tracy plays up his fragile befuddlement at the newfangled world around him in amusing style, and the surprise of discovering he likes this ice cream flavor after initially being repulsed by it. A bit obvious as subtext, yes, but it's a moving moment that feels real on screen, especially as Tracy sells it, talking earnestly about his revelation to a waitress who couldn't care less. Meanwhile, Hepburn's words about their relationship's early difficulties seem a truer, more fitting capper to their off-screen partnership than his speechifying at the end, which verges on the self-congratulatory.The sherbet scene is immediately followed by Matt backing into another car, an off-putting moment which Hepburn's character unconvincingly treats as comedy. A lot of eye-rolling scenes, like the delivery boy who boogies on the job like a \"Shindig\" extra and picks up a girl who grooves along (Barbara Randolph, who plays the girl, nearly became a Supreme, according to IMDb.com, and certainly had the necessary moves and sex appeal.) Katharine Houghton, who plays the daughter, Joey, trills her lines with a perkiness that comes off too forced by half, though a more natural performance would probably be out-of-tune with the character as written in the script: \"It never occurred to me I'd fall in love with a Negro, but I did, and nothing in the world is going to change that.\" She does have a coquettishly pleasing screen presence, and the fact she is Hepburn's real-life niece, with the same hair color and vocal intonations, does sell this as a family affair.As a movie, \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" has flaws, but it is also a bold cultural milestone that treats its subject with intelligence, especially as Dr. Prentice's parents come over and reveal concerns of their own about the union. The movie's best performance, better even than Tracy's, is Beah Richards' as Mrs. Prentice, who like Tracy plays her scenes with engaging subtlety and stillness. With less time on screen, Richards makes her character's adjustment to the situation more realistic than Hepburn, who is struck dumb by the news in one scene, and then firing an employee for having much the same reaction a few scenes later.A lot of wet-eyed moments, too many, especially toward the end, but good intentions should mean something, and Tracy and Richards' on-screen work means something more. \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" is a typical Stanley Kramer-directed fare, social commentary as subtle as a mallet, but entertaining all the same.",

            "content": "This movie, though a little too-full of some recycled, long-winded dialogue, has a lot to say. At a socially progressive and supercharged time for tension, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner makes a lot of points about the changing world.Though many are frustrated with Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy)when he disapproves of his daughter's imminent interracial marriage. But Tracy brings more complexity to the character than that. It's not simply about making interracial marriage more commonplace or even whether it's legal all over the country (the Draytons are a liberal family), it's about the stigma. The film uses the perspective of each dinner guest to show that in 1967, when the film was produced, it may have been more widely accepted, but interracial marriage was still heavily stigmatized, and often dangerous for both spouses. Subtext such as this may not be spelled out as apparently by the dialogue, but it is clear. The film is well-written, even if some of the dialogue gets a little repetitive.In addition, though the movie happens in very few places (mostly the Draytons' home in San Francisco), the visual aspects of the film are dynamic and bright. Special attention was clearly paid to the set (as one would hope when it is largely the entire setting for a longer movie) to allow for dynamic movement of the actors and cameras as they drift from one perspective or conversation to another.This movement between people feels natural, as films go, and gives every character in the film a chance to compare their viewpoints and feelings to each other character. This was a very clever way of showing a take on race relations in such a chaotic time that I had not seen in film before.There are several strange sequences, such as Dorothy (Barbara Randolph), Tillie's (Isabel Sanford) assistant, dances off-screen to catch a ride into town. These sequences, however, provide a greater context for the conflict occurring inside the Draytons' home. It's a sort of meeting place for the external and internal to show that, \"Hey, this isn't the only crazy thing happening. It's an extremely crazy time for social issues.\" If nothing else, this movie is important. It should be revisited as society progresses, as it shows important things happening during an important time, and that context is something to consider historically. Historically significant and an example of good film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a film that Americans should still be watching. If not for a better understanding of the country's roots in social issues, then for some great entertainment that might even strike a chord emotionally.",

While it did make breakthroughs in cinema at the time it came out, it still follows and reinforces the white patriarchal ideology.John has to be this perfect man, because if he was anything less there would be fault in him and that would make people think of how he might be 'kidnapping' or 'tricking' Joey into marrying him. Then John leaves the decision of the union in the palm of Joey's parents' hands, giving the whites the superiority that is already evident in the society. Adding to that, John is the 'man', and he is the only one concerned about the problems their union will bring, as he is the caretaker in the couple. Joey being the 'woman' is not concerned, and perhaps also because she is white she does not need to be concerned because things will be taken care of for her. There are many more such examples, but the main thing that makes this movie all go downhill, is the ending, when Matt (Joey's father) silences everyone and tells them how he went through the process of opposing the union to listening to everyone-else's opinion, and finally to his conclusion (based on the mothers' influence), that all that matters is how much they feel for each other. But he comes to this conclusion like he came up with the whole idea by himself.I could go on longer, but let's move on.Oh wait, there's one more. John says to his father, \"You think of yourself as a coloured man, I just think of myself as a man.\" Reinforcing hetero-normativity much? It would have been better to say \"I think of myself as a human\". But I don't blame them much for that 'mistake', even in today's world we reinforce this compulsive heterosexuality.The acting was pretty great considering that Spencer Tracy was deathly ill (he passed away 17 days after the movie wrapped). Katherine Hepburn and her niece Katharine Houghton, played their parts well enough, though Hepburn was more of a presence and had a stronger character. Not much is actually known about Houghton's character except that she was always a happy child. This too causes me to wonder what Joey and John have in common that they could be so in love. Sidney Poitier was pretty convincing in his character, though I noticed that he might have had a bit of a lisp, and I'm not sure if that was how he actually spoke or how his character spoke and I'm hoping its the former. If it was the latter\u0085that just emphasizes the ideology.I read that this film helped other films that included African- Americans, to be main-streamed into the cinema culture, and I am glad that it had a positive impact. But still, it follows and reinforces the white patriarchal ideology so much so, that once I know of it, I can't forget it.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

How someone can say one thing and be all for it, but when it effects them they suddenly have to think about it, or it's not okay anymore. I think the subject in which this film handled was carried out in a creative scenario. It never seemed dull or boring. While the reactions of the parents seemed extreme to me, someone born in the 90's, it still seemed relevant in a way. While interracial relations are more widely accepted in the US with each generation, there are still some who aren't accepting of it. I think that there will always be someone who won't agree with it. I couldn't help but also think of the current issue dealing with equal rights for the LBGT community. I could relate this story to that somehow, in that someones parents could be for those equal rights, and yet if their child ended up being gay, they might initially reject it. I don't think I'm the only one who could make that connection today after watching this.",

With so many marriages happening in the United States, it is hard to believe that as recently as 1966, 17 states actually had laws against interracial marriage.Interracial marriage was a very hot topic in the 60s, although many people didn't like to talk about it. It was illegal in many places, but as shown in the movie people have started to accept the issue. Many of the things that happened in the movie would not really have happened during the time, but that is not the point. The movie was just trying to prove a point about marriage and how people should be allowed to marry anyone they love, no matter what their skin color. As American becomes more diverse today and in the future, more people will begin to understand that there is nothing wrong with an interracial marriage.",

            "content": "\"Guess Who's Coming\" opens with a shot of a United airplane in flight. Because of the angle of the wings, the sun reflects bright white off one and dark off the other. This uniting of black and white portends the plot where 23-year-old Joanna (Joey) Drayton (Katherine Houghton) flies from Hawaii to San Francisco to surprise her mom Christina Drayton (Katharine Hepburn) and dad Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) with her new beau 37-year-old Dr. John Prentice (Sidney Poitier). Since her parents have been liberal about race relations all along, she expects, \"There's no problem.\"Desmond Morris (best known for his book *The Naked Ape*) observes human interactions in *Manwatching* (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1974, 169): \"If we see something that excites us, whether with pleasure or fear, our pupils expand. If we see something mildly distasteful, they contract.\" On the following page he relates about, \"when liberally minded people were shown photographs of black males kissing white females. Although all the subjects spoke approvingly of racial equality, their pupils split them neatly into two groups--the liberals 'at heart' whose pupils matched their stated beliefs, and the 'merely persuaded' liberals, or perhaps pseudo-liberals, who, despite their praise for racial integration, revealed pinprick pupils when confronted with the black-kissing-white display.\"The suspense of the film lies in trying to guess which categories the parents will settle into.The colored maid and the suitor's black father both hold forth that the Negro doctor is exceeding his station in life. The white dad admits to being \"flabbergasted.\" Everyone cautions the starry-eyed couple that it might not end well. This is an eminent example of (Prov. 30:21-22) \"the earth is disquieted, and it cannot bear: for a servant when he reigneth.\"This is supposed to be a rare Hollywood message movie. But there are messages and there are messages. One message I read by subtracting 7 years from the lives of the couple, to get a 16-year-old girl and a 30-year-old guy, the exact same age difference between a once 30-year-old Roy Moore now in the news and the 16-year-olds that he was purportedly interested in at that age. His marriage to one of them did turn out just fine. Can it be we Yankees are overly judgmental on the southerners who are more accepting of age difference, just as the South was more judgmental about race? The second message is what if your family is not so liberal? One should perhaps not date someone from a class he or she could never marry into; if they fall in love, what then? Here the couple fell in love 20 minutes after meeting. That would seem to rationalize against fraternization.Typically, in a Hollywood film, love conquers all. We certainly have a cast to give us hope to pull it off. Sidney Poitier is the only Negro actor at the time a White audience could abide in a leading role. The actresses were just the ones to tug at the heart strings. Notwithstanding the great acting here, Poitier and Houghton just didn't have any chemistry together. For supposedly being in love, they simply didn't look at each other often enough. Furthermore, Portier's speech inflections were nowhere near those of his character's parents making it hard to believe he was their son. The movie was redeemed in part by Billy Hill's song, \"The Glory of Love,\" played in various forms throughout.\"Guess Who is Coming to Dinner\" was directed by Stanley Kramer, with Ray Gosnell the assistant director. The Gosnell clan (of whom I am one) originally hailed from Virginia; perhaps that accounts for all the southern style hospitality shown in the film. It was released 50 years before I just now saw it, back in December, 1967. It just got accepted into a national archive to preserve culturally significant films. Its \"message\" has to do with things perhaps changing in fifty or a hundred years. I wouldn't hold my breath. It probably has application to other \"special difficulties\" as well.It followed the template of a play, more or less, with limited fixed settings and heavy dialog. I wasn't overly impressed by it.",

Katharine Hepburn was by far my favorite throughout the film. I think she was most interesting because we're brought in the film seeing her reactions but later seeing how she has this understanding with her feelings and emotions but not only that she understands her daughters and John Prentice's emotions and feeling towards the parents and everyone else in between. This film had a great depiction of what interracial couples dealt with during the 60's and early 70's. The use of camera work was pretty impressive too, when Tillie goes into detail about her thoughts the camera shifts and we are looking at the picture at angle. I thought that was pretty cool because it shows how John's world has just been shaking up. The scene when Matt Drayton was upstairs changing was funny, everything was flying all over the place.

Not only are the performances excellent (particularly those of Tracy and Hepburn), but also the social issues are addressed with enough emotion to make the topics still relevant more than 30 years later. For all it's preaching and awkward dancing (somebody please shoot that delivery boy), the film comes off as an ably directed film that is both a crowd-pleaser and a work of art.But everyone knows that. I won't talk more about the easy praise for the movie. Instead I think there exists some interesting underlying racism typical of Hollywood at this time: First off, John Prentice freely gives all of his power up to Joanna's parents when he lets them decide on accepting him or not. Providing them with an ultimatum, John becomes another powerless black man whose life is in the hands of a white man. Later when the decision rests entirely on Joanna's father, Matt, we wonder why the same importance isn't placed on John's father. His parents are, in fact, pushed to the periphery so that they barely matter in the decisions at hand. John's father is even more impotent than his son; and John's mother is the only real member of the family to stick up for her son's love, however weakened her argument might be.This angle shows how terrified Hollywood (and most of America) was of granting black people power in the late 60s; when blacks have power they reach closer into society, exert their sexual identity, and (some would say) \"corrupt\" the white race. This film does an excellent job of fighting this absurd viewpoint and goes to great lengths to bridge that gap and bring two races closer together. Despite this, we still see in the film how African Americans are subtly reduced to weakened roles, oppressed by strong white images. Not only does John nearly sacrifice happiness to appease a white couple, but he refrains from having sexual intercourse with his girlfriend\u0085that would be too risqu\u00e9. One can definitely see how this film fits in a long line of Poiter-starring vehicles where African Americans existed in white America as weak, sexless beings. Who can blame the Blaxploitation boom for rearing its head in the face of such a climate? On one last note I just wanted to say how beautiful it was to watch the classic couple of Hepburn and Tracy perform together for the last time; you can see the love in Hepburn's adoring gaze - so sad that Tracy died soon after. Still, even if this were their only film, they would have left behind a strong legacy worth re-watching many years into the future.",

Even today, racial tensions are seen often and this film was released in 1967; just years after the civil rights movement. An interracial marriage was rarely seen in the past and to portray a film on the controversy was quite powerful. The message aimed to show that two people who are in love should be allowed to do so and shouldn't be concerned with the opinions of others. Another thing that stood out to me was the clear differences between the older and younger generation in the film. For example, when the father (Matt) accidentally causes a car accident with a younger man, every kid in the parking lot took the side of the young man when he was screaming at Matt. As Matt was leaving, the parking lot applauded for the young man. One more thing I was impressed with the overall staging.

The Drayton parents acting jobs were perfect. The mother from the beginning was shocked and you could tell from the scene when she was sitting on the couch. Her eyes were watery and she didn't know what to say. She changed though because she welcomed the marriage and didn't object. The father on the other hand was against the marriage for the whole movie as was John's father. They both were completely against it but had to change by the end because it was going to happen. Joey kept piling up things on him with telling him there getting married, that she was leaving that night, and then inviting John's parents to dinner. He was put in all these tough predicaments.

Having said that, both issues are huge and it might have been asking a bit much to expect the film to address both. The class thing was air-brushed i felt.But it does address gender issues I think. Both the black father and the white father are very conservative and old-fashioned. They are opposed to the marriage, as are the mothers - initially. However the mums get their heads together. The mums are more liberal-permissive and their job is to talk their respective husbands into being groovy. But Spencer Tracey (Hepburn's dad) and Roy Glenn (Prentice Snr) are opposed to the marriage. So the film does play up to gender stereotypes - the dads are the warriors and the mums are the peacemakers. But stereotypes are not wrong just because they are stereotypes...The dads are entrenched and the mums are trying to sort it out. Which view will prevail? Will it all end in lots of tears and tragedy, or can the mums pull the iron out of the fire?Of course, as well as the mums trying to sort it out, so are the love- struck couple. Poitier is trying to convince his dad to be a bit more open minded, and Hepburn is doing likewise with Tracey.Of course Poitier and Hepburn are brilliant, but I never really picked up a big sexual attraction here, not a lot of chemistry. Indeed, they are rational, pretty cool. A decent exploration of race issues, but a little bit folksy for my taste - could have done with more edge.",

            "content": "This is one of the finest movies ever put on film--it's easily in my top 5 and may be #1 if I think long enough about it. Let's start with the easiest part: the plot. At first blush, this is a movie about race and the difficulties associated with a mixed-race relationship. But that's not really what it's about. The movie, to put it simply, is about love. Love of a parent for a child, a husband for a wife (and vice-versa), and passion between two people who may have met only recently, but who know their love is an everlasting one. On all levels, this film works. The girl is young, her beau is astonishingly accomplished, and they do of course have different skin colors, but I never once thought they were anything but a young couple in love. But the power in this film comes from the parents, particularly Tracy and Hepburn. Their comfort on-screen with each other is palpable and you know you really are watching an old couple deal with what life has thrown their way. A scene where they argue while Tracy shaves is one for the ages and, as others have remarked, his final monologue is extraordinarily powerful. Watching these two act and work together leaves you happy that they were a couple and that we have the opportunity to observe their work until the end of time. Potier is simply superb, first as a man asking another man's permission to marry the latter's daughter, and then as a man in love who won't give up. This transition occurs in one scene and is completely visible in his facial expressions alone: he realizes he will have to go on the offensive to win his love, and his face shows a determination and resolve that was not there when he first appears on our screens. It's the mark of a superior actor. This movie doesn't work without Isabel Sanford as the maid (previewing her Louise Jefferson role from \"All In the Family\" and \"The Jeffersons\"), and Cecil Kellaway as Father Mike, who provides an excellent foil for Tracy and needed comic relief. Finally, the goofy scenes outside the house (the meat delivery man and the drive-in) are incongruous with the goings-on inside, but somehow work. The drive-in scene, with Tracy's obsession with Oregon boysenberry sherbet to avoid thinking about his dilemma, is particularly excellent, as, while backing out, he learns he simply can't get away from the race-relations issue in his house. You must watch this movie\u0097-you won't regret it.",

While the manifestation of disapproval may be more guarded I think that the issues raised still resonate.But for me, the main enjoyment of this movie is not the social message but the acting. Every time I pass this film while channel surfing I have to stop in anticipation of the wonderful interplay between the actors. All of the performances are fine and they really work together as an ensemble. The two highlights for me are Beah Richards' scene in which she scolds Spencer Tracy for being a \"burnt out shell of a man\". Her forceful delivery and his indignant then contemplative reaction are marvelous. Second is Tracy's final speech to the ensemble which many others have mentioned. It truly is wonderful screen acting; and I defy anyone not to be moved by Katharine Hepburn's reaction to this speech. Though in the scene's background, her profound response is incredibly moving and makes her Oscar win deserving; although this was in no way a terribly demanding role.For the acting and as a snapshot of a time not so far in the past, highly recommended.",

Almost as if Hollywood was saying, 'Look how progressive we are.' But it could have been so much better. And really addressed the issues of the day in a much deeper and thought-provoking way.They set up a story that really didn't challenge this societal issue of the day in a way that would really get you to think.Everyone in the movie is successful. Everyone is rich, or at least middle class and comfortable. Everyone is educated, or at least comes off as being that way.The problem I had with the movie was that it sugarcoated the whole theme way too much. But then would throw in a monologue from each character that was indeed preachy, and sounded more like a college thesis about racism. And yet what was behind it almost made the message seem like, 'Well, if the white woman has to marry a black man, at least he's a handsome, wealthy, world-famous doctor.' That will get her parents to approve of him.What would have really challenged the status quo of the time would have been if he had been a mailman himself. Or a teacher. Or an insurance salesman. How accepting would her parents have been of him had that been the case? How captivated would she have been by him in the first place? Not that the latter should have mattered anyway as she was totally one-dimensional. In fact, there was nothing even remotely interesting or likable about her. To be honest, rather than the racial differences, I found myself focusing on the question of why HE would be interested in HER. There was nothing there.I guess it was the 60s though, and things were still rather fresh. They couldn't be too controversial. Or make the story too challenging. They had to take a potentially controversial subject and put it against a pretty backdrop to remove the edge.",

As far as cinematography is concerned the film consisted of mainly high key lighting with very little use of low key lighting.

This was profound because it distinguished his achievements for what they were - extraordinary. In a time in our country when segregation and integration were key words, this was a ground breaking film.  I do believe that the impact of this film may never be truly appreciated. Finally Spencer Tracy's character brilliantly portrayed the dilemna many of us face when our ideals cross paths with our reality.

Nothing wrong with that - he's every parent's dream for their daughter, being educated, of respectable background, intelligent, articulate and handsome - but he's black. What he and the daughter Joey (played by Hepburn's niece Katharine Houghton) could possibly have in common is something that would leave viewers guessing before coming to the dinner, as she doesn't appear to have any qualifications in education nor achieved anything significant other than being born into an affluent background, but then the character was highly underdeveloped, giving more emphasis to Poitier's role.

            "content": "The film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is about a black man and a white girl fall in love and how both sides' parents react to this \"shocking\" fact. The main characters are Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy), Mrs. Drayton (Katherine Hepburn), Dr. John Wade Prentice (Sidney Poitier) and Joey Drayton (Katherine Houghton).Joey and Dr. Prentice quickly fall in love and are about to inform the parents that they are getting married in two weeks. They first come to meet with Joey's parents in LA, and then Dr. Prentice's parents decide they are flying over to meet with their son and his girlfriend, Joey, without knowing that Joey is a white girl. The whole movie focuses on how determined Joey and Dr. Prentice are about their deep love to each other and how they eventually gain both parents' understanding and support to their marriage.I think the most impressive element of this movie is the dialogue; it is excellently written and beautifully spoken. Their languages clearly show each character's characteristics. The conversation Dr. Prentice and Mr. &Mrs. Drayton have in the study presents a well mannered and almost flawless person of Dr. Prentice. That makes an impression to Mr. & Mrs. Drayton that he is a well educated man and has a lot of respect to both of them. The other conversation which even enhances the characteristics of Dr. Prentice is between him and his father when his father is trying to tell him that he is making a huge mistake by wanting to marry a white girl. He speaks with strong passion and deep belief in himself. He tells his father \"you think of yourself as a colored man, and I think of myself as a man.\" That is to show the major difference between them and that is also what causes the disagreement on Dr. Prentice and Joey's marriage. When Dr. Prentice speaks with full passion and his facial expression matches his words perfectly and really gets the audience emotionally involved.Another important element used in this film is music. The film has music properly played to enhance the emotional effect. One of them is when Mrs. Drayton gets to know how much her husband is against their daughter's marriage and how their daughter is deeply in love with Dr. Prentice. She does not know what to do, since she wants her daughter to be happy by showing her support to the marriage but is worried that her husband will speak his objection which will really hurt their lovely daughter, Joey. She has complex feelings inside\u2014happiness and worries. The music is a low-tone type of music, which perfectly matches the mood of Mrs. Drayton. It also helps get the audience to be emotionally drawn into the story. By the end of the movie, it plays a happy song of \"you got to live a little\u0085.\" It matches the theme of the film, which is a love story. Since it is played in a faster and cheerful tone, it really enhances the happy atmosphere of the ending. Since the music is played once before during the movie, but it is in a much slower and low tone, the ending music is in a way to contrast that to make the happy ending even more memorable.This is a touching love story, which also involves race issues. Therefore, it is not simply a love story, it also makes people think -- how they can break the old rules and lead the world to a whole new chapter.The same old rules should not necessarily be forever followed. To realize and accept that there is \"no difference\" between white people and colored people can really make a \"difference.\"",

He is ably supported by Katharine Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, Roy Glenn, Beah Richards and Cecil Kellaway. I'd like to take a contrary view on Katharine Houghton's performance as Joanna Drayton, who plays the affluent daughter of Hepburn and Tracy and Poitier's fianc\u00e9e. Many find Houghton's performance overly naive. I disagree. The character of Joanna is intended to be privileged and headstrong, and Houghton depicts these traits perfectly.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is poignant and brave. It depicts perfectly the liberal ambivalence about interracial marriage that existed in 1967 and which persists, to some degree, over 40 years later. The film also foreshadows the Obama presidency-- the 'birthers' who deny the validity of Barack Obama's birth certificate might symbolically attribute his parentage to Poitier and Houghton. The link is deepened by Obama's 2009 award of the Presidential Medal of Honor to Poitier.The late '60s vibe of this film is pleasant, as is the use of the classic ballad \"That's the Glory of Love\".Summary: This film classic is well worth your time.",

There are many concerns between both families towards Joey and John's relationship and we are shown everyone's opinions of the intense matter.This film contains a solid and close story line that is emotional and relate able. The writing of the story is the strongest followed by the intense relationship between the actors and their emotional chemistry on screen. Glad I watched it, its one a recommend everyone watch at least once.",

Obviously the situation that the film presents isn't the most realistic one, but I think the situation needed to be so rushed and up-front, because it's the point the film is trying to make. The way it worked through every character's fears and doubts, paralleling society's duality, by having multiple instances where two characters sat down and presented their two opinions was creative. I'll say at times the film was very unrealistic, felt a little preachy, and some scenes were completely irrelevant and non-essential, but overall it wasn't a bad movie.",

            "content": "I agree that after 37 years this film is dated, but it's still interesting, and the ensemble performances are excellent.  That moving speech by Spencer Tracy makes me puddle up every time.  Roy Glenn had the finest speaking voice ever heard on film.Here are my quibbles:  Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were both marvelous in their parts, but way too old-looking to play the parents of a 23-year-old.  They were and looked older than the parents of Sidney Poitier's character, who was 37!  (The wonderful Beah Richards, who like Angela Lansbury often played older parts, was only a few years older than Poitier!)  For Tracy to tell Cecil Kellaway (who gave a delightful performance) that black Americans won't be accepted in Kellaway's lifetime and not even in his (Tracy's) was ludicrious.  Tracy was at death's door, and it showed.  Kellaway may have been older than Tracy but was obviously healthier.  I also thought it rather presumptious of Katherine Houghton to say that Poitier's parents could afford to fly to Europe for the wedding, just because they flew to San Francisco to L.A.  Europe is a long way from California and involves a lot more air fare.I wanted to address some of the comments made by another reviewer below. I found it interesting that one of the other reviewers felt it wasn't realistic for Roy Glenn's character to be completely against his son marrying a white woman.  This may come as a shock to you, but prejudice works both ways.  It's not the exclusive domain of WASPs.  Black families don't rejoice at the thought of intermarriage, and my guess would be that American Indians, Asians, Hawaiians, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, or any other group who want to retain their ethnicity don't like it much either. I don't think anyone is comfortable with the thought of their descendants, having evolved into a completely different ethnic heritage than the original ancestors (i.e., from black to white, from Asian to white, from white to Middle Eastern, etc.,) sitting around the table talking about how much they dislike the people of the same culture as their ancestors.Regarding class, I feel the producers *shouldn't* have made this a big issue.  The doctor, despite his modest upbringin, was now wealthy, and Joey's character had grown up with money.  Tracy and Hepburn weren't worried about Poitier not being able to support their daughter in the manner to which she was accustomed.  That was the least of their problems.  The wedding announcements in the New York Times show plenty of marriages between women whose mothers are school headmistresses and fathers who are inventors and artists and men who are corporate VPs and attorneys but whose mothers sell girdles at Macy's and whose fathers are bus drivers.  What's important was that the parents know how to carry themselves, know how to speak, and can walk into a mansion and feel like they belong there, as opposed to coming in dressed inappropriately, saying \"dese\" and \"dose,\" and stare open-mouthed at their surroundings.  Glenn and Richards were the picture of elegance and decorum.",

It tells the simple story of Joanna and Dr. John go to Joanna's family home for dinner after the both met in Hawaii. Then, a series of events happens. It's simply a funny story contrasting from a theme that is now dominating the United States Of America as I write this review.In the picture, the African American maid of the Draytons' is highly against the mix-skin tone couple. This shows how ironical it is when a black woman goes to work in a white oriented home for so long. She loses her sense of fighting for her race's rights. (Pardon me, if this may offend anyone). John is quite annoyed by this as we see. I think this what the picture is about, not the cruelty of white men and how racist America is or etc. It's simply a simple love story about uniting the people together, throwing skin-tone accusations into the bin. These kinds of marriages have occurred very often nowadays.Though it is a positive picture, it is not exactly very great in my eyes. This could be due to the fact that I'm male but, it is a reasonably strong picture.7/10: B",

A young black man, his white wife-to-be, both their parents, a priest (white parents' best friend), and their maid are all forced into a situation where the outcome must be discussed and a decision about the whole idea of the marriage must be reached within about 4-5 hours. What results is a kaleidoscope of intense dialogue that basically covers all the angles, taking place between all the participants in small groups at first, and then one-on-ones culminating in a masterfully delivered soliloquy that just melts the heart.It is quite rare to see such beauty in film.

            "content": "\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a 1967 movie about interracial marriage starring Sidney Poitier as John Prentice and Katherine Houghton as Joey Drayton, a young couple who meet one another's conservative parents to announce their engagement. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn star as Joey's \"liberal\" parents. Sidney is well educated, hard- working, and handsome; Joey is charming, lovely, and dedicated to John. The two are clearly in love and want to make a life together, but set in the era of the Civil Rights movement, both sets of conservative parents are appalled at the prospect of the bigotry they know the interracial couple will face, and startled at their own feelings of racism. At the time this movie was made, interracial marriage was illegal in 15 states, but by the time it was released, those bans had been struck down.The film is interesting because Joey's parents always espoused liberalism but when their daughter proves to have taken their teachings to heart, they have to deal with the dismay they feel. Part of the conflict is the Draytons trying to determine why they feel so appalled\u0085 are they truly racist? John gets disappointment from his parents as well, and the family housekeeper just speaks her mind in an example of black-on-black racism and asks him what he is thinking, marrying \"up\" and marrying a white girl? Cinematically, the film has several continuity errors, which are noticeably pointed out in other reviews, and the sets are glaringly obvious to the point of occasionally distracting you from the dialogue. The lighting, though, makes everything pleasant and basically foreshadows that we are going to have a happily-ever-after ending. You don't feel any sense of dread and everyone looks attractive and pleasant.A remake of this in 2005 starring Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher called \"Guess Who\" reversed the roles, with Kutcher the white fianc\u00e9e of an wealthy African American woman. Her parents are shocked, but that film is played for laughs by focusing on the relationship that any man is not going to be good enough for Mac's daughter, and he keeps mentioning race because that is the most obvious contrast. Bernie Mac admitted in an interview that racism was no longer a factor in this day and age, and the movie was meant as a comedic showcase of his and Kutcher's talents rather than a social commentary like the original. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is not an action driven movie. It concentrates on dialogue between small groups and pairs to show the conflict. Spencer Tracy was suffering his final illness through the filming of this movie, and many times could not be on the set all day: he is clearly exhausted in his final speech where he wraps up the movie by stating that love must carry the day, and despite the ugliness and pain other people will cause, John and Joey have his blessing. This scene is why the movie is such a classic, because in today's debate over homosexual marriage, you can see the same argument and conflict people are having now\u0085.what matters more, love or society?

They were a liberal family but during the 60's the Drayton's had a tough time accepting at first that their daughter was in love with a black man and knew how difficult it would be for society to accept to them as a couple, when it was still illegal in several states for them to even be married. This movie was considered New Hollywood, so it came out at the end of the production code. So we were able to see a black man and white woman together on screen and kissing. And to see a black man without his shirt on, on screen while another woman is in the room with him, who is not his wife. Katherine Hepburn says the word \" Bitch\" in this film which would not be allowed before the production code.

B)The girl's parents were played by American Cinema's First Couple, Film Integrity Personified, whose very presence led credence to the premise of the film. C) The bulk of the angry dissent is assigned to the poor, working class, and easily dismissible \"colored\" father, who has been left to the past by his Magical Black Son. In a scene completely devoid of reality, the Son castigates his father in brilliant cinematic fashion (an act which would have gotten him immediately popped in the mouth in any real Black family of that era, even at that age. Kramer,obviously, never spent a moment in a Black home in his life. That level of disrespect for parents was unheard of in Black families at that time. If the quiet, docile mother had walked in during that dramatic tirade, she would have slapped her Son, herself - \"Boy, have you lost your mind???....\". ) D) The rest of the angry dissent was saved for Kramer's most tone deaf moment in the film, when the White family's self-sacrificing \"good colored girl\" maid, in full throttle, Hattie McDaniel-inspired form, throws herself in front of her virtuous White charge, and savagely attacks the Magical Black Man for having the audacity to forget his place. Kramer really played to the heart of his target audience with this scene, allowing them to vent, through privileged laughter, at a stereotype that they had lived with so comfortably for generations. Kramer, with this scene, was blissfully dismissive of the sensitivities of the Civil Rights era Black audiences who helped to make this movie a hit. This scene was played for laughs and it is often fondly recalled by fans of the film. Rest assured, however, the gales of laughter this scene caused in Manhattan's Upper East Side was matched, pound for pound, with groans of anger (and worse) in Harlem. Yes, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER was made for easy digestion by a generation of infants with weak and sensitive stomachs.

Very shocking to look back at how things use to be and kind of funny that people would even make a fuss over something such as this. The only reason I even stayed awake through this film is seriously because of all the top notch acting done by the main characters. Out of the entire movie the only scene that really did seem unnecessary was the stupid part with the delivery boy dancing like a goon. I wasn't sure if it was intentional but the way things go down with Sidney Poitier had me thinking he was a trickster and a bad guy for a little bit. Then the realization was made that Tillie is just a bitch. Each scene is set up in such a fantastic manner which gives the movie a real nice flow and artistic feel to it. The ice cream scene provides great comic relief. A movie that anyone can enjoy and very eye opening for its time \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" is a touching film.",

When I first watched it, Hepburn came across as the best actor because she was so active and committed. But upon watching it again, I found that Poitier's role was to be cautious. He had a family before, he had personal experience of what they would have to face by being an interracial couple. And this knowledge made his character more reserved. The only really negative I have against the movie is that they fell instantly in love, and they are using the basis for their three week relationship, to make their families approve the marriage.

The premise of the film was groundbreaking for the time and very thought provoking, even in society today. However, much of the film is spent watching 3 or 4 characters give long monologues to each other about race and love. It gets a bit boring and old. The opening scene I thought was shot very well, but once the characters get Spencer Tracey's house it is all downhill from there. Boringness aside, the acting is great and so is the music. This is Spencer Tracey's last film, and he gives a great performance. For being a race movie of the 60's, the way that Stanley Kramer handles the very sensitive subject is actually quite graceful and sensitive. This is also Sidney Poitier's first major role, and he does do a great job. He handles this important role perfectly.",

It showed that her parents were tolerable of black people living in the same society but it bothered them to welcome one into the family. John's parents also acted in a similar manner. When they met Joey at the airport they were shocked to see their son with a white woman. The mentality is not the same for both parents; Joey's parents were a little uncomfortable with the idea whereas John's parents were shocked because typically white people are less accepting of black people, at least during this time. I thought it was very good because it showed the level of acceptance on both sides and the trial and tribulations each parent overcame in accepting their child's choice in marrying the one they love no matter what their akin color is. The picture quality is very good and the lighting is good also because all the actors and actresses faces are bright and visible.

African-Americans were protected by the law, but still were not respected by everyone, as Stanley Kramer showed in this movie about a debate between two families over an inter-racial marriage. While an overall good movie, some of its ideas have dated. First off, Sidney Poitier's character, in order to be worthy of the white girl (Katharine Houghton) has to be wealthy and a doctor who happens to work in Hawaii. Second, the subject of interracial marriage, while still not accepted by some, has become somewhat common in our society. The movie seems to stand better as a time capsule to the changing ideas of the late \u009160's.\nThe performances in the movie are good, though no actor stood out among the rest in my opinion. Katharine Hepburn did win an for her role as Houghton's mother. But, in my opinion, she didn't deserve it. She never gets to have a dramatic scene to herself. Through most of the movie she just stands and says words. The Oscar might also have been out of sympathy for long time lover Spencer Tracy's death, which occurred two weeks after the movie was completed. The film otherwise does have some good parts and I do recommend it. But it should be seen, as I said, as a reminder of how beliefs and ideals have changed since it was first released.",

Kramer draws you into the emotion of the characters almost immediately with the abrupt news of John and Joey to her parents that they are getting married after only knowing each other for ten days. The amazing acting of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn and the expert direction of Kramer helped the audience share in the bewilderment of two parents that just found out their daughter is marrying someone she just met. Add into that the dilemma created by the racial situation in 1960s America and the film poses very interesting social questions.\nThere are many points of view from the lovers who want to get married, the mothers who accept that they are in love, fathers who understand its going to be hard and could cause trouble, and the social statements that the writers used to explain the complexities of the situation. One thing I thought was interesting was how they used the character of the maid, who was an older black lady, to convey how older black people felt about the civil rights movement. They were unsure, and worried about all the noise the young people were making. This is a great movie from the time when civil liberty was just beginning for people of color.",

There were situations in the movie that were unrealistic and made the issue of interracial marriage easier to deal with then in real life. For example, the chances of finding any man, whether he be white, black, yellow, orange, or purple with the credentials as John Prentice is extremely slim. If John Prentice had an occupation that was more realistic like a banker or a doctor, then it would have made the situation a lot harder. Also, the opening scene where the happy couple was merrily waltzing through the airport I found to be enormously na\u00efve and completely not representative of the context of the time period. Also the priest in the movie was very accepting and supportive of the couple's marriage and was wondrously happy for them, but that was not an accurate representation of all the churches and their views on interracial marriage. I know of churches and institutions today that frown upon interracial marriage and they believe that interracial marriage is not willed by God, and if churches like that exist today I can know they were more extreme in the 1960s. However, despite these historical inaccuracies in the movie its purpose is clearly there. It served to increase awareness of race and ethnicity and to challenge people to act out what they say about equality and about the color of someone's skin not making a difference.",

Its also about dealing with the generation gap, a major theme of the time which has in some ways slipped away now.

He let the crew know that John and Christina couldn't be held apart regardless of the ridicule they were going to face being a biracial couple. Diner begins.Guess who's coming to dinner is a very polarizing film. It directly attacks a tender issue of inter racial marriage. Instead of having the parents taking a racist point of view they had just feared the way society would treat the couple. Which is a shot at the American Society. The way the built the minor characters in a way of how society would react to them is an amazing detail during the film. The movie is needed for the time. It is a great catalyst for change.

Spencer's last lines on screen melt me to tears every time. it is only fitting that one of the best actors of all time would spend his last moments on screen with the love of his life, someone who just happened to be the best and most important actress of all time. what i hate is that this beautiful love story was almost over. 10 days after completing the movie, Spencer died in his love's arms. here ends the most fabulous romance of all time. (SPOILER ALERT) Remember Spencer's last words on screen to Kate; \"all that matters is what they feel, and if it is 1/2 of what we felt, that's everything.\" he was looking straight at Kate(who was not on camera, the shots of her and him were spliced together), he was telling the world of their love, he was paying tribute to before millions. he was saying goodbye. if you havent seen this movie, do so for them. o-by the way-i love it, and i am only 15.",

            "review_title": "A Warm and Optimistic Film That Tackles the Subject Matter In a Sensitive and Modern Way",
            "content": "Travelling back to 1967 we find a film that tackles the issue of race and interracial marriage at a time when attitudes were starting to change, but perhaps not fast enough. This is still a prevalent theme in films, most recently explored in 'Get Out' directed by Jordan Peele, which starts pretty much in the same way as 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?', but which takes a much darker turn. However, the best genre for exploring these issues is comedy-drama, which is what 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' is, as this enables the arguments and discussions had by the various characters to be shown and to evolve, as well as to lay their prejudices and beliefs open for us to laugh at, but also in many ways recognise. The simple beauty of this film is that it is allowed to be, there isn't any external pressure on it to throw in plot twists and excitement; it is simply a two-hour discussion on the topic of racism and interracial marriage. However, it has such engaging and genuine characters that it is an enjoyable discussion, and never really gets dull. The plot is also really simple, which as I have stated, works as strength, rather than a weakness. 23-year-old Joanna 'Joey' Drayton, returns home to San Francisco, after a holiday in Hawaii, to introduce her parents to her fianc\u00e9, 37-year-old academic Dr John Prentice, whom she met while she was there, only 10 days earlier. There is only one problem: he is black and she is white. The simplest of set-ups makes for a wonderful character study, and for exploring the issues of acceptance being pushed to its limit. Because nobody in this film is an actual racist. Joey's parents, Christina and Matt (played brilliantly by Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy), are nice, middle-class, liberal people who brought their daughter up to believe that the colour of a person's skin should not make a difference as to how you treat them, and Joey is certain that her parents will not raise any objections to her choice of husband. John, however, is a little more sceptical, knowing how racism is much more deeply embedded than just what a person believes politically. Therefore, John decides that he will only marry Joey if her parents give their blessings whole-heartedly, and without any reservations, but they have only until that evening to decide as he is flying out to New York that night, and then on to Geneva to lecture at the World Health Organisation, where Joey will join him and they will be married. This plot device is a little weak, as it creates a false sense of tension about whether the parents will bless the marriage or not, and it steers the debate in a definite direction, rather than letting it flow naturally. Despite this the issues are tackled incredibly well for a '60s film, with a real sense of hypocrisy shown to be the main problem rather than just open racism. As I said, Joey's parents are all for black equality until their daughter confronts them with her black fianc\u00e9, which takes them aback a little, especially Mr Drayton. They have a black maid called Tilly, who brought Joey up, which harkens back to the days of slavery, especially as even the assistant housekeeper, Dorothy, is a young black woman. However the message of the film does appear to be that racism is only something that the older generation experience, as the young people in the film don't seem to be aware there is a problem: Joey can't think that her parents could take issue with her marriage, her fashionable friends, Peter and Judith, are only pleased for her, and don't even mention the colour of John's skin, and the aforementioned Dorothy's (implied) boyfriend is a white delivery boy. Indeed, this gives a strange sense of optimism to the film, that when the older generation are dead and buried, issues regarding race will be a thing of the past. The only people who believe there is a problem are the older people: Joey's parents, the maid Tilly, who thinks Dr Prentice is getting above himself, Mrs Drayton's colleague at the Art Gallery she runs who is appalled at the idea of intermarriage, and John's parents who are typical working-class black people, and think the whole idea is ridiculous. The only older person who breaks this mould is the Irish Catholic priest, Mike, who heavily supports the idea of them being married; because he believes having to fight the prejudice that will follow them will bring them closer together. In fact, the only real obstacle are the fathers of the couple, especially Joey's father, who doesn't object on racist grounds, but on the grounds that he doesn't want his daughter to have all the trouble that such a marriage could cause. As I have said, the characters are also a real strength of this film as they are 3- dimensional and not caricatures, a trap this movie could easily have fallen into. Joey is optimistic and na\u00efve, yes, but at the same time she genuinely loves John, and there is almost a sense that she knows there is a problem, but is trying to ignore it. Dr John Prentice, played excellently by Hollywood's then token black star Sidney Poitier, is noble and dignified, and intelligent, who knows more about the race issue than his bride-to-be, but is also funny and playful. He can also be pushed to his limit, making him very human and not just a 2-D cut-out for the debate to be focused on, and the relationship between him and Joey feels very loving and real. Joey's parents are also loving, both to each other and their daughter, which makes the drama when something comes between them genuinely compelling. Hepburn plays the mother as a woman who struggles with this issue herself, but is determined to accept it to make Joey happy, but who must also fight with her husband, who isn't as accepting as her; Tracy also does a sterling job as the father who just wants what's best for his daughter, and believes she has made a massive error of judgement. The way he makes throwaway racist comments, without meaning any harm, is also very clever and reveals a lot about how racism isn't based on hate but on ignorance. It is also a comedy and so it does have some very funny moments and dialogue, which makes us stop and look at ourselves and our own attitudes towards race. It is a very warm, optimistic film, perhaps a little na\u00efve at times, but cleverly makes the whole situation about love not hatred, and has an incredibly modern feel to it. Of course it does have its flaws, the '60s vibe and references do feel a little dated and laughable now, which is to be expected, but personally I feel they do add a charm to the film, which makes it enjoyable to watch, even if it does occasionally make you cringe. Also as I have said before, the plot device of the marriage only being able to go ahead if Joey's parents agree is a little misguided as it then makes the film more about trying to persuade Mr Drayton to bless the marriage before the day is over, than about the characters' reactions to this news, and it makes the second half of the film drag a little. The last scene is also a little slow, despite the fact it is supposed to be the climax of the entire debate, as Joey invites John's parents to dinner over the phone, when he hasn't told them his fianc\u00e9e is white, and they all have to sit down together, but it just seems to drag as they all just re-discuss and recycle everything they've already said, and the ending does feel a little anti-climactic. Also there is a strange backstory that John had been married before but lost his wife and son in an accident, which has no bearing on the story and is never really raised again. The word 'negro' is also bandied about a bit too much for a modern audience to be comfortable with, and the 'n' word is said once, only by the black maid, but considering a white person wrote the script, it's enough to make you shudder. Apart from this though, it is a very well-written film that feels startlingly modern in the way it handles the 'race-issue', whose message is of course that black people should be treated as people, not black people, which is shown through the representation of John and Joey's parents being almost parallel versions of each other, suggesting that we are all the same underneath the skin. It avoids being stereotypical in the way it deals with the issues raised, and the characters avoid being 'types' or caricatures, and above all it is a brilliant family drama that also explores the relationships within families, and how nobody behaves perfectly when pushed to their limits. Overall, a film that still remains relevant today and handles the debate it sets up sensitively and with an optimistic outlook that things will improve, as long as the younger generation from both races continue to break down the barriers previous generations have set up.",

He has only one problem -- he's black.  If he was just an \"ordinary\" black guy (or ordinary white guy for that matter), then the tough decision Tracy needs to make would be moot.  Because the ONLY thing he can object to is Poitier's race, the movie works.I'm surprised that the Oscar was not given to Tracy posthumously. Katherine Hepburn's performance was just OK, but Tracy stole the picture.  Even Poitier was \"as expected\"--low key, intense, and likable.Tracy's speech at the end of the picture nearly brought tears to my eyes. It was both moving and humorous, and delivered with honesty and passion.I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars.",

Joey Drayton was my favorite not only because she was pretty attractive but she played the role really well, falling in a love with a guy and hoping her father approves. John Prentice was also very good and he respected her. Their mothers to me were basically the same person. The father of the girl was a typical father of a girl being skeptical of a daughters decision but especially because he was African American. Overall the movie was OK and not at all what i expected.

First of all, it's so incredibly TALKY. I've seen very few films, even those faithfully adapted from stage plays, where the actors spend so much of their time standing or sitting around, drinks in hand, engaging in faux-Socratic dialog on this or that. And to think this was written directly for the screen by the same man who wrote the manic \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\" and the slapstick-y \"The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!\" A second problem is the performances. I was a huge fan of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and feel that Sidney Poitier is one of the greatest living actors. Yet in this film, we see none of the verbal sparks that Hepburn and Tracy generated in other films (notably \"Pat and Mike\") and precious little of the fire that Poitier is capable of. To be fair, Tracy's illnesses (diabetes, among others) almost certainly reined in his performance. But the other actors didn't have that excuse.Unfortunately, films that deal with contemporary social issues often don't last. \"In the Heat of the Night\", for example, while very fine as a murder mystery, seems overblown in treating racism, and the southern characters (except for Rod Steiger's wonderfully complex police chief) are paper-cutout caricatures. That same sad fate has befallen \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\".",

When Joey brought home John, her black fianc\u00e9, her mother was shocked, but then accepted it because of Joey's happiness. Joey's father, Matt, would not give his approval because of the ridicule the couple would face and the struggle they would go through. John's parents had similar reactions. In the end, the parents gave their children their blessings. This seems very unrealistic. Times were changing, but there weren't there yet. Some people still have a hard time accepting interracial couples now. There is great dialog in this movie and Heptburn and Tacy are wonderful.",

In my opinion, (the opinion of a 20-year-old college student who considers himself a casual film enjoyer, so take my opinion with a HEAVY grain of salt), films such as \"Imitation of Life\" (1934) do a better job of depicting and changing the conversation around race-relations in The United States. \"Imitation of Life\" (1934) is over 30 years older than \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), and, (once again) in my opinion, does a better job of convincing the audience of the desired outcome.Many films that seek to push a viewpoint, no matter how moral, apolitical, humane, or anything else of that nature, tend to be very 'in your face'. For instance, think of not agreeing with a late-night comedian. The laugh track is directed at YOU and all fo the jokes become about how ignorant you must be. In the case of \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), the film does a great job of developing characters in a way that you feel for them and respect their viewpoints. Allowing you to see yourself in the characters and feel respected, no matter which opinion you may have on the interracial couple.",

This film was filled with love from every member of John and Joey's family. Although there were members of their families that may not have been too supportive but it was never due to racism, it was due to the fear of what John and Joey would go through because of racist individuals they may come across. The parents were my favorite parts of the film. The love that the parents had for their child showed immensely throughout the film, there was no judgement of their child's choices. There was actually the opposite, the parents had respect for their choices and were proud of the individuals they raised. Although there were negative people in the film such as Tillie and Hilary, they represented two different ends of the spectrum. Tillie, a black woman, represented the reaction of a black person who may not feel as though an interracial marriage could happen and was judgmental of the idea of a black man marrying into a wealthy white family and getting the same respect that she would give the white people she worked for. Where as Hilary represented the racism that was occurring at that time. Hilary never accepted the possibility that the interracial couple could be accepted, her only explanation for what was going on was that something was wrong with Joey and that she was in danger. Joey's mother not only shot down the idea that there was something wrong with her daughter but also removed Hilary from the families life which also removed the racism from the film. Although this may not be an accurate representation of what many happen in this time I found it to be refreshing to have a black man portrayed as a doctor rather than someone who cleans for a white person and to have white people look at a black man as an equal and eventually as part of their family.",

Cramer shines a light on prejudice by focusing on how discriminatory attitudes and views effect even the most isolated situations, such as the potential marriage of an inter racial couple. Sidney Portlier and Katherine Houghton play a young couple (Dr. John Prentice & Joey Drayton) who unexpectedly visit Joey's parents, with news that the two plan to be married. But once Joey's parents find out John is black and Johns parents that Joey is white, chaos consumes the household. The film explores the dynamics between the couple and their families as their fathers object to the marriage. It is specifically interesting that the film chose to portray Mr. Drayton as a liberal who has publicly fought against injustice and racism in his local newspaper, yet doesn't feel comfortable with his own daughter marrying outside of her race. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" does seamless job of exploring the United States varying points of view and stereotypes of the time on a smaller scale. Although there are serious messages of hypocrisy and prejudice, as well as true love, there is a mixture of genuine comedy throughout. I enjoyed all the performances, especially Sidney Poitier as Dr. Prentice and Katherine Hepburn as Mrs. Drayton.

This is good because it means there was not much moving around or action, which is good for character development because they are not dying, it also means more dialogue. This allows the audience to see how the characters were all somewhat dynamic and complex. Every character changes throughout the film, some more than others. I liked this because it allows the audience to acquire a sense of compassion for each character, and allows them to see the point of view of another side. This may now affect that person in the audience to look at their neighbors differently and be less ignorant.The acting was also phenomenal and I think that this movie is so powerful because it was current affair.

            "content": "Although the setting of the film is unusual (one would have never seen a black man with a white woman) for the time, it is an excellent example of interesting issues that carry over to today's world of racial awareness. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the maintenance of stereotypical characters while at the same time making advances for the portrayal of African American people in films. This is especially present in the characters of Tillie and John. John represents the new type of character that achieves almost entire equality, while Tillie represents the old \"Mammy\" character that is caring, affectionate, strong, and wise.From the interactions between these two characters it is clear that Tillie represents the old point of view that interracial couples are bad and John and Joanna represent the new emerging wave of people that feel differently about interracial couples than those who raised them. At the end of the film Mrs. Prentice appeals to Matt Drayton and talks some sense into him. She shows him that race is not as big of a deal as they had all thought and that both John and Joanna's parents have been wrong. This shows the advancement of African Americans from servile roles to roles in which they are not belittled by their white co-stars.",

Though, now a days, no one would be iffy about their daughter marrying a Yale graduate and a doctor, but back then it was different. His career path and what he was involved in definitely did help him in ways, but for both sides of the family, they were more concerned with the fact that one was white and one was black. This was a common shared feeling back then. This is both a romantic film about love, but it is also a comedy I feel. There are funny parts in it, even though the subject matter is serious. I enjoyed this movie a great deal and I would recommend seeing it!",

The fact of the matter is, the real world would have been much different for this couple than what is portrayed on screen. The audience is never given a chance to see all the problems that are discussed for 2 hours in the movie. Kramer was forced to play to his audience of mainly white theater-goers, and had to sugar-coat his portrayal of interracial marriage.

This is a really good movie on a couple of levels. First, for the time frame (and forgive me, I wasn't actually alive when this came out), it is a nice \"transition film\" that subtley speaks out against the ridiculous attitudes of many upper middle class families concerning their biogtous ways. No matter what positions they claim to have taken (and Tracy's character is embroiled in his own claim to be a champion of the civil rights movement), their real attitudes are only expressed \"when it happens to them\" (e.g. your daughter wants to get married to a black man...how do you feel about this?). Secondly, the acting is great. It evicts emotions. You see the the men because they are interrupting true love and you cheer for the women, because they crusade to put their offspring first. Even the married couple is expressed differently. Joey is a naive soul who believes her parents are the best thing since sliced bread. John is a fighter. He's the most sincere fellow you'd meet, but he knows what he wants and he's not afraid to speak his mind to anyone (while at the same time not wanting to step on Drayton's toes about the situation). The ending is classic: It doesn't \"sell out\" to the plot and it makes me admire the days when Spencer Tracy was king and regret that this film was his last.",

This movie is not my generation and I could not identify that it had some of the most well-known actors of its time like Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn. Though it was dealing with a sensitive topic of its times, it was handled very delicately by both the script-writer and the director.But the handling of the issue was not the high point of the movie for me. What amazed me after watching this movie was the honesty with which it was written. Ignoring 1-2 digressions, the plot stuck to what it had to convey. The sequencing and the flow of scenes made sense, and I must add that it is not easy to do this in such low-decibel drama movies. It was an emotional ride for all the character's involved, except maybe Joey who for her age had to be shown as a young immature young woman who could not see beyond her love. The dialogue were straight to the point - I don't remember a single dialogue which was out of line or not relevant. It was a good clean script. Near-absence of background music added to the drama and am guessing it created an environment that Mr.Stanley Kramer intended. Well, he succeeded.I could recognize only Mr.Sidney Poitier and he delivered a powerful & straightforward character performance. While reading some other reviews I realized that this was Mr.Spencer Tracy's last movie and that too with Katharine Hepburn with whom he had an off-screen love affair. The veterans pulled this one off with amazing simplicity. The last scene where Mr.Tracy delivers his speech was a fitting culmination to the emotional drama that unfolded in the previous 90-95 minutes.To summarize, GWCTD is a good clean Sunday afternoon cinema which I would recommend to anyone. 8 out of 10 for me.",

I thought the fathers speech at the end was the perfect touch. I feel like he said everything just right and really let the audience know how he truly felt.

I won't tell you how anything ends, but you'll know by reading the description anyway... let's jump in.\nThis movie is trite, boring and repetitive. The parents in this film are opposed to their daughter's marriage to a guy they literally met hours ago? Subconscious racists I guess. If I become a parent, I am not giving my kids my support if the decide to marry someone I've never met before. I don't care if it has great messages about liberalism (it doesn't and I'll explain later), give me characters who make sense. The owners of a liberal newspaper aren't going to be horrified if their daughter wants to marry a black man, they wouldn't care. The couple are brats, they overreact to their parents not wanting to endorse their marriage to a person they don't know.\nAlso, this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The plot goes nowhere and characters are created only to extend the run time. There is an entire scene devoted to buying ice cream. Nothing important happens, the father get mad at a black guy, this doesn't aide the plot, it just makes me hate all the characters more. It serves to scapegoat the parents further for their opposition to what is clearly a rushed marriage.\nNothing exceptional exists in this film. The dialogue is dull, the story idiotic, the cinematography fine and the music forgettable. The only real success is the acting, which I found passable at worst and mildly impressive in specific scenes thus the three as opposed to two stars. Never watch this.\nI think people like this film because it is somehow \"important\". Remember, just because a film has social commentary it is not suddenly flawless and a classic. Make a good movie first, then worry about your social message.\nI hate to be negative so I'll suggest some good films with a similar subject matter so this isn't a complete waste of time for you. Watch Get Out or Twelve Years a Slave for good race commentary combined with excellent film-making and a gripping plot.",

Having only seen this one Hepburn movie she reminded me strongly of Jessica Lang, whose acting I am a big fan of. The screenplay and dialogue were written fantastically and for a movie without much action it had a surprising amount of rising action and suspense. Hepburn laughing at Spencer's lines felt like genuine displays of her warmth toward him and their scene at the icecream place was just perfect. The scene with the maid's daughter and boyfriend seemed incongruent with the rest of the movie and I was exasperated for much of the movie at the frequent scenes of Hepburn's eyes brimming with tears but none coming out; I grew to be impressed by it at the end as it obviously takes some serious skill to pull off (as seen by the multiple tears falling on the daughter's less talented face at the end). I would've liked for the film score to be more involved, though I can't say I can imagine there being a lot of room for more music, and I thought the heated response from Poitier to his dad near the end was a little heavyhanded, like it was written by a white guy that wasn't sure how a black father and son would speak to each other.

Not to mention, for a realistic fiction movie that takes place in the 1960's, its a tad pit unrealistic. Lastly I don't like ow the black father is portrayed in the end making it seem as though he's the only one who doesn't approve when he's the only one who really had a valid reason for not approving their marriage.

            "content": "Race relations dramas starring Sidney Poitier from the 1950s and 1960s generally haven't aged well with Lilies of the Field (1963), The Defiant Ones (1958) and this film in particular seeming patronizing and dated by today's standards. This film has the added weight of featuring Spencer Tracy in his last film role alongside longtime professional and personal partner Katharine Hepburn who would win an undeserved Academy Award for her performance. I would recommend that you watch the five to ten minutes of this film that are just Tracy and Hepburn interacting but failing that I would say go out and watch The Graduate (1967) before stepping near this very much a product of it's time film.\n\nTwenty three year old white girl Joanna Drayton, Katharine Houghton, falls in love with older widowed doctor John Prentice, Sidney Poitier, who happens to be African-American. The two face many obstacles in getting married when they return to the United States as Prentice is determined to earn the approval of Drayton's parents, Matt, Spencer Tracy, and Christina, Katharine Hepburn, who each react differently to the news of their daughter's new romance. Matt is worried about the two of them getting married because they have only known each other for two weeks but Christina is trying her best to win him over. More drama is added to the mix when Prentice's parents are invited to dinner with the family and their own prejudices are revealed.\n\nThe first comment that I must make is that this a poorly made film from a technical standpoint. The sound cuts out at odd times, certain scenes run far too long and often end awkwardly on lines that don't wrap up conversations adequately. I expected at least a basic level of competence from a film that is so famous but this film didn't deliver as it seemed to rely on it's star wattage and the good will that it's intentions brought to the reception of the film to coast by. The film set also looks cheap as I never believed that the exterior of their house or their \u2018view' was even remotely realistic and when considering the fact that this was made in 1967 I'm not as willing to cut it slack as I would be had it been made in the 1950s. This general shoddiness impacted how I viewed the film because it often distracted from the message the film was trying to send and the occasionally effecting performances.\n\nAnother big issue with the film is that it's one of those disgusting pictures that exploits a social issue by presenting two supposedly normal characters who eventually adopt a progressive view that is already held by the majority of the audience. In this way the film preaches to the converted, it is saying something that might have been genuinely controversial or refreshing a few generations beforehand but which was held by the majority of Hollywood in 1967. It's frustrating watch a film be so pleased with itself when what it does really isn't all that special or brave. Adding to my dislike of the way the film chooses to present it's social issue they attempt to equalize whites and blacks by portraying the African-American characters as being equally as prejudiced as Matt and Christina. They never really flesh out this plotline and it feels like a strange deflection from the fact that the majority of racism between white Americans and African-Americans comes from the white Americans.\n\nThere is also something lacking in the performances as Hepburn and Tracy are occasionally a delight to watch but are used too sparingly to save such a weak film and Houghton and Poitier fail to inject any real spirit into their performances. Houghton seems unable to deliver her lines convincingly as she flits about and uses as many hand gestures as her famous aunt does but doesn't possess the dramatic heft or the knowing humor to pull of this act. She and Poitier also fail to generate any chemistry which makes it difficult for us to feel any real dramatic tension because we don't really care if they end up together. The amount of Academy Award nominations this film received was a crime and it is quite obvious that Anne Bancroft deserved the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance in The Graduate (1967).\n\nThe best scenes in the film will only leave you reminiscing about the classic romantic comedies that Hepburn and Tracy appeared in together and in that case I would tell you to see Desk Set (1957) and Adam's Rib (1949) before going near this dud.",

            "content": "It would be completely understandable if anyone criticized this movie for playing it very safe after taking some severe risks at the beginning, and that in doing so the story not only became progressively formulaic; but the characters appeared to be stereotyped and, worst of all, self-contradictory and inconsistent.\n\nThat said, the acting here is undoubtedly more than enough to overcome these issues and redeem them, nay, to totally justify these seemingly nonsensical changes and alterations that happened to some of the characters, most noticeably Matt and Christina Drayton. I have seen a lot of great performances that are able to elevate the characters and even the entire movie in general. But, frankly, I have never seen any performance, no matter how superb it may be, that can convince me of what I considered an unmistakably major flaw. What makes me appreciate the acting, in particular, in this movie is that it opened my eyes to some hidden underlying themes of the movie's story, which are more than fundamental to understand the movie properly. If the fabulously realistic and sincere performances, somehow, didn't do the same for you, I suggest you try you figure out some key themes to consider them as you're watching the movie. Two of the most important themes are; the late resurgence of the inherited awful traditions and beliefs, and the undiscovered hypocrisy. Yes, that's how profound this apparently simple film actually is! Of course, the shift in Matt Drayton's attitude could have been executed way more smoothly and maturely; but the abrupt nature of the changes could be fairly, if not quite easily, taken as a reflection of the character's disorder.\n\nSpencer Tracy, in his final role, gave, for lack of a better word, a mature performance that made his character surprisingly believable despite its outwardly incompatible attitudes that made the character of Matt Drayton seem to be immensely problematic. Sidney Poitier's performance, as the handsome African-American Dr. John Prentice, is solid, steady, committed, engaging and relatable at the same time. Katharine Houghton captured the rebelliousness, impetuousness, and also the innocence of her character, Joey, so perfectly. She reminded me quite a bit of another Katharine; Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson in The Graduate, which was, also coincidentally, released at the same year, 1967. But it's Katharine Hepburn who stole the show here with her Oscar-winning performance that I personally consider as one of the best low-key performances in a leading female role I've ever seen in film!\n\nI would be lying if I said that I found the second half of the movie half as entertaining and riveting. Nevertheless, the dialogue was much better at the second half (the final monologue is simply remarkable!) as it was at the first, which is noticeably elevated by, once again, the incredible acting.\n\nThe movie is decidedly filled with stereotypical characters, but the only one that bothered me is the maid, Tillie, whom I didn't find to be funny at all; actually she is quite annoying. Her character's motivations and attitudes are justified, though.\n\nGuess Who\u00e2(TM)s Coming to Dinner is an essential classic 1960s film, and one of the best films that examine prejudice and racism; it tackles its weighty themes with surprising depth, humor and breeziness. It's also very relevant nowadays. And there is no doubt that it has major influences on hundreds of movies that came after it, especially today's.\n\n(8.5/10)",

Pride of race is unnecessary and often leads to a sense of superiority over other races, or a need to ascribe to victimhood.

Not only does the movie manage to be interesting, it is delightful for the entire runtime. There are so many moments that will stick with me because they made me laugh, cry, or cheer. The movie includes people who are on every side when it comes to views on interracial relationships, so it feels like it should speak to all audiences (except the Hilary St. George\u2019s of the world who can shut up and go away.) There is so much heart to this movie, because the characters clearly love one another dearly. Fathers and mothers love their children despite everything, husbands and wives love one another more than they can say, and even friends are loved like family. I felt like this entire movie embraced me like a warm hug, despite the hot-button issue that is at the center of it all. One big reason Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner is so successful is that amazing cast. Sidney Poitier has immeasurable charm and uses it to make the point that he\u2019s just a man and he shouldn\u2019t be defined by his color. He makes for a nice grounded counterpoint to Katharine Houghton\u2019s bubbly lightness. Katharine Hepburn is astounding, and says so many things with just her eyes. You can see her opinions change as the film progresses without her needing to say how she\u2019s feeling. Spencer Tracy is left with one of the toughest roles of the whole movie. It is remarkable how he is able to be the main character who is opposed to the wedding, sounding like a complete hypocrite, and yet still be sympathetic. Roy Glenn and Beah Richards don\u2019t get as much screen-time, but their impact is vital to the film as well, and they both get important scenes when they arrive. Not to mention Cecil Kellaway who had one of my favorite moments in the entire film. I know there will be audiences who will not gravitate to this style of movie. Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner establishes its premise early and then spends the rest of the time with characters just talking it through. It feels like a stage play because so much of the film takes place in one house, and there is not much action aside from walking around. The closest they come to a stunt was a fender-bender between two cars at an ice cream parlor. However, when the dialogue is written this well, I don\u2019t care one bit. I was riveted as much as I am watching Die Hard. I can\u2019t say enough about the big speeches in this movie. Almost every character in the film gets their moment to let loose with a monologue at some point. They are written so well that they help define the character who is giving the speech, and also articulate an important point related to the central conflict of the film. I don\u2019t know how much more I can say about Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner. It blew me away, and I now need to own it so I can watch it 10 more times at least.",

Insurance didn't want to cover this film (rumors of Tracy's health) so both Hepburn & Kramer put up their own salaries as collateral. It seems that they all wanted this film to be made.\n\nSecond, Hepburn earned the 2nd of 4 Oscars with this effort late in her life. I imagine she treasured this one as a gift from Spencer. Of course it was also interesting to see two Katherines on screen - with identical hair no less! Mother & daughter parts in the script were actually cast with an Aunt & Niece in real life!\n\nPoitier's gives another stellar performance to rival his Oscar winning performance in \"In the Heat of the Night\", which was the same year. Alternating between the well-mannered, educated, modern man and the sheepish, procrastinating son-of-a-mailman comes off seamlessly within his character.\n\nOf course having Isabel Sanford among the cast was also genius. As for the story-telling, this is about social NIMBYism. Can families stay together when they must prove that their personal code of conduct is identical to idealized goals. Can a person who has tragically lost a family fall deeply in love again, and will that love be as solid as the life-long love of elderly parents that cherish a lifetime of memories?\n\nThis film is still a pressure-cooker analogy of modern society.",

            "content": "Representing the swan song of Spencer Tracy and solidifying Sidney Poitier's resume, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is an examination of the changes going on during the mid to late 1960's. The film has a very basic premise in which young Joey (Katherine Houghton) comes home from a trip to Hawaii with John Prentice (Poitier) to meet her parents (Tracy and Katherine Hepburn). What follows is the conflicted feelings that go along with the changing times of the 1960's. John will not marry Joey without the consent of her parents. Her parents are unsure about giving consent, not due to their own racism, but due to the fear of how difficult their life will be as an interracial couple. Added in are the two cents of everyone around the family. True, this can be a comedy at times, but it's more a look at the old guard facing the new guard.\n\nDirected by the legendary Stanley Kramer, the film represents a kind of social experiment. Let's drop '60's progressivism on the nuclear family of the 1950's (although the privileged life of the Drayton's is far from nuclear). The Drayton's are not conservative minded individuals, but very left leaning. Still, they fear for their daughter and how that current state of the world would react to them. Tracy delivers his final performance with a flourish and considering his death was imminent brings even greater power to his role. Add to the fact that this is one final pairing with Katherine Hepburn makes it even more bitter sweet. Hepburn also mesmerizes on the screen as the mother giddy over her daughter's upcoming nuptials, yet fearful at the same time. Once again Poitier proves that he is one of the greatest actors of this era, a witty and likeable presence that thinks things out for the protection of others. The only real negative of the film is Houghton's performance as Joey, which comes across as very snotty and annoying. Whether it was written this way or not, you can almost feel like maybe John would be better of with not being tied to her in some instances.\n\nI asked myself a question while watching this film. Have we moved forward in the last half century compared to our ideals? In some ways we have. Interracial marriage is not illegal in seven states, as the film reminds us. There's very little stigma related to it anymore, other than the old school and uneducated. The thing is that it feels like where we have progressed as a society, we're still slipping in other areas. To avoid making this review an ideology discussion I'll stop there. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a time capsule of the '60's and represents one of the greatest psychological battles of all time. When your ideals come home how are you going to react?",

If you were to make the same movie about Gay marriage, it would raise a lot of the same questions.  It's an honest look at the issue of inter-racial marriage from 1967, when civil rights battles were flaring up all over.

            "content": "The film Certainly had its impact at the time of its release, 45 years later, it is still compulsively watchable and if one swap the interracial couple with a gay couple everything would work effortlessly and even no big change of the dialogues is necessary.\n\nThe ensemble is the quintessence of the film's success, personally I adore Poitier's well-educated mien and his eloquent rebutting of his father's parochial opinion of offspring's duty to conduct what parents think is right, evade from social prejudice and merely follow the leader. But in lieu of the plot, John (Poitier) and his white-skin trophy wife-to-be Joey (Houghton) have to recede to a morally-low position, William Rose's script has proffered all the possible (and impossible) approaches to dramatise the situation (a 15 years age difference) and pressure the judgment call should be resolved within the meagre time span (half day at most).  \n\nThus, the entire climax is the father of the bride Matt's (Spencer Tracy) decision (it seems a bit racist their black counterpart has little saying in this condition), the professed liberal white man's crucial decision is the game changer seeing that his wife Christina (Hepburn) has capitulated long ago and \"completely sympathetic\", has firmly chosen her side of her mollycoddled daughter. So Matt's ultimate 8-minutes soliloquy (prefaced by a self-affirmation \"I will be a son of b****\") not only has its power of wisdom and appeal to be an excellent showpiece of ethical preaching, a cordial and visceral performance merits standing ovation, but also in the nonfictional life, Tracy's ailing health and his fervid love for Hepburn (out of marriage) are tangible and heart-wrenching, in the coda of his swan song, it reaches a pinnacle by his declaration of love and it is an impeccable curtain call both on and off screen (Tracy died weeks after the filming). \n\nHowever, it is Hepburn, won her third Oscar together with Rose's Best Adapted Screenplay win (out of its overall 10 nominations) while Tracy's posthumous recognition come unstuck. With a borderline leading role among a peerless cast, Hepburn's win might be an overrated adulation, nonetheless it is no slander could smear the performance itself, it is her competency is shortchanged. Houghton, the real niece of Hepburn and a debutante in the film business, tackles with an unsympathetic role out of her naivety, she is reckless and selfish enough to put her parents into such a difficult situation, but it is what the storyline requires, so what left for her to subjectively interpret is very limited. \n\nSupporting players are also commendable, Kellaway and Richards are nominated as well (the stereotyped good persons with high moral conscience, admirable and amiable), but Sanford's biased black maid's opinion behooves much more introspection towards the innate frailty of human race, love guides us and love blinds us too.\n\nThis almost one-apartment cramped family drama even now has its pertinent social reference, which is a sad truth to accept, just wish Tracy and Hepburn will not be disappointed up there in Elysium.",

Rated 4 thanks to the brilliant performances as usual from Tracy, Hepburn, and Poitier. I like the fact that the film revolves on the racial issue, a bold move considering it was made in the era where prejudice against african-american still prevailed. Title sounds comedic, but I'd consider it more of a drama. Humour is still there, mostly found in dialogues between Hepburn-Tracy duo. Not rated 5 since the setting is a little bit dull, It'd be better if they could like go outside more often rather than just staying around the house all-day-long (except the one time Hepburn-Tracy drive for a takeout).",

            "content": "There was one thing that I took away from this picture above all was the fact that we are all colourless human beings and love is just, simply, can happen between the most different, yet seemingly similar people. \r\n\r\nWhat inspired me to watch this movie was not the strong theme that resonates throughout the play, but the fact that it was really the comeback of legendary actress Katharine Hepburn to motion pictures and away from televised feature films. The true star of this movie is however not Hepburn, but is in fact Sidney Poitier who plays Dr. John Prentice, a renowned medical physician and effortlessly well-mannered black fellow who falls in love with not just any girl - but a white and privileged one - whom transfixes on the idea of introducing the pair to her affluent parents as a 'madly in love' couple. However, this is to the dismay of the girl's father, portrayed by Spencer Tracy in his Oscar-nominated and final film role and initially her mother Christina whom stress that they won't have a \"dog's chance\" of curbing prejudice and blinded bigotry. Katharine Houghton - real life niece of Hepburn - marks her first feature-length picture as the eccentric and quirky Joey. \r\n\r\nI understand that there is severe criticism for this picture by not only representing the harsh white superiority values of the time but the significantly low position women held during 1960s America. Almost every leading female character in the picture is suppressed by men and deemed either irrational or foolish. But I believe this serves as an ideal way of interpreting the society of America in 1967 and not only the shameful mistreatment of African-Americans at the time but of women also - regardless of color. The disproval of Hepburn being awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress is also something of controversy surrounding this picture. Although Hepburn's character was stunningly portrayed, the role of her partner, was of more deserving higher critical appraise. \r\n\r\nThis film is not just a part of cinematic history, but world history. Historically, during the filming and release of this picture, 17 US states outlawed interracial marriage and it was only until June 1967 - two days after Tracy's death - that this was repealed. Tracy's ill health was prominent during the later sections of the film; in particular, the bathroom scene before the \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" punch line takes full effect to a very deeply saddened a teary Hepburn.",

I think it does a marvelous job at looking at the issue of race and it forces its characters to confront the issue, revealing their own prejudices in the process, despite their denials of such prejudices. It's a beautifully made and very compelling film that didn't let me go until it was over. I was captivated from beginning to end since the story is phenomenal, the acting is superb, I loved the humor, it's heartwarming, it's emotional, and it also gets its messages across beautifully. It's one of the best dramas I've ever seen and I highly recommend it if you love a good drama.",

Joanna Drayton has fallen in love with a doctor she met only 10 days before and wishes to get married. Obviously, her parents played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, are startled by this whirlwind event. They are even more dismayed when they discover he is a black man. Hepburn's character lightens to the idea while her husband is adamantly against it. Soon everything becomes even more complicated when the man's parents are invited to dinner, only to be equally startled. Eventually giving it more thought, Tracy does condone the marriage realizing how much his daughter is in love. This would be Tracy's final film and he would die only a couple weeks after shooting ended. He and Hepburn do a wonderful job with Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hougton as well. This movie is good and also monumental for the racial issue it covered.",

For instance, there was one scene where John was saying to Matt that their child could become the Secretary of State, if not the President. Now the rest was history. The President of the United States was a biracial kid who would be exactly like their kids but was already 6 years old at the time when the film was made! Also, although race is the central issue in the movie, I find it interesting to look at the gender dynamics as well. In fact, the idea in the film that I entertain most is that men tend to create problems, and women tend to solve them. Think about that.",

Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katherine Hepburn deliver so well that the movie already seems like a weird dark comedy about an issue blown way out of proportion (even the characters that think it ought to be a non-issue understand that it's nearly the end of the world).  It's fascinating for that reason alone -- even if it's not a 100% accurate portrayal of the time, it still reveals how much something like this in a general sense mattered in this era (which certainly is accurate).\n\nSince I'm writing this in 2011, I should say that coincidently this movie may stand the tests of time to a later date than anything released this year (it was a weak year for film), which is something else the detractors should note.\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is great entertainment, and it's pretty smart during the front half.

But this is merely a one-sided view at the whole picture. True, it does have its fallacies - a love story where the plot deviates to a Stoic discussion on masculinity and the duties of a father (in the aforementioned scene). However, right from the start, Kramer has cleverly mixed comedy and drama into one superb potion, and that potion is of course the film.\n\nIt has a genuine love song (\"The Glory of Love\"), though not an original; Oscar-worthy performances not only by Hepburn and Tracy (in his last role), but also by the leads Houghton and Poitier; and last but not least, a genuinely moving monologue delivered by Tracy's character (the last in his entire career), that puts to shame all the other so-called \"heart-piercing\" monologues in other sentimental films. What this film does not have in excess is sentimentality, and that, as experience should prove, is something that should be so in a tale like this. A liberal drama clashing against the ways of the times, and a love story that should be watched by those into the genre. With one major weakness - everything, including Prentice's record, is a clean bill. Everything seems too perfect. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner takes place during the course of one day as two families struggle to overcome their concerns about the interracial marriage of their children. This film is a treat for the eyes with lovely sets and beautiful people. It also has a nice 1960's feel that is reinforced by sophisticated wardrobing and an \"easy listening\" soundtrack--featuring The Glory of Love as the signature tune. The film relies very heavily on the use of dialog and reflects the elegance of a time when people were entertained by stimulating conversation. The San Francisco backdrop also is the perfect setting for a movie that challenged racial convention.\n\nBut there are a few serious flaws. This is an introductory role for Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece) who plays Sidney Portier's fianc\u00c3 (C)--Johanna Drayton. Her inexperience is apparent, particularly in comparison to heavyweights Portier, Tracy and Hepburn and as a result, she is unconvincing in the part. Moreover, her character is not well-written or well-developed which makes it difficult to understand why Sidney Portier's character--John Prentice-would fall in love with a woman who appears to have so little to offer intellectually --given his significant professional achievements as a doctor. One also must ask why it was necessary for his character to be cast as a doctor in order to be seen as an acceptable partner for a young white woman who had not really accomplished anything accept being born into a privileged family. The answer is simple. Making Prentice a doctor-and not just any doctor-but a world renowned expert in tropical medicine, made the interracial relationship more acceptable to white audiences during the 1960s.\n\nThe other cast members are outstanding and the on-screen chemistry phenomenal. Katharine Hepburn (Christina Drayton) and Spencer Tracy (Newspaper Publisher Matt Drayton) deliver brilliant performances as Johanna's parents. John Prentice's modest working class parents are played with great dignity by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glen. Mrs. Prentice and Mrs. Drayton favor the marriage and both characters provide passionate, articulate arguments as to why their husbands should agree. But their husbands voice serious objections and the families spend the evening in intense discussions over the issue, accurately reflecting the racial fears that existed 40 years ago. Prentice's father reminds him that in many states interracial marriage is illegal and that he is \"getting out of line.\" There are also a number of very memorable and funny lines. In the scene in which Matt Drayton wonders why \"the colored kids dance better than the white kids\", Portier's response is classic--\"you dance the Watusi, but we are the Watusi!\"(For readers under 40, the Watusi was a popular dance in the 1960s and also an African tribe). Cecil Kelloway, who plays friend of the family, Monsignor Ryan, deftly brings a sense of humor and moral guidance that is effective because it is not \"preachy\". He challenges Matt Drayton's liberal credentials and suggests that Drayton's misgivings about his daughter marrying a black man reveal his hypocrisy. Isabel Sanford (\"Weezy from The Jeffersons TV program) plays the feisty maid of the Draytons.\n\nIt's been said that in the final scene Tracy--who was very ill at the time and who died shortly after the movie was completed--delivered one of the longest soliloquies in American film history, in only one take. Katherine Helpurn was clearly so moved by the scene that it's hard to believe that she is just acting as her eyes brim with tears.\n\nAlthough the some of the sentiments are dated, this film is highly entertaining, and provides a rare opportunity to experience outstanding performances from six gifted actors who bring compassion and depth to Stanley Kramer's film. Its' angst relative to interracial marriage also reminds us of how far we have not come.",

For what's it's worth, I'll just say right off the bat that no matter what, this was, is, and always will be a film worthy of serious thought and discussion, and that's one of the biggest compliments I can give to it or any movie. \n\nThe story is one about interracial love. Dr. John Prentice is a successful, kind, and sensitive African American who, depsite only knowing her for 10 days, has fallen in love with a nice young white girl girl named Joey Drayton. His parents are working class, or at least were. Her parents are wealthy upper class old line liberals. The plot of the movie concerns John and Joey going to see her parents to tell them of their intentions to marry as soon as they can due to his demanding schedule, and of course, their approval. \n\nThe movie examines various perspectives concerning the issue of interracial marriage, whichwhen the film was being made was illegal in 17 states. Within several months that was no longer the case, but the time period was still rife with tensions as the country was dealing with Civil Rights and Vietnam. The film is dated to an extent, even though in some places the central issue of the film is actually still cause for some concern. Modern audiences however, would proably have more of an issue with the fact that John and Joey have only known each other for 10 days though.\n\nThe film is to be commended for at least treating the subject seriously and in a dramatic manner, though there is some humor here and there to keep the film from being too heavy and pretentious. The writing does have some faults, such as John being presented as pretty much flawless and maybe a tad Uncle Tomish (maybe to make the film more comfortable for white audiences), and their love is shown as pure and chaste, but it does touch upon black on black racism, even if the film really comes off as more about white guilt, oh, and the ending. \n\nThe film does play it safe at times, but that's mostly the hindsight talking. I understand that this was a risky film when it came out, and I'm thankful it was made to begin with. Where this film shines and is at its best is with the acting. This is the strongest part of the film. There's an overflow of monologues here, but the dialogues are engaging and well done. Poitier is really good as Prentice though, as I mentioned, his character is maybe too perfect. Katherine Houghton is really good as Joey, I loved Isabel Sanford as the Drayton's black maid who really sticks it to John. Everyone usually makes the boiggest deal though about Hepburn and Tracy. This was their final film together, and his final film period (he died 17 days after filming wrapped). During his final monologue, the tears in Hepburn's eyes were real as both she and him knew that because of his poor health, this would be the last work he'd ever do. The final scene is powerful and moving enough as is, but this knowledge makes it even more so. \n\nThis is an entertaining film, and it tries to do something and say something, but I really had a hard time with it, mostly because I was watching it (and am reviewing it) with two different mindsets (scholar studying black history and regular film fan) running simultaneously, thus my opinion about it is mixed, though I'm trying to find a middle ground. \n\nFor those reasons, and the reasons I've lsited throughout this review, I gotta be fair and gve this one a straight B. I do encourage you to see it, but I do think that it could have been better, no matter how risky it was back then. Like I said, at least it got made in the first place.",

This time the subject was the ticklish one of inter-racial marriage ( it was in the 1960's when interracial marriages in a few states in the USA were illegal.)\r\n\r\nIn 1967's San Francisco, after the Civil Rights Act has been signed but before Martin Luther King has been assassinated, young Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) arrives back at her parents' upscale home after being away for a while.  She wanted to marry a black , and albeit  the daughter of ultra-liberal parents, their principles put to a severe test. Her parents, the prominent liberal newspaper owner Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) and his elegant wife Christina (Katharine Hepburn) are delighted to see her but are suddenly taken aback when she reveals that she's had a new boyfriend for 10 days, he's 14 years older, she's in love, she's going to marry him, and she needs their blessing tonight. Oh, and he's 'colored.' As Joanna blithely explains, 'It never occurred to me that I would fall in love with a Negro, but I have, and nothing's going to change that.'\r\n\r\nOf course, Sidney Poitier is an ideal choice: An internationally respected specialist in his field (medicine), impeccably mannered, handsome, well-dressed, and a descendant of a respectable California family. What more could a mother want for her child? Of course, our daughters could marry nice black doctors like Poitier.\r\n\r\nForty four years old now, the issues it dared to raise at a time when they were extremely controversial still echo across the decades. It's dated a bit, but to watch it today is to measure how far we've come.\r\n\r\nSubject matter aside, the film surely owed much of its popularity to the appearance in it of Hepburn and Tracy as the mum and dad of the girl.

Sidney Poitier gives a solid, though maybe a bit too aloof, performance.  Katharine Hepburn is good but Spencer Tracy seems too formulaic in his actions.  Katharine Houghton is irritating as the daughter.\n\nStill, it tells a story that had to be told, and came out when not everyone in the US had the same rights and freedoms.",

You say you don't want to tell me how to live my life. So what do you think you've been doing? You tell me what rights I've got or haven't got, and what I owe to you for what you've done for me. Let me tell you something. I owe you nothing! If you carried that bag a million miles, you did what you're supposed to do! Because you brought me into this world. And from that day you owed me everything you could ever do for me like I will owe my son if I ever have another. But you don't own me! You can't tell me when or where I'm out of line, or try to get me to live my life according to your rules. You don't even know what I am, Dad, you don't know who I am. You don't know how I feel, what I think. And if I tried to explain it the rest of your life you will never understand. You are 30 years older than I am. You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it's got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight of you be off our backs! You understand, you've got to get off my back! Dad... Dad, you're my father. I'm your son. I love you. I always have and I always will. But you think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man. Now, I've got a decision to make, hm? And I've got to make it alone, and I gotta make it in a hurry. So would you go out there and see after my mother? \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTillie: I don't care to see a member of my own race getting above himself. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMatt Drayton: When I had ice cream before, I had a special kind of flavor that I liked very much but I can't remember what it was. \r\nCarhop: I'll bring you the list, sir. \r\nMatt Drayton: Oh no.

I want you to go straight back to the gallery - Start your motor - When you get to the gallery tell Jennifer that she will be looking after things temporarily, she's to give me a ring if there's anything she can't deal with herself. Then go into the office, and make out a check, for \"cash,\" for the sum of $5,000. Then carefully, but carefully Hilary, remove absolutely everything that might subsequently remind me that you had ever been there, including that yellow thing with the blue bulbs which you have such an affection for. Then take the check, for $5,000, which I feel you deserve, and get - permanently - lost. It's not that I don't want to know you, Hilary - although I don't - it's just that I'm afraid we're not really the sort of people that you can afford to be associated with. \r\n[Hilary opens her mouth to say something] \r\nChristina Drayton: Don't speak, Hilary, just... go. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[last lines] \r\nMatt Drayton: Now Mr. Prentice, clearly a most reasonable man, says he has no wish to offend me but wants to know if I'm some kind of a *nut*. And Mrs. Prentice says that like her husband I'm a burned-out old shell of a man who cannot even remember what it's like to love a woman the way her son loves my daughter. And strange as it seems, that's the first statement made to me all day with which I am prepared to take issue... cause I think you're wrong, you're as wrong as you can be. I admit that I hadn't considered it, hadn't even thought about it, but I know exactly how he feels about her and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that you son feels for my daughter that I didn't feel for Christina. Old- yes. Burned-out- certainly, but I can tell you the memories are still there- clear, intact, indestructible, and they'll be there if I live to be 110. Where John made his mistake I think was in attaching so much importance to what her mother and I might think... because in the final analysis it doesn't matter a damn what we think. The only thing that matters is what they feel, and how much they feel, for each other. And if it's half of what we felt- that's everything. As for you two and the problems you're going to have, they seem almost unimaginable, but you'll have no problem with me, and I think when Christina and I and your mother have some time to work on him you'll have no problem with your father, John. But you do know, I'm sure you know, what you're up against. There'll be 100 million people right here in this country who will be shocked and offended and appalled and the two of you will just have to ride that out, maybe every day for the rest of your lives. You could try to ignore those people, or you could feel sorry for them and for their prejudice and their bigotry and their blind hatred and stupid fears, but where necessary you'll just have to cling tight to each other and say \"screw all those people\"! Anybody could make a case, a hell of a good case, against your getting married. The arguments are so obvious that nobody has to make them. But you're two wonderful people who happened to fall in love and happened to have a pigmentation problem, and I think that now, no matter what kind of a case some bastard could make against your getting married, there would be only one thing worse, and that would be if - knowing what you two are and knowing what you two have and knowing what you two feel- you didn't get married. Well, Tillie, when the hell are we gonna get some dinner?",

Sure, had I seen it as a child in the 80s, it probably would have had more of an impact even then. However, I see interracial couples every day and I barely even notice.\n\nHaving said that, you have to respect this movie regardless. Creating a movie like this, with this sort of subject matter, was bold and went against everything that was acceptable at the time ... I have to admire that.\n\nAs far as the movie itself goes, Hepburn, Tracy (in his final role before passing away), and Poitier were all excellent and supported by a stellar script. A movie so dialog driven can only be pulled off with exceptional acting and this aspect carries the movie.\n\nHaving said that, Katherine Houghton's character grated on me and actually took away from the movie. Headstrong and naive, she seemed to make stupid comment after another and made most of the awkward situation worse than it already was.\n\nLastly, after building up this dramatic and powerful scenario, Stanley Kramer sort of cops out in the end. \n\nAnyway, it wasn't an instant classic to me, but as I stated earlier ... that may be because I am from an entirely different era.

Making Sidney Poitier the king of all oreos was one way to accomplish this; by making his character unassailable in any way, the parents are forced to wrestle with their inner misgivings and portrayed as the obstacle (in a funny twist, the black parents are upset at this marriage too).  This movie is obviously not as cutting-edge as it was when it came out, but the production values are strong, acting is notable and the script is well-written, if a little preachy.

The tension is thrown out on the screen for all to see, a perpetual parade of the dirty laundry of the day. It's no holds barred for racial misconceptions, fallacies, and genuine doubt between the families. A true historical record.",

            "content": "Back in 1967, interracial marriage was forbidden in many states. And that was the year in which that law was abolished. Coincidentially (yes, it was a coincidence apparently), that very year an interracial marriage comedy-drama was released to critical acclaim: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. The movie is an interesting and entertaining critic on that subject, but it is as well a heartfelt story with protagonists we can care about.\r\n\r\nKatherine Houghton and Sidney Poitier star as Joanna Drayton and Dr. John Prentice, a white female and a color man who met in Hawai during one of John's university conferences. Despite it was frowned upon at the time, the two fall in love and start a relationship, which, in ten days, develop into a marriage commitment. John feels that Joanna's parents won't accept him, but she assures him they will, therefore they decide to travel to their home so they can meet John. But when they arrive her parents, mostly her dad (played by Spencer Tracy), are against their marriage, though her mother (played by Katahrine Hepburn) later accepts them. But to complicate things, Joanna invites John's parents to dinner. The same case applies here: his mother (Beah Richards) accepts their marriage, but his father (Roy E. Glenn) refuses to give them their approval, even in a harsher way than Joanna's father did. \r\n\r\nIn the world of 2010 we are used to interracial marriages, but in the world of 1967 it was a very but very rare thing to happen, and I think that that is one of the things that makes this film work, the impact it had at the time. Even today I can see the controversy this theme caused, and it is clearly reflected in the character's of this film. It is an interesting subject to aboard, and I think that the makers of this film did it right.\r\n\r\nThe film received one nomination for each of the acting categories, and won for Best Actress for Katharine Hepburn. I think that the nominations are a clear sign that the performances in this film were outstanding, but I do think that maybe a couple of more players deserved to be mentioned: I am speaking of Sidney Poitier, who plays John, and Roy E. Glenn, who plays his father. Both of this actors played magnificently their roles, with the proper sentimental value they had to give to their characters. There is a dialogue between the two that I think it must be the most powerful scene in this film, and it was quite moving. For the other actors most of them played their roles wonderfully too. The only winner, Katharine Hepburn played her character with skills and she certainly shows her emotions, but I still think that the winner that year should have been Anne Bancroft from The Graduate. Spencer Tracy did a terrific job too, getting into his character. I think you can see he is believing all he is saying. Cecil Kellaway (who playes Monsignor Ryan, a friend of the family) and Beah Richards (who played John's mother), were nominated for the supporting roles, and I think they deserve their nominations. But there was one player I couldn't really stand and that was Katherine Houghton. Is not that she was utterly bad, but she was mediocre at best, and some of the dialogues she said sounded too forced and sometimes out of place, but not because of the screenplay but because of her (and I hope I am not being too harsh) making them sound annoying. She is like the central character, along with Sidney Poitier, but there were moments I couldn't stand her.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to be praised in this film is the screenplay, which won at the Oscars. The screenplay is very well written. The characters are nicely done so we can care about, but I think I would have appreciated some more look into the character's past. The situations in this film rank from funny to moving, and many were inspiring and powerful. The dialogues were smartly written, with some sounding out smart, others funny and others charming, and there were a couple which were memorable. Some of my favorites were \"You see yourself as a color man... but I see myself... as a man\" and \"Joey, this might be the last time I have to tell you to do something, and I am doing it: shut up.\" The first one sounds quite inspiring and has alot to do with the film's main themes, and the second one has a charming and funny effect at the same time. \r\n\r\nBut I do have a couple of complains with this film. I already mentioned a couple, as Katherine Houghton and the lack of (or the little of sounds better) character's backgroung. But there are some that I should say. First I think that the themes of racism were taken too lightly, at least until the arrival of John's parents. Until then, I felt that this subject could have been approached in a way that could have had a higher impact, and that maybe this was a key thing for a film that racism is the main item. And then there is another thing. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt that the film was missing something. I don't know what it was, but it felt like a couple of issues had been left on the cutting room. But that aside, it is a greatly entertaining movie.\r\n\r\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is a very enjoyable movie, with some great performances, smart writing, memorable quotes, moving moments and serious themes. It may have a couple of flaws, but in the end the film is very good. \r\nMy recommendation: this is a film you'll most likely enjoy, even if it is not perfect.\r\nMy score: 83%.",
