            "content": "I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it.The Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the \"second world\", which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.In fact, the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?), in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, \"We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that\". Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark \"a smarter film\".Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). It's just a random mishmash of settings and clich\u00e9s, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work), but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. At least in Godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.Still, I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.",

            "content": "I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking \"Where is this happening? What's going on?\" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.",

            "content": "Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you.",

            "content": "True, there are many movies much worse then this movie. This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both.. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.Acting- I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film (next to the ending credits, which played 'Wish I had An Angel', the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well (somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it). Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.The Soundtrack- Except for 'Wish I had An Angel', the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story (something I will get to soon). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.The Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us \"Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies\". At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.The Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud). Then it fast-forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective. He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.Overall, miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0.",

Lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks. The continuity was off through out the entire film. The creatures weren't bad, but they really weren't good either. Bottom line, I want that ninety minutes of my life back.

This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better.

            "content": "The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is \"a cause of abhorrence or disgust.\" If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because this is the best I can come up with. However, I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.I went to see this film with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action/adventure flick guru. This latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark. Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started I knew why immediately.It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. Yet, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie. Yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone.Then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid.The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what is going on? Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? Once again, NO.Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. But then BAM...sex scene. Once again I don't know.A good, oh i don't know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. This is set to a heavy-metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.And if that wasn't enough...There exists no main villain. There is the scientist and there are the \"alien\" things. At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I have no idea.The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the alien things break through? Did the military tell them? Who knows...and by this point who cares? I didn't and you won't.But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And thats right, you guessed it, it the middle of the *&%$ing day and it's bright as can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I don't know and I don't care.Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches of me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my gung-ho action/adventure roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created) admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.To sum up this CRAP-FEST i give it a 0.0/10 and would give it lower if I could.Unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.",

            "content": "I'm in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director Uwe Boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but I have got to say that this horror/action film (apparently based on an Atari video game) is utterly diabolical\u2014far worse than I ever expected (my opinion of Boll had been reasonably high after seeing Rampage, which was surprisingly effective).The long-winded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink: ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs '22 years ago' but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.As the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll's pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater's performance isn't all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn't even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).After much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue ('Some doors are meant to stay shut') and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron's Aliens (the Xenos\u2014yes the monsters ARE called that\u2014obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed.",

To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush.

Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in several countries , but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received lousy reviews. Only recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure/action/horror films or those enjoy in general of the Uwe Boll cinema .The film will appeal to fantasy/SciFi buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Terror/fantasy movies genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because dash horror , action , fights , shots and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact.

            "content": "First off, I haven't played the game 'Alone in the Dark' and this is the first Uwe Boll film I've ever seen. From the reviews I've read, the scathing criticism of Boll I've heard and all the message boards on IMDb, my expectations were way low. Game adaptations are inherently bad, the only exceptions I can think of are 'Mortal Kombat' and the 'Resident Evil' movies (yes, I like Paul W.S. Anderson too).Now that I've killed off two-thirds of IMDb's users by saying the above, let me kill off the rest by saying that I thought 'Alone in the Dark' was quite good. I'm a Christian Slater fan, for starters, and now I'm a Uwe Boll fan too. I reckon, as B-grade movie directors go, the guy's got talent. He handles the sex scene very well (without it being fifteen minutes long and featuring an inordinate amount of nudity and fading in and out all the time) and the film was fastly paced and tight. The visual effects were also amazingly well-done for such a film, the creatures (I forget what they're called) especially.I could overlook the problems with the script and the acting, but only because 'Alone in the Dark' is so suspenseful and genuinely interesting at times. There's never a dull nor slow moment to be found. I reckon 2/10 is rather harsh. I've seen worse films than this; much worse. While it may not sit well with gamers, 'Alone in the Dark' is one of the better B-grade horror films I've seen in years, just as long as you don't take it seriously.",

            "content": "It has only been recently that Uwe Boll's seeming masterpiece, Alone In The Dark, has been available here for rental. It completely bypassed local theatres, and was available on DVD in America at least a year before here, which is rarely a good sign. Unlike Boll's previous effort, House Of The Dead, the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects. The real problem lies in the direction and editing. Articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing Boll's inflated self-opinion and inability to work effectively with collaborators. It seems that this includes actors. Reid and Slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned, but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film. At one point, Slater and Reid appear to be running from the Alien-like creatures of the story through a warehouse. To say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement. This scene could have been more convincing, in fact, if they had been running across a floor with a rear-projection behind them.No, the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing. A sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes. Adding to the film's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow. Said plot basically follows Christian Slater, who looks nothing like the Edward Carnby of the video games, as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them. Exactly where this plot stems from, I do not know, and I have only briefly played one of the games, but I do not remember any of the embellishments Boll has provided (which telegraph themselves with fervor). Compounding the problem is that Boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes. That none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes Boll's incompetence as a director pretty obvious.To hear it from Boll during the featurette, Atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film. The nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to sayabout Boll and his films. The writers of a rejected screenplay for House Of The Dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with Boll. Speaking as a writer myself, this tells me far more about Boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy DVDs made of his lousy films ever could. Adding insult to injury is that Nuclear Blast paid Boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack. If there were justice in the world, Nuclear Blast would be one of the many record labels outselling Sony by a twelve to one ratio. They are innovators, and have released some masterpieces from the likes of Therion or Agathodaimon. That they have to slum it in dreck like this while Sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to Alone In The Dark. I hope that thirty grand could be written off easily.Soundtracks and bad direction aside, the construction of the film is utterly terrible, too. I cannot really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has, but I bet that Uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of Resident Evil. It is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in, and that context needs to make a certain level of sense. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot, but at the very least, Alone In The Dark could have given a small breadcrumb trail, anything to make point A follow logically from point B, so to speak. The idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space, and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone (even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film) is pretty ludicrous. Others have described the patent unbelievability of Tara Reid as an archaeologist, but this is in fact one of the least of the film's problems.I gave Alone In The Dark a two out of ten. As a horror film, it is far too tame to horrify. As an action film, it is too stagnant to move the audience. As a serious acting piece, it has no drama to speak of. Without the lousy or idiotic production decisions, it also loses the unintentional comedy that made House Of The Dead bearable. In essence, it winds up in no man's land. See it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence.",

If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.

            "content": "Whenever people think of Uwe Boll, they think of all of his films that can be considered bad. (If not terrible) And the film that most people point to as one of his worst is the 2005 release \"Alone in the Dark.\" (Heck, it's the one I've seen many claim to be THE worst film he's made... and others claim it to be perhaps one of the worst films of all time.) It's the one that seems to get the most attention. The most publicity. And of course, the most hate.I'm not in that camp, though. Oddly enough. In fact, I'd be willing to argue that despite being a fairly terrible film, \"Alone in the Dark\" to me is arguably one of his best video-game-to-film adaptations. Something about it comes off as borderline \"So bad, it's good\" to me. And I honestly found it to be perhaps the best-directed film in his entire filmography, at least from a visual/composition standpoint.The film follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), as he struggles against various otherworldly threats, including deadly creatures, underground caverns, the delusions of a mad scientist, and other forces. At the same time, he reconnects with an old flame (Tara Reid) and comes to odds with government Bureau 713 and a former comrade. (Stephen Dorff.)The acting is... well. You know. ...bad. Slater is trying and seems to be having a blast, but he's still quite wooden. Reid is amusingly-bad in her attempts to come off as smart and serious. Dorff is probably the best, giving the only performance that seems SLIGHTLY decent. (Though still both over-done and under-done depending on the scene.) And supporting characters are all around the level of \"meh.\"The script is a fairly incomprehensible mess. From scene to scene, you can't really grasp what's happening, what's relevant (or irrelevant), what character motivations are, etc. There's a lot of bizarre leaps in focus and there isn't really any clearly defined focus or main conflict. The film seems to be made up of various meandering subplots that don't quite fit together. In addition, the cinematography is bland. The music is sub-par. Effects range from \"excellent\" (some early bullet-time effects, while tacky, are very well-executed) to \"awful.\" (Some of the creature effects being laugh-out-loud bad.) And there's a lot of little issues here and there throughout the production and presentation.This SHOULD be a 1 out of 10 film for sure. But there's just something about it. I just can't bring myself to give it that score. In part, it's because I do honestly believe that this is one of Boll's better films. And I believe that here, he shows off perhaps the best visual direction of his entire career. It actually has a few really cool shots that are well-composed, there's at least some creativity shown (even though it doesn't work) through attempts to be moody or exciting with key sequences, and it has the most style out of anything he's really done. Don't get me wrong... the film still isn't particularly well-directed. But it seems to have the most effort put in by Boll out of any of his films. It isn't cheap and rushed like \"House of the Dead\", nor overly \"gritty\" and sloppy like everything he's done lately. It looks the most like an actual decently-budgeted movie out of all of his films.In addition, something about this movie strikes me very-much as a great example of \"so bad, it's good.\" Whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts to make characters look smart (giving Tara Reid glasses, for example), or poorly-executed action beats... I find this film very likable and entertaining because of how bad it is. And that counts for something.I think that this is definitely not Boll's worst film at all. I don't even think it's in his bottom-5. I found it amusingly bad, and with a surprising amount of style and effort. And that effort alone makes it better than much of his other work.I give this a very-bad 3 out of 10. Fans of bad movies (like me) should definitely give it a shot. You just might find it entertaining!",

            "content": "The other day my roommate called me up and said he had two complimentary tickets to a special pre-screening to a new moving coming out soon: Alone in the Dark.If the name sounds familiar, it's probably because you're familiar with the video games by the same name. If not, don't worry, although the movie claims to be based off the games (games I know very well), I didn't see any similarities other than the names of the main characters.My friend and I wandered into the theatre and took our seats. Anxiously awaiting the movie. I was especially excited because the game Alone in the Dark ranks in my very exclusive list of all-time scariest games ever...it's only competition is Doom 3. The point is, I was expecting a movie that would scare my pants off and send chills up my spine, much like the first game did back in the early 90s.Before the movie started, a man came out and stood before us, and announced that we were the very first audience ever to see this movie, and he hoped we enjoyed it. The excitement built!The movie started...and it wasn't long before that excitement turned to confusion, and shortly thereafter, disappointment combined with a healthy dose of disbelief.This movie sucked! Plain and simple. The plot was, by far, the worst thing about the movie, followed not too distantly by the dialogue and cheesy acting. The only actor who did a halfway decent job was the main character, Edward Carnby (played by Christian Slater). In fact, I would go so far as to say he carried the entire movie.Please note: From here on, I will be making references to the movie that would be considered spoilers. Even references to how the movie ends. If you actually intend to see this movie even after reading this review, you may want to skip the part about the plot.Let's return to the plot for a moment. (This is where the bulk of the problems lie.) The plot can be summed up through the following words: broken, confusing, irrelevant, uninformed, and poorly written. Why?The movie has practically nothing to do with the games. The games were based off of an investigator who explored various \"supernatural\" phenomena, and became trapped in this haunted mansion. The entire point of the game was to get out of the mansion alive...something that was not so easy to do! The movie didn't take place in a mansion, really had very little to do with the supernatural and more about some sort of alien creatures. It wasn't a psychological thriller with some action interspersed, it was an action flick...and if it attempted to be the former in any way, it failed miserably...so much so I never noticed any elements of it.There were several questions raised in the movie that were never answered or even dealt with for that matter. There was this theme of some ancient civilization which apparently had something to do with these creatures, but it was never explained what the civilization had to do with the creatures, or where (or what) these creatures were to begin with.Several inconsistencies with elements of the movie. For instance (big spoiler ahead). It's established that these creatures cannot exist in the light. They're hurt by sunlight and various other types of light sources. Then, at the end, the main characters climb out of their underground ordeal, appear in the city, during the day, and notice that everyone is missing. (no bodies, no blood, no signs of struggle...just missing). Then, in broad daylight, one of these creatures jumps out at them and the movie ends. ...uh, folks...daylight. It seems the director forgot to pay attention to that little fact. This is one of many inconsistencies in the movie. It's rife with them.There was this (military? police? rebel?) institution called 713 which was apparently hunting these creatures (aliens?) for a while now. It was never established what this organization was, if they were part of the government or not, or anything about them. They just showed up and all the characters in the movie just accepted them as being in charge of things.The love scene. Completely gratuitous! There was no chemistry between the hero and the heroin. In fact, the only way one would know that there was any kind of attraction between them was that it was briefly established in the beginning that they used to be in a relationship. Then, for no apparent reason, in the midst of all this danger and alien creatures in the same building with them, bam. They go at it. Then, as if nothing had happened, the rest of the movie they continue on their way with absolutely no chemistry to the very end.Character Development...there was none.Several points where the movie moved way too fast or way too slow, causing either confusion or boredom. I could go on, I have a whole list of things I disliked about the movie, but I'll stop here. There were a couple good points to the movie, and it's only fair to state them. The introduction was well done and was relatively engaging. I'd go so far as to say the first scene was the best scene in the entire movie (although even that scene had several points to it which raised questions that were never answered or dealt with in any way - adding to the confusion later on). The cinematography in parts was creative and showed a level of quality that was far beyond this film. The special fx held their own and, for the most part, were impressive at points. Alone in the Dark could have followed in the footsteps of the games it was based on, and potentially done an amazing job. The games were incredibly frightening and established a mood of horror and suspense from the moment you started playing till long after you quit playing. This movie did nothing more than leave a feeling of disgust at the pit of my stomach, that it should represent a series of amazing games and fail so miserably at doing so.The sad fact is, my friend and I had the opportunity to see Alone in the Dark for free, and yet, somehow, we both came out of the ordeal feeling cheated.",

Sometimes people like to have something to rag on no matter what - right now, for the Internet film community, it seems to be Uwe Boll - and judging from quotes I've read by him, as well as movies I've seen, he deserves a lot of it.But some of the hatred goes too far. \"BloodRayne\" was already on the IMDb Low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters.I'll give you an example of the exaggeration regarding this film: One critic I read claimed the opening narration went on for nearly ten minutes, however it lasts perhaps a minute at the most.The dialogue is pretty bad, and the beginning with Christian Slater telling a young child on a plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid of the dark is unintentionally hilarious. There are other gems such as, \"Looks like a dead end up ahead. I better take a look.\" Or how about Tara Reid - a supposed archaeologist (hah!) - referring to Newfoundland as \"New Found Land.\" I read here on IMDb that Reid was invited on Jay Leno and wasn't even able to give a definition of her profession in the film.Christian Slater I pretty much just felt sorry for throughout the film - he's such a good actor and his resorting to crap like this and \"Hollow Man 2\" is a real shame. I am still hoping he makes a comeback. For what it's worth his performance here actually rises above the laughable material.The special effects are pretty bad, but once again not nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading some message board posts here.Overall I was expecting something so bad I would have a fun time laughing at it. Unfortunately this film is not laugh-out-loud bad, it's just plain BAD. It's not the worst film ever made - it's not on par with Ed Wood - it is actually just equivalent to most Z-grade straight-to-video flicks out there. If Boll's name had not been attached to the project and it hadn't attracted a theatrical run, I'm sure it would have a slightly higher rating on here and less of a \"fan base\" so to speak.I'm not supporting the film or saying it's remotely good - it isn't - but I am saying it's about as bad as any other straight-to-video horror garbage.I wouldn't recommend it because I didn't even have a fun time watching it for giggles - it's just a really lame film that takes itself way too seriously and perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount of (admittedly ripped-off) style.",

I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.1. Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a \"Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities.\" I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, \"photonic\" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.Jesus, I can't even being to wade through the clich\u00e9d elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which \"fuse\" with the spine of their host)Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug \"didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,\" thank god. Oh, and the people with these \"fused\" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.Not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.",

In the beginning of the movie, there is this long ass text scroll that is like if they took the opening Star Wars scroll and made it as boring as possible and guess what... it makes no sense! As for the main star in the movie: Christian Slater, as bad as he was in The Wizard, he is so much worse here. He isn't even trying here. In fact, no one here in the cast is trying. I hope that those checks contained a lot of 0's. Alone in the Dark contains one of Uwe Boll's most annoying trademarks, and that is the awful action sequences. They are all shot in such boring angels, that I almost fell asleep during them. Plus, they are literally shot in the dark so you cant tell what is happening. The special effects in this movie are so bad, even Stephen Sommers would say \"Damn do those effects look bad.\" There are parts so bad I almost felt embarrassed, like in one scene a soldier was supposed to be dead and yet while people are walking away she lifts her head up. I mean, how did that get past editing? Some people say that Uwe Boll is the new Ed Wood, no, at leat Ed Wood had a passion for filmmaking, Uwe Boll on the other hand just doesn't give a crap. I would say that he is the least talented director in Hollywood, but I believe we all know which infamous duo has earned that title(Hint hint: They directed Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie).",

            "content": "It was inevitable that I'd get around to seeing a Uwe Boll film sooner or later. The German director is widely regarded as a modern day Ed Wood, incapable only of churning out a string of god-awful genre flicks packed with bad acting, worse effects and a complete lack of talent. ALONE IN THE DARK is the title of a popular PC game that went on to spawn sequels and remakes on plenty of other computers and consoles, and this is the filmic adaptation. And it's a pile of pants.You know you're off to a bad start when the opening scrolling text begins. And then goes on. And on. And on. Basically there's more story condensed here than in the rest of the film, and that's because test audiences left confused, wondering what the heck the film was about, and the opening scroll was tacked on afterwards. Then, to my surprise, things got cheesy and quite a bit of fun. We meet up with Christian Slater, playing a muscular, vest-wearing hero type, and watch his encounter with a superhuman skinhead who leaps great heights and takes bullets with seemingly no pain or effect. Boll's direction is hyper and wannabe stylish, and this sequence is a hoot.Then things get really bad, with a muddled story about an evil professor, a museum relic that comes to life and a tactical unit of wannabe SWAT guys fighting monsters. The monsters are bad \u2013 half the creatures seen in HELLBOY, half THE RELIC \u2013 but the slithery worm things that live in people's spines are pretty neat, a nice gross out idea. The film moves on from there with a series of poorly connected set-pieces, all of them predictable and done to death a million times previously. There are explosions, shoot outs and a few mild gore scenes, although one shot of a woman's head split open is pretty near the knuckle.I find it difficult to dislike Slater. He has this nice guy persona in every film I've seen and he seems slick and cool here. Even the bit of crumpet on his shoulder (AMERICAN PIE's Tara Reid) isn't too irritating. Then there's Stephen Dorff, who I last saw in the awful haunted house movie COLD CREEK MANOR, and he isn't bad either, playing a hard-ass commander. Maybe Boll is better at directing actors than he is at directing stories.Anyway, things play out predictably, and it all washes over you with its inanity and pointlessness. Yes, this is a bad film. Is it one of the worst films ever? I doubt that. It's actually on the level of a Sci Fi Original movie, except with a higher budget. 'Pretty trashy' and 'nothing to get excited about' sum up this film nicely for me.",

            "content": "I got what I deserved. I was aware of how apparently everybody on the planet, including Tibetan monks and nomads in the Sahara desert, found this movie terrible. And yet I wasn't wise enough to avoid Alone in the Dark, since I occasionally enjoy having a laugh at the expense of a bad movie. Not here, though.Normally, \"I did not understand the plot\" is not a valid criticism; 90% of movie plots are quite simple - they may be *stupid*, but you do realize what's going on. However, Alone in the Dark is incomprehensible; you more or less get the big picture, but storytelling is such a mess that explaining the finer details of the plot is impossible.While I did expect this stuff to be terrible, I also thought it was going to be funny. Sadly, it's just boring beyond belief: dull exposition, hideous action scenes, an atrocious, ear-splitting soundtrack. Uwe Boll, the German director who appears to almost relish his own lack of talent, creates zero tension - while the old Alone in the Dark games were legitimately creepy in their build-up of atmosphere.Acting is abysmal, but no one could have uttered these dialogues convincingly. Slater, a competent actor in the right role (Very Bad Things, True Romance), appears lost and miserable - he made me miss the mustachioed Edward Carnby of the games, who looked like he was made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Oh, and Tara Reid as an anthropologist? But of course! Look how she inhabits her role... she wears glasses!The result is poorly written, badly directed, not scary, not exciting and - I want this to be clear - not even unintentionally funny. If you want a good sci-fi/horror/action movie about photosensitive monsters, watch Pitch Black. If you want a \"so bad it's good\" flick, again, look elsewhere (the Wicker Man remake!), because Alone in the Dark is not even worth a laugh.1/10",

Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things (like his failed relationship) on his mind. Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons, been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in the history of film. I'm voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I've derived even the slightest pleasure. Frankly, I'm satisfied that he made this stinker. I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with \"Underworld: Evolution\" for ticket sales. Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about.This rates a 1.0/10 rating for this messy, convoluted crap-fest, from...the Fiend :.",

How do I do that about this film without feeling like I'm kicking a limbless child?Edward Carnby (Christian Slater, Heathers) is an occult detective and the star of the video games that you may or may not have played. As a child, he was subject to some intense experiments as he grew up in an orphanage where Sister Clara raised him. As a result, he has a sixth sense and has increased strength and agility. He also used to work for Bureau 713, which protects the world from the paranormal.We learn about Bureau 713 from a long scroll in the beginning that is also read to us. It goes on way longer than it needs to. And then it goes on some more. It may still be running as you read this.He's also investigating the disappearance of the Abkani, who worshipped demons from another dimension, demons who are coming back to ours. His girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid, American Pie) is the curator of a museum which happens to have artifacts from the Abkani. There are also some paramilitary guys who are legitimately wearing paintball armor led by Commander Burke (Stephen Dorff, Blade).The writer of the film, Blair Erickson, summed up the changes Uwe Boll made to the script: \"Thankfully Dr. Boll was able to hire his loyal team of hacks to crank out something much better than our crappy story and add in all sorts of terrifying horror movie essentials like opening gateways to alternate dimensions, bimbo blonde archaeologists, sex scenes, mad scientists, slimy dog monsters, special army forces designed to battle slimy CG dog monsters, Tara Reid, Matrix slow-motion gun battles, and car chases. Oh yeah, and a ten-minute opening backstory scroll read aloud to the illiterate audience, the only people able to successfully miss all the negative reviews. I mean hell, Boll knows that's where the real scares lie.\" Yes, the bad guys look like aliens and basically tear everyone to pieces, other than Slater and Reid. That is -- if you get that far. This is a film packed with continuity gaffes, appearances by camera people and even Reid being unable to say the word Newfoundland. For a film set in California, Canadian signage appears throughout. When Agent Cheung's dead body is found, she visibly moves before the scene ends. And perhaps most amazingly, the creatures in the film? Their main weakness is light. Yet they show up in broad daylight to attack the two main characters at the end of the film.I know Uwe Boll likes to punch critics, but I can handle it. Seriously, if you love a video game, there's the worry that this man has made a movie of it. I'd do an entire week of his films on this site, but I don't even know if I have that kind of guts.",

The production values aren't bad, but self-conscious direction tends to prevent the viewer from being pulled into the story. If you think about it, however, these same generalizations could be made about a lot of movies, some of which have achieved substantial commercial and critical success.

When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, \"Alone in the Dark\" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. The reason may be explained by the \"brilliant\" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that \"videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore\". Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong.

It's all his fault, too; with the exception of Postal, anything that was once a property in a bit-system has been taken by Boll with his Germany tax-credit-shaved dollars (or as he says in Postal with real hilarity, Nazi gold) will be made bad with his style of dull camera-work and unimaginative and uninspired action set pieces. At best he can garner a few points for some bad-movie fun at times, but the product over all is so poorly produced throughout, from its overwrought writing to the mis(or WTF)casting, to simple things like music and weaponry characters use, or the designs of the monsters or whatnot. Case in point, Alone in the Dark, given a 9% out of 100% on metacritic (about the worst critical average one can get without being Paris Hilton), promises to perhaps be something extremely stupid and badly made but fun... and it's ultimately too dull to care at all.The plot is so convoluted that you would have to be the biggest slobbering geek for Alone in the Dark the video game (and hell if I know any of them), and it mostly just concerns some paranormal investigator with memory loss and who is an orphan (Christian Slater) teaming up with an archaeologist chick (Tara Reid, who else), and some other prickly paranormal guy (Stephen Dorff) all trying to track some creatures that have escaped from a crypt off of a ship from God knows where over God knows what and blah blah. Yeah, blah blah is a good word to give it, especially with the opening text scrawl going on so long as to make any of the Star Wars opening texts look like log-lines. Honestly, one would come to this at most expecting some cheesy-stupid dialog for the actors to chew on, and even in THIS it's a failure; Slater's narration sounds like it was made at gunpoint via ludes, and Dorff looks confused at to why he's even acting next to Tara Reid. We are too, Stephen.The monsters or whatever look cheap even in CGI, the action and gun battles are lazily staged and not exciting, and when it should come time to be \"scared\", the director and his so-called DoP just flicker lights on and off. That's right, your six year old would have more imagination than these clowns. It might not be so offensive except that it's chiefly a time-waster that promises to suck in a fun way. I'm not sure what's more taxing on the audience, that a lot happens and none of it, not an iota, is interesting, or that a couple of actors we might've liked in other films are put through the motions of a script that would barely get by the people at SyFy channel. The ending, by the way, is retarded into such a way that it makes only minimal sense, and then gives an Evil Dead ripoff that is just staggering.While watching the movie Alone in the Dark, I was bored and more engaged chatting with my friends as it went from one big action ramp up to another with the same pale-faced actors and incompetent special effects went along. But thinking and writing about the movie now, it boils me just thinking about going through the experience just for the sake of a few laughs. It's laugh-less. Worthless.

Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film. But alas I felt alone in the dark (I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist) as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.So... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can turn invisible at random (and I assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.And those were the high points. The story revolving around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is rather inept. And a government agent(Dorff) whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess. The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.Then comes the plot. Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. And the ending did not make one ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll. Disgrace, thats all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.I payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.Shame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorff.

This movie starts out with Christian Slater narrating an event from his childhood in an orphanage and fails to tell what exactly happened. Then he starts falling victim to stalkers and attacks without any explanation of why it's happening.He meets up with a scientist played by Tara Reid, who run from a monster in a museum, and some top government agents storm in and chase it off. The rest of the movie relies on poorly edited shootouts and monster chases, and not a single moment of them is realistic and entertaining.The ending was probably the worst, Slater and Reid escape a cave and end up outside the orphanage even though it was dark before and then suddenly daylight. Then they find the city deserted but without any carnage or blood splatter to be found anywhere.There are moments in this wretch that normally I would say have to be seen to be believed but instead I'll describe them here, and I am not making any of these things up: 1. In the beginning Christian Slater fights some guy chasing him for a stone and while laying on his back manages to jump off the floor and do a complete back flip kick in the air, even though his foot was at least two feet away from the guy's face yet he still reacts like it hit him.2. During the shootout at Slater's house one of the bullets goes straight over a lady's head but she still falls over like it hit her.3. In the cave system a female soldier is supposedly killed, but at the end of the scene you can see her lift her head up.4. The acting from every cast member is laughably bad, especially from Stephen Dorff who tries to pull of a bad ass persona and actually tries to take the plot seriously.In conclusion this movie is so badly written, directed and acted that it is actually painful to watch and the plot is often confusing and boring at times.One out of ten stars can't even describe how bad this film is, stay as far away from this and all of Boll's movies as possible, life is too short to waste it on his piles of excrement.",

            "content": "It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. The final product would still outshine this movie.Seemingly based on an ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one's ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. Which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough.Christian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.But see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie.That's about as distilled I can make the plot. It's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.The acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing \"Newfoundland\" as \"New Fownd Land,\" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid's all that good looking. She looks like she's in perpetual need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.Anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That can't be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.Oh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now-familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. Bizarre.Alone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. Hardly a note rings true. There's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can't quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It's atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit.",

Well, it seems as though one can, and that one is the man himself, Uwe Boll. Alone in the Dark is just bad, plain and simple, there is nothing good about it at all. It is basically a mish-mash of crap. Acting? Wooden. Script? A mess. Music? Unbearable. Characters? Random. Directing? ..........Right from the start I knew it was heading up **** creek without a paddle when (Texas Chain Saw Massacre style), text started scrolling up the screen while a narrator reads it out in a deadpan voice. What I found strange was the text basically gave away the twist, and for the rest of the movie it was about the main character Edward Carnby (Christian Slater, who obviously needed a paycheck) trying to unravel the mystery of which we already know the details of. Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff also pop by to pick up a paycheck and add no life to their cardboard characters. However, my beef is not with the actors, but with the stupid story and direction. The main problem with the story was I understood very little of it, it just made no sense. Random pieces of story were thrown in here and there with no explanation (what the hell was the old professor doing in the forest commanding all the creatures?) and the scenes all looked cut and pasted into the movie. One minute the two main characters are making love (where and why I couldn't quite work out) and the next they are shooting aliens with twenty SWAT guys in the same building. And of course, this fight was accompanied by random camera movement, strobe lighting and heavy metal music.I am going to stop now, because I could write an essay about the stupidity of Alone in the Dark and Uwe Boll. Basically, avoid this movie like the plague it is, go watch ANYTHING else, but just ignore this load of trash.\u00bd/5",

I honestly can say that the actors had not much talent, or maybe it was just bad directing; I can't tell.I have to say that the effects / CGI were okay enough. The monsters look cool (eventhough they resemble the classic Alien monster now and then...) and the scenes with them are slightly enjoyable.

            "content": "I'm not fan of the AitD video game series, so I didn't know, what to expect from this movie. Though, I don't know, what can prepare anybody for this horrifying experience, which some people call a \"movie\".After you sat through the most boring opening sequence ever (an annoying voice reads a scrolling text for 4 minutes!), you quickly find yourself in an orphanage. Some kids are mentioned, a bad guy (or whoever) wants to do some sort of experiment (or whatever) on them. But how clever: one of them is missing. The missing child later turns out to be Edward Carnby (Slater), the main character of the video game series. And the madness won't stop until the movie ends - 85 minutes later!!! You must watch a silly action sequence, which ends with a very painful move - Slater impaled the bad guy, but not the impaling is what is painful. It's the camera work and the execution of the scene. It's more horrible than some scenes from FearDotCom, which are in my case (FearDotCom was the only movie ever, I gave a 1/10 rating) very, very serious words...The story goes on and on, and you constantly asking yourself: \"What does this bad guy want?\", \"What does this \"Bureau 713\" want?\", \"Who's this?\", \"What happened to that guy?\" and finally, the most important question to ask: \"Why am I watching this mess?\"...If this was not enough to turn off your TV (or in worse case: leave the theater), you can go on, but I warn you: the silliest shootout scene ever is yet to come...So when the main characters (\"characters\", har-har...) are in the museum (or whatever the hell it is), some Alien-esquire monster is appearing from the middle of nowhere. Slater and his female museum curator sidekick (Reid) are running around together in the building, and suddenly - they find some guns. With their newly gained firepower, they began to shoot everywhere, except for that big monster in the middle of the room. But their massive incompetence scares away the ugly beast, and they are wandering forth. Then the scene gets more and more stupid.It's time for the Stupidest Shootout Scene Ever to unfold before your very eyes. Some troopers are coming in and they're shooting wildly. They're shooting to the left, to the right and away from the camera. But they never hit anything. Some worms are appearing, which are apparently crawling into someone's spine and turning them into zombies. Sounds silly? Yes. Does it look silly in the movie? No, it looks much sillier.So, we have this bunch of incompetent troops who are incapable of hitting anything, we have the two main heroes, and a few monsters. And you cannot care about them! You don't even know, why they're there where they are, you don't even know, what are they doing. And on top of it: they're in the middle of an action scene, which supposed to be entertaining. And it's not. This is the Stupidest Shootout Scene Ever, and you have to watch it to believe it. I couldn't describe this visual torture properly. But if I could, you would be roaring in pain...Slater and Reid survived the shootout - me too...Our heroes then have a pointless meeting with the main bad guy (who wants to command the creatures of the dark, because... umm... I think, even the scriptwriter doesn't know, why...), and all of a sudden, the main characters decide to climb out from the catacomb (or whatever place they were before), and they began walking in the evacuated city. Yes indeed, the evacuated city. But asking questions about it, is pointless, as you guessed correctly. Why was the city evacuated? Irrelevant. When was it evacuated? Irrelevant. It's evacuated. Period.So our heroes are moving on, approaching an open street. They began walking away from the camera, and Slater utters some silly closing words which are, as the movie itself, totally irrelevant and pointless. And the movie ends with a creature jumping on them in the middle of the day. A creature, which supposed to be living in darkness. But don't worry: this was the movie's last ridiculous move, here comes the ending credits. And they are brilliant! Nothing is wrong with this brilliant last scene!...The only reason why I don't give it a 1, are the special effects. They were sometimes convincing. The scene, which surrounded them was silly, but the effects, when the monsters vanished were decent.So I gave it 2/10. And it could have been 5/10, if I could care about the characters. But I've never seen a movie in my entire life which could be this uninvolving (except FearDotCom of course).I say: avoid at all costs. Don't waste 90 minutes from your life on this, go watch another movie. Pick a David Lynch or a Tarantino, but leave this movie Alone in the Dark. It deserves it.",

The film contains characters, as well as dialogue, a love interest, a conflict, and a resolution. There is an antagonist and a protagonist, sets and props, and scenes in which things occur. Then there's an ending which features credits. Not the tiniest scrap of a plot to be had.It appears they made an attempt at a story involving a mad scientist trying to resurrect demons that wiped out an ancient race of people (why?); a young Slater escaped from his experiment and got electrocuted or lost his memory or something. Now the demons have been unleashed and Slater is their main target. I think. The movie suggests it. There then follow endless scenes of people walking around stealthily with their guns drawn, and a major plot point is made out of how cool and buff Slater is. Then I think Tim Conway pops in and insults him while giving him tips on golf... wait, what?... Oh, now it's *Stephen* Dorf? Well, I don't know anymore.

Moreover, the acting is a bit wooden and the dialog is kind of sub par but then again, there are many action movies that suffer from similar problems.One major annoyance with this film though is the darkness, yes, darkness would naturally be an integral part of a film called Alone in the Dark but having nearly all the action take place in near complete darkness ruins the film as it makes it impossible to see whats going on; this is especially poignant in one scene where pretty much all the light comes from the muzzle flashes of the guns. The lack of proper characters doesn't help either, in the end you have a bunch of cardboard cutouts that you can't see (due to the darkness) and don't care about, the result of which is and utterly unengaging action flick.",

It's a personal insult to the audience.What's even worse it's supposed to be based on two things I somehow hold dear: a) H.P. Lovecraft and b) Alone in the Dark video game series. The movie was probably meant to be a rendition of a 4th game in the series (which was also a VERY bastardized version of the original trilogy). The first three games were set in 1920's and involved an middle-aged bespectacled private investigator Ed Carnby who gets involved in some paranormal phenomena. It was all very creepy and atmospheric. The 4th one involved a younger, cooler, kick-a** Ed Carnby who somehow got a serious weapon store at his disposal, brandishing even a laser gun (!). Blah.And now we have a MOVIE version of the WORST part of the video game series. Do we have a case of garbage-in-garbage-out here, ladies and gentleman? Well, no. Uwe succeeded in making bad material infinitely worse. To the point where it makes ABSOLUTE NO SENSE AT ALL. The video game's plot is Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap.I think the problem lies in the fact Uwe didn't quite get the grasp of English language. For him, \"horror\" means \"lots of SFX and loud soundtrack and explosions and bimbos working as museum curators\". I mean, Tara Reid? What was he thinking? Uwe also thinks that horror movies must include Matrix-like camera work, and basically look like a Britney Spears video. Cos that's like cool and fizzle-wizzle and the kids will dig it,yo.I'd like to say that this is a movie for younger audience. However, I don't know how young exactly should you be to possibly enjoy this.

This movie was once in IMDb's 'down 100' and it had a perfect spot there, here's why.I would like to start out with a small introduction to the director of this movie, Uwe Boll. Uwe is a ex-boxer from Germany who spends his time making self-funded (or sometimes government funded) movies based on popular licenses, mostly videogames. Uwe is a man who rather fights his critics then listening to them, and openly admitted that he NEVER played any of the videogames that he based his movies on. Uwe Boll therefore is the worst possible choice to direct a movie based on a video game, and it is as good as hiring a director to do a movie based on a book he never even read. Uwe Boll is compared to the British director Paul WS Anderson a lot of times, but at least Paul WS Anderson creates movies with reverences to the games he based his movies on.Alone in the Dark is a video game series that I always had a passion for. Its a classic survival horror game that doesn't rely on big and loud gunfights or armies of monsters swarming around. Alone in the Dark is the kind of game that does its title justice; its best played in the dark. The gameplay, the dialog, and the whole mystery of the mansion you roam in has a atmosphere that few games can match these days. Even Atari's latest attempt to revive the Alone in the Dark franchise has shown us that big special effects and good looking graphics aren't everything. But what do we get with the movie? Loud action scenes, corny dialog, paperthin characters and plot... From that point on I just wanted to punch mister Uwe Boll in the face (in pure boxing-fashion) for completely turning a great franchise into a travesty that has literally nothing to do with the source-material.Carnby looks and acts nothing like the character he is supposed to be playing from the games. Heck, he doesn't even remotely look anything like a detective to begin with, and his overall performance is horrible. There is also little or no explanation about his character, or any other character for that matter. The only thing that matters in this film are the CGI-monsters (that have no relevance to the monsters in any of the games either) and the loud action-scenes (including really tiresome slow-motion effects) and even that is executed very poorly. There is basically no acting in this film, and everyone seems to have only one neutral expression.If you by any chance stumbled on this title, I recommend buying or renting the games, especially the first one. When you played that, and then still want to watch this movie you will most probably agree with my frustration. I don't usually 'boycot' any director, since movies are usually a personal piece of art taken from the perspective of the director and producer, but I avoid any movies from Uwe Boll. I don't care if he improves his directing, the lack of humor in his movies, the overall shoddy production, poor characterization and lots of plot holes because I'm not going to watch it. He can direct a modern equivalent of The Godfather for all I care, and I'm still not going to watch it. I'm not going to sit through the crap that he calls film-making ever again. The fact that I even saw this movie TWICE (once alone, once with friends) is something that was a complete and utter waste of my time and I urge anyone to stay away from any movie that Uwe Boll is involved in. He doesn't care about film-making, he doesn't care about story, he doesn't care about the games, he only cares about your wallet.",

He also has this uncanny way of hiring actors (who we know, for a fact, CAN act) and get them to NOT act. His isn't even a case of \"no talent\", it's more like \"anti-talent\".But enough about the director and on to the movie; I haven't played the game, so I don't know if the movie had made more sense if I had. It feels like it tries to be a puzzle-mystery \u00e0 la Lovecraft meets Tomb Raider, but due to the lack of continuity between scenes and some flagrantly bad scenery and props, the result becomes a series of events and things that by coincidence sometimes have something to do with each other.There definitely seem to be parts missing, and not just between scenes, but in scenes as well. We go from half an army fighting in one scene, to five guys dead and no one else to be seen in the next. Close to the end we see Dorff firing his gun almost desperately at absolutely nothing, and then running like crazy and firing some more at absolutely nothing. It might be worth mentioning that he's firing through an opening that was until recently covered by a door; a door that was supposedly either always there, or put there by an ancient Indian tribe, but still manages to consist of mirrors and look surprisingly beginning-of-the-21th-century modern. Did the ancient Indians have a fondness for rectangular mirrors, or did later generations just add to the exterior of this gateway to evil darkness to improve the general air of the room...? Other things more or less missing seem to be actor motivation and special effects timing. The actors look like they're mostly just in this for the promise of getting paid, and deliver their lines with all the conviction and individual thought of a phone salesman on his 10,000th call for the day. It's a bit funny to hear someone say: \"We need to get out of here. Let's move! Let's move!\", even though he's the only one who hasn't left the room yet. When it comes to special effects, the monsters weren't that bad, but I don't know how many guys I saw start screaming and twitching before the monsters had even had a chance to attack them from behind. Maybe they just felt the evil aura.I know Uwe Boll has become something of a phenomenon, because you just can't believe how bad a movie can actually get, but this one isn't worth seeing. It isn't exciting, nor scary, and can't be made funny even by adding your own lines or comments to it.",

Director Uwe Boll is directing another movie that I was interested in called \"Bloodrayne, another video game based movie, and it's due later this year (2005). Obviously, after seeing the trash that is 'Alone in the Dark', I hold absolutely no hopes for any of his past or future pics.I won't go into the plot, because, well, there really isn't any worth mentioning. Bad action scenes, a run-of-the-mill story, and ridiculous plot holes sprinkle the movie like the cheese that it is. However, I won't give this movie a vote of 1. There are other worse movies then this (I just can't remember any right now). The only saving grace of this movie is that there was an actual production value showing SOMEONE in the Special-FX dept was awake. The CGI wasn't too shabby, and the makeup dept did the job as well.Remember Christian Slater? Remember him, WAY back in the day in Tarantino's True Romance? How about Interview with a Vampire? Murder in the First? He's a good actor, so what is he doing this for? There was an interesting read by Blair Erickson, who was assigned to write the original script for AITD, but walked out on Boll after doing rewrites. Erickson was so disappointed by Boll's constant harassing him of the script, that Erickson and the rest of the screenwriters walked out. After Boll hired other writers, he then phoned Erickson back, wanting to know if he could use some of his script ideas, WITHOUT PAY. Erickson seemed to have said no, for here is what he said:\"For those of you who actually give a s***, the original script took the \"Alone In the Dark\" premise and depicted it as if it was a actually based on a true story of a private investigator in the northeastern U.S. whose missing persons cases begin to uncover a disturbing paranormal secret. It was told through the eyes of a writer following Edward Carnby and his co-worker for a novel, and depicted them as real-life blue-collar folks who never expected to find hideous beings waiting for them in the dark. We tried to stick close to the H.P. Lovecraft style and the low-tech nature of the original game, always keeping the horror in the shadows so you never saw what was coming for them.\" To me, this sounds like a better script then what Boll used. Which proves to me that Boll is a bad director, and has no eye for a good movie, much less turning a decent script, or at least a decent IDEA of a script into a good movie. After 'House of the Dead', someone should really stop Boll from making movies based out of good video games, or ANY movie for that matter.3 out of 10",

            "content": "First the only points of interest I found with the entire film: the CGI shot when the camera went inside Christian Slater's gun as it fired off two bullets, and the Nightwish song over the credits.Now the Bad: Ever talk a person who knows about something - say, Edgar Allen Poe's writing - but doesn't really know it? Ever meet a person who can imitate martial arts, but not actually fight with it? Or run into a guy who can go through the motions of an art form without truly understanding his medium? My personal favorite, ever run into IMDb users who've read dozens of reviews and (wrongly) assume they can write something useful? Alone in the Dark is an exercise of uninformed imitation; it's a montage of images pulled from better films, linked together by incoherent thoughts that masquerades as a plot. It's as though Uwe Boll decided true originality was impossible, so instead he'd borrow elements from everything and call it style. Someone must have left off the first part of that Hitchcock quote, \"Self-plagerism is style.\" Emphasis on \"Self\" Uwe, \"Self-plagerism.\" Got that? Good.From the opening TCM meets Star Wars text crawl (minus the John Williams fanfare) to the final Evil Dead shot, Alone in the Dark is one idea right after another that is done better in better movies. It doesn't bother me so much that ideas are taken from other materials, it's the fact that Boll takes someone else's ideas and ODs it on steroids. The shining example would be the shootout at Carnby's place, ripped from a scene in Equilibrium.The unlit \"gunfight\" from Equilibrium worked because 1 - there wasn't much (if any) camera movement or cutting, 2 - it was very brief, 3 - the focus stayed on one character, and most importantly 4 - it was intended as an abstract view of a gunfight. Alone in the Dark attempts a similar scene, except to make it his own Uwe Boll moves the camera, cuts, quadruples the length, shows more characters/monsters, and tries to make it a valid gunfight within valid geography. The end result is incoherent chaos in the frame, chaos that the audience will not care enough to even try to follow. I can easily see people nodding off in the middle of the climactic scenes, sadly.Which nicely brings me to my next point - I had no investment in this film on any level. I didn't feel anxiety when the monsters lurked in the unknown abyss of darkness, no sense of dread came over me when the monsters swarmed and severely outnumbered the good guys, I got up to get popcorn during the sex scene, and picked out a new ring-tone for my mobile phone during the final battle. As a side note, three weeks ago I watched my new DVD of Hitchcock's Psycho and was amazed at how excited I felt watching the opening credits - yes, you heard me right, the opening credits to a 45 year old movie that I've already seen . . . many times.I'm baffled by the lack of suspense both Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead have. Apocalypse with all its hellish terrors can be upon the main characters, and the glowing digits on the DVD player counting down the rest of the running time has more suspense. Maybe it's the fact that Boll, instead of keeping his eyes on the road and steering this horror vehicle at its intended target, he's too busy looking over at Sam Raimi, Kurt Wimmer, Peter Jackson and not realizing he's about to rear end a cop.Slater worked just fine, Dorff did all right, but I suspect they'll be picked on by critics since the rest of this film will put viewers in trash-all, leave no survivors, mood. Tara Reid, on the other hand, is fair game, because her performance is worthy of a possible Razzie nomination. She failed to convince me that she was associated with a museum in any way. She delivered her lines as though this was the first time in her life she said this many big words in the same sentence. I was not convinced she had any knowledge of, much less mastered, the vocabulary this character is supposed to use on a day-to-day basis.Her delivery sounded like an actor struggling to recite lines without knowing what they actually mean. Ever listen to someone try to speak a language they barely know? There's a certain flat tone to listen for since the person is struggling over the vocabulary, giving them no room for expressionistic vocal inflections. Tara Reid plays these same notes while reciting the historical mumbo-jumbo that's supposed to make the plot make sense.In the end, Alone in the Dark is a step up from House of the Dead; however, strangely enough, House of the Dead is the more entertaining of the two. An analogy - House of the Dead is the main attraction at the freak show who is so hideous that you have to see it to believe it. Alone in the Dark is just a really really ugly guy on the street.",

These things are literally called Xenos or Zenos or whatever, I don't care. The plot features these kids who had worms put in their bodies that would control their minds when they became adults. At least it isn't worse than it sounds. There's one scene where we see a guy having the worm put into his body. If you can do that, why even raise kids in an orphanage? The movie stars Christian Slater and one of the minor characters is played by Jesse Ventura. Figures he would fight someone named Christian. I guess worms controlling people's bodies is right up there with Ventura's conspiracy theories. Glad to see him die. There is a villain who injects himself with monster blood to keep him alive or something. He appears near the end and just dies. His character was completely pointless like pretty much everything else in this movie.There's even a scene where a woman dies and you can actually see her actress lift her head off the ground! I didn't even notice another scene where a woman dies and the shot fired didn't even touch her! It's pretty easy to assume that the CGI is horrible. That's too bad even for video games. We see more awful slow motion shots and bad angles which I got used to since \"House Of The Dead\". Of course Uwe Boll repeats the same stupid mistakes in his films. Why are there an endless number of awful video game movies? Pray for me, people. Pray for me. 1/2*",

            "content": "Oh, Uwe Boll. Not only were you terrible with comedy, you don't seem to understand the basics of horror/action filmmaking either. Or dialogue. Or human interactions.Alone in the Dark starts with an impossibly long text crawl that explains, in confusing detail, the world that the movie takes place in. The thing is, what's actually there isn't that far removed from what other movie that combine paranormal investigative teams, ancient cults, and otherworldly dangers. I was reminded of Hellboy, and while Hellboy isn't Guillermo del Toro's greatest work, it does cleanly establish the rules of its alternate version of reality that involves Rasputin, the Old Gods, a demon baby, a secret government organization, and a few Nazis trying to bring about the end of the world. Alone in the Dark tells a similar story but it's told in such a convoluted way that it's really hard to simply figure out what is going on.There are flashbacks to the main character's childhood that seem to end with implications of a bunch of dead kids, but they're all alive twenty years later and have been turned into some kind of unkillable monster zombies. There's talk of a secret division of the government out for paranormal research and defense, but its history is really unclear until the very end when some of it gets cleared up (way too late to matter). The basic professional relationship between the professor who disappears and reappears at will and the secret division is muddled at best. This movie didn't have to be a great work of art to just arrange the information of how everything works together across, but it also wouldn't have taken that much effort. Maybe Boll was trying to be unpredictable, but he ended up just being confusing. Or, he's just an awful storyteller who has no idea what he's doing. There's always that.To make the movie experience even worse, it's not populated with characters but human looking automatons that spout expository gibberish at each other. No one seems to have a discernable motivation to do anything. They do it because it is their type and they are in an action horror movie, so those types must be followed. Dialogue is stilted and unnatural and most of the actors are really just sleepwalking through the whole thing. The only exception is Stephen Dorff. Poor Stephen Dorff...he was almost Aragorn, you know. He gives his all in this \"film\" as the badass and hardnosed leader of a squad of secret government paranormal troopers. He throws tables and emotes, dammit, he emotes, but the character is threadbare and no one else around him cares.The movie is also largely flatly lit. Everything set inside during the day looks like it was filmed for a cheap television show. There are no shadows and everything seems so two-dimensional. When the CG monsters attack, the lights go out and we get a bunch of darkness that's equally flat. The absolute low point of the film is probably the moment when there's a desperate attack on our \"heroes\" in the dark with guns blazing, and the music cranks up some kind of pulse pounding hard rock. It's so completely antithetical to the idea of how to build a sequence in an action/horror film that I laughed.This film is shoddily made, confusingly assembled, boringly performed (save poor Stephen Dorff), and doesn't understand the basic building blocks of a horror sequence. Oh, Uwe Boll, my life would have been better had I not decided to try your \"movies\" out.",

Standing in Carnby's way, however, is the impact that a brief encounter with an evil spirit called the Queen had upon his mind, as he slowly finds himself overpowered by the forces of darkness as they eat away at his very sanity...Uwe Boll became known to the world with the video game horror based film House of the Dead. After the horrible reviews and box office, someone somewhere decided to let Uwe Boll destroy another video game franchise, this time it's another horror video game, Alone in the Dark. Which frankly is how you should watch the movie, if you have to that is.Alone in the Dark goes wrong in so many directions, the first would have to be the screenplay, which has too many plot holes and confusing storyline that no one can tell what is going on. Throw into the mix a director that has no clue what he is doing except throwing an explosion here and a shootout there. Boll did one thing right, make the movie about soldiers shooting creatures, instead of your everyday party goers, such as seen in House.Alone in the Dark suffers from a lot of different things, but even if you didn't know who Uwe Boll is or how bad the script actually is, you must be able to notices the horrible casting job. Who in their right mind would think of Tara Reid for a genius anthropologist? Her lines range from horribly delivered, to \"hey look over here\" or \"hey check this out\". Slater plays an Indiana Jones type character, who lacks the charm, wit, courage, intelligence...basically everything that makes Indiana Jones.Stephen Dorff isn't that bad of an actor, he just has the unfortunate curse of choosing bad movie roles. Either he needs a new agent, or needs to get better material thrown his way. Frankly military leader hunting the beast who has conflict with the lead character doesn't do him justice.A lot of the scenes are laughable when Boll tries to make them hip for the new generation. Such as the characters being in total darkness, then shooting the bullets that have lights on them which light up the characters and the screen. Boll should take some directing lessons and not try to make something look appealing.It's obvious that Boll doesn't care about the story, or just doesn't understand it, the characters, the music, basically everything that makes a movie with the exception of special effects. Boll tries to make the film cool with it's \"slo-mo\" and of course the shot where the monster jumps at the screen.Apparently someone out there thinks Boll is doing something right because he has numerous video game titles on the way, next up is Bloodrayne. I can only hope that when FarCry hits the theatres he will learn from his mistakes and make at least a decent film for once in his life.",

Carnby survives this attack & knows that he's onto something, meanwhile Hudgens is finds another piece of Arkani relic & sends it to the museum where he works where his assistant Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) starts to catalogue the piece. By a complete coincidence Aline (?) also happens to be Carnby's ex-girlfriend so he gets in on the act & they both discover that all these Arkani bit's 'n' pieces are in fact parts that join together to make a key, a key that opens the gateway between light & darkness which is a bad thing because if the key was to fall into the wrong hands & the door was opened all the nasty creatures & monsters from the dark would be free to roam the earth & kill everyone...This Canadian, German & American co-production was executive produced & directed by Uwe Boll who, it seems, has gotten a reputation as one of the worst filmmakers around. Alone in the Dark is the first Boll film I've seen so I can't comment but based on this in my opinion I'd still say the worst genre filmmaker is a toss up between Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco & Jim 'I have no budget' Wynorski, hey it's just an opinion OK... Anyway, the script by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch & Peter Scheerer is based on the Alone in the Dark computer games but apart from the central Carnby character & the title they apparently have zero in common & I have to say that the script is a big problem here. For a start the narrative is very poor, things just happen, there's little consequence to anyone's actions & as a whole the film feels like a collection of barely connected set-pieces. The character's are poor, Reid's archaeologist is all but redundant, Hudgen is nothing more than a convenient by-the-numbers pantomime villain who does nothing except want to open the gateway to flood the world with monsters for no apparent reason & worst of all is Carnby himself who is meant to a paranormal investigator but this aspect is criminally wasted with him doing precisely zero investigating, this could have been good if the filmmakers had structured the plot around him having to find out what's going on & being a detective, you know at first everything's all mysterious & we find out what's going on as he does. But no, all subtlety & tact goes out of the window in favour of CGI monsters, a silly plan for world domination & shoot-outs as it forgets all about the story that it tried to establish during the pre-credit text. Having said that it moves along at a fair & despite a few dull moments it kept me entertained for 90 odd minutes, I don't think I'd want to see it again though & it could have been so much more...Director Boll does OK, while the film has great special effects it's not scary & while watching it I got the feeling it never really tries to be. There's certainly no tension or atmosphere as it feels like some sort of hybrid of Alien (1979) with it's slimy monsters, The X-Files (1993- 2002) with it shadowy Government agency protecting us from unseen evils. Starship Troopers (1997) with it's all out shoot 'em up action scenes with loads of soldiers running around fighting monsters & there's even a touch of The Matrix (1999) in here with it's slow motion gravity defying fight scenes plus a little of The Relic (997) as well with monsters running around museums & swat teams dropping down from skylights. According to the IMDb there's a longer gorier Director's Cut with Miles now killed on screen, I'm not sure who Miles is but I think he's the swat guy who gets shot through the head so I think I saw the uncut one although it's still not that gory, there's some mutilated bodies, an autopsy scene & a cool bit where a female soldier is lying on the ground & there's some juicy close-ups of her head which is split in half. Reid stays fully clothed throughout, sorry guys.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Alone in the Dark is well made & has that Hollywood big budget polish to it, with a decent script this could have been really good. The acting isn't great, Slater & Dorff look like they don't want to be there & Reid is predictably terrible.Alone in the Dark wasn't the complete disaster that I was expecting & maybe it's that that saved it, I was expecting so little that I literally couldn't have been disappointed. It's not a great film but at the same time I don't think it's as bad as many make out, then again I did just give Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988) ten stars out of ten a few hours earlier so some may not want to trust my taste in films... It's still much better than Ghoulies IV (1993) though, isn't it?",

That film is a film of bad choices and missed opportunities that could have amounted into a good B horror film.Uwe's at it again here with a film that is even more confusing because on the face of it it should have worked, he put many of the right things together but somehow made one of the dullest films I've ever seen. Its so bad that I had to fight to become awake enough to stand up and walk out of the theater. Guns are going off, things are blowing up, monsters are attacking, people are running and screaming and the audience is sleeping.Part of the problem is that the cast didn't so much phone in their performances rather they hired cardboard cut outs to do it for them. There is no life in anything they do. They don't care about whats going on so we don't either.This is a movie for those who want to sleep and for no one else...well maybe those needing to see every movie monster ever created, but no one else.3 out of 10. Better than expected, but so painfully boring as to be unwatchable (simply because you will be sleeping)",

            "content": "There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.The plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying.The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over.TOTAL: 4%",

He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them. This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sh*t.",

This film, with such a peculiar name, probably caught your eye.I imagine that this film is loosely based on the game \"Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.\" However, perhaps the only things this film has in common with the games are its title and the characters' names.I played a lot of games, although I haven't played any more lately. I've always been a big fan of horror games, but I know little about the Alone in the Dark game series. So, I watched the film as an ordinary viewer, just watching the story without comparing it to the game itself.The plot is generic. Through certain artifacts, a historian dominated by darkness can cast a supposed supreme evil on the earth. Edward Carnby is a supernatural detective who can save humanity.The concept of having a government agency that investigates paranormal events did not go very well with me. When the Government is involved, the idea of ??terror in the dark loses its charm.The film itself has a good pace, despite being generic. It even looks like a movie from a triple-A company. CGI is a little out of date, but I understand that the film was released in the first decade of 2000.I can't finish without mentioning Carnby's costume. The main characters need to stand out from the crowd, but the overcoat just makes him goofy. Video games are video games, but in real life, that overcoat is pretty old-fashioned.Recommended? I would not recommend this film for casual viewers. This film is definitely a film for fans of horror films in general, regardless of quality.",

I haven't played the video game that this movie is based off of, so I can't say if it's a good adaptation, but the film is just so bad, that even if it was, it wouldn't help.The writing is terrible, there are plot holes everywhere, it rips off a bunch of other movies, the characters are bland and forgettable, the dialog is bad, and it feels clustered. The acting isn't much better, I can't blame these actors, they didn't have much to work with. It almost seems like they know how bad the movie is.And the direction is horrible. At points, I can't even tell what's going on, the editing is so annoying at times. The ending doesn't make any sense at all, and there are continuity errors everywhere.

My other theory is that they all showed up at the set without a script, decided to shoot some random scenes of cool looking paramilitary guys shooting CGI monsters and leave it to some guy in the editing room to make sense of it. Maybe some scrolling text at the beginning would say something about a plot and that would do it. The deal is, the producers had Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff at the hotel, the paramilitary costumes were ready, there was a little sun in Vancouver, the heavy metal soundtrack was ready and the CGI guys were already animating the monsters, so why waste time waiting for the writer to do a plot.",

But I also believe a lot of people just go with the hype and give it a low rating because they hear everyone else hates it.The film, as far as I understand, has nothing to do with the games whatsoever. Which may be why a lot of people hate it. I never played the games, so I wouldn't know. But as for the plot, people do exaggerate how confusing it is. Heck, I've never played any Alone in the Dark games, I watched the movie on my computer while chatting with my friends and I wasn't that confused. So it can't be that bad. Granted there are a few things that are never explained, and leave you feeling dissatisfied at the end.The \"villain\". Old professor who injects himself with demon blood and wants to unleash a bunch of demons to take over the world. OK, for this type of film that's perfectly acceptable. But we never ever get to know why he wants to do this, what made him turn evil or why he's even necessary to the plot. In fact, his presence is actually just needed at the very, very end for one very brief sequence. So he's a totally useless villain that can't help but to confuse the audience.Then there's some jumping in time and very unlikely happenings. For example, in one scene Christian Slater and Tara Reid is attacked by zombies in his house. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Stephen Dorff and his gang shows up. Alright, I can buy that. But why does he bring Slater and Reid along to the old abandoned goldmine? And couldn't they at least explained to the audience a little better that they were going to look for the old portal mentioned at the beginning? Also, why the heck does Tara Reid, who works at a museum, follow Slater, Dorff and a team of elite agents down into alien infected territory? The script isn't smart. Nor is the dialog. But the acting is alright. It's very uneven, with Slater and Dorff giving good performances, a bunch of other guys giving mediocre and a good chunk of the cast giving awful, but at least Slater and Dorff manages. Likewise, the music is very uneven. When it tries to be suspenseful, it suffers. But in action scenes, it's good.Speaking of the action scenes, they are fairly nice. Very well shot and visually impressive. To bad there's to little variation. It's basically just a bunch of agents shooting aliens with their automatic rifles over and over again. Gets tiresome after awhile, despite the music and the nice visuals.I wouldn't mind it if Uwe Boll made a straight out action film sometime. In fact, it might turn out quite good. But suspense and plot are not his strong points.Overall, it's a pretty dull movie. It's not really that bad. Just dull. That's it's main problem.",

            "content": "In the early 90's Atari was Atari, and Resident Evil a twinkle in Capcom's collective psyche. Alone in the Dark, however, having been developed by then upcoming French publisher Inforgrames, was already doing the rounds, busy inventing the third person, variable camera genre that one day would give gamers stuff from the various Res Ev titles to more contemporary efforts like Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Onimusha.Therefore to see AITD's movie conversion owing so much to Resident Evil's big screen tenure struck one as deeply ironic. How did the tables turn so? It doesn't really matter, because at least for the first hour, director Uwe Boll's action flick kept its act together by providing solid, rollicking adventure fare with heaps more charm than the last RE entry ever mustered. The film displayed the same smooth execution we saw in Boll's 2004 video game interpretation, House of the Dead, and hopefully serves as harbinger of good news for his helming of another game-to-celluloid metamorphosis, coming attraction Far Cry.Anyway, AITD the movie had very little to do with its game namesake, since none of the original series' Call of Cthulu Gothic charm made its way through, neither did the misty, almost Victorian locales cross over in the transition. Chief protagonist Edward Carnby has returned, done by Christian Slater in a much needed chance at coming back into Hollywood's limelight-infused embrace. Slater gave a respectable go at doing Carnby, although he decidedly lacked any serious one liners, thus depriving Alone in the Dark serious merit. The producers, to our joy, chose to stick with an R rating by not cutting out the gore and good language, somewhat negating the effects of dry, choppy dialogue segments bereft any memorable moments.Other characters included archaeologist Aline (Tara Reid) and paranormal investigation Bureau 713 chief Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the story, Carnby, himself employed as detective in all things unreal and spooky, just came back \"to town\" (Vancouver looking a bit too much like Raccoon City) bearing an ancient artifact from a long-lost civilization. Demented professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) wanted the relic for his world domination scheme, of course, and since he and Carnby shared a sordid past, their paths soon crossed as a chase to get the item in question ensued, taking viewers to several locations. Bureau 713, led by Dorff, stepped in to save humanity from Hudgens' plans, and proceeded to engage armies of creatures known as Xenos in several quite impressive battle scenes as part of the overall plot progression. AITD looked and felt like a B movie most of the time, adding to its charm, assuming you're forgivingly inclined. Sure, the CGI wasn't up to major release standards, but such minor niggles became easy to ignore amid the film's overall enjoyable content and surprisingly absorbing action. Speaking of which, one had to note a significant amount of attention to detail went into crafting these combat elements, with good set and costume design.Towards the end things began to fall apart, sadly, and by minute 90 it had all reached a hasty and laughable conclusion, but even so, this one had that unique, shamelessly straight-to-video vibe, the one you perhaps remember longingly from defunct Dolf Lundgren releases and others featured on The Movie Channel's midweek late night schedule. Besides, it had a brief appearance by sultry Hong Kong vixen Francoise Yip (Black Mask), so who's complaining? Better suited to casual movie watchers than hardcore followers of the eponymous series, Alone in the Dark was a light-hearted mix of action and SF horror adequate for a quick caper fix and not too much beyond.Rating: * * *",

Slater strolls for this role without showing any of the skills that made him a star in the early 90s. (5/10)Tara Reid: Aline Cedrac assistant curator at the museum who also happens to be Edward's girlfriend, she gets caught up in the middle of the battle after she uncover the location of the door. Going to take a deep breath before going for this one, just no how did this happen? Try your luck in romantic comedies. (2/10)Stephen Dorff: Commander Burke leader of a military team trying to keep the monsters away from the public, old partner of Edward but after seeing the truth he teams up with them to uncover the truth. Stephen can act and has proved it many times, just need to give him something to work with. (4/10)Frank C Turner: Sam an old connection within the organisation that still communicates with Edward, he fills in the science gaps and you can guess what happens to him by the end. Basic supporting performance. (4/10)Matthew Walker: Professor Hudgens scientist trying to open the door to the truth about the ancient people, he will do anything to get his answers including sacrificing anybody who gets in his way. As villains go this is generic one that doesn't need too much to make them special. (4/10)Director Review: Uwe Boll \u2013 He not only managed to mess up a relatively easy story with awful CGI and lack of directing ideas. (2/10)Action: Plenty of guns being fired, not sure if they ever hit anything as everything is in the pitch black. (3/10)Horror: Doesn't give you any scares, frights, well made with the acting. (1/10)Settings: The settings used for the gun fights are used well, because they would make real settings for such a discover if someone wanted to keep it quiet. (6/10) Special Effects: Terrible special effects that I only saw one good one and that was a soldier's head split in two. (1/10)Suggestion: I think if you are bored one night and this is on it would be acceptable to watch it as it slips close to the line of so bad you have to see. (Late Night TV)Best Part: The ideaWorst Part: The CGI, Acting and Execution of the idea.Believability: No (0/10)Chances of Tears: No (0/10)Chances of Sequel: Actually has one sequelPost Credits Scene: NoOscar Chances: NoBox Office: $10 MillionBudget: $20 MillionRuntime: 1 Hour 39 MinutesTagline: Can mankind defeat the army of darkness unleashed by an ancient evil cult?Overall: Not only did this film destroy the source material, it ruined any chance the video game had of returning.Check out more reviews on http://moviesreview101.com/",

            "review_title": "Another Brilliant Uwe Boll Computer Game Adaptation",
            "content": "The sound of IMDb users clambering onto the anti-Uwe Boll bandwagon is almost deafening. Alone In The Dark is leading most of the \"worst\" categories in this year's IMDb polls and three of Mr Boll's films (Alone In The Dark, BloodRayne and House Of The Dead) have been voted as being in the top 20 worst films of all time.I'm not sure why Uwe has become IMDb's undisputed whipping boy. It might have something to do with the fact that Boll specialises in the generally reviled art of computer game adaptations or more simply, due to vote rigging by the bored computer geeks who largely populate IMDb. Regardless of the reason, ranking Alone In The Dark as the 20th worst film of all time is utterly ridiculous. The film is no worse than scores of other action/adventure films that hit the market each year and is, in my opinion, much better than some of the trash in IMDb's top 250 (Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith, Batman Begins and Toy Story 2 for starters).A plethora of reviews have highlighted some of the film's weaker points. The plot is confused, the special effects are occasionally poor and Tara Reid is not exactly convincing as a brilliant archaeologist. I would respond that the plot, while far fetched, is never incoherent and is really beside the point in this kind of genre. The special effects are generally much better than those you would see in most American films with an equally low budget and the occasional dodgy CGI alien is rather endearing to genre enthusiasts. And as for Tara Reid, give the woman a break. She can't spend the rest of her days exposing her surgery scarred breasts at Hollywood parties in an intoxicated state. I think she gives a very respectable performance in a rather unforgiving role.Now for the film's good points, which have been largely ignored. The film is technically very competent and Uwe Boll directs the film's action sequences with panache. I especially enjoyed some of the camera angles used to capture the firing of the UV bullets. As with all true auteurs, Uwe Boll's films have a distinctive style and that is particularly true of Alone In The Dark. The film's interesting look lies somewhere between film noir and a comic strip. This is used to great effect in the film's artistically filmed and unexpected conclusion. The performances of Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff display a lot of charisma and Tara Reid is captivating in her own way. As a fan of B grade and genre films, I also liked the odd CGI aliens and other dubious special effects.Uwe Boll continues to forge ahead as a true cinematic pioneer, being the undisputed king of computer game adaptations. This pursuit appears to be much too low brow from IMDb users but I'm sure Uwe is having the last laugh, making entertaining films and watching the money roll in.",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh It can sometimes be the case where a film gets so critically slated that, like a person slowing down to observe the horror of a car crash, a bad review can be as glowing a recommendation as a good review. This can also apply if a film looks like it will be so bad on some campy level it will actually be quite good fun. This is what inspired me to give Alone in the Dark a pop, a film that received a monumental amount of bad reviews but which I got the idea might be good fun on some zany level or the other. Afraid not.The 'plot', sketchy and apathetic as it is, has Christian Slater as Edward Cardwell, a 'paranormal expert' who arrives in Los Angeles to do some work with some ancient artifacts from an ancient civilization called the Abkani. On his arrival, he is promptly chased by a mysterious assailant with seemingly superhuman power who tries to kill him. Paranormal experts must naturally possess the fighting skills to fend off big, bulky, aggressive attackers, for he comes out of this unscathed and promptly sets off to do his work. He meets back up with his old flame professor (Tara Reid) and learns more about the artifacts. From here on in the plot is basically just a confused, senseless mish mash about supernatural powers, a murderous beast, personal possession of the a'facts for personal power and an intrusive FBI agent (Stephen Dorff) who has a beef with Caldwell and tries to sort the mysterious goings on out his way.It has to be said it's been a long time since a film like Alone in the Dark came along which got all the right ingredients for a bad film together so perfectly. Hilariously bad acting, awful story, terrible editing, bad casting (Reid as professor?) and a bad sex scene where Youssou N' Dour's 1994 hit 7 Seconds plays rather viciously as Slater and Reid dabble in some really light porn.Indeed, without knowing anything about him, I'd like to give director Uwe Boll the benefit of the doubt and credit him as a reasonably intelligent man. It's hard to see how he could have seen the script for this unspeakable travesty and not seen what a badly written, incomprehendible, ineffective pile of pong it is. Indeed, you get the impression he must have known what a bad film it was and just made it as a parody of what a really bad film should be like. If you want to check it out on a so bad it's hilarious level, by all means go ahead. Just let yourself in for one REALLY bad film. NO STARS",

I wanted to do the same thing, but after watching this film, I went to my doctor and he told me that I was now mildly retarded. He didn't know I had seen this movie the night before, so he ran a bunch of tests and kept saying \"I just don't get it...\" over and over, but that is a story for a different time.All I can say is that whatever this movie is supposed to be, it isn't. Was it supposed to be scary/suspenseful? Maybe, if your idea of scary/suspenseful is coming downstairs as a little kid on Christmas morning to see if you got a brand new bike, and instead you find your father naked and he throws strawberry jelly in your face and punches you in your nutsack. Confused? So was I when I watched this movie.Was this film supposed to be a horror film? Oh, it was a horror. Kind of like if your Mom wanted to scare neighborhood children on Halloween, so she put on a devil mask and painted bullseyes on her nipples and had the kids shoot her in the tits with BB guns. Would that be horrible? Sure would, just not in the way it was intended to be. Kind of like this movie; its not a horror movie, its a horror of a movie.About 3/4 of the way through the movie I inexplicably started beating my girlfriend. That's right. This film was so bad it made me an abuser. It has also been traced as a root cause of alcoholism, epilepsy, dick cancer, and gingivitis. Oh,. and Stepehen Dorf is in it, so what did I expect?

This goes on for about 3 minutes, explaining....nothing.Christian Slater's character is introduced, as an investigator of Paranormal Activity, for an agency run by the government known as Bureau 713. Now, when you hear this, you'd think \"X-files\". No...actually, think more along the lines of \"Crossing guards who tried out for SWAT, and got rejected.\" The organization is compiled of a bunch of scrawny soldiers in skateboarding helmets and paintball vests spouting tactical non-sense and waving hands in the air as if they're trying to give hand signals. The story, from what I got, was this: This race of Hell demons came upon Earth, and a mad scientist tried to merge human subjects and the race together. He used 20 orphans as test subjects, and now, twenty years later, he has decided to continue his research.Somewhere in there fits some crap about an ancient race that tried to contain the deamons....wow, to be honest, I just got totally lost...I'm sorry...and you will too, so don't even bother seeing this. (Recently, movie prices were just dropped in my area...so thankfully I only wasted $10.00 instead of $14.00)From a technical standpoint: There is no plot..the characters are as dry as the turkey I ate for lunch...These \"elite soldiers\", as I said, run around in knee pads, skateboarding helmets, shooting at anything that moves, and even things that don't move..like the sky..or ground. There's one scene that shows closeups of guns firing in the dark for maybe five minutes...the producers didn't do it, but I will for you.WARNING: THIS FILM MAY CAUSE SEIZURES. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.The movie is just full of poor acting, and what didn't make any sense to me is this: These soldiers flip down their tinted visors...while in the dark...searching for a monster that is entirely black.

Your brain just won't let you have any fun. It knows what you're watching is total garbage. It can't let you enjoy the demon killing and other action scenes because the movie is just so outrageously stupid.This movie was written by someone whose only concept of the English language comes from watching other bad action movies. Every character in \"Alone in the Dark\" talks in clich\u00e9s. Well, not even whole clich\u00e9s, more like clich\u00e9 fragments. Dorff barks orders at Slater who in turn howls at Reid until there's nothing but three mainstream actors wallowing in a bad B-movie.Slater is a detective searching for demons. He finds them. They attack him. Dorff becomes involved in the hunt as does Slater's hot blonde scientist girlfriend Reid. All three of them shoot lots of demons while some asinine reason is given for the demon's world domination plan.\"Alone in the Dark\" is a bad movie. I kind of knew that when I rented it but I was hoping it would at least be a fun flick. I'm sorry to say that the movie is just too brain dead to be enjoyable. Demon killing shouldn't be this dull.One last thing, I really enjoyed the two government agents who stayed behind at the communication command post. They both wore all black and kept saying things like, \"These readings are off the charts!\". In fact, I think the girl agent, (with her government issued black baseball cap on backwards), said that line three times.

I wanted to turn it off. I wanted to go to sleep. But I kept watching for the sake of the review I am writing now.Nothing was good about this movie. The story was forgettable (I seriously don't remember it), the acting was high school talent show-ish, and the script was a mistake. It had to have been a mistake. I can't find another way to explain how a script as bad as the one used for Alone in the Dark could have been written. And the action... Director - \"Lets play some rock music while the actors shoot guns in a dark room! Wooo! It'll look cool.\" Not an exact quote, but I bet it comes close.Alone in the Dark isn't \"so bad its good.\" Its just so bad. It was so bad the filmmakers had to add a 200 word title scroll just to clarify their mess for the test audience who originally screened it. And even with the backstory literally typed out on the screen during the intro, much of the film still doesn't make any sense.Don't even bother watching this beast.",

Even 50 year old no-budget shockers usually had some endearing qualities, this turkey has none, it is insult to the movie going public.

            "content": "To call Alone in the Dark a movie would probably be generous. It is a movie in the sense that events were filmed with a motion picture camera, are edited together and is projected in a theater screen. However, one significant aspect of a real movie, featuring a story, is completely lacking in Alone in the Dark. It is a plot-less, indecipherable mess that goes through the motions of being about something for an hour and a half and then is over.Any attempt to actually describe anything that goes on during the film's running time would most likely be fruitless, but I will attempt: Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator (with only one change of clothes I might add) who has uncovered an artifact that holds the key to opening a door to another dimension (I think) that is being pursued by a scientist working for the covert Bureau 713, a paranormal investigation division on the government, although the current manager of the Bureau, Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff) is unaware of the nefarious plot under his nose and attempting to stop this scientist from opening the doorway also.That brief synopsis is the best I can piece together from my viewing experience of the film, and if it seems under-explained and not quite complete, that is because the film is the same way: under-explained and not quite complete. The actors here are just going through motions of scenes and reciting dialog as if it meant something when it doesn't really. I never felt I had a good grasp on anything that was happening in the film, and kept waiting for the next scene to start explaining things, and that scene and explanation never came.On the technical end, Alone in the Dark is at least competent. The visual effects of the various otherworldly creatures is decent, the film doesn't look supremely low-budget (although I am sure it is), and it boasts, while not a stellar cast, one that has at least some name recognition. Unfortunately, most of the cast is wasted in this film, and at least some of the supporting actors turn in some rather horrible performances, especially Tara Reid as an assistant museum curator and Carnby's girlfriend. Her dialog delivery is poor and doesn't really make much of an impression.As the film progresses, it's pretty obvious that the filmmakers are channeling better movies like Aliens (with it's massive firefight between creatures and soldiers) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (possessed humans by alien creatures), but doesn't come close to approximating the good aspects of either of those films. In the end, Alone in the Dark is an hour and half exercise in attempting to make a buck off very little effort. If the film makes back it's cost, it will, unfortunately, have succeeded. Just so there isn't an Alone in the Dark 2.",

You can rarely pin it on one person, and those who do are missing the bigger picture. Regardless, Alone In The Dark did not need to be made. This film should never have been released.You watch it. Things happen, with only the most tenuous connection making a plot out of the story. This aspect of the film is so bad that, without the introductory dialog, there would be zero hope of the viewer understanding why these things were happening. So, the core of any successful film is, in my opinion, the story and the plot; there is a story here, but it's ridiculous. There is a plot, but it's too loose to do its job.You watch it. You see Christian Slater overacting, stiff and lifeless. You see Brad Doriff, miscast and unnecessary. You see Tara Reid. And seeing Tara Reid is fine in my book, but when she starts talking, the magic is lost. You see bad acting everywhere, bad casting and ridiculous dialog, poor execution and performance all around.You watch it. The actual fear from a horror movie is nonexistent; I challenge anyone to describe what truly scared them about this film. The entities that are meant to scare you are nearly void of purpose, poorly designed, digitally executed in a shoddy, video game-esque manner that detracts from the live action film you're watching, and, more than anything, are not scary in and of themselves.Nothing about this film is scary. Nothing about this film is redeemable. For their budget, they could have filmed somebody playing the classic PC game it is \"based on\" (in quotes because, beyond the lead character's name, there is nothing in this movie that relates to that game) for two hours and made a more enjoyable film. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Another smudge on Uwe Boll's credibility, but not even close to being completely his fault.",

Turning popular violent video games into movies is a bad idea and it's guaranteed to result in an unwatchable film. Wasn't the humiliation after that dreadful \"House of the Dead\" enough evidence for him? Obviously not, because here's \"Alone of the Dark\" and he already finished his new potential turkey \"Bloodrayne\". I don't really feel like wasting too many words on this idiotic film, so I'll just second the majority of opinions around here: \"Alone in the Dark\" is a lousy and very irritating film that truly deserves his ranking among the hundred worst movies ever made. The plot (for as far as you can use the term \"plot\") isn't just rubbish, it's also highly unoriginal and d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu! Ancient alternate civilizations....gateways to evil dimensions...secret government agencies that cover up atrocities...kidnapping orphans to experiment upon...It all sounds like a very bad episode from \"the X-files\". The CGI effects are pathetic and the visuals and sound effects are only able to give you a stomach ache. There's absolutely no humor in this film and it's really sad to witness how all the actors take their roles so serious. Talking about acting, this turkey has some of the worst ever! Especially Stephen Dorff should urgently consider a major career change as he only appeared in very mediocre movies lately. Christian Slater looks ludicrous in his role of butt-kicking hero and you can't possibly expect us to see Tara Reid as an intelligent archaeologist, can you? The most alarming fact to me was that I saw this film at a festival were Uwe Boll personally came to present his film. He was talking about this project as he was a new prodigy and the savior of future horror! Painful...very painful.",

I don't know what's worse, the fact that this is apparently a big budget film shot as a cheap TV episode, the incredibly wooden and amateur acting, the clueless directing, or the nonexistent plot. No, the worst insult to you as a viewer is that this movie actually dares to take itself seriously!!! Pretentious to the point of nausea, you can't take your hand off the FF because you're compelled to get the excruciating film to move forward in some way and get it over with. The production values are so appalling!! You'll quickly realise that they are redressing the same set for several different scenes. One moment it's a museum, the next it's Slater's apartment, the next it's an abandoned factory, the next it's an underground laboratory.... it's just embarrassingly obvious. So, where did the money go? It seems all, and I mean all the budget was spent on creating the creatures, which are fine, but not that big a deal. But after you see the little payoff you'll get from the monsters, you'll find it all the more painful that you got them in exchange for a bargain-basement production.About the 'actors', dead extras can't even remain still, since one actress is seen getting up when the actors are leaving the scene. Sloppy!!! Cheap!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, who's more to blame for such a stupid blunder? the actress who can't understand that she has to wait for a few minutes, the director for not re-shooting the scene, or the editor, for not trimming those few seconds that constitute the final nail in the coffin?

When watching this film, I was lost when trying to Figure out the above films were rated better. House of the Dead was probably the worst I have seen and its still rated better. Alone in the Dark isn't amazing. It wont live long in the Memory for some but it deserves a lot more than 2.0. I think 5.0 might be about right.On to the Film itself. It starts quite nice, the first action scene is entertaining and to be honest, I was impressed! Now, as the film goes on, you would expect the main Characters to be described and maybe a little History and reason, for what they are doing, Right? Nope! We get another action scene followed by another action scene followed by a Sex scene. Wow, take a breath please... Now we get some Character details??? Nope, we get more and more \"Action\". Its entertaining apart from some bad effects and dreadful Rock music but you have to have character details. They are part of the Movie, they Must be involved more, but they aren't. Don't get me wrong, some things are shown or said but You are drip-fed minor details about whats happening and Whos who and the way its done is just wrong! This is why the film, for me, doesn't get anything over 5 because it can get tiresome. To be perfectly Honest, I enjoyed parts of the Film a lot. The Plot was a little thin and the Acting in many places was weak but I still watched from Start to finish and still felt satisfied. It wasn't Slaters best, but it wasn't it worst. He did well as the Lines he were given were pretty poor. Tara Reid is not Aline Cedrac. Tara fails to impress all the way through. She cant act smart and simply, because of that very factor, she failed in every department. The best had to be Stephen Dorff, he played the character well and was seriously trying is best. Well played!Overall, I wasn't disappointed for some reason. I have played the game but to be honest, the story in the game sucked too! So I wasn't gonna argue if they changed that for the Movie. It did get a little tiresome towards the end but I really do feel for the actors as I think a better Director/Producer/Writter could have made this film something special...5/10",

Christian Slater, along with Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff (who gets hardly any time in the movie) walk around shedding their clothes left and right and attempting to act in front of the camera in this wreck of 96 minutes of what a b-movie fanatic might just call a \"movie.\" For everybody else, Alone in the Dark may be that one crapfest out there with enough bad editing, bad dialogue, bad direction, and bad acting to beat Plan 9 From Outer Space's record for worst movie of all time.Dr. Uwe Boll finally proves to us that he is helpless, and even though God himself won't stop him from making movies, he is going to keep making clunkers till somebody shoots him in the head. The problem with him is that he has no taste in film; he thinks everything goes good with Matrix special effects. Someone should tell him that Matrix special effects belong in the Matrix movies, and not in horror video game adaptations. You will constantly see slow moving bullets and time slowing down as people jump through windows and swing punches during fight scenes. These effects cause a lot of money to film. Dr. Boll actually spent more money to lower the quality of his movie. Only he is capable of doing that. And on top of that, the overall creature effects looked like something out my Playstaion 1. The man intentionally made it to seem that way, and further lowered the quality of the movie, of what might of been a good movie if executed properly.Brendan Fletcher, of Freddy vs. Jason fame, shows up in the movie and impresses the audience with his short but powerful performance as the surfing tax driver. Since when do surfers drive taxi cabs? In Alone in the Dark, they do.I can go on about how bad this movie is, but I would be just repeating what the other two thousand negative reviews have been saying about this movie. You know, I'm a very optimistic guy. If one of my professors told me I only had a ten percent chance of passing the class, I would stick in there and hope for the best. As for Dr. Boll, I had the same optimism and for his other turkey, House of the Dead. Now this is no HotD review, but the movie was awful, and perhaps it was not his fault. Something could of gone wrong during filming, and maybe--just maybe--Dr. Boll isn't that bad. So I had some hopes for Alone in the Dark, but I now know since I have seen his latest film, I am positve: Dr. Uwe Boll cannot make a good movie if his life depended on it, and with the way his career is going now, I won't be surprised if something happens to him.

            "content": "Alone in the Dark is not a film for the faint of heart, nor the faint of patience. Just a word of warning.It begins 22 years ago, when Professor Hudgens took 20 orphans and subjected them to bizarre and unprecedented experiments in the hopes of saving the human race. Basing his research on material culled from archaeological digs for an ancient tribe called the Abskani, Hudgens succeeds and hides his work from everyone \u0096 including the government that funded it. As his experiments come to a close, one of the orphans, named Edward Carnby, escapes and makes off into the wild to live free from Hudgens' controlling influence.Now fully grown, Carnby dedicates his life to exploring paranormal activity across the globe. Once a member of the secret government unit Bureau 713, he has become a one-man agency, and finds that his latest discovery, a small ring-shaped artifact, may hold the key to a recent increase in paranormal activity around the world. Reuniting with his estranged archaeologist girlfriend Aline Cedrac, Carnby begins to search for answers and hopefully save the world.What he soon discovers is that Bureau 713, led by Agent Richard Burke, is similarly aware of the recent surge in activity, and determined to find the same solution he now frantically searches for. Reluctantly joining with Burke, Carnby begins to unravel the web of mystery that surrounds his artifact, Professor Hudgens, and even himself. As more and more evidence of a connection appears between his own past and that of Bureau 713, Carnby must decide whether to help save his friends \u0096 and possibly the entire human race \u0096 or abandon them to uncover the long-hidden truths for which he's been searching all of his life.Now for the record, I have heard and read many stories about people walking out on bad movies but never actually witnessed it. Well, now I can saw I have. About half way into the flick, two people walked out of the theater that only had about ten people in it tops. And to be honest, it wasn't going to get any better. I have read so many, countless, reviews on this movie being God awful. I was really counting on this one to be good. I wanted to see it so bad, and I wanted to love it so much. But I can't.The film is far from being the \"Worst movie ever made\" that so many people are making it out to be though. Bare in mind, the mad man that is responsible for the turd that House Of The Dead made this flick, you'll most likely get a rough idea of what not to expect. Uwe Boll seems to have improved his direction slightly with this one, and for the better. The movie is not completely mindless, as House Of The Dead obviously was. Tara Reid's performance was god awful, and thankfully, despite her having second bill, she does not over power the film.Slater and Dorff have definitely seen better days. This movie is probably their worst as a matter of fact. I assume a few dead presidents had something to do Slater's and Dorff's involvement in this flop. I mean, the script isn't exactly Casablanca. But then again, but movie is? I have a feeling I'm going to be flagged with many negative comments because of this review. I do like this movie. What I like about it is that the action is not constant, but rather it builds more on suspense and horror rather than blood and gore. Boll's direction is quite unique. It's become a little professional than his ladder House Of The Dead, which relied souly on mindless action. He seems to be able to make you jump on some scenes which he tried to do in House Of The Dead, but ultimately, he fell on his face with a ridiculous silly action flick that tries too hard to scare with action and gore rather than building up suspense. He succeeds with the suspense here.Overall, Boll is bad director, and he just chooses bad projects. House Of The Dead was one of them. Alone In The Dark was also a bad choice, but he seems to have found to a way to approach this film differently than House Of The Dead (I can't put my finger on it, but it's there) and hopefully he gets better at it for his next films, BloodRayne, Far Cry etc. Which I am anxiously awaiting. I'm ready to see what Mr. Boll will have up his sleeve for his following films. Hopefully he WILL improve on BloodRayne.My conclusion is simply this: Uwe Boll's career is soon to end in America, I'm not afraid to say. The man simply cannot direct. A blind mute has better direction than Boll's movies for crying out loud. But he does know how to entertain. And unfortunately, that is pretty much all Hollywood has to offer us right now, and Alone In The Dark succeeds on that level, yet fails on almost every other. I'm on the fence with this movie. I can easily say I enjoy it, but won't bother with it until the DVD arrives. If that. The ending is what really bummed me out. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. **1/2/*****P.S.

            "content": "You know when a movie is in trouble when its foreword lasts so long that you have trouble finishing the first five lines before the next five scroll up to replace them. Clearly, Lions Gate Films hired a narrator so that audiences could keep up. Sadly, the heavily detailed preamble in \"House of the Dead\" director Uwe Boll's newest video game masquerading as a movie \"Alone In The Dark\" is so obtuse that you may want to ignore it and wait for the characters to repeat bits and pieces of it in their dialogue. Frequently, producers add prefaces because they are afraid that there is no other way to convey such an abundance of back story. Seriously, who goes to the movies to read? Most people want to watch and react rather than read. This is why many moviegoers shun films with subtitles. Anyway, this derivative, below-average, formula-driven creature feature lacks the production values and the polish that German-born helmer Boll brought to his earlier epic \"House of the Dead.\" Believe it or not, \"House of the Dead\" looks like a four-star masterpiece compared to this largely humorless, overly complicated, clich\u00e9d-ridden, supernatural claptrap about huge, leaping, cranium-crushing, lizards of the \"Alien\" variety that number into the thousands like the bugs in \"Starship Troopers.\" No, \"Alone in the Dark\" is neither bad enough to qualify as campy, like those guilty-pleasure, 1950s' sci-fi monster mashes, nor does it take the creature feature flick to the next level, like the vastly underrated \"Alien vs. Predator.\" Among a predominantly no-name cast, Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff appear to be killing time for a paycheck in this excuse for lots of second-rate blood & gore.Fashionably unshaven, with a tattoo on one shoulder and a spaghetti-western duster draped over his buff physique, actor Christian Slater impersonates a haunted 'paranormal investigator' on the trail of a mystery about a lost Native American tribe called the Abskani. This advanced society thrived during the age of the hunters and gatherers. They opened a gateway between light and darkness and unleashed the spawn of Hell. As the Tara Reid character observes during a lull in the action: \"Some doors aren't meant to be opened.\" Could she have been talking about the doors to all the movie theaters where this substandard, superficial adventure is being shown? These hideous demons are supposedly so ghastly that the Indians locked them up in a gold-plated Pandora's Box. Designed as they are by a special effects company called Toy Box, the monsters appear pretty phony.As a rough and tumble hero patterned in the Indiana Jones mold, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater of \"True Romance\") has just discovered an ancient artifact in the Amazon basin that promises to unlock the secrets of the Abskani and these demon lizards called Xenoes. Once Carnby deplanes, an apparently invincible assailant tries to relieve our hero of that precious relic. This thuggish brute takes a couple of 9mm slugs in the chest and shrugs them off like bee-stings. Carnby finally disposes of him by body-slamming him atop a large ice-pick. Unfortunately, this drawn-out match amounts to the best thing in this anti-climatic opus. Eventually, we learn from the hopelessly overwrought script (by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer) that a crazed scientist, Professor Hudgens (newcomer Mathew Walker), abducted Carnby and nineteen other kids from a Catholic orphanage and used them as guinea pigs in his nefarious experiments. Hudgens wanted to merge man with nature as the ill-fated Abskani tried. After Walker forced a slimy, squirming, centipede-like critter down all their gullets that attached itself to their spines, Carnby managed to escape and kill his parasite. The other nineteen weren't as lucky. Twenty-two years later, amid nightmares, they drop what they're doing in their everyday lives and mutate into murderous ashen-faced zombies. Meanwhile, a trigger-happy, paranormal, SWAT-team style outfit called Bureau 713, headed by Commander Burke (Kiefer Sutherland look-a-like Stephen Dorff of \"Blade\"), wants to wipe out these dastardly devils. Inevitably, Carnby looks for help from his girlfriend, Aline Cedrac (an abominably miscast Tara Reid of \"American Pie\"), a brilliant but bespectacled archaeologist who wears clothes that bare her midriff but conceal her belly button. She also has a funny way of saying 'Newfoundland.' Although neither Slater nor she conjures up any chemistry as lovers, Reid has one great scene where she punches him out for failing to let her know about his whereabouts. This scene and the first fight scene are about as good as it gets.Although the overexposed, washed-out photography adds an edgy quality to the narrative, it makes everybody look unattractive in their pancake-thick make-up. The monsters don't appear very realistic and never pose a tangible threat. The gore is cheesy by anybody's standards. The dialogue sounds like a play-by-play commentary. The characters spend too much time telling us where the plot is propelling them or uttering inconsequential fluff to keep your attention from drifting. Most of the action occurs in a creepy mine shaft or an abandoned warehouse. At least, \"House of the Dead\" was fun, while \"Alone in the Dark\" suffers from a case of prefabricated plot. Slater and Dorff both bring more dignity to this mediocre movie than it deserves. Meanwhile, this swiftly-paced, 96-minute potboiler reaches its predictable climax without arousing the least bit of sympathy for our heroes or modern civilization.Expect to see \"Alone in the Dark'' on the Sci-Fi Channel where the commercials will provide some relief from this noisy tedium.",

One of the better elements with this one is the absolutely frantic and frenetic Action Movie-like pace here which really goes a long way towards making this one so enjoyable. This starts off really nicely here as the start of this one coincides with the car chase through the streets and the resulting series of brawls through the shops along the way offers a truly fine opening, the museum shootout is a lot of fun with the creatures coming into play nicely stalking them in the darkness while it makes use of a not only the exhibits but also the different interconnecting hallways for some great chases throughout here as they try to get away before the utter fun of the firefight from the military team that arrives to take them out and the confrontation in the house is even better with the different tactics of avoiding the creature being quite fun while again offering a lot to like in the fine gunfire and shoot-outs use to take the creatures down. As well, there's the finale here where this one really has a lot to like in the main attack against the team set-up outside with all kinds of gun-play to utilize in the situation even though there's the high-powered weaponry on display the creatures still break-through and slaughter the team in graphic fashion providing this with a thrilling sequence along the way. It also finishes up the rather fine part here of the underground adventures down in the pit where they discover the control facility and finally get the big resolution in play to end this on a fine note. These make the film enjoyable enough here to hold this off against the few minor flaws here. The main issue with this one is the absolutely confusing storyline here that makes no sense whatsoever throughout here, from the reasoning of the security council to need the children for the original experiment, why he had escaped as long as he had despite everyone knowing of his involvement, the reasoning for the creatures' appearance and the connection to the Indian tribe being just some of the questions raised here, and some of these are ones that impact that film a lot. The only other flaw to this one is the fact that there's really badly-done CGI that really doesn't offer much appeal here in making the creatures imposing and fearful here with the way they're depicted. There's still enough positives to like here to hold this one up.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and a clothed sex scene.",

I can barely grasp all the opinions this movie produced inside of my twisted mind but I will try.The question is where did all the money go into? The monsters? Well I don't think mostly invisible monster effects are expensive. Then we have the main character starring Christian Slater. He has now officially reached the bottom. I would really like to know what he thought when reading the script for the first time. If there was one. Tara Reid as an archaeologist? Exactly. Enough said. Fascinating how there really isn't even a trace of character development.The movie starts off with some lame text and a narrator speaking it out. This guy sucks heavily. Great stuff. Imagine a retard forced to read with a gun pointed to his head. That's what you have here. I actually watched the director's commentary (way more entertaining than the movie itself) and Uwe thinks this explains some of the story. He also revealed other groundbreaking things to me. That the ending is poetic, that this is actually about nature taking revenge against man and that the animatronic monster puppeteer is Chinese who doesn't know any other language so they had to shoot one scene 25 times.What about the plot? Well I did understand bureau 713, the governments paranormal research agency, had something to do with things going on but that's basically it. So many questions are not answered and believe me there are tons. Why were the artifacts scattered across the world? What's the purpose of these creatures? What's the point of anything in this film? I'd really like to know.Slater's thoughts which we can hear throughout the movie are very interesting. They remind me of a farting duck singing some very bad ballads. Like the one in the completely mysterious sex scene with Tara Reid. This was actually the closest step to character development. Very sad indeed. In his commentary Uwe himself stated that Tara not getting her bra off is, I QUOTE: \"idiotic.\" Uwe you are my hero and idol.The first fight in the movie featuring Slater and some crazy moron is very satisfying. Here we witness Slater's super strong kick which blasts the guy through glass! Also appearing: pointless fence climbing, pointless jumping, pointless everything. All that because of an artifact that looks like a cake that looks like a shoe that looks like it's badly made. And it's very small.Bureau 713 is definitely a huge pile of manure. They have all these gadgets and so many soldiers and they can't do squat. One of the worst secret government organizations seen on film. Well the software on their computers looks pretty neat. And why is Uwe obsessed in shooting long waiting-to-die scenes with some soldiers we see for the first time? There are actually a few in a row at one point near the end of the movie. Another mystery.Just remembered the greedy captain of a transport ship. That is what I call bad acting with just one line. Love that guy he's brilliant.Okay. This movie sucks very much. But! With the Uwe's commentary on DVD it's absolutely awesome. It's actually pure comedy that way since Uwe is dead serious when talking. That commentary is really killer stuff. So don't waste your time watching just the movie, watch it strait off with the commentary and you have a winner. Recommended when viewing: tons of popcorn, rivers of beer, vomit can and an old shoe that looks like an artifact. Just be careful if you see a bold idiot with sunglasses.Originally written for http://www.bad-good.org",

When most people hear comments about a film that are as bad as what's been said about Alone in the Dark, they'll avoid at all costs; but for me, the bad comments really made me want to see it, just to see if it is really is as bad as they say - and surprise, surprise, it's just as bad; if not worse. There are a number of things that can make a movie be the opposite of good, and Alone in the Dark manages to lampoon a surprising amount of them. First of all, this film is boring in a way not often seen outside of films that have the words 'Blair', 'Project' and 'Witch' in the title. It's based on a video game (that I've never played, by the way), so you'd expect there to be lots of flashy and exciting scenes; but there isn't. There are scenes that should be exciting, but it's all so downbeat that it's hard to care. Despite looking good, the film also suffers from really poor production elements, including really bad acting, a terrible script and lethargic direction, courtesy of everyone least favourite modern horror director; the lamentable Uwe Boll.Actually (and thankfully), this is the first film I've seen from Boll, and I'm not finding the idea of the rest being rubbish hard to handle. House of the Dead was lambasted upon release, so you'd expect movie producers to blacklist the director; but instead, they gave him this film, which was also lambasted upon release. So what do they do? They give him Bloodrayne, that gets lambasted and now I've noticed that his upcoming projects include adaptations of Postal and Fear Effect! What's going on here?! I'm not a movie director, and other than what I've picked up through watching other people's films, I don't know anything about movie-making; but I'd really like to think that even I could make a better movie than this one (I'm available to make a video game movie, if any of Boll's producers are listening). This brings me to the acting. I actually rather like Christian Slater, so I really hope that he was well paid for appearing in this trash, because seeing him try to convince the audience that he's all action hero is really painful. No point in mentioning the rest of the cast...or anything else about this film. I wasted an hour and half on it, and it took me about ten minutes writing this.

            "content": "I will watch just about anything. It's a problem sometimes. Uwe Boll's reputation precedes him, as does that of 'Alone in the dark' specifically. Given an opportunity to watch this infamous film for myself, I couldn't refuse.Is it really that bad?I'm not sure what the opposite is of being impressed - and a thesaurus is no great help in this case - but 'Alone in the dark' seems to work tirelessly from the very beginning to make sure we are that. One full minute of exposition in the form of scrolling text on the screen, accompanied by a voiceover. A flashback, to a couple decades past, transitions quickly and haphazardly to the beginning of the narrative - where right away the screenplay announces itself as blunt, direct, and direly lacking in all subtlety. That happens again in the next scene. And the next. And the next. And...Star Christian Slater's opening narration, introducing his character to the audience, exemplifies the definition of \"phoned in.\" The speedy shift to an action sequence is chock-full of effects, camerawork, and choreography that seemingly tries to imp the grandiosity of more celebrated thrillers, but far less convincingly. And so far we're only 15 minutes in.Is 'Alone in the dark' really that bad? Even having seen Boll's 'In the name of the king,' and knowing the poor regard this is kept in broadly, I wasn't fully prepared for what I was committing to watching. Yes: It pretty much is exactly that bad.Story beats consistently strain credulity. I'm given to understand that Boll had a hand in rewriting the screenplay to his own ends, but I have a hard time believing that the credit given to other screenwriters here means that they weren't just as complicit. What we get are flat, hollow characterizations; cheap thrills; hack dialogue; tepid action sequences; and an overall plot that is carelessly conceived, and flimsy.The original score in the film is at once both unremarkable and over the top; every band who contributed to the accompanying soundtrack should be ashamed of themselves. The effects, from slow motion and gunfire to blood and gore, mostly reek of the same malodorous, heavy hand as the screenplay. That goes as well for the direction, which would be less than noteworthy if not for Boll's failure to compose very conventional shots with the same steadiness and practiced dexterity of countless other film-makers.I do genuinely like a few instances of design in the sets and props. There are some very recognizable and admirable names in the cast, including and not limited to star Slater, Mark Acheson, Frank C. Turner, and Stephen Dorff. Unfortunately, between Boll's direction and the collectively botched writing, these performers are at best gone to waste. Much has been made of Tara Reid's performance, and I ever hesitate to leap to conclusions about an actor's skills in a picture that's generally lackluster. Unfortunately, in this case, I think it's safe to say that Reid also has something to answer for in 'Alone in the dark.' I don't want to judge the whole of her career on this one film, but her contribution to the mess that this turned out to be is no less dubious.An action sequence about halfway through weirdly feels unexpectedly inspired - yet if it felt a little overdone at the start, it only becomes more so as it goes on. At that point I had a moment where I allowed myself to hope that the movie had gotten all of its questionable bombast out of the way, and things would improve in the second half of the length. They didn't. Not really.Against all odds, there are some worthwhile ideas here. In much more capable hands, this movie could and should have been a fun supernatural horror thriller, emphasizing unseen terrors in the dark against the backdrop of ancient myth and legend. Instead, such concepts are all but entirely subsumed in the drive to fill the duration with action.And then there's the ending. All I can say is that the last 5 minutes, following the climax, manages to outdo all that came before it: The denouement is so poorly conceptualized, disjointedly written, and altogether egregiously ill-considered that it blasts away whatever minimal value the film may have held previously. Despite everything, up to this moment I was prepared to say that I've still seen worse movies. Now I'm not so sure.'Alone in the dark' is so bad that it can't even elicit a derisive laugh. My curiosity got the best of me and I felt compelled to watch it, but now I'm somewhat inclined to think that was a mistake. Unless you're a masochist who purposefully seeks out cinematic torment, I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "There is a fine, extremely fine line between campy and crappy. I'm not sure any director can set out to make a campy film and be guaranteed to succeed. If they do succeed and save their film from just being crap then the film can turn into a profitable series or \"classic.\" A good example is the Evil Dead series which was just so amazingly bad that it's one of the most classic campiest series ever. In my opinion Alone In The Dark is not, it's not crap, it's full of campy low budget, mind stretching effects that makes it watchable. It's seams are almost bursting apart but the campiness holds it together by a thread.Alone In The Dark is supposedly based off the video game series but really only in the name of the characters. The comparisons end there. Edward Carnby is a paranormal investigator who formally worked for a Government agency but now freelances looking for the answers to an ancient secret. An eccentric archaeologist is also looking for the answers to a mysterious evil discovered by an ancient civilization, the Abkane. Carnby races against him to find an artifact that will release this evil.That's the best I can give for this plot. There is no reason behind releasing this evil, there is no background or explanation or really any sort of sense making plot. When you have such a poorly written story, you better hope you have some amazing action to back it up. The action is not bad for this film. The opening scene involving a taxi cab chase actually made me sit up and take notice thinking...hey this movie might be good!! It does slide a little from there. The extremely low budget effects especially the firing of weapons and the blood and gore to the attempt at CGI for the monsters is horrendous, campy, and laughable so it has that going for it. Christian Slater plays Carnby well. He manages to pull off the broody, hero with a dark past well. He's not my favorite actor and works better in a supporting role but he does well considering this is more of a straight to video type role. Uwe Boll is getting a lot of flack for directing this and House Of The Dead which granted was one of the crappiest films I've ever sat through but Boll is smart...he's fallen into a cash cow of ideas without ever lifting a finger. All of a sudden he's got a line up of video game to movies films coming. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. Some of the video games have a killer story that could translate into an awesome film...Resident Evil has been turning out well. DOOM looks good, Tomb Raider was acceptable...what it comes down to is Boll a good director?? It seems not considering his campy and disappointing adaptations to date. Remarkably he did bring on some star power for Alone In The Dark, Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff all have done very popular work. They don't have much to work with this story. Tara Reid is just awful, I don't know how this girl became a celebrity. She fits into the storyline well because she's terrible!! Despite all this Alone In The Dark is leaps and bounds better than House Of The Dead and it'll make you laugh with it's campiness. One gory scene featuring a split head was pretty grotesque. You'll groan and probably be disappointed but it's not as bad as you might think. 5/10",

            "content": "I gave this movie a 5 out 10. You would probably ask why I would do that. I'm in no way a fan of Boll's other movies. But this movie was great to enjoy if you are looking for a movie where you can shut down your brains and just look at it. I saw House of the Dead and I hated it. It was one of the worst zombie movies ever made. Having played the game Alone in the Dark, I did enjoy this movie. Sure allot of things were wrong: the plot holes, the directing, etc... It is great to see Tara Reid do things that she wouldn't normally do. Most directors wouldn't cast Reid as a scientist, but here she does play one and you have to respect her decision to do such a thing. I mainly rented this movie for the idea that this movie was based upon a video game and I wanted to see how he did it. Another reason were Stephen Dorf, Tara Reid and Christian Slater. I like seeing them on screen, so I wasn't disappointed in their acting abilities. They did give the best of their abilities under the direction of a director who isn't a A-class director. This movie can be compared to Van Helsing, the Mummy Trilogy and many other movies who are nothing more than mere entertainment and should be viewed as such. They aren't a masterpiece. Alone in the Dark is a action-horror movie with the emphasis on action and not survival-horror like in the game. It is great to see that Uwe Boll does take on the challenge to direct movies, mainstream Hollywood wouldn't do. Or the fact that Boll is not afraid to deviate from the game storyline. Perhaps in the near future, someone in Hollywood might come up with the idea to remake those Uwe Boll's movies and possibly even do it better than he does. But for now, we will have to do with Boll making movies based upon games. It's a acquired taste, this man's movies. I do hope that the next movies will be more quality than quantity, but I fear it would be the opposite.",

Can it be that bad? Well.......Thing's start off badly with a ridiculously long Star Wars style scroll which is also spoken in case you can't read.We are then straight into a car chase including box's of vegetables getting hit, how's that for a clich\u00e9? then a fight, with loads of slo-mo camera work, resulting in the death of the bad guy which seems to go un-noticed in the market place! Christian Slater is unfortunate to be the star of this turkey with Tara Reid co-staring as his girlfriend who is an archaeologist, you can tell she's clever as she wears glasses and her hair in a bob, though she does spend most of the movie running around in a naval revealing tank top.She was obviously hired for her looks and not her acting ability as she plainly has none, I can't recall such a wooden performance for some time! The movie meanders on at a snails pace, we get a pointless and utterly gratuitous love scene, then some monster's appear and a SWAT style team,lead by the dreadful Stephen Dorff, spend the rest of the movie trying to kill them and the movie turns into a dreadful low grade Aliens style flick-but without the horror and suspense!

In the novel \"1984\" and various film versions of \"1984\", the hero of the story, Winston Smith, was told, after being tortured by the state for an extensive period of time, the worst torture for him was waiting in room 101 which contained his worst nightmare. We remember that Winston had been terrified of rats ever since childhood because his mother had been killed by rats.When Winston was put in room 101 by Big Brother's henchman, a rat cage was placed on Winston's face and he was told that the guard on the cage protecting him from the hungry rats would be removed unless he renounced his love for Julia and swore loyalty to \"Big Brother\".After watching this movie last night on T.V. it is my opinion that had Winston been given a choice between viewing this \"movie\" and telling \"Big Brother' to remove the protective guard on the cage, I am confident that Winston would have said, \"I'll take the rats please\".",

            "content": "Alone in the Dark is a disappointment, but it's in a way you might not expect. Some movies fail to live up to the hype of their praise, but this is a rare breed of movie that fails to live up to the hype of its ridicule. I wanted it to be so bad that it was good, but unfortunately, it doesn't even \"succeed\" on that level. It has its moments, but rather than sustaining a constant stream of \"entertainingly awful badness,\" it just starts to drag and becomes a chore to finish sitting through. Folks, I've seen Troll 2, and Alone in the Dark - you are no Troll 2.I don't recommend paying money to see this (and thank goodness I didn't), so I'll be kind enough to point out some of the highlights: * The movie starts off with a 60-second scroll text. A narrator, who sounds a lot like David Carradine, reads it to us. Feel free to read along! Since this is loosely based on a video game, one can only assume that Boll wanted us to experience all the *COUGH* excitement *COUGH* of reading an instruction manual. Brilliant.* At the beginning of the movie, Slater is sleeping on a plane and is having a dream about his past when he was part of a group of 20 orphans who were used for some weird experiments 22 years ago. When he wakes up, a bad kid actor barely manages to ask him if he had nightmares. Slater mumbles something about, \"Yeah, I had this dream that my agent let me accept a role in a Uwe Boll mov...\" but before Slater can finish his sentence the scene is cut. Very choppy editing if you ask me.* Tara Reid is an assistant museum curator/archaeologist. You may have the tendency to read that sentence and scoff, but please keep in mind that she wears glasses and puts her hair in a bun. We all know that automatically equates to intelligence. Unfortunately, she fails to convince us of any sign of said intelligence as she spits out every line with such a lack of emotion that you just know she had memorized it five seconds ago and was doing her very best to say it without messing up. \"Edward. It. is. so. good. to. see. you. again.\" * A huge creature with inhuman strength chases Slater and Reid into a room at the museum. They close the door and Slater yells at Tara to lock it. This creature just penetrated a dude's skull and is rampaging through the museum, destroying everything it touches, but a locked door is gonna stop it? * Welcome to the world of awkward, out-of-place make out scenes. Out of nowhere, Slater and Reid start rekindling their old flame on a bed at the museum. Was that supposed to be an ancient artifact? King Tut's bed, perhaps? Or does the museum just keep a bed with silk sheets handy? * Don't you just love big fight scenes that consist of CGI creatures, loud heavy metal music, lots of darkness, and a little gunfire flash? It's by design. You can't see or figure out what's going on, so I can only assume that Boll lives by the \"if you can't see it, then you can't judge it too harshly\" philosophy.* There's an agent in the movie named Pinkerton. Agent Pinkerton? Come on. They should've had a sheriff named \"Marshall Law.\" * There weren't nearly as many cheesy lines as there should've been, but Slater did manage to reel off a handful of stupid ones like, \"Something tells me we're not the first ones down here,\" as he stares at an obviously MAN-MADE wall. Well thank you, Master of the Bloody Obvious. Those human skulls adorning the walls may have been a tip-off as well.* Why in the world are the soldiers setting a timer on a bomb to explode in 8 seconds. 8 seconds? Ever heard of giving yourself a few seconds to FLEE TO SAFETY?!?!?! Or was this a subtle, yet-oh-so-clever homage to the 1994 Luke Perry/Stephen Baldwin Lane Frost biopic? * There's no way you can keep from laughing at what is possibly the absolute worst song to play over ending credits I've ever heard in a movie. Some band called Nightwish starts belting out, \"I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL\" and Mr. Shade and I immediately started doing bad Dokken impersonations. I was spinning around, doing haymakers with a fake guitar, and Mr. Shade was laying some heavy beats on his imaginary drum set. There IS entertainment value to be found in songs that sound like they came straight out of the 1980s heavy metal genre; you just have to look for it.It's pretty sad when you're sitting in the theater thinking, \"You know, this movie would've been far more entertaining with Jean Claude Van Damme delivering bad one-liners in his broken English.\" What Boll should've done is had Van Damme stare down one of the evil monstrosities, and as he removed a cigar from his mouth he'd say, \"Looks like you'll be alone... IN THE GRAVE!\" Then he'd open fire and blow the demon-spawn back to the brimstone from which it came. The line is cheesy, but it's what is needed if you want to make a bad movie like this work.\"Some doors are meant to stay shut,\" Slater tells us. Yeah, and some movies are meant to stay unmade. Let's hope it's a lesson that Mr. Boll soon learns.Rating: 1.5 (out of 5)",

I'll be the first to admit I miss Christian Slater on the big screen, but I did not want to see him return like this. He's one of my favorite actors (Heathers, True Romance) and I think he just committed career suicide. Stephen Dorff isn't known for making good role decisions recently either. And don't get me started on Tara Reid. She has her hair pulled back and is wearing glasses so I'm supposed to take her seriously as an archaeologist. Please. Here's a quote from Reid on what archaeologists do: \"They study, like, the Mayans and like...artifacts and stuff.\" I don't know whether to laugh or cry. House of the Dead, Uwe Boll's last film, was a campy and entertaining bad movie. I dug it. This, however, is just a BAD bad movie. There isn't a single laugh. The first ten minutes of House of the Dead had laughs, nudity, and a little zombie carnage. This movie has an opening text crawl to make George Lucas blush, Slater in a ridiculously over-sized trench coat, and nothing else. There was no real gore to speak of. I think the R rating came from Dorff yelling obscenities every time he was on camera. There are no redeeming qualities here and an ending to stump even the most genius of cinematic minds. The \"success\" of House of the Dead must have led Boll to believe he was doing an art house picture. Can't wait to see Bloodrayne and all the other video game adaptations Boll has ready to throw at us.",

This series of ridiculous, incoherent...stuff, as so many on here give testimony to, crowns him King of wasted film. There's no real point in discussing the movie, if that's what it is. Just because you see moving images when you press play doesn't mean it's a film. There's money here, you can tell, which makes it even worse. So many daring, imaginative filmmakers out there would love to have had this budget. But no, Boll is given yet another project to insult moviegoers. When Boll makes personal appearances he does get crowds, people just love to have their photo taken with him and get his autograph. I'm personally offended by this practice in that it only encourages him. Truly bad movie making should not be praised or encouraged. There are bad films out there that are fun, we appreciate the effort, especially if the filmmaker was sincere but fell short. But this is just another example of a man's insistence on his talent, confident in his abilities, arrogant in the face of audience reaction, time after time. I see in the trivia he blames the script. OK. This mess should come with a manual and some sort of medication. Boll is making Zombie Massacre due out in 2010. May God Have Mercy On Our Souls.",

I do know, how ever, that the newer games have been brought to modern times instead of early 20th century.The main character of the film is Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), same as in the games. He's a paranormal investigator trailing mysterious artifacts left behind by an ages ago extinct Indian tribe. These artifacts open a portal to the another world where all the bad monsters come from.'Alone In the Dark' suffers from the same exact problems as the rest of Uwe Boll's game movies: the plot flows forwards very awkwardly and scenes are badly constructed. Action scenes lack intensity and are badly shot. In fact AITD contains one of the worst action scenes I've have pleasure to fitness and, just like it was in 'Bloodrayne' and 'The House of The Dead', the major battle scene of the movie is over long and totally uninteresting.Special effects are at best mediocre, at worst terrible, but they could have been the best effects in the world and they would have not saved this movie from bad direction and bad acting, which of course brought Tara Reid into my mind, who happens to play a role of Edwards girlfriend Aline, who is a scientist. There also is probably the tackiest love scene ever shot between Reid and Slater.The story structure is very problematic, as the film begins with one of the longest opening crawls ever, which explains things that should have been explained during the movie. Now in example the motivations of the bad, eeevil mad doctor are left obscure. He want's to open the portal, but why? Does he want power? Is he just curios? Crazy? Stupid? Experimental nature? Perverted? What? What are his motivations in destroying the world? Then there are these pure Ed Wood moments in the film, like sudden time changes. In one moment, while the main characters are running underground, there is a night above the ground. But when they emerge from the mines after a couple of seconds the day seems to be in the middle. Go figure. Also there was something of a point made about the flashlights, that were adjusted emitting light, that could harm the evil hell hounds but then nobody used them.In all 'Alone in The Dark' is slightly better than Boll's another game movies, but that isn't a hard task. There even was one good scene in the film, but that couple of seconds really isn't enough to pull this out from the swamp it is in.Alone in the Dark rating as a horror movie: 2 out of 10. Not the crappiest movie I've seen in my life, but does come damn near close.Camp comedy rating: 4 out 10. Couple of comedy gold moments in the film, but over all just pretty boring stuff.",

Essentially, an alien race once populated the Earth and wiped out the civilization that worshiped them. The race was forced back from where they came from to await the time when they would be released back into our world. Fighting them is a paranormal-paramilitary organization similar to The Initiative in Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Also investigating them is Christian Slater's character who is an ex-agent of the organization turned private paranormal investigator who has the requisite mysterious past.To add to the Aliens tie-in aspect, the creatures are referred to as \"Xenos\" from the Greek word meaning foreign. In the Aliens film series, the creatures are referred to as \"Xenomorphs.\"Furthermore, an X-Men comic book (during the Claremont/Byrne years) sort of touched on the same subject as the film. In issue #143, titled \"...Guess What came down the chimney,\" the story is about, ancient demons have been set loose on Professor X's property. All but one are fought back and defeated.

A low score of 2.3 (on February 20th, 2016) is nothing to be proud of, for sure. I wonder if people are just disliking it because it is an Uwe Boll movie.I did enjoy the movie for what it was: brainless entertainment that ran for about an hour and a half. I must admit that I had expected more in terms of horror and a dark setting for the movie, given the fact that it is based on the \"Alone in the Dark\" games. But director Uwe Boll decided to take the movie in a more action-based way, essentially turning it into nothing more than an \"Aliens\" rip-off in a way.The story is about Edward Carnby (played by Christian Slater) who is troubled by nightmares and having problems with remembering his childhood which was spent at an orphanage. Ancient Abskani artifacts are unearthed and opened, bringing darkness and creatures that dwell in the darkness with it.Right, well the story was a no-brainer, for sure. But still, it proved to be entertaining enough, if you take it for what it was. And as such, then I found entertainment in \"Alone in the Dark\". Slightly less than mediocre entertainment, mind you.The cast was alright, and Christian Slater did pull the biggest load of the movie all by himself. Stephen Dorff seemed to be running on autopilot throughout the course of the movie.As for the special effects and CGI, well I will say that it was adequate and served its purposes well enough. Just don't expect to be blown away by a myriad of overly impressive sights and spectacles.It was a shame that the director took \"Alone in the Dark\" into an all-action direction, because \"Alone in the Dark\" should be kept in the dark, brooding and bleak universe of scares and survival horror that it is in the games.\"Alone in the Dark\" is not amongst the best of movies from director Uwe Boll, whom has a bunch of movie version of games to his name already.",

However this was not the case with the very simple and bland script, visual effects that seemed very aged and the overall disappointing film.I could have afforded to go on a tangent or two with the characters and story and defiantly needed to be slowed down.

I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen, trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in. Now, mind you - I am weary of \"computer-game-generated\" movies. I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable. And yet, I am such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's, it would be OK. Man, those were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I'll never get back. If I had that chance, I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead. This isn't even in the \"so bad it's funny\" category. You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene, - which I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body on press conferences.There is no plot to speak of. Won't waste your time pitching it to you. The credibility of the story sinks below 'I did not have sex with Ms. Lewinski'. The acting is but a few notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend OVER this one.Kids, I recommend the Video Game. It has far better story, acting and much more thrills. As for the movie, here's a spoiler - it STINKS! Wait for the porno version.",

It focused way too much on the supporting actors, and there was no character development. It was a total bomb of a movie, I was embarrassed for Christian Slater. The story line really made no sense at all. I don't even understand where they came up with the title. When they were fighting the creatures at Carnby's apartment, it seemed like a really bad music video, and why were they going to his apartment anyway? To get the artifact, key?

Tara reid's transformation from museum geek to gun-slinging lara croft teamed with a paranormal investigating indiana jones (slater) is just too much.The story is idiotic and borrows from many sources, including tomb raider (unabashedly so) so there is nothing original about it.

            "content": "Alone in the Dark is the second foray into American released film-making by Uwe Boll and he didn't learn much from his first attempt.While this movie is a tad better than House of the Dead, that is like saying a 47% is better than a 45%. There are both lame and grossly missing something and there are both bad. House of the Dead needed editing or rather get rid of the video game segments. Alone in the Dark needs something else altogether.It is not nearly as good as the 1982 movie of the same name or of the 1978 foreign film translated into the same name, but at least it doesn't include snippets of the video game footage (of which there are 5 games to choose from).Rather Alone in the dark needs coherence or adherence to a plot line. There is an idea of a plot.That idea being kids are taken and implanted with creature DNA, so that when the alternate world is opened the kids (or now grown-ups) will come to the will of a mad scientist. Only the scientist infects himself, the will succumbs to the creatures, the creatures are locked in a cave that is bobby-trapped by creatures, but wait the alternate universe isn't opened yet. Or at least that is what I think the plot is, with the addition of some artifacts need to be used to open the cave and the main characters get those artifacts because the mad scientist works for the good guys.Basically the cave looks cool, but why not just see the movie The Cave which looks just as good. the creatures look neat, but again see The Cave or a majority of other creature features. Stephen Dorff does a good job, but his part is woefully short and ends up relying on do much gun fire and quick cuts. Slater's role may make Mindhunters seem Oscar worthy and Ms. Reid s just supposed to look pretty. In terms of eye candy she does fine, but here dramatic features are wanting and acting from anybody else is pretty non-discreet.In all, very little Dorff, to much stilted acting, to many quick cuts, to much gun fire, a convoluted plot, and some non-censorial Alternate reality stuff.At least Alone in the Dark makes one forget why Darkness and Elecktra were bad, but that is still not a saving grace.",

I just couldn't believe it. It was almost a quest to walk out of the film and have something to hold onto. Like, it was bad but at least the sound track was good. Nope. Nothing in that film was good. Acting? Bad! Story? Bad! Sound? Bad! Cinematography? Bad! Sound Track? Bad! Special Effects? Bad! I'm discouraged that other people have actually given this film good ratings. They must be family and friends to the cast in crew. All I have to say the only merit this film has, is the idea that at least you can where it like a badge of courage that you managed to watch the whole thing. I could comment on the story but what story. Can anybody tell me what it was about. I got the idea of the dimensions and Alien looking things and parasites. But the Zombies, the Mad Scientist. I knew I was in for a bad time when the prologue lasted for five minutes and was read by a guy with a lisp. So many things are wrong about this film but I can some up the problem with this. The movie refused to stick to the reality it set forth. I can believe in section 8 or creatures from another dimension. I can believe Tara Reid is a scientist. What I can't believe is that when the creature kill a security guard at the museum where she works and section 8 shows up and explains what is happening that Tara Reid would go back to work like nothing is happening.So bad it goes to funny to bad again.

In all fairness, my wife ordered this from Netflix and she doesn't know about Uwe Boll, but I'm just as guilty for sitting down to watch it.In case you haven't already perused the commentary, this 'film' stars the fading stars Christian (I'm a poor man's Jack Nicholson) Slater and Tara (see my botched liposuction procedure pics in People magazine) Reid. You can tell Uwe Boll directed this travesty, because only he would cast Tara Reid, and have us believe she's an archaeologist. Christian Slater gives us his \"I got out of bed, so now what?\" performance as a paranormal investigator with a secret past.Anyway, the plot is a hodge podge of thrown together scenes, which lack any direction or continuity. The acting, what there is of it, can be compared with those Sonic commercials, where the people sit in their car bantering back and forth until that punching sound is edited in for effect (see Youtube if you have never seen one). Most of the CGI is pretty laughable and the action is like going on a high speed chase through Disney World's 'It's a Small World' ride at half speed.I gave it (2) stars because, it was awful, but not AS awful as other Uwe Boll movies I've seen. You could tell there was almost an attempt at some level of competency, but at the end of the day everyone cashed their paychecks and went home.Someone mentioned that Christian Slater's career will hopefully be able to recover from this debacle, but honestly, what kind of career has he had in the years leading up to this or since?

All I can say is: WTF was that about?We're used to seeing great characters and rich game environments being diluted in the translation, after all the genre and most attempts at it are continuously mocked, but this had NOTHING to do with the game. The clue is in the Title: ALONE in the DARK. The fevered anticipation the game arose in you is kin to Dallas crawling through the Nostromo air ducts, not some sub-par Starship Troopers style shootouts on a building site. At no point did I care about the characters, they could all be wiped out and it would be of more interest to watch the CGI creatures go about their daily lives. The plot is non-existent, as if each actor is playing a role in a different film, turned up on the wrong set and went through their lines, not a shred of story is told.In all this isn't a bad film, as we know, bad films can be quite entertaining, this is just a hollow pointless waste of 90 minutes or so.

            "content": "As expected by another direction job by Uwe Boll, this movie is once again terrible. Boll really seems to have a talent for creating horrid films, and this is one that again does not disappoint.While it is slightly better than House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark really does not have any redeeming factors whatsoever. There is a lengthy opening title sequence which, unlike something like Star Wars, is even narrated. I mean, does Uwe Boll seriously believe his viewers to be analphabetic? Does he think nobody that views his films can read? If the viewer's intelligence equals the intelligence of his films, perhaps that would be the case. It features characters that do not have any character development, no definining traits and no personality. Somehow Boll also manages to get an horrendous performance from every actor in his film. I get that most of the actors in his film are usually terrible, but Christian Slater, who is by no means a bad actor, is just absolute garbage in this movie. Boll has also done this to other critically acclaimed actors such as Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, Burt Reynolds & Ron Perlman. These are great actors, but somehow in films with Uwe Boll they are all just absolutely horrible, and seem to not have any motivation to be there. The same is true with Christian Slater in this one, as he wanders through the entire ordeal as if it is a struggle for him as an actor.The acting as hinted to in my previous rant was once again terrible. Tara Reid is the most obvious example of this. This is an absolutely terrible actress further made ridiculous by the terrible writing this film has. She is this stereotypical sexy secretary who is, ofcourse, blonde. Let's not forget that she is also wearing glasses so that the stereotype becomes full circle. Apparently Slater's character is her boyfriend, although we never get to see why this is the case because both characters are soulless, cartoonish, monotonous 'people' that do not resemble any actual human beings whatsoever. The screenplay is as usual in a Uwe Boll production once again garbage. The most evident example of this is during the ridiculous conversation between a kid and Slater in the airplane. The kid states his mom says there is nothing to be afraid of in the dark, to which Slater answers: 'Your mother's wrong kid, being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive', like it is common knowledge in this world that Abkani gateways open between darkness and light.It also features narrative exposition. But do not expect something along the likes of The Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas in this. The narration is absolutely atrocious. Literally everything that Slater narrates in this film consists of obvious facts that have been shown to us in great detail one scene or a couple of scenes earlier before. It is an insulting display of exposition, and it further makes me realize that Uwe Boll does indeed think that only idiots watch his films, because it is in the end ofcourse also an idiotic film itself. Action sequences feature horrible editing and a lot of shakycam shots. There is never a clear overview of anything in any action sequence, but there is one scene in particular one has to point out. There is a scene when the Xeno's ( Yeah... this name is not an Alien ripoff by the way... definitely not. ) invade Slater's home and out of nowhere these paranormal investigators ( Who seem more like the SWAT instead of what they are supposed to be ) show up. What follows is a sequence that features an extreme amount of cuts, hilariously unfitting heavy metal music & an obvious lack of vision due to there being no lighting, Which brings me to my next point, the lighting of this film. This is a film with horrible lighting and terrible production values in general. There are so many shots in which the only thing visible is pure darkness. The one scene i just mentioned is the worst example of this, but there is literally nothing to see in this entire film. Everything is just complete and utter darkness. This cinematographer is on par with Uwe Boll's qualities. The CGI & visual effects look like cheap 1990 videogame garbage. Especially the one scene where a gate opens and loads of the Xeno's are visible. It just looks so bloated and ugly. While there is much more to argue about substantially in Alone in the Dark, the bottom line i tried to summarize is that is has terrible acting, writing, lighting, CGI, special effects, narration & characters. The only positive thing i can say about it is that it is better than Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, but that's not saying much. It is still definitely one of the worst films ever made.",

I don't so much mind that the special effects in this movie aren't even on par with the likes of the boring garbage they send straight to the sci-fi channel. I don't mind so much that there isn't one good performance in this movie. Here's my problem with this movie. We get a 2 minute backstory/ history lesson on the history and culture of an ancient Indian tribe that is nothing more than white letters on black screen. When the movie starts, it has just about nothing to do with anything we just saw. The movie continues like this for the next hour and 40 minutes. it felt like there were like....eight eighths of eight different movies which, just coincidentally had the same cast members, edited onto one film strip. The entire movie is incredibly disjointed and leaves so many plot holes it's unbearable. To me it felt like every scene which moved the \"plot\" forward was just introducing new and random pieces of the puzzle which don't even fit together. Nothing ever ties back to anything. Not to mention the AWESOME slow mo wire work hand to hand fights which look nothing short of ridiculous and out of place and gun fights which use some \"video game-izing\" techniques which would look sub par and stupid on the console video game system that the game of the same name was originally released on.Just so none of you get it twisted.....I refused to pay money for this movie so i bought a ticket for million dollar baby and snuck in to this.....trust me....go see million dollar baby.The only way I can recommend this movie is if you'd like to know what the worst movie all time would look like so that you can appreciate every other movie you'll ever see more.",

Alone in the Dark is, of course, not an exception.The plot is utterly pretentious, boring, predictable and nowhere even remotely near immersive; the acting is among the dullest I've ever had the profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid witnessing; the characters are so flat they might as well be cardboard cutouts (not to mention they are all completely unlikable); and the camera work is so shaky and uneven that I actually got a headache. Not to mention the sound, music and special effects might in fact cause brain hemorrhage.Here's an example: somewhere near the middle of the movie, there's a fight scene. It is set in a room which is almost completely black. Almost the entire scene consists of closeups of the various guns' muzzles as they fire, and the camera won't stop shaking. It's completely disorientating and impossible to follow for several minutes, and then the fight suddenly ends (and thankfully the noisy music along with it). That's about as good as it gets.In short: this movie is garbage. It's not hard to understand why Uwe Boll has to finance his own films.",

Fortunately for me, that was the far preferrable way to go. Sitting through the first twenty minutes of \"Alone In The Dark\" is tantamount to having the hairs on your arm pulled out one at a time. The movie is so incredibly convoluted, so audaciously written, and horribly conceived that you are seriously led to wonder why the studio even bothered. Christian Slater's talent was totally wasted. He plain and simply did not belong in this movie.Uwe Boll should have his film-maker's license revoked.

It's Uwe Boll movies like this which sometimes make me wish we live in an 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' totalitarian society with the ability to write horrific works like this out of our history forever, but unfortunately for us all this society has not arrived yet.My conclusion it that Uwe Boll is still continuing his quest to De-evolve the standards of cinema with yet another super-turkey. If we continue to fund the 'Uwe Boll's' of this world then it is our own fault that we have got the plethora of endless non-stop dreck coming into our cinemas week-in week-out.

Now in his sophomore effort he's been able to succeed at the unthinkable make a good movie? no make one even worse than that soon to be oh my god I can't believe how bad this is Camp classic House of the Dead. It's quite obvious to me now almost anyone can write a script and be funded in the industry and you will too after not seeing but witnessing the unintentional laugh-fest Alone in the Dark. Now for the film's story Christian Slater stars in the worst comeback role ever as Edward Carnby a paranormal investigator whom I think was let go from the big paranormal investigation division and is now freelance or working for himself or something. In the opening scene after the horrific and plot outlining prologue Slater battles a superhuman who jumps off bridge and through windows attacking him from above. The person whom is powered by the dark forces wants to get a key he's holding, for no particular reason they fight in overly used matrix style combat moves. Tara Reid stars as the the films supporting mess as the asst curator at a museum doing a display of the ancient American Indian tribe the fictional Abkani's whom were mysteriously wiped off the face of the earth. She teeters along unbelievably and delivers the ultra bad dialog even more horrifically than it's initially written. Stephen Dorff stars as the leader of the paranormal military division sent to fight and take out the creatures whom they are being attacked by. a one emotion bad ass gur whom has an assorted supposed history th the film's characters. And the rest is all yada yada yada as the film moves along at an unitentionally laughable and exquisitely bad pace. The film has so many flaws it's hard to name them all but lets give it a try first with the one thing that bothered me the most. The film quality was absolutely atrocious it felt like I was watching a horribly unfinished rough cut of the actual film. It was grainy and mostly unsee-able accompanying the farce was a hilariously placed soundtrack and score and some of the worst dialog I've ever heard from any movie in my entire life. But the real treasure here is Miss Reid she is one hell of a flake and delivers the most memorably awe inspiring bad performance ever, truly one that will be quoted in porn films and frat parties in the future. Some of the things the film has going for it are some mediocre fx and some nice asst. directed camera effects. maybe Boll should put in sometime as an asst director first. But here it is people I'm not gonna tell you not to rush in too see this. The film is damn great entertainment definitely one of the most hilarious films I've seen in years. At the screening i witnessed there was a dreadful trailer for his next project Bloodrayne. Love it, or hate it and you'll probably hate it Alone makes a nice addition into this troubled film makers career had I known we could be drunk while filming a movie, I'm sure much more more of us would have embarked on the journey earlier on in life. Filled with inexplicably bad scenarios and unintentional laugh inducing moments Alone is in the top of it's class so bad it's good. and I can't wait for the next one.",

            "content": "But that really isn't saying much. While I cannot stand more then 5 minutes watching House of the Dead and I cringe every time I see the fight scenes in Bloodrayne, however I find the problems within Alone in the Dark to be far more tolerable. As a matter of fact and I might be going crazy here for a second, I did recently comment on Alone in the Dark being horrible, guess what? Mr and Mrs Smith is worse action-wise and plot-wise, this movie at least makes a decent effort to string a very easy to follow storyline, it's quite simple and cheesy, but better then no plot at all. That still ranks this movie as bad, but I'll get to that. First, the plot, Edward Carnby(Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator and former government paranormal agent, in this movie he tries to solve the mystery of the disappearance of various civilians, while trying to unlock the secret of a number pieces from an ancient civilization known as the Abkani, a secret which is related to his(Carnby) troubled past. The rest you can pretty much piece together, it's standard Uwe Boll meaning bad dialog and acting(Tara Ried as the prime example), cheap-looking sets and props, poorly edited and confusing action sequences, the pointless sex scene and overall cheesiness. However, like I said before, I somehow managed to sit through the entire movie, something I can't do with House of the Dead and Bloodrayne. Here, Uwe Boll makes at the very least a decent effort to make something out of an action thriller. Why the low score? After reading the script-writer's comment I wonder if he actually played any of the AitD games. While he did claim this was an original movie, he focused it more on Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare for Dreamcast and PS2, very loosely I might add, but most of the elements where there. What I didn't like was the fact that the key premise of AitD was essentially a serious detective/horror game, here they turned the game into a mindless action movie(even the games are scarier), which might not sit well with game fans. Like I said this is Uwe Boll's best effort in the video game-to-movie adaptations scene so far, but again it's nothing something to be proud either.",

The effects are okay - not top notch but its about what can be expected with this kind of budget. While I'm not a close follower of the video game series, I know that there is only very limited similarity between movie and game - i.e. the main character, the title, possibly some plot ideas but thats about it. The game series is based on horror elements mainly, while the movie is 90% action and almost no horror, so if you're a huge fan of the games you'll almost certainly be disappointed, otherwise there's a chance you'll find it okay.",

However, while this movie isn't the next Reservoir Dogs or The Matrix, it's an enjoyable little action/horror flick with an intriguing story.First of all, technically, this movie is quite well done. The computer effects aren't exceptional, but they're better than those in many recent Hollywood flicks. The creature design is pretty cool, too, even though some close-ups of the monsters are visibly computer generated.Acting is generally sub-par, but not annoyingly so. I like Dorff and Slater, and they deliver their part. Some of the supporting cast is pretty bad, but they aren't on screen for too long.The main weakness of the movie is the script. There are some plot holes, and the story is a bit complicated. But if you pay attention, read the intro and listen to the voice-overs, it's quite easy to follow what's happening. Large parts of the story seem to be taken from Lincoln/Child novels, which is just fine with me since I think more of their books should be turned into movies.The film is about 50% horror and 50% action. While it couldn't stand as an action movie or as a horror flick, the combination of the two make it quite interesting. The action scenes are well filmed, with great music scores and some interesting camera perspectives. The horror scenes deliver the scares, and caught me off-guard four or five times.All in all, this isn't a memorable movie, but it *is* a very enjoyable movie, clearly better than some of the recent Hollywood action/horror movies like Species 3 or Cat Woman. It absolutely does not deserve the low rating it currently has. If you like action/horror movies, rent this. Don't expect a movie in the level of Underworld or Blade, and you won't be disappointed.",

The screenplay is awful too, it never looks like the game, and maybe that's why Uwe does such a bad movie. Maybe that's why he makes bad movies, because he has bad screenplays. But what am I saying?

To start off how utterly BORING this movie was, the plot was brought to us by some person reading something. They read the most uneventful story I've ever heard. All I remember is some proverb number(like 227 or something) and it's a government thing. Next thing I remember, was that I saw Christian Slayter with his elite trench coat. He was such a bad ass, his hair was scared to grow. He said something lame to a taxi driver and some guy got mad behind them and started to chase him. I think Slayter got him mad by looking for a rock. Then they fought or so it seemed. The camera was so awkward. I couldn't tell what the hell was going on. Then Tara Reid was a scientist. With the impossible happening, she then had sex with Slayter for some reason. They had made no prior connections or made it fairly obvious they were an item. She even slapped him in the face, so the random sex scene was a wtf moment indeed. Then some guys were shooting at monsters, more rocks had more important roles, and some guy blew stuff up. Slayter and Reid came out of a basement type door, which lead outside to a foster home. He found a dead nun and cried about it for some time. They later went to the city and found it completely abandoned. Finally, a camera zoomed into their faces and made it seem as if something were to have wanted to get near them and cause shock and surprise. See, the film gave me no explanations whatsoever throughout the entire thing. So, pretty much what I wrote in my review is exactly how I viewed the entire movie. To sum it all up, the movie was an uneventful, boring piece of poopie-crap, asshole mouthful that fails to give Uwe Boll any cool points.

His fixation with the Abskani turns him on a 22-year crusade to usher those same demons into today's world. Unbeknown to Edward Carnby (Slater) a paranormal detective, and his girlfriend Dr. Aline Cedrac (Reid), they possess the key artifact to unleashing these menaces of terror. And they'll need the help of Commander Burke (Dorff) and the government's top secret \"Bureau 317\" to fight zombies and battle demons in order to stop Hutchinson before he re-opens the door of eternal darkness. Based on the popular Atari video game series, Alone In the Dark, holds true to most paranormal thrillers. Fast paced, killer action, streamlined special effects, and gripping suspense. Unfortunately, a poor storyline, undeveloped structure, and pathetic clich\u00e9 acting suffocate those highlights. Looking for a sequel? After such an anti-climatic, open-ended conclusion, it deserves one. Then again\u0085maybe not. But, if an audience is only concerned with what's on the surface, then this movie may become quite engaging. The 'scares,' special effects, and action sequences are comparable to its recent sister movies. Its like Residents Evil meets Dreamcatcher meets Starship Troopers.

Slater is Slater on a shoestring budget, as is Dorff. But TARA REID cannot act and is entirely miscast as the anthropologist curator-type person. Page One, uwe Boll, if your lead actress can't pronounce her character's occupation without being laughed at, you're in trouble.Which leads me to the worst thing: Director Uwe Boll. House of the Dead stank to high heaven. But what i am wondering is this - can we really trust a guy who puts \"An Uwe Boll Film\" in the opening credits to figure out intelligent or creative input into his movie? And what about that 1 and a half minutes of scrolling narrated text at the beginning of the film. It's as if he wants to bore people before it's started. It's completely unnecessary.However, I do believe there are a lot more worse goings-on than all this. I am thinking that, with Alone in the Dark, there may be some money laundering going on. It reminds me of Mel Brook's producers - if you make a bad production and shut it down, perhaps you can make a killing. Is it pessimistic of me to suggest that the $20 million spent on the film is done so to create a failure of a movie by shooting in cheap Vancouver and deliberatley ruin a movie by miscasting, both behind and in front of the camera? Are there ulterior motives at work here? At the time of writing this the movie has generously opened at #14 in the charts on its hopelessly unchallenging first weekend in January and has scraped a mere 5% of it back. By the time it hits video stores, it will recoup most of it, no matter how viciously ripped apart it gets from the critics.I mean, come on, there must be *some* explanation for this incredible miss-step of a movie.And now I hear that Uwe Boll is making Bloodrayne and Farcry - two more movies that are taken directly from video games. It's clear to me that such a talentless team helmed by an even more talentless director haven't learnt a damn thing and show no signs of improving. How can they continue to work and produce this crap in such high volume? There must be some explanation.There definitely must be an apology.1/10",

Personally I felt Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, two capable and arguably underrated stars, did as well as they could with what they were given to work with here. Slater somehow actually manages to remain likable throughout this whole thing and I don't think that was a small feat in this instance. That's about the only thing positive I can say about this film.Of course, it's rarely the case that a movie based on a video game is any good and this is certainly no exception to that rule. Uwe Boll starts the movie basically where the middle should have been. It's like playing a video game and suddenly finding yourself trust deep within the game play with little or no explanation as to what is going on. Sure we do get the scrolling text at the beginning of the movie. The problem with that is instead of telling us, we should have been shown. The OMEGA MAN style ending also shows some potential and actually proves much more interesting than most of the rest of this movie. If a story had started from there, it might have provided better results although I doubt it somehow given Boll's involvement (although I do keep expecting him to prove me wrong one of these days with some competent B-Movies).The special effects are particularly disappointing too as never do we get the sense that the monsters we see here are anything but CGI critters. They definitely lack realism and that really hurts when the success of your film is basically dependent on them to provide your horror film with its overall punch. Actually the previously mentioned OMEGA MAN does a much better job of creating terrifying adversaries for a lone hero to fight and that was achieved via make-up work and fine acting talent. Don't even get me started on how truly awful Tara Reid is in this one.Simply put, a mindless waste of time. An action horror film that lacks suspense, realism and is largely a confused, muddled mess. Still the B-Movie, and the so bad it's almost good movie fan in me doesn't totally dislike this one.",

Someone needs to go back to film school....Is this a good example of how you should bring a game to the big screen ? Well the answer will depend on how seriously you can take tara reid as a scientist and boll as a competent director......",

I went into this with decent expectations; the cast was pretty good, the trailers looked exciting, the action seemed intense. Well, here's yet another manifestation of the old clich\u00e9 \"never judge a book by its cover\". Where should I begin to describe its crappiness? Its plot is convoluted at best. A sketchy introduction talks about an ancient, yet technologically advanced tribe of Indians who unleash some hell portal, fluff, fluff, fluff, etc... But they come back to life somehow and bad things happen and evil demonic things are gonna take over. It's filled with ancient movie clich\u00e9s. Evil, monsters, etc. I understand that that's a good mechanic for a movie in many cases, but you need a gimmick for that to work, and Alone in the Dark is just a rehashing of the same old stuff we've seen a hundred times before. While the action had plenty of potential for greatness, it's all reduced to Christian Slater, Tara Reid and cops shooting at zombies/demon-thingys, or demon-thingys killing random cops/civilians. Not to mention the demon-thingys themselves: they're also quite rehashed. They look like some cheap ripoff of Aliens or something, and they can turn invisible and all this other crap. They have interesting characteristics with potential, but no interesting exploitations of them. The gore in the movie is convincing-looking though, and seeing peoples faces getting ripped in half is usually fun, but when the rest of the movie sucks, it all goes to naught. Tara Reid is an attractive woman, that's no secret to anybody, but the truth is that's all she is. Having seen this movie, I'm convinced the woman CAN'T ACT. She's just another pretty face polluting the silver screen. Her performance was more than lackluster, it was almost as bad as the kid playing Anakin in Star Wars: Episode II if you get what I mean. She showed little emotion and responded the same way no matter the situation, plus she could never pass for a very intelligent archaeologist, it's really not her type of role, I'll give her that.But by far the worst crime about this movie was the ending. There's no explanation for how stuff happened in the end or how the characters got where they did and whatever. All I'm saying is that there's this cliffhanger (although i don't think anyone's holding their breath) with clear implications of a sequel to come. I certainly hope that never comes to fruition for the millions of unknowing moviegoers who would watch that as millions of us did this time around.Do not see this movie unless you are that big a fanatic of action flicks that even the bad ones bring you enjoyment.",

He's making low budget films for horror fans. I like the Lovecraftian elements the writer has added to the film. He's a writer who's style has been neglected in the past (Most recently a lot of directors have rediscovered his work!).The only problems I had with this movie was it could've been a little more cheesier and Francoise Yip should have had a bigger part. The violence is all right and the direction was adequate. We need more R-Rated horror flicks. i wish everybody would quit player hating on Uwe Boll. You want to see a bad horror movie, go out to your local video chain department store and pick up an Asylum movie or a David De Coteau video. Now that's crap and terrible film making.

Otherwise viewing this movie should only be taken as some form of punishment.From the video game I remember being called \"Alone In The Dark\" this has little to do with what I recall. I didn't go in expecting a lot of great things from this movie, and was I ever satisfied in that regard. Other than material to make fun of, this movie literally offers nothing.SPOILER ALERT...as if it could spoil any further...Christian Slater does a very decent job with his character. The problem is, there isn't much dimension to the character. As an action/horror movie, the best scene IMHO is very near the opening, when he leaves the airport. Beyond that, he appears to own only one set of clothes, has a relationship with Tara Reid's character which (probably thankfully) isn't explained at all, and seems to be hated-yet-accepted by the person from his former job who now happens to run everything (Stever Dork..uh...Dorf). Except for the one guy who apparently feels he is worth risking his entire career over for some reason.Tara Reid ought to do at least a passable job at a supporting role, and be a good bit of eye-candy while doing it, and I must lament she fails miserably at both. Get very used to hearing, as dramatically as possible, \"It's Abkani\" for about 50% of her dialogue.Dorf got a job. Good for him. Let's hope it holds him for awhile and we don't see him in anything for another few years.Obviously a fair amount was spent on special effects for the critters. But again we see them fall into the mold of \"this thing can kill you with ease, rip and rend its way through any obstacle...except the mundane office door you and your hottie are hiding behind and trying to lock.\" If you don't have a handful of sarcastic friends to watch this movie with so you can enjoy each others' quips and jokes along the way, you will truly be 'alone in the dark' watching this one.Blech.",

She just stumbles into his apartment and BAM, the most random sex scene ever. Not only was it random, but it was also incredibly awkward. I'm sorry, but a coked up, middle-aged nobody of an actor having sex with a semi-starlet like Tara Reid should never be filmed. EVER.How does this old guy have control over these Alien-wannabes?

THis was definitely Tara Reid's worst performance since 'Around the Fire.' After seeing this, it is hard to refer to her as an 'actor.' She would have a hard time getting cast for community Theodore. And why did Slater agree to this flick? I found out that this movie was based on a video game. Like Silent Hill, this movie suffers from many of the same problems that plaque game-to-movie titles. First, the plot is choppy and leaves the viewer filling in logical holes. The acting is also choppy and has that cold, impersonal feeling you'd get if it was created by computers themselves. Further, the plot is unoriginal and boring. By the time the climax scene comes, you've long since given up on caring about the characters or the outcome. In fact, I found myself hoping that they would all perish. FUrther, the sets look cheap and 'empty'. It was as if the movie was shot over the course of a weekend.

The plot holes are ludicrous (the main villain could have ended the entire world some twenty years before the movie even begins, but decided to indulge in an overly complicated plot). The acting lame. The dialog is, by God, outrageous. At one point our hero is trekking through a generously proportioned mine, complete with tracks, and blurts out \"I get a feeling we're not the first people down here.\" Seriously. He actually says it.Worst of all, this supposed \"horror\" film is not in the least scary. The monsters are seen in badly-cut glimpses, and that only after some half of the movie is over.

I sat through the very first scene in the movie thinking \"okay, this isn't that bad,\" but from there, things not only went totally wrong, but they got worse as this tragically slow movie progressed, with all this bland, boring, and cheesy dialect and acting used throughout this travesty of a film. That \"I thought you were dead, @$$hole!\" line made me cringe (her \"boyfriend,\" Edward Carnby, came home expecting to be greeted by a sweet kiss from his lover, and instead he is blessed with a hard slap across the face and scolded with some horribly distorted and outspoken voice throughout the acting involved by her character in part) as did much of the movie in it's entirety, with things not only happening unrealistically (apparently three shots to the limbs didn't kill a guy, but running his head through a box filled with spikes and fish inside did) but without a reason, with the aforementioned guy chasing some random people's cab around town for reasons that were not introduced or mentioned. Everything about this movie was so horribly distraught and underwhelming that I didn't even finish watching the rest (I stopped at the part in which there was some random sex scene involved; Tara Reid's character, Aline Cedrac, suddenly rousts an already asleep man from his sleep and the two start \"hittin' it\" from there... oh boy, now I've seen everything!) There was nothing to like about this movie, NOTHING! Even the action scenes were mediocre at best, that is, if you manage to stay tuned long enough to watch them. Unfortunately I only managed to catch the ones at the very beginning, and those weren't that good. Not nearly good enough to redeem this god-awful piece of trash in any way, shape, or form.The bottom line: \"Alone in the Dark?\" It should be renamed \"Alone in the Theater Begging for Your Money Back Because This Movie Totally Blows\" I give it: 0 stars out of 5.

CARRIED? ...Dragged it kicking and screaming like something my cat plays with before he kills it is more like it.I should have went running when the movie opened with what seemed like endless pages of scrolling script... \"ancient civilization... open portal...unleash evil...yada, yada, yada...\" SNOOZE!

OK, I'll stick around.Enter Tara Reid the ARCHAEOLOGIST....BLAHhhahhhhahhhhahh!!!!!!

Speaking of dialog, Tara's character doesn't seem to serve much purpose at all except to incessantly point out to everyone like some kind of blithering idiot \"Hey guys, its Abskani\" with as much passion as if she were endorsing a new bathroom cleanser.Awkward love scene out of nowhere...

One of these idiots decides \"Gee, I really wanted to blow up stuff\" so he GOES BACK AND OPENS THE DOOR... OK... he has about enough explosive to blow up a SMALL house... are we to believe he was going to destroy this whole other dimension with that? Then the remaining 2 crawl out alive, and there's a really dumb \"surprise\" as they find themselves in a vary familiar place... which is like in the woods or something. And then the next scene they are \"Surprised\", but this time apparently because they didn't expect to be teleported to the middle of what looks like San Francisco, where they find that the whole city has been abandoned... Huh? The director seems to have forgotten what movie he was doing because apparently, he used extras from House of the Dead in this movie (Zombies/ people who were experimented on and are bonded with monsters from the dark side... what's the diff? Can you do scary?)... And in parts, he seems to have even forgotten the plot.I must say there were 2 or 3 really cool special effects, but they were swimming in a toxic waste of bad acting, bad timing, bad direction, bad music, bad scripting.One more thing: PLEASE SOMEONE give Christian Slater another good script... how the heck did he get tricked into this one???",

            "content": "After seeing previews for this film, I was kind of excited about it because it looked like it would be a cheesy fun \"Aliens\" rip-off with Christian Slater. I was right about one thing, it does have Christian Slater. I first saw this when it came out on DVD. My friends and I got dead drunk over its laborious 90 minutes and then went to see \"Batman Begins\" to wash it out of our brains. Among other things, this film was my first Uwe Boll movie. I'd heard people calling him the worst director ever after \"House of the Dead\" came out. I had to see for myself and this film seemed like the perfect opportunity. I actually did go back and saw it sober just so I could know I was judging it fairly and so I could listen to Boll's commentary. This review is based on the sober viewing.I never played the game this film is based on, but I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on here. The opening title crawl explains to us (and a test audience who didn't figure it out) that a Native American civilization called The Abkani once existed, but stopped existing after opening the gateway between worlds (Lovecraft anyone?). It also talks about a government agency that researched the Abkani and their monsters and the mad scientist who headed up the project. Once that crap is over with, we meet Christian Slater as video game character Edward Carnby who has just arrived in a location that is really Canada in disguise and some guy is already trying to kill him. They fight in the most obvious movie street ever before Carnby puts a CG bullet in the guy. From here we meet Tara Reid as a \"genius\" anthropologist (read: requisite \"babe scientist\") who is in a museum doing some kind of expo on the Abkani (remember them from the prologue?). Monsters you can't quite see show up and Carnby has flashbacks of being an orphan child experimented on by the mad scientist. Oh, and Stephen Dorff shows up as an X-Files soldier type guy who Slater used to work with.Come to think of it, the movie was never too clear on any of these things. I like ambiguity as much as the next movie nerd, but it's not like the dialog or characters make up for it. Reid is an object (and if you hear the commentary, Boll pretty much thought of her as that \"she is not losing her bra!\"), Slater the stoic action detective with a past but very few lines, and Dorff grunts at Slater a lot. Why did they ever bother getting name stars if they weren't going to give them anything to do? The murky little plot boils down to this: Slater and mankind vs. mad scientist and monsters.The big question is: does this result in a scary film? This is technically part of the horror genre (it really fails to develop any real elements of action, sci-fi, or spy/detective genres). The title \"Alone in the Dark\" suggests that this could really be some scary s***. However, for most of this film, the characters are not alone, and it never really gets that dark. Even the scenes in the mine towards the end of the film are brightly lit as if this were a comedy. Sure, there are monsters, and \"sleeper\" zombie-like people, and the world is supposedly threatened, but none of that is frightening.In the end, the best parts of \"Alone in the Dark\" are the art on the DVD case and Boll's commentary in which he blames the box-office failure of this film on American audiences being \"afraid\" of movies as \"different\" as his. I won't blow the ending, but Boll called it a \"daring\" \"David Lynch ending\" (which has to be the biggest insult David Lynch has ever received). Boll explains how the German tax-shelter allows him to make endless bombs and rather than actually trying to defend his inept direction, he simply blames his detractors (including IMDb commenters) for his reputation. No, Uwe, you dug this hole all by yourself.In short, it was better with the beer, but not by much.",

I figured with Tara Reid also starring, the movie would have some sexiness with it. The movie was horrible from beginning to end. Slater narrates at the start but never explains what happen to him when he was a kid. Next Tara Reid tries to look intelligent with the scientist glasses which she can't play the part. There were so many unanswered questions that the movie did not answer. It needed to explain the professor better, the relationship between Reid and Slater, Slaters friend who pumps him information, etc. Of course the ending didn't make any sense. What happened. Everyone should do themselves a favor and stay away from this movie.",

            "content": "I think I can give a mostly positive review to this film, mostly because it lived up to my expectations. It was just crazy cheese and nothing more.Despite negative reviews, the world needs cheesy films. You can't fully appreciate films like Saving Private Ryan, Casablanca and War of the Worlds, etc until you've exposed yourself to films like Alone in the Dark, Ishtar, Battlefield Earth, etc.I have seen worse, much worse. I do agree that this film COULD have been better with just a little nurturing. I think Uwe goes for way too much intense \"MTV\"-style action over substance that would've given a level of respect to the film. A good example is \"The Relic\", a horror film that built up its characters, even minor characters, to create a better level of intensity. AitD tried to match that level, but couldn't.Slater did a decent job, Dorff did what he could, but Reid is severely miscast, even for a cheeser. Just listen to her try to pronounce \"Newfoundland\"......and you'll agree.I did like the cameos by Ona Grauer and Will Sanderson, alumni from Uwe's other project \"House of the Dead\".I liked the music, the action and the monsters, and I didn't mind the ripping off of other films. The 713 Forensics agent was a refreshing character who was misused by the script. The script should have helped explain, however, the connection to everyone. Could have used a scene between Edward and John, who were good friends apparently. One sloppy element was at the end (spoiler).....The city is supposedly evacuated, but then Carnby suggests everyone disappeared. Which is it? The conclusion also suggests that 713 HQ was attacked, but how do the monsters even know where the HQ is? If the monsters are affected by sunlight, how can one creep up on Edward at the end in broad daylight? We must take into account that any film must deal with time constraints, limited budget, a certain skewed vision by Director/Producers/writers, etc. I'm curious to hear the commentary track for this one. Having considered all of Uwe's obstacles, I'm still befuddled by the casting of Tara Reid and her lack of research into understanding her role and the pronounciation of words like \"constellation\" and \"Newfoundland\".",

I should have taken the hint when the theater did not have alone in the dark on the reader board and I had to ask if they were indeed showing the film. I should have just left.First off the acting is very bad if nothing else I did laugh my butt off but there was no connection between the actors and what they were saying. I think they must have realized early on in the filming that this was not going to be a good movie and just \"phoned\" in there performance.As for the story it had some potential and could have been a decent thriller if done correctly.The directing and editing of the film is were it truly failed miserably. The movie was just a bunch of cut together scenes with little or no explanation as to why we were watching this scene or caring about what was happening. One scene in particular stands out when Tara and Christian slater are in his house and then all of a sudden they are in the dark shooting machine guns with a army of people also shooting guns. Then it is not dark anymore...just awful.I cant think of anything else to say other than please don't see this movie it only will spawn additional movies by Uwe Boll and you know that is something we do not want.PS I actually heard he is going to be making more video game movies such as CounterStrike which is my favorite game and I pray that this does not happen.",

            "content": "As a film \"Alone in the Dark\" stands as a sort of half-way point between Uwe Boll's House of the Dead and BloodRayne. Like BloodRayne it has a fairly competent production but like House of the Dead suffers from a lack of serious credibility.First the good points, the opening half was actually fairly entertaining and though I question the usage of an opening text-drag as a means of exposition it undoubtedly has a kind of old-school video-game call back feel to it. The action scenes during the first half were also good and the actors emote with a degree of sincerity. Also I thought the soundtrack was great all through the film. Also the CGI work was actually pretty good.However in the latter half the film starts going down hill in a big way. During its more epic moments it starts to lose the warmth of the first half and turns into a rather dull and serious escapade which lacks any sort of emotion. The gunfights are nearly incomprehensible and the later left-fielder moments fail to impress the same way they did in the first half. The big problem with this film is that after a promising start it fails to build up to anything significant or even entertaining. We also get a lot of redundant shots of the 713 guys gearing up for battle as well as another quite embarrassing sex-scene which Boll seems to be very fond of. Alone in the Dark feels like something that could have had a lot of promise but its complete lack of comical entertainment value, compared to that of House of the Dead, makes it a movie that just feels drained of all content by the end.",

            "content": "The notorious Uwe Bolls' latest 'film' has now arrived. And the world would have been a whole lot better off if it hadn't even been made. Like his previous 'film' House of the Dead, this new pile of inane nonsense is a mishmash of lightning fast editing, bad effects and a plot not worth a dime.Christian Slater plays a detective that has spent his life investigating the paranormal and mysterious. But the biggest mystery that remains unsolved, unfortunately it's not what Slater is doing in this garbage in the first place, but a deep dark secret connected to his own childhood. Alongside him are Tara Reid as the potential love interest (though both seem more bored than in love when on screen together) and Stephen Dorf as the captain of a paranormal police unit.If you're confused, then good. That's what I felt about thirty minutes in to this 'film'. Events occur without any real explanations as to why they happen, people show up in places with no hints as to why or how they're there. But apparently Boll has decided that the audience doesn't care about details like that. They're here for the violence and monsters!If only this could be considered a creature flick, or even a no-brainer violence film like Seagals better films in the 80's. But, alas, the film fails to deliver even sub-par scares or thrills. Action scenes are riddled with bad editing, horrendous and out of place heavy metal and very badly animated cgi monsters. It seems that 25 million dollars (the films budget) isn't enough to make even decent action sequences. Which is surprising, considering Peter Jackson filmed both Braindead and Bad Taste with a third of this 'films' budget, and it looked a whole lot better!You've probably noticed that I speak of Alone in the Dark as a 'film'. This is for the simple reason that I don't find anything in this that allows it to qualify as one. There is no entertainment factor, there aren't any thrills nor any signs of a plot. It seems that Boll has only gotten his hands on a semi-famous thriller game franchise and has used it to create a z-class snoozer of a mess. If only directing would require a license, then it one could hope that one day someone would take Bolls license away and never allow him to work again. At least not in pictures. Because if this and Alone in the Dark are anything to go by (and to me they're enough) Boll hasn't got any talent, but more ego than the entire population of his homeland of Germany combined, and we haven't seen the last of movies like AITD.

But not everyone bought the DVD like I did. I'm sure the people who rented it and watched it once or the ones who went to watch it at the movies gave it a 1 cause it makes absolutely no sense the first time.Besides that, I think the reason why it is in the bottom 100 is the awful acting from Tara Reid. Her performance was simply unwatchable. That's the problem with Uwe Boll movies, he gets popular actors which never turn out to be good. Even Christian Slater's performance wasn't that great.To give it a little credit, there are a few cool special effects, decent action and some good scares here and there. For Uwe Boll, this is a slight improvement to House of the Dead, which was a movie I had to turn off after 20 minutes. A better Uwe Boll movie would be BloodRayne, which isn't great, but better than these. Although this is worth a rental if you're just gonna watch it for the action.

But couple of hours before, I was not happy seeing a movie that was poorly written and had bad leading actor and actress.The story is about an ancient North American Indian tribe who was very advanced but simply disappeared after opening some sort of doorway to another dimension of sorts. The doorway was closed but not before some terrible things came over and supposedly killed many of them. Fast forward to present time and you have a zealot professor who wants to get all the relics of this ancient race for his own personal reason. Also, you have a secretive paranormal US government agency whose job is to track this type of activity.Christian Slater portrays a former agent from this paranormal agency whose mission is to find out why he has no recollection after 10 years old. And you have Tara Reid, who plays an assistant curator of a museum, working for the diabolical professor, and who is a love interest of Christian Slater character.Let me first start off by saying Tara Reid is a bad actress. I have no ill will towards this woman but she really cannot act. The only thing I liked her was in Van Wilder and she palatable because the story was so damn funny. Here, she has no choice but to really act and you could see she has no acting ability.As for Christian Slater, what can you say except he should have stopped acting after early 1990's and used whatever money he had by going into some business because his sneer-like demeanor really is annoying. This guy is also someone who is one dimensional and has no real acting range. He has that one dimensional personality that I remember seeing in the movie \"Heathers.\" In fact, that same demeanor is in all his movies.Overall a bad experience. I just got up and left the movie theater about 60% into the movie. I could not stand to watch this awful movie any further. I would rather go home and see the paint chip away from my walls.",

This movie was not like that. Yeah, there was a lot of action but it all played out the same way and the scenes were very similar to each other. I got really tired of just watching stock scenes of people blasting aliens with machine guns over and over and over again. The first couple of times it was alright but I wanted to know more about the characters and they told me practically nothing. I get that they were going for more of an action movie feel but it just bored me and I felt like I'd watched a dull movie without a story at the end.

Why is the use of voice-overs by the Carnby character so inconsistent? And those are just the questions I was asking in the first 10 minutes of the film.

It's fragmented and disjointed, with scenes that have little to do with each other, horribly transposed upon each other, with little transition. It's full of generic and 'mandatory' scenes that do little to further the plot.

And there are a couple of moments of gore, which belong in Dawn of the Dead, not an Aliens-clone sci-fi action film.Frankly, this film wouldn't even make a good video game - it doesn't hold a candle to the Playstation game it's based on. It's too hackneyed; a string of second-rate action sequences held together by grand canyon-sized plot holes and some of the worst dialogue I've ever encountered.

In the beginning of the film, Carnby repeatedly claims \"I am here to protect you from the things you don't believe in.\" Yet he continually imperils the lives of the taxi driver, other motorists and bystanders in an open market. He also assaults a police officer and steals his weapon, which constitutes a felony. (Atypical behavior of character)2. Bystanders were witness to a car chase and ongoing assaults in broad daylight, in an open market. At this point the authorities should have been alerted, and should have intervened in the process. Despite this, Carnby was able to walk away scot-free. Even a day later he is sitting outside waiting for Fischer, yet no one seems to liken Carnby to a wanted man in broad daylight. (Logic error)3. Near the beginning, it was never stated how Dr. Hudgens was able to acquire information on Carnby's exact whereabouts while situated out on an unknown open ocean. (No explanation; randomness)4. Before carnage ensued onboard the ship, Hudgens was thrown into a compartment and the door sealed. During the carnage, he barricades the door, preventing it from being opened again. After the carnage, he throws the rod off the door which swings open, even though it was clearly sealed shut. (In fact by barricading the door, he would have compromised his only chance of escaping.) (Impossible; inconsistencies)5. Aline Cedrac clearly vented her annoyance at Edward Carnby for not being honest with her in the past, yet she made out with him as if all was forgotten, only for the two to get back to business as if nothing happened. (Atypical behavior of character; randomness; pointless action)6. Bureau 713 should not have been able to retrieve Pinkerton's body from the market place without attracting attention. If the authorities did eventually make it to the scene of the crime, they would have impeded on the intervention of an unknown establishment. (In fact, there was no vivid explanation as to whether Bureau 713 was governmental or private.)(Impossibility; logic error)7. It is revealed that Pinkerton was experimented upon just like the orphans, giving him the supposed invincibility. Yet while he is impregnable against any weapon including lead firearms, the orphans fall foul of every weapon, including the very type of ammunition meant to decapitate the Xenos and not humans. (Fischer already told Carnby that the paraphernalia was effective against the xenos, and never mentioned whether if it was effective against the infected humans.) Furthermore, it was revealed that Pinkerton was 'killed' because a metal spike cleaved through his spinal cord and killed the parasite attached to it. Yet the orphans were easily killed even though there was no visible destruction of the same parasites fused to their spinal cords. (Inconsistencies; missing information)8. Even if Carnby managed to successfully pilfer Burke's access card, it should not have given him easy access into Bureau 713 as he is no longer part of the establishment and every personnel must possess an authentic photographic ID card. (Logic error)9. Given that the monsters underground had not ventured out of the dark world minutes after the gateway was opened, Burke should have given himself ample time (more than mere five seconds!) to detonate the device and escape, without shooting at the monsters and aggravating them in the process. (Atypical behavior of character; pointless action)10. When Carnby and Cedrac return to the orphanage, they find Sister Clara's body lying on the floor. But the orphanage is empty, so why was it left behind and not carried away for health and safety? Also even before the evacuation, the orphans present around her would have stopped her from committing suicide. (Logic error; no valid explanation)11. It is unthinkable to an average person that an entire city could possibly be evacuated in less than one night; and even if the city was attacked by the unexplained monsters, there should have been traces of blood and debris in the vicinity as there always were in previous scenes of rampage. (logic error; inconsistencies)",

            "content": "Title:Alone in the Dark Director: Uwe Boll Cast: Christian Slater, Stephen Dorf, Tara Reid Review: Uwe Boll is up to his tricks again...has he gotten better at the game of making of movies? Or does he still like to destroy franchises like he did with House of the Dead? Well...a little bit of both me thinks.The story is about this paranormal detective called Edward Carnby (Slater) who is hot on the trail of some ancient artifacts from a disappeared civilization. At the same time an organization called the 713 (think an X-files with machine guns and a small army) is investigating some creatures that have been turning up killing people. The 713 decide its time to kick the creatures butts and therein lies our movie. Carnby used to belong to the 713 and decides to tag along with them and figure out a part of his past that is missing.As for the movie, Ill be honest, House of the Dead is left a few steps behind.This is in fact a superior film, but when you think about it, topping HOTD isn't really all that hard. Lets see, I liked the fact that the CGI was held in control, there's no over abundant use of cgi, its used at just the right moments. Also, it does some character development, the main character actually has a past and a story so you get to know him a bit before the action gets rolling. And then the story is actually interesting.As I watched the movie I felt that Boll was holding back on his fast editing techniques and hacking and slashing scenes...he was refraining himself from going ballistic to the point of not making any sense like it happened in HOTD. But when the shoot-out at Christian Slaters apartment starts to happen I completely lost it and burst out laughing cause it was like Boll just cut loose and let out all his fast action, fast editing, -what the hell is going on here- techniques loose and just went Crrrrrazy! The movie still has some things that bring it down a bit like for example...the story was waaay to simple and they fill it up with a lot of filler back story. Yet, amongst all the filler story, they don't manage to explain the origin of the creatures. What the hell where those creatures....I don't know cause either it wasn't explained at all...or they explained it so poorly that I didn't even get it. And then there's this totally unnecessary sex scene that was so devoid of emotion! I simply couldn't understand why it was there! It served no purpose whatsoever in the story. My point is, if your going to have a gratuitous sex scene at least make it worth our while! Alas..there were no Tara Reid boobies to be seen anywhere.Slater, Dorff and Reid are trying their best to look like they give a crap about whats happening in the movie...and in certain instances they try a little over acting to spice things up. There's on totally hilarious scene with Dorf going all angry cause he finds something out. Tara Reid stood out as a one note performance on this one. Slater and Reed look like a couple of has beens trying to survive making cheap horror movies. But heck I guess given the type of film that they were making they did alright.What we have here my friends is an enjoyably, cheesy step up from the mess that House of the Dead was. Its not a masterpiece of course, but I have seen many many worse horror films.My advice? Wait for it on video.Rating: 2 out of 5",

I've seen my fair share of truly dreadful films... this wasn't one of them.First off, its qualities: the film has an interesting look; the beasties are cool (although we don't see them quite enough for my greedy taste); the acting is passable although there IS a bit of scenery chewing going on; the camera work is also passable; the action sequences are OK; the SFX are competent.It's faults: the ending is a bit muddled and inconsistent with the storyline up to that point; some of the cheap means of achieving \"tension\" are just too clich\u00e9d (the squad sent in for the final battle have a single generator vital to all of their equipment? and only one incompetent nub to set it up? and it's no more protected than my neighbour's hydrangeas?).I suspect that a lot of the bad-mouthing this film is getting is purely anti Uwe Boll rants. Most of what I've read about this film, the negative stuff that is, is often so completely over the top (\"the absolute worst film ever made\") that it becomes completely unbelievable.As for my rating of 7/10, well, I rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 as a horror/sci-fi flick. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of far inferior films in this category. And to me, a 10/10 sci-fi horror flick isn't quite the same as a 10/10 drama. I have considerably laxer requirements for the genre.",

However, I did make an honest effort to try and see this movie with an open mind. And I think I was successful. That didn't help the movie much, though.It sucks, pure and simple. The actors try, they really do. Christian Slater tries, Steven Dorff tries, even Tara Reid makes an honest effort. It doesn't matter. They don't know what to do. It's like Uwe Boll (Director) said \"OK, in this scene you run. Action\". Then the actors are on their own, making up the scene as they go along, with clever lines like \"this way, this way, this way\" thrown in there for good measure. I doubt that is how they actually did it, but it sure feels like it when you watch it.The sound-mixing is bad (music is usually way to loud, almost obscuring some lines of dialog at times), although the music itself is totally OK (albeit way to obvious at times, when instead of amplifying the feeling the director intends us to feel at a certain time, it is more of trying to tell us what we should feel). That however is not the case for the pop song thrown in over the lamest love-scene I have ever seen, between Slater and Reid. It hits you like a ton of bricks. Bam, there they are, in bed. What relation does Reid and Slater have before it? They mention something about Reid having a boyfriend, and she does get happy when she meets Slater the first time in the movie. But are they dating? Who knows? The script-writer? Or is Reid cheating on her boyfriend with Slater? Nah, she is supposed to be a \"good character\". OK, so they are dating. This is usually the kind of thinking you do in this movie (and I am still not sure about them dating or not).I could go on and on, but the only thing I can say is I pity the 200-ish people who gave this a \"10\" rating. I respect their opinion, I just pity them. In my honest opinion, they couldn't see the difference between this movie and a train wreck. No, wait...I must, however, advice everyone moderately interested (negatively or, god forbid, positively) to see this movie (preferably without spending money, you would feel robbed). Crap with this kind of budget doesn't (and SHOULDN'T) come around, often, or ever. It is incredible that people still hire Boll do direct movies, even after he has proved himself unable to deliver any sort of emotion through the screen, be it sympathy, sadness, or tension (the \"car-chase\" in this movie is an example of his inabilities, as is the shoot-out with Slater and Reid vs. Monsters, with rock music played to force a feeling of excitement on us, a feeling which wouldn't be there even if Slater and Reid dying in the movie would literally kill me in real life). But if people continue to go to his movies and give him money, this will continue. So stop giving Uwe Boll your hard-earned money. Please. For the love of god.",

The action sequences are trite, except for one lengthy epileptic scene remarkable only for its jerky cinematography that completely obscures any actual action that is occurring. It's as if the director (who, in my opinion, should be banned from ever setting foot on a movie set again) took elements from more entertaining action flicks, threw them into a blender until they lost all ability to entertain, and slapped them on screen.There may be people out there who enjoy this film, but the entire audience I saw it with trashed it terribly. I strongly advise anyone not to go see this film but to beg Lions Gate not to allow this director (Uwe Boll --who also brought us House of the Dead) to continue with the video game franchise movies he has slated. It seems as if he licenses the franchises based solely on the success of the titles & throws the plot that actually made the games successful out the window. Do not be fooled if you enjoyed the game -- this bears no resemblance to it.During one particularly lengthy Good Guys vs. Creatures shootout, I kept waiting for the equipment to flip over and show Tonka written on the vehicles and for someone to step out of the monster suit.Truly a travesty that I don't feel ever should have been allowed onto the big screen.

It isn't one of those typical cheesy \"it's so bad it's good\" films that are bad films but still entertaining and unintentionally funny. Alone in the Dark is just bad and it isn't funny. For a decent sized budget film (having a $20 million budget), Alone in the Dark feels cheap and the story is very weak. There could have been at least some thrills, suspense or jump scenes but it was very bland, uninteresting and even the creatures looked unsatisfying.

            "content": "I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, only what I had seen in the trailers. Apparently the film is a take off of a video game, which might have helped my understanding of the film. The plot was very thin at best, the dialog was sub standard, and the overall progress of the movie was confusing. There seemed to be two completely different and independent story lines involved with this movie. The first storyline is voiced over before the start of the movie. It basically explains that there was an ancient civilization, the \"Abkani\", which was wiped out of existence by evil creatures that they had released. The \"Abkani\" then trapped them in an underground cavern and took parts of the key to \"the ends of the earth\" in hopes of never letting out the evil again. The second storyline is thrown in to the movie (very haphazardly) where a secret government agency, the \"713\", is experimenting on orphaned children and ends up creating monsters. The government cuts the funding and the scientist continues the experiments in an abandoned gold mine in the heart of the city (conveniently located next to the door were the \"great evil creatures\" were trapped).I must say that the CGI animation of the creatures was pretty good though. If I were to guess, I would say that this is where most of the money was spent for this movie. The relationships between the characters were non-existent and the dialog was like a third grade play. There was no believability in the scenes, I felt nothing for the characters, I had a hard time following the plot (or lack there of), and I couldn't wait till the movie was over. I was very disappointed by this film. I like both Christian Slater and Tara Reid but this was not their best work, by far. I think this project could have been done a lot better. It just needed a more refined script, better direction, and some cohesive editing. This is one of those movies where you leave the theater feeling ripped off. I only recommend watching this movie IF: it was on TV, on a rainy Sunday, you had had an interest in science fiction horror films, and there was nothing else to watch. Overall, I would suggest not wasting your time or money. I rate this film a 2 on a scale of 1-10. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was the CGI creatures were semi interesting.",

But make no mistake: this is NOT great cinema by any stretch of the imagination--my star rating merely pertains to the cheesy goodness contained at its core. The plot, explained in an overly complicated opening text crawl, is admissible; it's much more fun to listen to Christian Slater's would-be Noir voice-over, Tara Reid's pronunciation of \"NewFOUNDland,\" and ten-dollar phrases like \"iridescent resin\" (watch out, David Mamet!). A particularly unsexy sex scene comes out of nowhere, accompanied by a song sung in no less than two languages; Slater mentions a place called \"Chile\" as if he's ordering at the drive-thru at Wendy's, as he and disgraced indie hunk Stephen Dorff (\"Cecil B. Demented\") try to channel their inner Jack Nicholson. Meanwhile, Reid wanders around looking confused and bored, even as sub-Gieger 'aliens' prance across the set. Bullets fly in any and every direction, and even as things and people are shot and eviscerated, it never feels very exciting. \"Alone in the Dark\" is quality badness--a fun throwback to 1950s sci-fi--but Boll still has a lot to learn about making a film that's so bad it's actually good.",

Any attempt to list the inadequacies of this film, or of this director, would take me over the 1000 word limit of IMDb, as well as causing me to dwell on one of the worst films I have ever seen, in my opinion.It is films like this one, as well as House of the Dead, that convince people that video games do not adapt will to film. I disagree and think that video games can provide an excellent framework for a good film. Even the best of books will not make good translations to film when the source is totally ignored. When a movie is so drastically different from the source it is based on, with only the title in common, then that ruins the experiences of those that enjoyed the game as well as for those that were looking forward to a decent return on their $7.50.For myself, I would like my money back, please, Mr. Boll, as well as the 1.5 hours I just lost.By the way, I'd like a new vote scale of 0 (should never have been made).

After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.But then that's the point, isn't it. Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are \"announced\" or in \"pre-production\".These aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.Alone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together.

But that is not necessarily a good thing. The script is not too bad,the acting is not too bad,the direction id not bad at all and the sound and visual effects are OK enough. The movie lacks emotion,though,and that is its main weakness. No terror,no catharsis,no relief. Not to mention gaps in the script,similarities to other movies of its kind and the most terrible,unimaginative zombies in the history of horror/action flicks.Comparing it with films of its own kind,it lacks. Its main rival would be Resident Evil,another not too brilliant video game-turned-movie attempt. Resident Evil has better effects,better dialogue,better direction,better acting,more horror,more despair for the turn out of things.So why did I give it a 4? Well,I know it's not properly adapted from the game series and I know Slater and Dorff will think of it as a black moment in their careers one day but this film did not disappoint me so much. I could easily watch it again (in the not too near future). It's as bad as Alien vs. Predator so I can survive it. Plus,it's cool enough for the 14 year olds! So heck,it could have been worse.",

As I weigh the evidence in question I must admit that while this remains a strong contender in the making, I can't think that this would deserve such a title. I mean it is a strong 1/2 star rating, I couldn't give this a full star if I tried. There are a couple of chuckles to be had, such as Tara Reid as a scientist who seems to unleash the intellectual within, by just wearing glasses. Honestly watching Tara Reid try to act as a very educated scientist is almost like passing a kidney stone. (And I know this pain since I passed one when I was 19) It is truly painful to watch. Still it is Christian Slater who earns most of the sympathy here. Slater was in True Romance and Heathers, both of which are great movies and to see him in crap like this, well it is a sadness that even I can't put into words. Still it is one of those movies that rips off Resident Evil, Aliens, The Hidden and any Albert Pyun movie of your choice.

He's starred in a few of my favorite movies (Robin Hood, Legend of Billie Jean...), but his portrayal as a hard as nails detective is a bit over the top. Tara's is a bit wooden, but she's only really meant to be the love interest. Problem is, barely twenty minutes in, I'm seeing several really stupid and really bad plot points: a fictional ancient race, a stupid car chase, a really unbelievable fight scene, a moron who can't be killed, a stupid ship captain who ignores warnings of doom (shades of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"), a minor character that passes on too many bits of info, a moron scientist in a secret experiment, stupid unbelievable CGI monsters, an absence of law enforcement officials... Let's face it, it's a crappy movie with a bad plot with a big budget. It's a retread of \"Aliens\" with a dose of \"The X-Files\" and a dose of secret society movies. I don't know why it's in the \"Horror\" section of my video rental places when its clearly \"Sci-Fi\" with \"Action\" undertones. Like I said, it's basically an alien invasion race, but it takes FOREVER before anything starts to make sense. Here's a plot point for you. Why would an ancient race seal up a race of creatures, but then create a lock that someone could open? Why not just seal up their cave with several years of rocks, trash and garbage then run a lake into the cave to seal it up. Why? Because someone wants an idiot to come along and screw over the planet.

Fear of being stuck in a dark movie theatre with no way out while one of the films he has directed is playing. The new \"horror film\" Alone in the Dark continues this lovely tradition. Easily the worst film of the year, (a spot that likely won't change much in the next twelve months) this is the perfect date movie for a couple wanting to break-up.The story has something to do with an ancient culture and evil spirits and giant lizards and the world ending and a whole bunch of stuff that makes about as much sense as Tara Reid playing an anthropologist. Actually, it's a little surprising that Paris Hilton didn't pop-in to play a genius statistician. The incredibly dark cinematography doesn't help much, either. Creating terror takes a bit more talent than simply turning down the lights. Of course, Dr. Boll (apparently he has a doctorate in literature\u0085 somehow) doesn't quite understand the finer details of film-making such as pacing, mood, structure, cohesion and, best of all, quality.The most heart-breaking fact of all is that every year tons and tons of good films come out but get no distribution and end up lost in a vicious marketplace while a \"film\" such as Alone in the Dark gets a wide release in over 2000 theatres. Adding to this pain is the notion that our dear friend Dr. Boll has three films coming out in the next two years, all based on videogames just as House of the Dead and this \"film\" have been.

I do know that they have a key that opens something evil, there's a bullet-proof monster that attacks in the dark, there's a huge division of paranormal investigators (I didn't know they had those in real life!), and a crazy old guy who wants to, yes, you guessed it, conquer the world with these monsters. Sounds weird, doesn't it? Yes, it is....and it makes for one stupid, hilarious, entertaining movie. Getting into the acting for Alone in the Dark would be the same as trying to explain why a fish would die if it were taken out of water: Completely pointless, because we all know what happens. So, the acting is horrible. But it's so horrible, it's hilarious. The only movie I remember Christian Slater being in, at least one that I've seen, is Broken Arrow. That movie was pretty cool, and I didn't care for the acting. He doesn't do a bad job with the material he's given in here, but Tara Reid as an archaeologist\u0085.now that's something to see. She looks so out of place as her character, and she looks like she has no idea what she's talking about, and that just makes the movie so much better and so much funnier. Stephen Dorff has done some good acting jobs in the past: Deuces Wild was pretty cool, Blade was the most awesome movie ever made, but Cold Creek Manor, like Alone in the Dark, was funny and horrible, but somehow good because of that. But whatever. In here, he plays an agent and ex-friend of Carnby, and at one point in the movie (near the end), Dorff's character learns something that makes him angry. So, in one of the funniest parts of the movie, Dorff gets angry, yells, and kicks over a table. I quietly laughed. I'm not sure if it was because it was so laughably ridiculous, or because it was too intense for my feeble mind to comprehend. I'm gonna go with the latter.Now, I've basically been bashing the movie, so I'm guessing, you, the reader, are probably asking the computer screen, \"Dude, why did you give it an 8 if you're bashing it?\" I'll tell you why: The movie has one cool scene where the agents are shooting the monster in the dark, and the room is lit up by all the gun flashes or whatever, and you could see the monster for just a split second. Now, this scene is cool, but the rock music they play during it is what I'm not too fond of. It's some weird song I've never heard of, so naturally, I'm thinking, \"This scene would be cool if there was some Gwar music in the background.\" But it's forgiven. The scene was cool and entertaining. The other action scenes are entertaining as well, but really, it's a team effort in a sense. The action scenes combined with the movie's horridness really make it a true piece of entertainment. This movie is entertaining, just because it's so bad and funny. I enjoyed House of the Dead, but House of the Dead had something that this movie really didn't: More gratuitous nudity, and more blood. Alone has some blood, but not much, but sadly, it has no gratuitous nudity, so I have to take a point or two away.I can't wait for Uwe's next movie, Bloodrayne. I hope this guy keeps making movies, because they just keep getting stupider and stupider, and more entertaining. Plus, seeing how mad people get over these movies is absolutely priceless. His movies are entertaining, but Alone in the Dark was missing just a few things: Gratuitous nudity, blood and gore, and some Gwar tunes, and for missing those, I have to deduct a few points. In Bloodrayne, it's already said that there's lesbians and nudity in it, and naturally, there's gonna be blood. Hopefully in that movie, they put in some Gwar tracks. But until then, I can only hope...Score: 8 out of 10! No joke!",

I haven't played the game so I wouldn't know how much it really takes from the game's story. But that thing about the ancient tribe being wiped out due to some stupid gate being opened got a \"What the...?\" from me. The movie has this strange D-grade quality to it and was seriously painful to watch from beginning to the end.

I think he's a genius. No, I mean a complete wizard. I think he was trying to make a bad movie and wanted to create the dumbest, most sadistically awful trash in the history of cinema. Well, he certainly did that. But he must have been aiming for that! No sentient human being could produce something like this. I have encountered young kids with more directing talent. Alone in the Dark is awful in every sense. It can be funny, but not that funny. The acting, the writing, the direction, the plot... I could go on and on. It's a movie I don't really want to think about, since when watching it I felt like it was literally making me dumber. It was a genuinely unnerving experience seeing something like this had made it into cinemas at all. AITD is one of the worst films I've ever seen and to be honest, I don't want to talk about it. I still believe Uwe Boll is some sort of evil genius. As a result, I kind of respect him, since I refuse to believe a human mind, given a sizable crew, a generous budget and beloved source material, would be capable of something like this. I hope I'm right anyway. 1/10",

            "content": "OK, me and my five friends walk into the theater...and we see 2 people sitting in the first row. \"Not good...\" went out from our minds, but we were NOT trusting our intuition to get the hell out of that place right away. NOO, we had to walk in there and sit down and watch that damn movie! *SPOILER* (What kind of spoiler can there be, btw? That's like the worst movie ever, don't ever even THINK of watching 1 minute of that movie)OK, it starts OK, I watch that with much interest, actually trying to get the plot and remember some words of that moving up screen. OK, then we see a guy riding in a car, getting chased by some bold and fat \"Dozer from Matrix\" (in the same glasses) running after him, straggling him and them jumping around without gravitation like in Matrix, as well as using Jackie Chan moves. \"Not good...\" came out again, but I stayed where I was. The following things that I'm going to say...are simply the general terrible things that were in the Movie. The stupid blond, to which I was shouting \"die, bitch\" the whole movie, had a handgun which was absolutely automatic with which she was shooting the invisible monsters quite successfully. The blond, the main guy, the agent and another agent get to the door that they've been trying to get to all the time...and decide not to open it because \"some doors are not meant to be open\" though they've sacrificed hundreds of agents and millions of money to get here. Then when the door accidentally opened, they walked in anyway...and that was the passage to HELL. So they decide to finally get the hell out of there and the agent sacrificed himself by blowing up a pocket size bomb that LITERALLY destroyed the whole HELL with all of the cheap computer monsters in it that I could have easily drawn in Paint. The blond and the main guy get out and see the empty street as they've destroyed the mankind now...well, they smile, hug and while they are walking, they are attacked by a monster or whatever that attacks them, they scream and the screen goes blank. Me and my friends were so bored that we were like \"Yes! Gosh, these losers so deserved to die!\"...but my mood got spoiled right away as the suspense was cut by the ending song in the titles by Nightwish \"I wish I had an angel.\" What the hell does an angel have to do with Alone in the Dark? And the main characterS NEVER have been alone in the dark, by the way! No matter if that was made on a game or not, which I'm never going to play, this movie sucks so badly, it's not worth anyone's time! The actors are pathetically stupid not to know that this movie is BULL****!!! The only good thing that reminds me of this \"movie\", is the game that came out in 1995, where there was really a GUY who was ALONE in the mansion with monsters in the DARK. Play a game if you must, but I beg you, DON'T watch this movie! (I don't see this as a spoiler, because there must be no spoiler for a movie that should NOT be seen, and we have to share its stupidity with people, who we don't want to end up like us: spitting and cursing \"The worst $12 bucks I could ever spent on!\")",

            "content": "\"Alone in the Dark\" (2005), I heard the rumors about this \"movie\" before I watched it for the first time. All I have to say is, this \"film\" isn't as bad as everyone says. It's ten times worse! I'm not joking, this \"movie\" is beyond bad. It's so horrible, that it almost made it onto my top ten worst films of all-time list! \"Alone in the Dark\" has an unbearably boring and laughably predictable story, abysmal acting, boring sets/locations, cheap special effects and a dull soundtrack to attempt to hold this worthless diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a detective who specializes in paranormal activity uncovers mysterious events that could have deadly consequences. No really, that's the whole storyline in a nut shell. Could it be any more vague and minuscule? Look, I'm all for movies with a lack of story, just as long as it has good character development, as well as action and comedy to make up for the lack of plot. A perfect example of a film with very little story, is \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978). That movie hardly has any plot. But, the film makers worked hard and put substantial effort into it to make it as entertaining as possible! Plus, a good cast of characters can help make up for a lack of story. Unfortunately, \"Alone in the Dark\" is nothing like that. Fun fact, this \"movie\" is based off a video game, just like the majority of the other films directed by the mistaken for talented Uwe Boll. A lot of his movies are based off of video games, which justifies his lack of creativity. Now granted, I have never played the game that this \"film\" is based off of. But, if this \"movie\" is any indication, then it must be a dull game! Although, it couldn't be that much worse than this \"film\"! Here's a good word to describe how bad this \"movie\" is, shocking. For the majority of the time, nothing happens. Another glaring issue it has, is that most of it is shot very dark and you can hardly see anything! Look, I get that it was supposed to be a horror film. That being said, dark scenes have to be handled with care, or else they turn out to be terrible! Maybe they were just trying to hide the cheap special effects? We'll get to those in a minute. Bottom line, is that it's nothing but a long drawn out monster hunt with this barely established group of characters. It may only be 96 minutes long, but to tell you the truth, you could've fooled me. Seriously, it feels ten times longer than that! As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the story. Nobody in the entire cast even looked like they were trying at all. Not even Christian Slater or Tara Reid could save it, and those two are pretty decent actors! What happened to them here? Those two, along with the rest of the cast, just waddle around like confused morons for the whole duration of the \"movie\" and then it ends. This \"film\" has some of the worst acting I've ever seen! For example, a female character dies and right after the rest of the characters pay their respects and walk away, her head lifts up right before the camera cuts. When I first saw that, I thought to myself: \"what? Did that really just happen?\" I rewound the \"movie\", played it in slow motion and sure enough, she does move her head in the last second of the shot. Did she not go to acting school? All you had to do was lay down and play dead! At the very least, you just have to wait for the director to say, \"cut!\" I'm surprised that the editor didn't catch that. But, we'll go into more details with the editing and special effects in just a moment. Overall, the acting is beyond embarrassing. The sad thing is, we're actually supposed to be taking them seriously! But no, I was just sitting there laughing with how bad their performances were. As far as the sets/locations go, all of them are boring. Like I said, most of it was shot with minimal lighting. Plus, the color filter they used somehow made it look even worse! As far as special effects go, some of them are okay. But, most of them are cheap garbage. Especially the monsters! However that's just scratching the surface. There's a scene where a gun is fired, and the woman is supposed to be hit by the bullet. But, if you look closely, the bullet doesn't hit the character. It doesn't even touch her at all! On top of that, you can clearly tell that the bullet is fake. There are many cheap special effects in this \"film\", but that one is easily the standout. I've seen movies made back in the 1950's with better effects, and this \"film\" was released in 2005! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Reinhard Besser, Oliver Lieb, Bernd Wendlandt and Peter Zweier is nothing short of a cliched mess. Yeah, somehow four people collaborating on the film score couldn't make it sound good. How is that possible?! \"Alone in the Dark\" is easily, one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Just thinking about it is enough to make me sick! Yep, that's how much I hate this waste of cinema. I'm struggling to give this \"movie\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go on IMDB. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. Do I really have to tell you to avoid this \"film\"? No, I think it's more than obvious enough. All it does is take 96 minutes of your time, and leaves you in the dark.",

Alone in the Dark exploits to the fullest the tax haven that existed for film investment back in the early 2000's and uses it's sizeable budget as a bluff to hide the threadbare screenplay and complete lack of vision and or enthusiasm by Uwe Boll.Alone in the Dark displays so much wrong with films being made at the time, it gains educational value. Awkward Bullet time, nu-metal, flip phones, Vancouver. Also, it's a film where the star draw is the intellectual property and little to no trace of the source material remains. There were other egregious examples of this\nliberty taking with fanbases in mid 2000's filmmaking, but that is only one element responsible for the infamy of this particular, peculiar film.The awfulness of Alone in the Dark is itself like some creature of the night, opaque and indescribable. It's more a general feeling of ineptness that permeates from every shot in the film suffering from amateurish decision making. Whether it be terrible acting, Abysmally photographed action sequences cut as if Avid had a randomiser tool, or the lighting that's near avant-garde in it's aimless appropriation of shadows, not one scene i watched without me thinking to myself, i could have done better.I struggle to say much about about Alone in the Dark because it is an aggressively mediocre film. I expected much worse and i was profoundly disappointed. I eventually anticipated much better upon viewing and was left wanting. Uwe Boll clearly had too much money on his hands and was desperate to give his investors their money's worth. The result is an overproduced alien clone which might look the part, but has levels of directionless drama and over exposition usually found in films that cost a fifth to make of what Alone in the Dark did. Few films i have seen have been more forgettable than this one.",

            "content": "This is, undoubtedly, the worst movie I ever saw. May sound like overreacting. However, it is not. This movie has it all: the most irritating clich\u00e9s, meaningless relationship between two leading characters, confusing effects, displaced music, quasi-artistic and quasi-philosophical sequences, scientific errors of massive proportions, weird-talking fisherman idiotic lines, non-existing characterization and plot together with complete lack of motives for any character and else. I was also shocked by Christian Slater. Well, he never was fantastic, but this is so degrading. As one of my friends said: \"Playing in this movie was degrading even for those worms.\" So, let's start......with clich\u00e9s. I will be so free to say that clich\u00e9s are arch-enemy of any art. Why? Because they eliminate the most important part of any work of art---originality. And if there would be some scale that would measure number of clich\u00e9s in a minute,I am sure this movie would be the very first on that scale. Actually, it looks like there is no original concept in this movie, everything seemed as it have already been said or done somewhere else. For example, \"Abkani-ancient race which was so advanced that it opened portal to another realm\". And guess who was there? But of course - \"evil\", which presents itself as mutant between Alien and werewolf and, furthermore, it procreates through some kind of worms( I mean was it so hard to think of something new instead of worm implanted in spine ). Then, a renegade super-agent held back by government and his honest,but misguided friend; then, young, slim blonde assistant with spectacles who falls in love with our beloved super-agent; then, quasi-erotic scene to present us humble and unworthy watchers their undying love; evil scientist does not kill our heroes, but orders them to throw their weapons,which,of course,returns to him like a boomerang(I never quite understood why such an evil characters are always reluctant when it comes to killing their heroic rival,although they already killed many other men); then more and more...My rating for this segment of this movie is 1. A big, fat 1.Next segment analyzed will be nature of relationship between our hero super-agent and young-and-blonde-and-sexy-promising-and-spectacle-wearing scientist. If two people talk,cooperate,examine artifacts and explore internet, where does it take them. Normally,you wold say to healthy business partnership and mutual self-improvement. Well, Uwe Boll disagrees. He says: \"If you meet a complete stranger of an opposite sex, and talk with that person, examine artifacts and cooperate with him/her while you are being chased by rampaging horde of evil mutant beasts and zombies for a whole two days, you will,most certainly have sex with that person.\" Hm. You can see more emotions and motives in porno. However, this \"\"\"erotic\"\"\" scene is very short,somewhere about 30-45 seconds, and I rate it 2,for shortness. Now, special effects, music and camera. Unlike other movies, where special effects are used to show something that is unable to be taped by camera and because they add another dimension to the movie, which, of course, makes movie easier to understand and to watch, special effects in this movie actually take a dimension of, should I say \"watchability\", away from it. Combined with loud music and camera jumping quickly(from soldier to alien, then back on the soldier,then on a dead soldier etc.) around, effects in form of bright lines in the air representing bullets flying in all directions, pose such a distraction, that after minute you can't stand another second of it. And there is at least 25 minutes of that kind of scenes in this movie. When first such scene happened, seven of us in room, were 10 seconds just astonished, and then we simultaneously begun laughing and laughed till the end of the scene. So, obviously,there are also elements of comedy in this movie. Of course,rating for this segment is formidable 1.Philosophical dimension also must not be cut out when analyzing \"Alone in the dark\". Christian Slater, as a true renaissance man, can fight, make love,shoot, be humorous, do some archeology, see in the dark and philosophize. He has such marvelous insights in life, fear, \"darkology\", love and obliteration of man kind. Too bad is the fact that all he says is just pile of pompous nonsenses. For example: child says(with no particular reason):\"My mommy says that there is nothing to be feared of in the dark\", and Slater then said the best thing possible: \"There is. When you have fear, there is better chance you will survive\". Really something for a 7 year old kid to hear. There are also many other lines,or should I say quotes worth remembering in this movie,including: \"Some doors should better remain closed.\" You rarely hear or see so original material. Of course, rating for this is 1.Then scientific errors. So,when they're in Abkani facilities, young scientist can without any problems read all they wrote. How? Abkani lived 10.000 years ago in North America,when there were no other advanced civilization there. So there is no other writings scientists could compare to Abkani alphabet,and therefore,there is no possible way that scientists could decipher Abkani alphabet. Or maybe Champollion find it in Egypt alongside hieroglyphics. This could be a good theory as they were advanced race which opened a portal to another dimension,so they could travel around world. But no. As they are finding parts of inter-dimensional doors key, they see they are scattered all around the world. The explained why: \"10.000 years ago Chile was pretty far away\". Well, didn't they say Abkani were advanced, and if they were able to travel to another dimension, why would it be so hard to go to Chile. Rating - 1. Anyhow, this movie is a disaster, it is worse than \"the worst\", the comparison-of-adjectives should have fourth level just for this occasion. I would rate it \"-10\" if it were possible, but sadly 1 is a minimum.",

Slater is painfully wishing for his Kuffs days, trying to be the jaded wisecracker. Reid can't pronounce half the words that were churned out for her clich\u00e9 of a character, and Dorff's only purpose in this movie is to miss his cues and scream obscenities.There is -no- valid argument to defend this movie; neither comedy nor schlock nor camp factors. Uwe Boll is a disgrace to the very concept of storytelling, regardless of the language he's in.If you went to see this movie: my condolences.

If the movie makers had sat down, acknowledged from the beginning that they were making a dreadful piece of schlock, and went with it, this could've been quite fun. I can imagine gore, nudity, crazed scientists, monsters creeping about, etc. There are movies out there that are schlock, know they're schlock, and deliver the goods. Last year's ANACONDAS or SEED OF CHUCKY would fit that bill nicely, in fact.But I suspect everyone took themselves far too seriously. This is bad, but bad in a dreadful, dull, ponderous, slow kind of way. Exploitation that doesn't give the audience what it wants is absolutely pointless, and we've certainly hit that low here. Who told Tara Reid to keep her clothes on? Who made the picture so damn dark? What's with this boring back story about native American civilizations and gates and whatnot? Why are the major fights with people you don't care about? Why is the crazy doctor doing all this? What exactly are the monsters? Why are they doing all this? Etc.The main difference between Boll and Wood is that Wood at least was trying to entertain his audience. That's why he's still remembered -- whatever else his movies are, they're fun. There's nothing fun about this, which is the sad part. Nobody's going to be screening this in a Midnight movie festival twenty years down the pike.My advice: if you're doing trash, admit it's trash.

            "content": "\"Alone in the Dark\" reviewed by The Correct Critic\"Alone in the Dark\" is an appropriate title for the first film I ever saw alone in a dark theatre. It's a good thing I saw this disaster alone, because if I had asked a friend along, I would have been dreadfully embarrassed. Most of the January-February movie fare is as tempting as my mother's cream cheese and jelly sandwiches. With the Oscar buzz high, studios feel the hype over the Best Picture nominations will drown out any talk of these duds. Hollywood may even make a few million dollars off these disgraces without drawing criticism that 90% of movies released in January or February are not worth two dollars, let alone nine or ten. That said, \"Alone in the Dark\" barely qualifies as one of these duds, because it is hardly a movie. The plot, if you insist. Well, there is no plot, but rather an incomprehensible premise based on an Atari video game. Christian Slater plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator. An insult to the Warrens, Carnby is trying to solve a mystery. During Carnby's youth, he and eighteen other orphans were abducted from a home for a brief time. Carnby possesses little recollection of that fateful night. Tara Reid plays Carnby's girlfriend/ex-girlfriend, a museum archaeologist specializing in Abskani artifacts. Tara Reid as a scientists \u0096 yeah, that's believable. Attempting to show she is no longer the All-American Pie girl, Reid adds a rough edge to her voice, only to sound like she suffers from emphysema. Her acting suggests she is smoking something, and I am not talking about nicotine addiction. Thrown into the mix is a mad scientist, a team of paranormal investigators under the title 713, zombies, and half-invisible creatures. The filmmakers feel these elements tie together; the audience may not share their perspective. The director, Uwe Boll, is on the same level as Ed Wood, a man voted Worst Director of All-Time by a critical survey. But while Ed Wood and his monster movies were laughable (come on, the man was a transvestite), there is nothing funny about Uwe Boll. I was astounded to discover that this man, who has his characters spout the clich\u00e9 lines \"It's happening again\" and \"Some door were never meant to be opened,\" actually has a Ph.D. in literature. \"Alone in the Dark\" is one of the two worst movies I have seen in my life. The other is a film adaptation of Antigone our English class viewed last year. That horror consisted of five spoken words, a nails-on-the-chalkboard score, and a bunch of females licking each other. You can always identify the worst movies, because they are literally painful to sit through. The obnoxious, ear-splitting noises (meant to scare) and the flashing of machine gun fire in \"Alone in the Dark\" gave me a headache. They should have cut the movie down to 30 seconds, and aired it during the Super Bowl as a live action Halo 2 commercial. Does \"Alone in the Dark\" have any redeeming qualities? Aside from instilling aspiring filmmakers with hope and confidence, NO. If I had the time, I would definitely stand outside my local cinema and picket this garbage. This is the movies at their absolute worst - the \"Citizen Kane\" of poor film-making folks. A sin against the art, \"Alone in the Dark\" will be damned to the ninth circle of Dante's inferno, where it will spend eternity frozen in black solitude.",

As I love watching things that are so bad that they become unintentionally funny again, it was with quite a lot of anticipation that I picked it up for a couple of euros. I was disappointed. While \"Alone in the Dark\" is by no means a good film (OK, it is indeed pretty bad), it's by no means as spectacularly bad as often advertised.Instead, it's the \"completely forgettable and utterly tedious\"-kind of bad. Very loosely based on a video game series, it tells the story of third-rate Indiana Jones-clone Christian Slater in his search for old Indian relics and a gateway to hell. In between, it throws in Alien-like monsters, horrifying cross-breeding experiments, brain parasites and a lot more. There's so much going on with so little explanation or coherence (inspite the longest and most tedious text-only prologue in movie history) that it becomes very hard to figure out what is going on.Not that that matters much, though, as it is very hard to care about the plot of the characters. Eventually, I just gave trying to make sense of everything (a futile task anyway) and simply stayed watching for the action.Judged solely by that, \"Alone in the Dark\" is not a total loss. There are actually some fairly decent action sequences on display, and while they also lack much in the way of logic or coherence, they at least show some level of competence. The same can be said about the acting: it's by no means Oscar material, but it does get the job done.In the end, there is no question that this is a bad movie. The characters are utterly forgettable and the plot is a colossal mess of dozens of half-baked. That being said, it's leaps and bounds above some truly horrendous movies of recent years, like \"Torque\" or \"Battlefield Earth\", which, in addition to being utterly incoherent, also looked dreadful and were truly horrible acted.On the other hand, those movies were so bad that they became unintentionally funny. There will be a place for these truly terrible movies in \"Worst 100\"-list for years to come. \"Alone in the Dark\", on the other hand, is flat-out boring from start to finish, and should be left in the dark and forgotten as soon as possible.*1/2 out of *****",

It was, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made.But them Alone in The Dark came along, and I change my mind - now this takes over Earth as the single, biggest piece of crap I've ever seen.And to think that Hollywood never learned from Earth makes me shrouded in fear...OK, where to start? Ah yes...the actors and director itself. The actors here are like puppets controlled by Mr. Uwe \"Boll-ocks\"...lifeless, clueless, and emotionless. Never I have seen Slater, Dorff and Reid sank so low in the acting department. They would make fine extras as zombies in \"Resident Evil\", judging by their acting. And Boll-ocks needs directing classes immediately - I would be glad to sponsor him the whole course, rather than to sit through his movies ever again!Then, there is the movie itself. What's with the intro? For Christ's sake, this ain't Star Wars!!! There's also the sex scene was not very 'encouraging', nor 'stimulating', the gun-battles which looks like \"cowboy-vs-indians\" kid games, and the dialogue seems to be spoken by brainless numbskulls. Example, why does Tara Reid has to say that 'some doors are never meant to be opened', even though they knew that the door is a portal to Hell? Does she think that Slater and Dorff are 10 year olds? Or, maybe she was addressing the viewers, whom by that time had already gave up on the movie? The plot is totally senseless too...what the heck is the Abskani tribe anyway? The way the tribe was mentioned by the actors seems more like they originate from Mars rather than Earth. And to make us believe that they are an 'very advanced' race, being able to create a portal to the \"dark side.\" That's'convincing' enough...like in Battlefield Earth, we're suppose to believe that Harrier jets can be flown by cavemen in 7 days...About the creatures? They seemed like cross-breeds of the aliens in \"Alien\", \"Species\" and \"Pitch Black\" movies. Talk about one ugly mofo...and it's not even scary! By the way, these creatures are afraid of light. Therefore I don't see the reason why a whole city needs to be evacuated. All that is needed is to turn on the lights...and you'll be safe from them. Why the plothole? I don't know...and I don't really give a damn anyway! And the music? Let's not go into there...my ears are still ringing from the excessive loud noice which was known as \"music\"...And now, Boll-ocks is doing BloodRayne, and my guess is, it would be a total stinker. Boy am I glad to hear that he is not planning a movie based on the video game \"Doom\"...or else, we're all \"doomed\" to suffer terribly from watching his movies again!",

The soundtrack was another killer, especially the very sudden start to the romance scene.For me though by far the worst aspect of the film was the directing. For example, in the fight scene at the beginning of the film you can quite clearly see the bad guy's fist punching air just to the side of Christian Slater's face - now I at least know how the actors do that kind of thing! Surely any decent director would have the awareness not to shoot that kind of angle?! I could go on but I think you get the idea that I was not a fan of this film at all.

The setup, akin to Sondheim's Into The Woods, establishes conventions which the second part of the movie gleefully deconstructs. The last quarter of the movie turns all previous convention on its head, willfully ignoring its own rules and exposing the entire genre as the mindless pablum that it is - all while confusing the audience to such a degree that we are left with no alternative but to reject the overt meaning entirely and grasp at the underlying substance - which, as Boll masterfully renders, is nothing. He even taunts the audience with clues as to his actual intent - Reid's obviously intentional mispronunciations, climactic fights which end with non-exploding grenades, Stephen Dorff's entire performance.

This movie is filled with enough testosterone-fueled stereotypes to give Spike TV executives a hard-on for the next few weeks. It's amazing how Boll also managed to miss the point of the game all but completely. Uwe, you do realize you were making a movie based on a game, right? Do you even realize you were making a movie based on anything? Where's the reference to the source material? Oh yea that's right you used the lead character's name and the title for the film.

Some of the visuals he can create can be pretty cool to watch.Boll's last film, House of the Dead (universally hated by the entire world) is the only other film of his that I remember seeing and in comparison, he's taken a step up with Alone in the Dark. Maybe it was better because there was a little more substance to this plot, maybe because there was a little more to know in this movie, maybe it was because they have some better actors in this film, who knows? Now, I'm not a fan of any of the actors in this film. If I had to choose the best actor, I'd have to go with Dorff because I own a few of his other films on DVD. Slater has always been a borderline actor and seems to keep it together in this film but is slowly dragged down by his co-star Tara Reid who will annoy you with her explosive mouth and whorish face. She really is annoying! Alone in the Dark never really gave me the action I craved until the end and by that time, the movie had already failed me. A big issue is that I'm not entertained by movies just using 3 minutes of continuous gunfire. It's not exactly exciting to see a bunch of bullets flying at the screen, it's too repetitive.I didn't mind the monsters, they seemed to stay true to the game, visually (as I recall). The CGI in the movie is generally questionable, yet bearable. I really like the music from the soundtrack in the first scene of uncontrollable gunfire where the screen kept going black when being attacked by those creatures. Usually heavy metal doesn't mix well with most scenes in movies, although I do feel as though it's a good testosterone builder, they did will with the music in this film. \"Ghost\" by Mnemic is a cool song, been listening to it on the soundtrack ever since early 2005.The movie suffers from seemingly washed up talent, pointless plot progression and a confusing director. Somehow they manage to keep the film within some kind of boundaries of toleration but that all depends on how far away you draw your lines.",

            "content": "So I'll admit it: I love House of the Dead.House was awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen (which really means something when I say it). It was awful, and because of the sheer brilliance of its tumbling ineptitude, I loved it. I laughed painfully hard. Needless to say, my expectations for Alone in the Dark were low (or high... however you would classify it).I was sorely disappointed. Alone in the Dark was a frantic, CGI-driven mess that delivered very little of the active humor that made House wonderful. The production value was higher here, so some of the scenes actually looked pretty good, but none of that was enough to rescue the film from its ADD storyline.The movie begins with a weird, crawling text legend that is both dragged across the screen (Star Wars style) and read aloud to you. I'm... trying to remember what it said, but nothing is really coming to mind. Something about artifacts and ancient evils. And also an ancient tribe, which the movie claims was the first ever to value gold. That makes them pretty flippin old. This text crawl seems to be a metaphor for the film in general, which was mostly just weird, CGI-monster-related violence that I mostly couldn't figure out the reason for. I think, basically, there were all these monsters underground, and... some guy with gray hair wanted to let them out so he could... I dunno, rule the world or something (I don't really know how that works). Tara Reid pretends to be a scientist by putting on glasses and using a computer program that does nondescript scientific things (like it shows this object sitting on her desk as a green polygon lattice... I guess that helps her somehow). Then Christian Slater fights some dudes and he and Tara Reid have sex. Then some people fight more monsters, and uh, there are like some kind of zombies, too.You get the idea. I'm not really sure how a lot of the things that happened in this movie were related, or what a lot of characters' motivations were for doing what they did.I guess there were some laughs that came out of this thing - most of them related to its disjointed, confusing plot. Every time one of us asked what was going on or why somebody was doing something or how the characters got where they were, we chuckled a bit. I guess it could be turned into a drinking game - take a drink every time someone vocalizes justified confusion. Apparently the filmmakers felt their art was above the constraints of causality.Now I'm actually kind of torn on whether I would recommend it for comedy value. It's like a fever-induced nightmare, except not scary.Ah, oh well. See it anyway. Contribute to the \"Pay Uwe Boll to Waste Miles of Film for Our Overall Benefit\" fund. It's a good cause.",

The movie starts out with a scroll that lasts almost 5 minutes. Already I knew I was in for a bad movie. The plot had no point, the characters were laughably bad and the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen.The movie does have a couple of high points such as, the creatures/aliens looked pretty cool although we don't really find out why they are there.*SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!* If you actually want to see this movie, I advise you don't continue reading.In the movie, we find out that the creatures can't survive in daylight. But at the end of the movie one of them jumps out in DAYLIGHT and attacks them! Uwe, please pay attention to the script!!!In conclusion, Alone In The Dark is a movie that must be avoided at all costs. Though it may be a step up from House Of The Dead, it was still very bad!",

            "content": "***** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT ***** Okay, clearly, and despite popular opinion, this movie is not among the 100 worst ever made. However, it is also fairly obvious that it should never have seen the light of day.I'll deal with the latter first...The plot is insignificant. Secret bureau discovers ancient tribal recordings of evil beings (namely, Xenomes; words that begin wit the letter 'X' are crucial to science fiction pulp) lurking in a dark world. Archaeologist leads research, research is shut down, archaeologist becomes mad, renegade archaeologist and merges orphans with dark creatures. Fast forward 22 years later and mad, renegade archaeologist discovers the last artifacts needed to open gate to darkness. Christian Slater means to prevent him. It's textbook stuff and I'm fine with that. Keeps me from thinking. Certainly doesn't make for an enthralling movie experience though.The writing is either lazy or inept, I can't decide. How are we introduced to Reid and Slater's relationship? She reveals the story verbatim to a strange delivery boy (ad-libbed by her good friend, the museum guard, more on him later). How does the mad, renegade archaeologist control the monsters? Why, he injects himself with their blood of course. Makes as much sense as anything else in here. Like the very existence of the merged orphans. What was the point? They're pitiful. They run aimlessly about, growling, then die instantly. They're the infected people from 28 Days Later, if that. Nothing like the Xenomes, who require copious amounts of projectiles coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin (that's right, technical gibberish aside, they're allergic to light) before croaking. The anachronisms and general goofs are packed so tight they could fill a review of their own, a select few include dead people peeking about, bullets clearly flying far overhead but remaining lethal, night becoming day in the time it takes to climb a ladder (in the spirit of Plan 9...), Xenomes being plentiful in our world, even though mad, renegade archaeologist only found one and the rest are locked safely underground, the city not being evacuated until the threat is eliminated... It goes on. I'm entertained, but I'm sure I'm not meant to be.Tara Reid can't act. Sure, she's easy on the eyes in that all-American, fake blonde cheerleader kind of way, and sure, she's perfectly able to look sarcastic or bored, but as soon as she's asked to imitate an emotive response, it's clear she's in way over her head. Take the scene where she and Slater meet and the nature of their turbulent relationship is revealed. There's supposed to be longing and relief in her eyes, but instead it looks as if she's reading cue cards behind him. \"Edward...\" The delivery is flat (that's 'Ewan McGregor in the first hour of SWIII' flat) and her body language signals complete disinterest. The remix comes when she finds her museum guard friend dead on the floor. \"Rob...\" Flat flat flat. It doesn't help that she's given lines that are absolute manure either. Like when they enter the Abkani cave and see writings on the wall; \"I think it's Abkani.\" Say word? Stunning. What's more is this quickly becomes a repeated line. She points out the obvious in a manner that would make John Madden proud. \"It's a cave!\" You don't say. \"There's something there!\" Miss Marple, look out. There's a silhouette sex scene here too. I couldn't for the life of me understand why. Her nipples are in the tabloids everyday of the week, but somehow, the good Mr. Boll couldn't convince her to do it here. I remain unimpressed.There are good bits too though. The Xenomes for instance. I'll get stick for this, but genetic crosses between Aliens and the Panthers from Chronicles of Riddick with stinger-bearing tails that crush heads and penetrate skulls are cool in my book. One female soldier gets her head split from the top of the skull down to the mouth and we get a good 5-second peek at a dismembered face as her legs twitch about. It's nasty and graphic and I appreciate that. They kill a nun too. They're THAT mean, albeit she was a orphan-selling nun and may have had it coming. And I like the fact that the mad, renegade archaeologist also voices the introduction, so he speaks about himself in the 3rd person, which adds to his megalomania. Very nice. His main henchman pushes civilians and cops aside even though they're not in his way. And climbs 2 stories to tackle people better. I like it. Oh, and most importantly, the kid on the plane in the opening sequence doesn't get more screen time. Now THAT would have suggested Bottom 100 placement.As it stands though, Alone in the Dark is mindless sci-fi tripe, but it is entertaining, mindless sci-fi tripe, although more often unintentionally than not. See it with friends so you they may join you in mocking it, or see it alone so you can mock it in silence and solitude (this may be how you'll watch many movies after introducing your friends to this one). Do not see it with your better half, for you will be caught in your futile attempts at spotting Ms. Reid's nipple and will sleep on the couch. Most importantly, it's OK to see it.",

But how the hell could a country that produced \"Metropolis\" give birth to the director of this movie? I am flabbergasted by how awful this film was. It wasn't a campy, \"so bad, it's good\" kind of film. It just plain sucked. Maybe I was expecting too much from a film based on a video game and the guy who directed \"House of the Dead,\" but still.George Lucas once said that special effects without a story are pretty boring, this waste of cinematography definitely enforces that sentiment. The special effects were OK, but there wasn't any kind of hook to keep them together. The acting was sub-par in my opinion and the story line was complete crap. The story is that Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator who has a past with a secret government experiment. The experiment was to open the doorway to an evil dimension and use kids with demons implanted in them to help take over the world. At some time in the past, Carnby either left or was kicked out of the government agency that tried to use him as a human guinea pig (bear with me, I'm trying to make sense out of this heap of cow dung). After finding an ancient artifact that can open the gate, he is hunted by these evil demons along with a female scientist (Tara Reid trying to act smart) and the head of his old department (Stephen Dorff trying to make a quick buck). Throw in an evil scientist, automatic weapons, and some Matrix style special effects and you've got a recipe for disaster.What were they thinking when they made this? There is no real redeeming factor in this film. You can't really sympathize with any of the characters because you've seen the plot so many times and done so much better that it's really not worth it.This could vie for the worst film made thus far this century.

I may have nodded off towards the end but the story was a complete mess, never played the game but still, and there was zero tension and no scares. I would not recommend it to anyone, but I thought it would actually be a lot worse. It was simply confusing and boring, though technically quite solid. No wobbly camera-moves, and some OK blocking of scenes. Seems to me that Uwes bad rep has to do with the failure to meet the high expectations from gamers.

But for myself, I think the quality of films are mostly based on biased opinions (including mine) and that we let our own personal views affect what we think and what we are to expect.First off, not every movie can be an art house/indie/thought provoker such as Sideways or Lost in Translation. This film tries to be what it is, entertaining and stylish and that it certainly is. I'll start off by reviewing the camera work/style: It is outstanding and the cinematography is gorgeous. The film couldn't look much better if it tried. The atmosphere and lighting used makes for an outstanding surrounding that looks impressive on the camera and also makes for a very believable environment. Uwe certainly knows how to use the camera, that can't really be denied.Plot is another issue. For those of you who were irritated by the crawl text at the beginning must have lost your memories, because the movies you know and love as the Star Wars films have an even slower and longer crawl text at their beginnings but they all seem to be overlooked. Just a point...but as for the actual plot of the film, it is rather good. It doesn't tell a story already told by the video games, but rather includes ANOTHER adventure of Edward Carnby, thus furthering his story and letting also have some background on his character. The story revolves around an ancient Indian race called Abkani, who vanished mysteriously after opening a portal to the world of darkness. In the future, a government agency called 713 would further investigate this, created nocturnal creatures called Xenos, that destroy on command. Humans are then experimented on and attempted to be merged with the creatures, only half of this is successful. Years later, Carnby is tracked down and hunted because he has a piece of the key that opens the portal to darkness. He fights the creatures commanded to kill him, reunites with an old flame and old rival, and tries to find out the mystery behind his own past and connection with the demonic forces after him. Won't spoil the rest, but the film is there and so is the plot...I simply don't understand how one could miss it? Acting is decent, could've been better on all fronts. Christian Slater was good and alongside Stephen Dorff carried the film on their backs and put performances that were worthy of recognition. Will Sanderson was good as the evil scientist and played his role very well. Tara Reid is my only complaint, she was horribly miscast and the fact that she couldn't act made matters worse, but she wasn't there to act, rather to be eye candy...and she did that very well. She resembles a high school drama student and a sub par one at that...stick to Van Wilder.The action here is intense and amazing as well, there is one particular scene in Carnby's apartment where the creatures come and a \"blackout shootout\" occurs and indeed it is a cinematic beauty. The action and suspense are high and the excellent atmosphere, good acting, and interesting plot all bring this together in what I thought was a very under promoted, and under-appreciated film. To say Ed Wood made better is ludicrous and to say that this is the worst film ever made is also ignorant because if you look outside the box and try to think of this as entertainment rather than Oscar material, then you'll enjoy more.",

In all fairness, my wife ordered this from Netflix and she doesn't know about Uwe Boll, but I'm just as guilty for sitting down to watch it.In case you haven't already perused the commentary, this 'film' stars the fading stars Christian (I'm a poor man's Jack Nicholson) Slater and Tara (see my botched liposuction procedure pics in People magazine) Reid. You can tell Uwe Boll directed this travesty, because only he would cast Tara Reid, and have us believe she's an archaeologist. Christian Slater gives us his \"I got out of bed, so now what?\" performance as a paranormal investigator with a secret past.Anyway, the plot is a hodge podge of thrown together scenes, which lack any direction or continuity. The acting, what there is of it, can be compared with those Sonic commercials, where the people sit in their car bantering back and forth until that punching sound is edited in for effect (see Youtube if you have never seen one). Most of the CGI is pretty laughable and the action is like going on a high speed chase through Disney World's 'It's a Small World' ride at half speed.I gave it (2) stars because, it was awful, but not AS awful as other Uwe Boll movies I've seen. You could tell there was almost an attempt at some level of competency, but at the end of the day everyone cashed their paychecks and went home.Someone mentioned that Christian Slater's career will hopefully be able to recover from this debacle, but honestly, what kind of career has he had in the years leading up to this or since?

Not only is the action extremely dull and uninteresting but considering its dark set and flashing lights its almost impossible to see what's going on. Not that you really care what's going on considering the far from engaging plot and the untreatable characters.

One of Carnby's assignments leads him to discover the secrets of the assignments leads him to discover the secrets of the Abskani, an ancient tribe that worshiped demonic forces which gave them incredible powers.Carnby's findings suggest that the Abskani are poised to return to take over the world, and only one person has the knowledge to stop them -- archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), who happens to be Carnby's former girlfriend. But Carnby's psyche has been tainted by his encounter with the Abskani demons, and he must now fight against their attempts to take over his mind as well as their attempts to conquer the Earth. Alone in the Dark also stars Stephen Dorff, Will Sanderson, and Fran\u00e7oise Yip. Basically starring a cast of Z list celebrities to star in a Z list directors hack job of a movie, that is if It can be classed as a movie.There's small joy in watching Reid stumble blindly through multi-syllable words that are plainly far more terrifying to her than any of Boll's joke shop monsters. Bafflingly, the budget evidently didn't stretch to getting the American Pie bimbo to flop her boobs out. Director Boll, though, the biggest tit of them all, has his 'talents' firmly on display.Some critics are calling Boll the latter-day Ed Wood. To paraphrase William H Macy in David Mamet's State And Main, Ed Wood's puke could have directed a better movie than this. Pure Boll-ocks.My final Verdict? Stay far far away.

A doctor felt he could control these creatures, found them and searched for the key to open up the gate. Until then, he experimented with merging the DNA of the creature with humans to create an ultra strong being under his control.*** end of spoilers ***I have seen a LOT worse plots..The creatures were decent, and I thought the SFX had some nice moments - especially the bullet time and the strobophobic scenes.This, like most of Boll's film, is done on a shoe string budget and in a very short amount of time. Knowing this, I thought he did a decent job and I enjoyed the film.The acting was very uneven. Tara Reid was horrible, but then again I don't think I ever was impressed by anything she did. Slater was good, and did the best given the material.Boll hasn't learned how to build true suspense (yet), but am optimistic he will.It is amazing how much he has improved as a director from House of the Dead.Dr. Boll has said that even he realizes that this film (Alone) wasn't one of his better ones. Yet, there was enough for me to sit back and enjoy 90 minutes of brainless entertainment.6.5/10",

And I probably like sci-fi films more than any other, especially if they're amusing with good action and fight scenes - like Serenity, which I saw at the cinema the same day I rented this film on DVD.So I was incredibly disappointed that I found this film so hard to enjoy - it could have been so different. It was a mess, like the writers were bored of the idea before they even started. There's a bit of background explained at the start about an ancient race of advanced humans who'd opened a gate to hell or some dark place with demons. See - I don't even know whether it was hell or somewhere else - because I DIDN'T CARE!!! It's so important for the viewer to give a damn about the characters in the story, otherwise you lose interest. This was the makers first big mistake. With better writing I might have cared what happened to Christian Slater's character, Edward Carnby, but no! Their next big mistake was not bothering to let the story flow properly. From the information about the ancient race to the flashbacks of Carnby's childhood, to the museum pieces and the professor, the connections weren't being made well enough. Since I wasn't paying much attention (due to their first mistake) the story needed to be so easy to follow a 3 year old could make sense of it. Scary monsters and special effects just don't do anything for me if I'm not interested.This film will have done nothing for Christian Slater's flagging career. And I've only seen Tara Reid in Scrubs before this, and can't imagine her career will do well out of this. I could blame the director - but the other actors don't come out of this as badly as she does.I would only recommend this film to someone who needs some time to think and likes to have something going on in the background which isn't going to distract them!!!",

She's so unbelievably bad. And Stephen Dorff didn't want to be there, it seemed. Why Boll... Why? Why zombies again?! Did you want to fix the HotD mistake? That was a throw-away storyline that didn't serve any point and was BOR-ING. And the Dorff goes down at the end to put the explosive, to blow up some/all of the creatures? and the door that god closed was different than the door opened? No logic here. And the ending- the town is deserted? What? Huh? Who cares. And the sex scene? It's beyond bad, and beyond out of place. Earlier in the day i had the song 'Seven Seconds' by Youssou Ndour running through my head. THEN i heard it during that sex scene. I knew i was in for trouble. It was some kind of bad omen.

            "content": "I got a feeling this film is going to get crushed because Uwe Boll is behind it. He's the guy who adapts videos games into movies, and he also directed \"House of the Dead\" back in 2003, and now he has adapted \"Alone in the Dark,\" a video game series set around the spooky and supernatural. \"House of the Dead\" was terrible, and this picture is not that good either, but it's not awful. In short, I didn't mind it, and I was entertained, but I was left wondering a lot, and I should not have been left in that state. I will decide whether to recommend the picture at the end. It's about, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) who is a detective that specializes in the occult & strange occurrences. Carnby used to work for Bureau 713, a secret government organization that protects the world from paranormal activity and danger. When Edward discovers one of his friends he grew up within an orphanage has disappeared, he realizes, Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) is planning something big, and Carnby must stop him. Together with his ex-girlfriend, Aline Cedrac (Tara Ried) and Commander of Bureau 713, Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Carnby must race against time to stop the professor from re-opening a portal and releasing demonic creatures before it's too late.It opens with a neat narrative telling us about a group of mine workers who discovered the remnants of a long-lost Native American civilization called, Abkani, in 1967. Shortly after, Abkani vanished from Earth without a trace. As a result, Bureau 713 was established to research and uncover the dark secrets of the Abkani. The director of the bureau, Archaeologist Lionel Hudgens began conducting gruesome experiments on orphaned children and the government shut him down. When the film starts, a team of people is looking for a runaway child. You guessed it, It's Edward Carnby. This opening serves as the core of the story as we learn revelations from it later on.I'm going to get this out of the way right off the bat. Tara Ried can't act. Her character Vicki in \"American Pie\" was a dumb ditz. She played the same character in \"Urban Legend,\" and she plays the same character in this picture. I'm not being mean, I'm speaking from seeing her experience on screen. Now, I have played the game that this is based on and the character of Aline is smart and can take care of herself. Tara Ried's character cannot. She is always hanging in the background, and she is cardboard with the role. Always in trouble and yelling for help. I'm sure Tara and her character will be another big target for this film, but this is not about her. Now, what makes this picture interesting is the story. For a supernatural picture, it works, and it's entertaining to see it unfold. Uwe Boll did a terrible job with \"House of the Dead,\" and it certainly showed that he tried to make a good film, but it didn't work. It seems to be the actors he uses are some causes of the problems, and I don't think I'm wrong about that.What's interesting is that Carnby has an interesting backstory to him. I think most of the film's story is lifted from the latest game \"Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.\" There are a few similarities to the source material: The creatures thrive in darkness and can be harmed by the light or electricity. The monsters in the films are called Xenos. I believe there are some others sources from the earlier games, but I'm not sure because I have not played them. So, the character of Carnby is most interesting. He was raised in an orphanage where he lost his memory when he was ten years old. Experiments were conducted on him and the children, and because of this, he can sense paranormal activity. He was electrocuted when he was a kid, and that serves as a plot twist later on in the film. He finds himself investigating his own past which seems to have connections to Abkani, an ancient Mayan-like Civilization from another dimension who worshiped the demonic creatures that Carnby seeks to destroy.Aline works in the city's museum of history as assistant to Hudgens. She has a vast knowledge of the Abkani. The plot really becomes interesting when a friend Carnby grew up with disappears in the middle of the night, and Carnby finds that it's all connected. Now, the story might be interesting to a certain extent but the action sequences are implausible, to say the least, and a sped up heavy metal soundtrack doesn't help much during an action sequence. The special effects are terrible. The acting is wooden, and there are numerous mistakes in the editing. There's a sequence where a female soldier is killed, but when the camera moves away, she lifts her head. Again, the actors he hires.The character of Lionel really works with the story. We don't know a whole lot about him. Maybe that's a good thing? He came off as really sick and twisted in his evil ways, and he serves as a significant part of the story. What doesn't work is the ending. Yes, there are numerous plot holes throughout, and we are left wondering but what really drags the film is the ending. I was left wondering what happened. Stephen Dorff is wasted in the movie. He reminds me of his police officer appearance in \"Feardotcom,\" and you might as well believe it's the same character; dumb and stupid. We're led to believe there will be a sequel to this, but I don't think so. For what's it's worth, it's not a terrible film, but it's not good either. On that note, I don't recommend the movie because of the numerous faults and the price you have to pay to see it, but when it hits home video, it's worth it to take a look it.",

I lose sleep at night knowing that Uwe Boll is out in the world with a camera and money, and this film confirms my nighttime fears.Granted, Alone in the Dark is better than House of the Dead, but it's like comparing a punch in the groin with a kick in the groin: its kinda hard to tell the difference. The problems are much of the same as House of the Dead: crappy acting, a broken story, and wrongly being labeled a real movie.Probably the worst part of the movie is the story. It starts off with five minutes of text, talking about some ancient civilization and monsters living in darkness. This is the most understandable part of the story. The rest makes absolutely no sense what so ever. Random monsters, random soldiers, random explosions, and random deaths mark the rest of this broken excuse for a movie. This train wreck of a story is laughable, until you realize that you are on the train.The characters in the movie have the personality of gum stuck on the bottom of your shoe, which only makes it more desirable to see them die. The actors portray no real signs of human emotion, and mostly look like they are there for a quick buck. It's sad, as Christain Slater can do so much better. Tara Reid, on the other hand, is simply in the movie because she looks great, which doesn't make up for her crappy acting. Boll might want to consider getting real actors for his next movie. Golly, that might help! Granted watching this movie with a few buddies is extremely funny, but only because there are so many jokes to be made at this movie's expense. Watching this by yourself is harmful to your health, and may cause uncontrollable rage, intense feelings of stomach flu, and a fist through the TV. You have been warned.",

If you have actually played the game, the only thing you will recognize is the main character's name, Edward Carnby, other than that, this movie is nothing like the game. which is too bad. From what I remember of playing the game, even with the graphics which, while advanced for the time, really didn't look realistic at all, being so boxy and game play being pretty straight forward and frustrating, it still managed to give you enough surprises to keep you on the edge of you seat as you played it. Movie execs should look at the first Resident Evil, the the following it has developed when converting games to movies.

The only other movie to manage that is Gigli. When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldn't tell. Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh? And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up. As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone \"opens the path\" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, BORING. I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.",

            "content": "ALONE IN THE DARK is sheer genius, an absolutely fantabulous amalgam of no less than six different monster-movie concepts, low-budget effects, Christian Slater and crap. German uber-hack Uwe Boll shrugs off any shame in the crafting of this cinematic clinker and delivers an instantaneous (and unintentional) camp classic.Follow up to his 2003 zombie-lark HOUSE OF THE DEAD, Boll is back and proving fairly consistent, this being his second of two god-awful horror video game adaptations that provides more laughs than scares. In HOTD, Boll had almost zero budget, but made up for his technical limitations with a rotten script, lousy actors and a constant barrage of violence and sex. The genius of that film, however, lies in how boldly and unapologetically bad it is, and for the right audience, watching HOTD can be a great experience. ALONE IN THE DARK is much, much worse... and subsequently ten times more fun.The \"x factor\" must lie in the amount of money those poor, witless European donors throw at Boll when he convinces them his movies will break even. This time the effects aren't bad, the action is polished, at least relative to HOUSE, and the actors are a lot better... known. Christian Slater delivers what should, God willing, be the defining performance of his dead career (either this or the Blockbuster exclusive PURSUED), bringing almost no weight or believability to his Ed Carnby, but a deliriously intense delivery on such lines as, \"No Hudgens! Don't be insane!\" Tara Reid can only be stared at for so long before you can almost see the dialog on the page as she drones on about whatever archaeological plot-furthering babble that her assistant museum curator (best joke in the whole movie) contributes. And Stephen Dorff is and always shall be very, very Stephen Dorff. The rest of the cast is filled out by one of the staples of a Boll film: random, untrained people off the street who bring a warm, campy quality to the backgrounds of each scene.But the real star of this movie isn't the leads or the chatty extras; it isn't even the terribly familiar monsters (imagine H.R. Gieger's love child with a Velociraptor and Lon Chaney's makeup and you've got a very general idea of what they look like). No, ALONE's real star is Uwe Boll's direction. He masterfully guides this thinly-plotted tripe into utter oblivion and unavoidable audience confusion. In what could only have been born of a post-production, in the editing room, rough-cut's finished \"Oh crap!\" moment, the first three minutes of the film contains nothing but essential background information presented in a very engaging white text-scroll... and read aloud. It's kind of like STAR WARS... except not at all. You know you're in for a fun movie when the entire dose of antecedent information is dumped on you inside of the first three minutes (yes, it takes that long).It's hard to tell where the visual aspect of the movie went wrong, as (only on a shot-by-shot basis) Uwe actually demonstrates some visual skill with the camera. However, once the shots get assembled together, AITD is a mess. The action scenes (especially a worthless fight between Slater and former-Sixers owner Pat Crocce) make BOURNE SUPREMACY look steady, the creature scenes are sloppy and lacking in continuity, and the shoot-outs are a bloody mess. Taking a page from EQUILLIBRIUM, Boll goes for the blinding-white-muzzle-flash-in-pitch-black aesthetic for one seemingly-endless sequence that actually gave me a headache. ALONE is a visual mess with only a handful of honestly good moments, and all of those are stolen from better pictures than this. I spotted \"homages\" to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, JURASSIC PARK, ALIEN and ALIENS, EVIL DEAD, the Watchowskis, Woo and Romero (for some reason there are zombies in this one, too). And each one is funnier than the last.It should be noted that I haven't talked about the plot at all, which I've avoided doing thus far for several reasons. First of all, the plot is barely there as it is, and it provides enough solid belly-laughs that I wouldn't dare give away. Seconldy, I was laughing so much I honestly didn't catch much of the story, and what I did hear I barely understood. Thirdly, it's almost too ridiculous to summarize... but let me try. Christian Slater plays an orphan and once-agent of the secret government agency \"713,\" which is essential THE X-FILES with big guns... and in Canada. Slater, now in exile, tries to find pieces of his amnesiac past in an orphanage while simultaneously sleeping with Tara Reid, the aforementioned museum curator studying some fabricated Native American tribe of Satanic alchemists. Monsters. Guns. Crappy sex-scene. Hilarity.Boll has recently said that HOUSE OF THE DEAD was intentionally bad, a self-deprecating satire of zombie movies. He wishes. The fact of the matter is, the man couldn't make a good movie if Orson Wells himself came back from the dead and mentored him for a decade or two. However, what he can do is deliver D-material horror schlock that will absolutely enthrall anyone with either booze or a very masochistic sense of humor.One Star out of Five for Quality (there are worse movies out there), but Five out of Five for MST3K-inspired joy.**(Anyone who makes the Marco Polo joke (the pool game, not the Spaniard) when a toss-away character named Marko bites it is forever in my debt. )",

Sure it rips of \"The Matrix\" some what, but it does it very well.The wardrobes in this movie, must have been picked from a four-year old, however. The Bureau 713 combat suits are obliviously paint ball armor. I mean come on. They're dealing with the PARANORMAL not the semi ad-normal. They should have metal or bullet proof vests on.This movie also has enough plot twist that it can get confusing. How ever most of them are reveled within 30mins of the movie. So PAY ATTENTION! Other then that I really don't have that big of a problem with Alone in the Dark. It was decent for a Uwe Boll movie. Nothing more nothing Less. However if Uwe Boll truly put his full potential into this movie, instead of just thinking about getting this movie re-leased in theaters, it could have been a lot better. However I just noticed a sequel is coming out, I don't see why. The ending left a loose end, but not a big one. It really dose not need a sequel. Well, neither did Blood Rayne. But now that's going on to it's 3rd movie. It really does bother me that Companies are trying so hard to get video game movie's out to the fan boys. Alone in the Dark had a lot more potential. Instead they wasted it on a cheap director, but hey. The movie COULD have been great but, Uwe Boll chose mediocre. Still, it wasn't that bad. You should at least give it a try.",

It's some stuff about ancient Indian tribes and alien portals or something like that.Then the actually movie starts. Some dudes are chasing this orphan boy. Boring. The kid is grown-up, and he's some paranormal investigator. He gets in a taxi and out of nowhere there's a big car chase and a big 10 minute battle between the paranormal guy and some other dude. He gets shot several times, but it appears that only a spike through the stomach can kill this guy! Then some more bull-crap goes down, and out of nowhere...A SEX SCENE! Uwe Boll's trademark.After that retarded sex scene between Tara Reid(as a scientist) and the paranormal guy, there's a big one minute battle scene between a few army guys and some aliens with bad heavy metal music playing in the background.After another hour of gore and violence, the movie ends. It gets a 1 out of 10 just for being funny.",

I was interested in the film, so naturally I chose to see what people were saying about it on IMDb. I was shocked at what I read! First and for foremost: Uwe Boll has established himself; most people know of him. Why? Terrible movies? I don't think so.Dr. Boll and his work have been bashed from every angle,and some unjustifiable and rude comments have been made. People seem to find themselves in the following of \"Boll Bashers\" whom can't stand his work.Why? Is it because Dr. Boll doesn't give up? Because he makes movies that some don't like? I don't think so. I think it's a trend. See Boll, Bash Boll; no true justification. Lay off the terrible, direct insults.Second: The Film ***may contain spoilers*** Alone in the Dark. I do believe that there was a miss-casting w/ characters and some things didn't seem to original (story), but I won't ignore the fact that it had some awesome shots and nice character models and creature effects.The battles between the creatures were interesting, and cool, but I think what lost people was it's darkness. Yes, the film was dark; literally. Some shots, you couldn't make out what was happening. For instance: The final battle w/ the 713 soldiers and the creatures, there were some cool gore effects, but they were hard to see due to the lighting.The cool thing about this movie is the actual look and feel. The film possessed a very 90's creature-feature feel... what's that? The 90's was full of creature films that used the a lot of CGI w/out puppeteers. AITD some what uses this idea because there was very few puppeteers in it. But it was cool, and I liked the creature's design.Third: See it.Watch the movie and form an unbiased opinion. I know most will not love it, but I can't see everyone hating it...I own the DVD. I love it.Why? The special features and commentary.Ever watched one of those commentaries and all they talk about it \"yogurt\" or personal, stupid stuff? Well... Dr. Boll's is not like that! He actually talks about the film, the technical aspects, his feelings, and his true thoughts of the film business.Fourth: Hate it or like it! Hate it or like it, is that what AITD is about? I am not going to sit here and explain the reasons why one would hate it, because truthfully, it has its downsides, but looking at the glass half full is better.All in all: The film has entertaining moments and dull ones too. It's a quick ride... fun and interesting.Watch it.... if you don't like it, move on.BTW, I can't wait for Bloodrayne :) -JVL",

There's no need for me to list all the shortcomings of this film, just read the other reviews here, all the ugly things said are not exaggerated. Sometimes I see a movie that got awful reviews and still find something in it that makes me think 'it's not that bad', but \"Alone In The Dark\" has no such redeeming features. It's simply the worst movie ever. What surprised me most is that this movie looks like it had quite a budget. Normally you would expect a movie that has this sort of high tech special effects to have at least a hint of a storyline, but this looks like someone cut random action scenes from completely different movies together to 96 minutes of film. Somewhere in the mess is a pivotal scene when a frightened Christian Slater looks into the camera and screams \"What the hell is going on here?\". I so knew how he felt. Was this movie sabotaged by a disgruntled cutter? Was there a script involved in the making of this? Why did not one of the executives take Uwe Boll to the side and remind him that it would be helpful if some scenes in this movie had at least something to do with the next. And than there is Tara Reid. Nothing spells quality entertainment like the lights going off in the cinema, you watch the screen and the name 'Tara Reid' appears in the opening titles. Before I saw this movie I thought the idea of casting Tara Reid as a super intelligent anthropologist is quite funny, you know, like it would be to cast Paris Hilton as the world's leading brain surgeon. However, now that I've seen it I think that there was no irony intended in this casting whatsoever. Poor Tara tries to play this role straight and to call her performance unconvincing would be the understatement of the century. The movie ends with Tara and Christian wandering through a deserted city, I still have no idea why this city was deserted, but I sure do know why every theater that this movie played in was...",

Of course if I see another one this bad I'll probably change my mind. The acting is horrendous as is the logic of the characters. The visual effects if you want to call them that also leave something to be desired.While Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff are normally decent actors, in this movie they are just bad. So is Tara Reid but that is to be expected by now. The movie is boring and uninspired. Well I guess I shouldn't really say that as some of the scenes were definitely \"inspired\" or I guess you could say ripped off from \"Aliens.\" They have the same motion tracker, the aliens in this have the tongue penetrating thing and many other things I'm sure you'll notice along the way. Movies like \"Starship Troopers\" and \"Hellboy\" are also borrowed in smaller doses.Now I'll let you in on the good stuff. All 3 things that you might want to skip to on the DVD if you can get to see it for free. 1) Very cool gore scene when one of the soldier's arms is torn off by an alien., 2) Very cool gore scene when some female soldier's head is split down the middle. Pretty sick looking. and 3) This one is my favorite, so watch this scene. When Stephen Dorff says that one of the female soldiers is dead, she starts moving before the camera even stops showing her. Very funny stuff.Overall, it sucked. 4/10",

Now, this is the part where I would summarize the story of the film, but this is rather difficult, since it was mostly non-existent and incoherent. I will try my best. Paranormal detective Edward Carnby(Slater) is a man with a troubled past. It seems he was an orphan selected to be a part of a genetic experiment involving creatures from another world, but escaped before the scientists got to him. He spent his life being afraid of the dark and looking for things that go bump in the night. He is then chased by some goon and fights him, and then uncovers the mystery behind the monsters that thrive in the dark. This is done of course with the help of his ex, a paleontologist(Reid) and an FBI agent(Dorf). It could have been a stylish, atmospheric horror film, but instead it turned itself into an action flick. The violence seems to take over the plot. The director cared more for the action than the story. Much more time was needed for all of the characters, yet they seem to be just breezed through in between shoot outs with the monsters. The only reason I gave this film a four was because of Slater's and Dorff's performances, and because the action sequences were done relatively well. Alone in the Dark is a standard shoot the monsters B-movie with little in terms of suspense and plot, and contains Pervasive Strong Violence, Language, and a Brief Sex Scene.",

Me and my husband have never played the game and we bot enjoyed the movie. Plus what does everyone expect from this type of movie anyways.So if you have played the game then maybe you need to forget about the game. If you have never played the game then just don't expect it to be the greatest movie out there. Its a horror movie people. History has shown us most of these types of movies are never really that great to begin with. The acting is never the greatest. The scary factor is never that scary. How many movies has everyone actually watched that was really scary. Maybe i can think of 5 out of the thousands of movies i have seen in my lifetime. Now lets address the issue everyone has about it having no plot. Maybe you need to go back and watch it again and pay attention to the absolute beginning where they do give you a little bit of history on whats going on. Granted they could give you more on what is what but most movies don't give you all the information you would really like to have. There was somewhat of a plot as far as I was concerned.This movie may not be the highest rated movie out there but i believe it deserves a better rating then what it has gotten so for. A 2.0 is really not true. I have seen a lot of movies 10 times worse then this one was. I would at least give it about a 5.6 out of 10I'll give this movie one of the biggest credits that most movies i can not give. At least i wasn't bored and wanted to go to sleep. I sat through the whole thing wanting to see what was gonna happen next. Not many movies out there can at least do that. Overall i would say its at least worth seeing in the movie theatres so you can enjoy it. If you don't want to pay full price for it go to a matin\u00e9e where the prices are cheaper. It is worth the watch. You will at least be entertained and not completed bored to sleep.",

Generally it helps me to decide if a movie is worth enough to watch or not.Although I agree with the guys who said that this film has several weaknesses (for example that the music was not fit all scene and there was not too emphatic relationship between the hero and the heroine) what I can appreciate in it that is the pure characters and the interesting job with the pictures. Somebody just claimed these things in the movie (he said characters have no motivations and the pictures are in-consequence in the style) but my opinion is that the movie which tells everything about its main characher's life without let the viewer see few years of his/her life is unreal and too much. I like when there are some minor moments in characters and in the story which remain covered. If the filmmakers let it up to my fantasy I like that. :) (But not on that hard way as Donnie Darko did. That was too much for me too.)The Alone In The Dark wasn't a great film but fair. A common story with some myth, monsters and heroes in the present days. There were three memorable visual scene for me. The monsters run down from the hill between the trees, one of them jumps to the helicopter and third one is the landscape of the other plane. These were interesting and spectacular experiences really. Also the narrator's (Slater's) voice was fit to the dark behaviour of this film precisely. He wasn't bad in his role.My vote was 8 to bring the average up but this movie is not more then 6 at all.",

The Dialogue sucked in plain English, but the action scenes were probably some of the best ever seen in a film. The scene where Beareau 713 troops have to fight the mass Xeno army is awesome.Special effects 8/10- Trust me, the special effects are excellent. Not perfect, but awesome.Sidenote- The Xeno creatures in the film are criticized for bearing an uncanny resemblance to Alien Xenomorph. On first glance, they do, but upon closer inspection, they look nothing alike.So overall the film isn't a masterpiece of a work of art, but it is enjoyable, and thought provoking, which is rare in movies lately.7/10",

Everyone had said how bad the film was, and after seeing the first 10 minutes of House Of The Dead (I couldn't watch any further than that), I wasn't really wanting to see Alone In The Dark. However, considering that people said Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse were crap, and I loved those two films, curiosity got the better of me and I had to have a look. Overall, Alone In The Dark isn't too bad. Sure, the acting was a bit cheesy, and yes, there were a few mistakes and confusing action scenes with clich\u00e9'd heavy metal music thrown into it, but as a popcorn film, it was quite good. I would classify it as a big, dumb action film. Not much plot, but the action sequences and special effects were rather good, so that saved this film, for me. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the ending. It was too sudden and unbelievable. I expected a bit more. Oh, and am I the only one that rolled their eyes at the use of Nenh Cherry's \"Seven Seconds\" during the sex scene?",

            "content": "A hundred thousand years or so when the moon doth glow there comes a film so horrendously bad it's fantastic. One of those cinematic experiences that forces you to simply laugh hysterically, rolling in the aisles at the utter farce and feeble attempts at film-making. From the music and editing to the directing and oh-so-stellar acting, the film becomes ingrained in your memory as one of those all-time \"so bad it's good\" films to cherish forever...ALONE IN THE DARK is not one of those films.Alone in the Dark is such a horrid film that the notions of character growth, suspense, or even plot don't even come into play. The film is utterly pointless, as the entire plot and all its secrets are divulged in the \"Romping Room Story Time\" at the beginning, where a laughably bored narrator reads a five-minute long short story with the passion of a Prozak junkie that makes Ben Stein seem like a Shakespearan thespian. The film might have well just taken the actual script and voice actors from the video game and just added beginning and end credits. There is no horror for the horror buffs. No suspense for the suspense buffs. No impressive special or visual effects that couldn't find on my XBox, and certainly no sex (just bluntly obvious dry humping with a bra-clad Tara Reid in a scene as sexually titilizing as watching a one-eyed, three-legged badger hump my refrigerator), and quality acting equal to...let's say, a car dealership commercial.So, in short, this film is essentially a true testament (along with such winners as Racing Stripes) that Hollywood has officially ran out of ideas, and was so desperate to spend money that ALONE IN THE DARK was just ripe for the picking. However, there is a great upside of this magnificently atrocious film. It makes you dumber. Much dumber, and hopefully after enough marathon viewings of Racing Stripes and Alone in the Dark, Hollywood may achieve its ultimate goal of lowering our IQs and expectations to such an extent that this movie, and all other movies like 3 Fast 3 Furious surely due out next Summer, will seem good and entertaining and life-affirming. So keep on trying Hollywood. You're not there yet, but you're on the right track! A for effort.",

Except that in this case, time seems to have stopped for the makers of this movie: sets look like sets and lighting looks like lighting, acting looks like acting and dialogue sounds like dialogue , edits look like edits and effects look like effects... must I go on? Which is really sad to see since there was already much better TV in the 1970's and there are definitely much better TV features or series now.What I mean is that almost every piece of scenery, action and dialogue made me do a double-take and go \"oh, they're TRYING to show me that....\" And my theory is that instead of working within their means and talents, the film-makers preferred to \"stretch themselves\" by going for everything they wanted in the film-- even if they could only do it in a half-baked manner. I can't say if this is the worst movie I've seen, but I understand why people hate it so much-- the times HAVE changed and audiences HAVE moved on....The fact that this movie was given a theatrical release tells me that the film-makers don't really realize its lack of potential-- or their lack of ability. So no points awarded for this film & its film-makers being stuck in the time warp of 1970's TV entertainment-- but 1 point for Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, because I'm a fan, and for their surprisingly sober performances in a movie which should have just been played for laughs.

However when watching a movie like this plot tends to get in the way. The only thing you need to know going into this is that creepy killer monsters and zombies are bad, and the characters must KILL THEM ALL WITH BIG GUNS! As a brainless sci-fi actioner, Alone in the Dark reminds me of a second rate Aliens. Black Creepy monsters, Swat Teams, and (in what I believe is a direct homage) Auto-Turrets.Christian Slater and Stephen Dorrf are both in their elements. The only REALLY terrible thing is.... Tara Reid. While Miss Reid may be entertaining in teen comedies as the dumb, but hot, blonde chick. In AitD she is cast as an assistant curator of a museum, and yet she delivered her lines like a dumb, but hot, blonde chick. The fact that this film doesn't have a strong female lead hurts it greatly. Tia Carrere would have been perfect in this role as she proved her archaeological chops in her series 'Relic Hunter.' This films strengths are its action and effects shots, accompanied by the ever prevalent heavy metal music that is in nearly every action movie to come out in the past few years. I have read hundreds of reviews of these films written by old men who pine for the days of old, when movies were accompanied by great scores performed by orchestras. Metal is here to stay in the action genre and the sooner everyone accepts that, the sooner they can learn to appreciate it for the musical merits it holds.Overall, this is a good film. Especially if you don't pay attention to little details and enjoy the carnage about to ensue.",

Does anyone else agree?I'm not even sure if the movie had an actual plot, and it was moving so ridiculously fast that I couldn't take the action seriously. I don't even know if you can call the actors/actresses \"characters\" in this film because they were completely lacking in character! I barely got a chance to even get to know anything about them, so I couldn't even sympathize with them at any point. The intense little love scene was probably the most thought out part in the whole movie and that didn't even fit in because every other scene lacked emotion and intensity of any kind.

            "content": "This is not the worst film of all time, but as an actioner it was pretty average. Lots of blood and gore and a mysterious something from an ancient civilization that jumps out to bite you. The little orphanage looks like something out of \"Signs.\" This film also owes something to the Indiana Jones series and \"Men in Black\", and the Matrix trilogy, all of which are somewhat better movies and had already been there and done that. The worst thing that can be said is that nothing in this movie has not been done or seen before.The reading material scrolling by in the beginning was a bad sign, I thought. Any film that requires such an extensive explanation at the beginning in such an artless way (notwithstanding the fact that the first Star Wars movie did so) is already in trouble. The narration at the beginning in addition by the lead character (Christian Slater) is also a bad sign. And of course if you think too much about what transpires, it does not make a lot of sense in many ways. For example, what was the purpose of the experiment implanting the larval creatures which convert normal people into crazed kung fu superdemons? Why was the old archaeologist on the side of evil? Why didn't the boy who escaped not die himself if he was electrocuted. What happened to him after that? Why was the nun consenting to this experiment in the first place? What was in it for her? Sure dude, here are my kids, go ahead Dr. Mengele, do anything you like with them and hail Mary. No matter since when the zombie switch is thrown they all leave their premises and walk to the museum where they are all dispatched by the SWAT army staffed by the Paranormal agency.And here was the leader of this super-top secret agency from which for reasons unexplained Slater was expelled. Apparently the security is pretty lax. Slater assaults the leader of the SWAT unit and gets his security pass. He just strolls into the place, talks with the older guy who is a kind of CSI pathologist who examines corpses. Strangely enough the SWAT team leader, Commander Burke, was surprisingly okay with Carnby's behavior, considering this was a super secret agency with military capability, and Carnby just gets off with a mild \"Well, don't let it happen again, okay?\" Later Dr. Hudgens takes a blood sample from a caged creature he just happens to have there in the laboratory and injects the old pathologist with something that converts him to one of THEM, whoever \"them\" happen to be. This was basically so the pathologist could trash the generator and put outthe floodlights that were keeping the nasty critters at bay at the entrance to the gold mine.The nasty light-averse creatures with beady eyes and sharp teeth seem not to mind Dr. Hudgens, in fact he seems to be leading them somehow. His big moment comes when our heroes (Carnby, Cedrac, and Commander Burke) are finally at the portal to the dark world and all they need is the key. Dr. Hudgens provides the missing link to the key and holds them at bay at the door until someone nails him with a knife. (All that circus training finally came in handy). There is some question as to whether they should open it but open it they do. On the other side there seem to be more of these nasty creatures, but never mind they seem to have gotten loose already anyway. Only Carnby and Aline Cedrac, the blonde and sexy archaeologist escape in time as the mine goes up in a fireball of handy ordnance that Commander Burke luckily (for Carnby and Cedrac) went back to get and set off. Meanwhile the nun proprietor of the orphanage has offed herself (as nuns do, of course) and the whole city has been evacuated because it was too late, the darn critters got out anyway, perhaps in hopes that someone might finance a sequel? Things are left hanging.The only thing that made sense in the movie was the rock video of Carnby and Cedrac having a horizontal good time. This makes sense because she was about the hottest babe to be seen in the whole film, the rest of them having already had their heads creased severely by the critters. Everyone needs a break now and then, perhaps.",

Tara Reid sure looks good, but that and the soundtrack is by far the only good thing in this movie. The main thing which makes it stink is the direction. Uwe Boll made this movie after he made the (possibly) worst film ever, House of the Dead. Of course, this one isn't as bad as House..., but both movies show what an abortive director Uwe Boll is. I haven't seen Bloodrayne yet, but I don't have any high expectations. Anyway, this movie is marketed as \"scary\", \"filled with action\", \"dramatic\" and \"thrilling\". Let me straight things out a little, then. \"Scary\". No. It's not scary at all. One ad I read said \"Have you ever woken up at night and looked in the dark, feeling like something is there? This movie explores the reality that exists, but we don't see\". Well, what? If that is the purpose, then it have failed like h*ll! If that is supposed to make a movie scary, then it failed there too. \"Filled with action\". Yes. So? Is it good 'cause of action? No. Especially since the action in this movie is stupid, unrealistic and boring. Besides, the action scenes are longer than any normal person could stand when they are as bad as they are in this movie. \"Dramatic\". Nope. The \"drama\" in this movie is silly and ridiculous. And there are very little of it too. To market this movie as \"dramatic\" would be a crime against humanity. If the watcher wants to see drama, then the chance is very small that he would choose this movie. \"Thrilling\". Well... no. It's a boring and stupid movie, and if you want it to be thrilling you have to begin with not making it boring and stupid. What more can I say about this movie? Not too much, since I don't want to write spoilers. To finish this review: please don't watch it. The only good things are Tara Reids looks and the various metal songs which makes the soundtrack.",

I feel like each of the three writers started on their own scripts, ran out of time, and pasted their work together with no regard for continuity, logic, or entertainment value. They tried to cover up their mistakes by presenting these inconsistencies as ZOMG BRILLYINT PLOT TWISTZ!!! but the movie mostly just doesn't make any sense. AT ALL.The acting is just sad. I really didn't care about any of the characters, and I think it's obvious that the actors didn't either. (Pay attention to the security guard at the museum; he is very obviously a shortcut to explain things that should be revealed through a decently written plot.) The camera work is ridiculous. The camera is there to show the action, not to show off the technique you're in love with today. And the music... OHHHHH GOD, THE MUSIC. A movie score is supposed to subtly enhance the action on the screen, but since no one seemed to be telling anyone else what was going on during this fiasco, they decided to slam bad metal music into your ears as yet another distraction technique.My friends and I make a habit of watching bad movies and razzing them mercilessly.

            "content": "Well, this movie has received a 2.2 average out of 12319 votes and if that alone doesn't scare you away hopefully my comment will.First off I think Christian Slater is an overrated actor. Sure he's made a name for himself. He did a good work in Interview with the Vampire and he did ride with the brat pack in Young Guns II. But asides from that I think he's received a lot more credit than he's worth.Anyhow Slater is given a fair amount of monologue in this movie. Up to a point where it becomes tedious in fact and it's also seemingly unmotivated. Speaking of monologues the introduction starts of with a speaker voice and is ridiculously long. If you even bare to remember half of it you're in for a disappointment because they iterate it throughout the entire movie. This film is still a puzzle, my sincerest wish is that they just skipped all attempts at being serious and just went straight for the action.Then again the action isn't much to brag about either. The camera is flimsy and some of the action scenes are actually left out for some reason. No spoilers here but we're cheated on some mayhem and we always like to see that.Without spoiling too much another issue is the scary part of this movie. Or the lack of it. With such flat character portraits you never develop any concern or sympathy for them. And to top it off, none of the actions scenes actually convey any real danger.We're also introduced to so many threats and all remains unexplained. Zombies, mad scientist, alien-type monsters and a top secret organization. And because this movie does include a great mystery it's frustrating that they try to serve an answer but ultimately fails.The movie also features Tara Reid, an actor we all love to hate and she keeps giving us reason to. Her acting and credibility reaches about as far as I can toss an elephant. She has a bad habit of bringing movies down a notch and she doesn't make an exception for Alone in the Dark. Her acting is 100% emotionless.To summarize this I just want to say that I gave this movie 1 star rating. I'm fairly certain it's a bit harsh, it probably deserves 2, maybe even 3. But because this is a fairly high budget movie with reasonably known (and well payed) actors it's a surprise it fails so miserably and does so entirely on it's won.",

            "content": "It seems the general consensus of opinion here on IMDb that computer games do not usually make the transition to the big screen very well. Some do it better than others, but most are simply produced to fully exploit our willingness to spend more of our hard-earned cash on their lazy and greedy film-making.The ALONE IN THE DARK computer games were superb. Graphically dated somewhat by today's standards, but nonetheless they were full of suspense, full of fiendishly difficult puzzles, and awash with genuinely unnerving moments. Based on Lovecraft's myths of Cthulu, the games are often remembered for their unsettling atmosphere, and the care taken by the developers of the games to make you actually feel alone in the dark.It's a great pity that the film is almost the opposite. As many have already mentioned, the film is lethargic at best. The script and the acting are both dire, and the atmosphere created is non-existent. If the film didn't take itself so seriously, it could have been forgiven somewhat, but the hammy clich\u00e9s keep coming, not to mention a weirdly inserted love scene that served no purpose whatsoever.Plus points? Well, there aren't many. The monsters looked pretty good to me, and some of set designs late on in the film are okay, but these could not detract from the fact that overall, the worse thing about this film is that neither the writers, director or actors could have cared less about the project.So, to be perfectly honest, neither could I.",

            "review_title": "Uwe Boll + Alone in the Dark video game = Hell On Earth",
            "content": "Aww yes. My favorite topic: Uwe Boll movies. I love writing bad reviews for bad movies, so Uwe Boll is useful in some ways, though video game industries need to realize that he ISN'T useful for making good movies out of their good games. Let's take a look at another one of Uwe Boll's 'masterpieces'.If you haven't been thrown off by such actors as Jimmy Neutron's Christian Slater and American Pies' Tara Reid, then hopefully, this review will. Uwe Boll is known by most gamers and movie lovers as the destroyer of good things. He is the Antichrist given flesh. He's the breathing Hell-on-Earth, and is on the same scale as George Bush in \"America's Biggest Mistakes\". He even was such a cry baby that he challenged his worst critics to BOXING matches so they would \"put up or shut up\". Well, someone needs to say that with such awful movies out there plaguing movie stores, the American public can't just 'put up' and Mr. Boll is the one that needs to 'shut up' and go back to making little movies on Super 8 and leave our beloved theaters alone. \"Alone in the Dark\" is NO excuse, and here's why.The story is . . . something about a centipede thing that takes over people's minds and makes them into superhuman zombies . . . things called xenos . . . some sayings about an organization . . . THERE IS NO PLOT TO SPEAK OF!!! You need proof. When asked of what he learned from this movie, he said \"a script matters\". Wow, it took you thousands of negative feedback from \"House of the Dead\" and this movie to make you realize that? You're making some good effort, Boll. Let's hope you realize, in the future, that theaters aren't where you belong. The acting in the movie? It's obvious that the roles are either BADLY, and I say that in Caps for a reason, acted, melodramatized WAY TOO MUCH, or are just not convincing. Imagine this: Tara Reid playing the role of a scientist and you'll get an idea of how awful the role will be.Christian Slater will need some SERIOUS good acting, I mean like playing a role in a movie that is as good as Return of the King, to redeem him for this horrible mess-of-a-movie. He tries to act serious, tries to seem horrified, but somehow, he just can't pull it off.Whatever script there is, it was really really horrible. Uwe Boll tried to make things interesting and pleasing to the audience with mediocre soldiers being slaughtered by xenos, weird reptile-like monsters that don't . . . like . . . light, how predictable and clich\u00e9, and with lots of special effects and gore, but what's in the movie isn't even laughable like \"House of the Dead\", it's just BORING and LOUSY on so many levels that you just want to go up to Uwe Boll while he's at home (in his cardboard, writing the script to \"Postal, a movie that I have a feeling NO ONE will see), and slug him hard into the face with brass knuckles, spit on his trembling face and say \"Put up with that!\" But I suppose that Uwe Boll is good for something. Directors for generations will be inspired by him to tell themselves \"Don't be as bad as that guy!\" Sometimes, I picture Uwe Boll as one of those kids that thinks he's popular so he hangs out with popular kids, and Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg tell him to get into a trash can and then, push him off a steep hill and say \"God, he's SO annoying!\" Normally, I would say \"Try again, Boll\", but in this case, go back to your cardboard box and live your life off rats in the sewers, where you and your movies belong. I would also like to thank those many reviewers who said horrible things about him and this movie because without you guys, Uwe won't realize what a joke he is. Is there any use for \"Alone in the Dark\"? Well, keep a copy in your bathroom in case you run out of a toilet paper and don't worry if it doesn't go down the drain, because then, you can (wearing rubber gloves, not for the crap on it, but because it is what it is) take it to your backyard and beat ALL your stress into it with a hammer. :-D",

            "review_title": "Askance at the Abskani",
            "content": "I am not sure when the IMDb summary was written. Or maybe I zoned out during the film...but the plot summary only kinda-sorta-maybe-a-little-more-like-not-much describes what i saw. \"Evil queen\"? \"Genius anthropologist with an incredible memory\"? \"The Abskani are planning on coming back to life in the 21st century to once again take over the world\"? NONE of these things were in the movie I just experienced. Very odd.The movie opens with a prologue, read aloud:\"In 1967, mine workers discovered the first remnants of a long lost native American civilization - the abkani. The Abkani believed there are two worlds on this planet: a world of light and a world of darkness. 10,000 years ago, the abkani opened a gate between these worlds.Before they could close it, something evil slipped through. The Abkani mysteriously vanished from the earth. Only a few artifacts remained, hidden in the world's most remote places. These artifacts speak of terrifying creatures that thrive in the darkness, waiting for the day when the gate can be opened again. Bureau 713, the government's paranormal research agency, was established to uncover the dark secrets of this lost civilization. Under the direction of archaeologist Lionel Hudgens, bureau 713 began collecting Abkani artifacts.When the government shut down his controversial research, Hudgens built a laboratory hidden within an abandoned gold mine. There, he conducted savage experiments on orphaned children in an attempt to merge man with creature. Hudgens' victims survived as \"sleepers\" - lost souls awaiting the moment of their calling.\" Okaaaay....the person I was watching this with turned to me and said \"What the BLEEP!?\" only he didn't say BLEEP..Basically what follows is a movie that has fight elements like \"Kill Bill\" (including the image of a slow-mo bullet fired and leaving the barrel), \"Stargate\" TV series (with little centipede creatures attached to spines), creatures straight from \"The Relic\" (even going as far to grab a head and...well...kill) and Aliens (a hoard of them hanging along the walls and coming to live) and an ending that echoes \"Resident Evil\". I am trying to remember when anyone was actually ALONE in the dark, and can only come up with the guard who is creeping around a dark room...it qualifies, I suppose, since the main characters aren't with him but actually in the next room over. Oh wait no, there IS that nasty little creature with him. So no, he is not alone in the dark. That would be a good name for this movie. \"Not Alone in the Dark\". Or perhaps \"Alone in the Dark Except for that THING\". It couldn't hurt the movie any. And really, I mean that. This film could NOT be hurt.There is a moment when some orphans turn into zombies and attack soldiers and museum curators (it seemed to kinda make sense at the time). Brad Dorff points a gun at Christian Slater saying he knows he is an infected orphan! Lucky for Christian he was electrocuted as a child. So he is NOT infected. This is proved to everyone's satisfaction when he shoots a zombie. Everyone gives him a hug and we learn the true meaning of Christmas. Just kidding!Christian Slater goes to his old orphanage to tell a nun his orphan mates are missing. \"It's happening again!\" she says. It is? Unless it was pre-empted by the opening narrating scroll of words I didn't see it. Or perhaps it is just to emphasize the horror of missing orphans that will turn into zombies that attack soldiers and museum curators. Oh the humanity! Then there was that weird episode when they descended into the \"well\" onto a pit of sand that was filled with slithering snake like creatures. So they all screamed a lot and danced around and shot at the sand. Of course there were some rock ledges they could have stood on to avoid the snakes, but I guess the visual of people standing on ledges to shoot snakes in sand is too much like watching people shoot fish in a barrel. Which, on something like The 700 Club would liven things up a bit. But in a horror movie... Wow. Hey and now that I have (kinda) trashed the movie I suddenly want to see it again.I think I will skip the intro tho.",

I'm just going to line item what is absolutely HILARIOUS: (spoilers, if you really care) Dorff running around ever military scene with this \"I haven't pooped in 3 days\" look. He always just seems angry, but they never explain as to why the guy is angry. Then you Tara Reid, can you think of a more hilarious idea than to put scientist gear on her and pass that 'party girl past her prime'. Garbage. But fun. And then you have the lead, Christian Slater. Probably not a winning career movie, even though I must say I would be extremely confused as to what was going on as well.I could keep going, but i'll spare you Just know that if you want to laugh at a movie that does NOTHING right, this is it.

Apparently he has, could be that he had more money to spend on assistants to help him straighten things out due to the higher budget. We will never know. What we probably will never know either is how he managed to get another 20 Million to make this movie when his previous outing were nothing short of a disaster. Yet another thing we also will never know is how he got these famous actors(C Slater, T Reid and S Dorff) involved in this one. My guess is easy money. Most of the budget probably went to bribe them into this thing.Clearly Mr Boll has near to non existent talent for film-making but probably has tons of fun at his moviola when doing his \"directing\". The only thing that probably hold his films together are the army of people working in all departments trying their absolutely best to make the best out of the situation they're in. This movie delivers nothing new story wise and it fails to deliver in pretty much all aspects. It's a no-brainer sci-fi action, no more no less. My memory of the game Alone in the dark was that it was set in a haunted house but maybe this is based on some other game. Sure it's an improvement from \"House of the dead\" but not in a long shot a good movie. When you have seen everything on this planet you could pick this up, maybe.How do you do it Mr Boll???? How?",

I really disagree with some posters here, despite his talent, really that dialog couldn't be saved.People would be a little shaken up over the events in that film, and it really takes more work to establish characters who didn't. Being an aspiring fiction-writer, the storyline pained me. Heck it reminded me of something I'd write at two AM during a 'free write' just to get the stupid out.I don't know. I liked the bit at the beginning with the rolling words, that kind of thing might've gotten a person slightly nervous. I just couldn't stop thinking of the old man, Fischer I believe his name was, that just rolled on into port with a bunch of dead bodies and blood strewn over the walls. How did that process go? Just so everyone knows, I didn't finish this. Turned it off when the surgeon guy (well the one that scanned Carnby with... something) was standing in his kitchen with his wife.

Alone in the Dark decides to make a b-movie as convoluted as it possibly can. It starts with a minute and a half opening scroll giving out a mish mash of information. Then the Christian Slater character is given a ham fisted voice over to further hand out information to the audience. There is just way too much back story going on for a movie with such a simple premise. The movie is a boring grind. At some level exploitation movies can get by with being ridiculous with sheer visceral impact (i.e. Violence and T&A). Alone in the Dark even fails at this. The action is pedestrian, uninspiring lifts from superior movies. And the sex scene could be shown on the PAX network. Not even close to being bad enough to be fun. 1 star.",

The title 'Alone in the Dark' comes from the classic game in which you were literally alone in the dark. In this film no one is alone, at least not for a substantial period of time. It seems to me that this would be an easy way to increase the suspense and atmosphere whilst remaining true to the original premise put forward by the game. Key niggles are...The whole aspect of Edward escaping the orphanage and not having the experiments on him completed after going back seems a little ludicrous given the fact that the Doc continues with his work on the Abskani after this point. That bit at the start with him shooting the guy several times not killing him, then impaling him on a little pole which does????? Oh and the fact they supposedly have hand-held torches which hurt the creatures but never use them? Why?Poor, rushed CGI makes for poor atmosphere.At no point did this film suspend my disbelief and draw me in, nor did it make me feel scared or jumpy.This film makes a pretty lame attempt at following the Hollywood formula. Two mistakes there, following the formula and not doing a good job at it. All of the standard Hollywood set pieces are there. 1. Carnby fights well, starts to lose the fight then wins just as it looks like his number is up. 2. Evil is unleashed accidentally by the greedy hired goons. 3. Only Carnby, our hero, is clued in enough to figure out what is happening and collect all of these artifacts despite the collected experience and resources of the 'unfriendly government organisation.' Oh and of course the evil genius who has the inside track on the bad guys. 4. Obligatory and completely useless sex scene which doesn't aid the plot in any way, (but does almost let us see the better side of Tara Reid). 5. One of the key good guys is turned bad to enable the bad guys to get on top to make the good guys victory look all the sweeter. 6. The good guy army is completely annihilated but our brave heroes are good enough to survive. 7. One of the heroes bravely gives his life so the two heroes with the romantic interest can survive.Did I miss anything?To summarise this film did nothing but confirm my opinion of game/movie crossovers. There is only one I have seen which surprised me, that being Resident Evil (which although wasn't great, was watchable.) My recommendation.. Avoid this and other crossovers.",

It's about being entertained for an hour and a half to two hours and we're not professional movie reviewers who comment on bad acting and how movies are made. I say this because the movie was by far not the worst movie ever made and the plot, in my opinion, was a mad man trying to unleash creatures from another dimension who destroyed some Indian tribe 10,000 years ago. He enlists the help of 20 orphans now adults to help him accomplish this. I was never confused like some reported. It was all right there to follow and having Christian Slater and Stephen Dorf to look upon was also enjoyable for this lady. The creatures were obviously computer generated because there were so many but they moved so fast that you didn't get to look too long and then criticize them. So I did not waste $5 for matin\u00e9e prices as I was indeed entertained and taken out of reality for an hour and a half. I say see movies without looking too deeply.

I learned to hate him easily through others and just how his movies appeared from the trailers, etc. but I decided that if I was truly going to comment on him and his work I'd have to sit through one of his flicks. After sitting through Alone in the Dark I have to say that I expected far worse. Plenty has been said about Uwe's talentless take on video game-based movies, but I think there's a lot worse out there than this movie. Sure the story was confusing, the plot badly paced, the acting was obviously substandard, the dialogue was just plain awful, various roles were miscast (I fully agree with masses when it comes to the truly misplaced Tara Reid) and I still believe Uwe's suffering from a massive delusion of grandeur and needs a stiff reality check...but it didn't make my eyes bleed or anything. Visual effects were so-so, MAYBE a little better than I expected, and that's the only thing even remotely close to praise that this movie's going to get from me. I quickly and easily compare it to those laughable straight-to-video/made-for-TV B-movies, it's not going to win any awards (aside from the occasional Razzie) but it just might keep you mildly entertained if you catch it for free somewhere. Try to imagine a step or two or twelve down from Resident Evil (or it's sequel) and you've got this.

Not to mention, the scene really adds nothing between the characters romance and doesn't add anything to the film. Its like the writers and directors were thinking\"Okay, Now a sex scene. okay, Now back to the story.\"The photography was horrible. Its so Generic. This movie could of greatly been boosted had it had some excellent lighting. When a film is called Alone in the Dark and parts of it are suppose to be bare of light, you can really do some clever scary stuff.There are a lot of dumb things happening here, but i'll name my favorite. When they give the guy the key and he starts opening the door(The door they tried opening) they all scream \"No, don't do it!\" only to kill him and walk inside the door. WTF!!!! Where is the logic? Who wrote this steaming pile of dung! Who consented to make this film!I don't think the film makers know what they are doing? Is this a horror movie? is this an action movie? Or is it just some product with big names attached to make money? With crap like this you'd probably make more money robbing a McDonald's.I watched this with a friend who turned to me when it was over and said \"That was pretty good.\" He's a bit retarded and likes movies like The Fast and Furious \"Cause it has cars.\" In conclusion, THIS IS A GREAT FILM if you don't think much, really don't have opinions on things, can't take a scan tron test, and are boring as hell. No offense to my friend(Who there are probably a lot of people just like him), he's good guy but he wouldn't know a good film if his life depended on it and this really proved it.",

I read some of the reviews before and I expected a very disastrous movie, but in fact, I must honestly say that it was not worse than Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Sure, the acting could be better and the characters do not develop at all, but still, some of the action effects are not bad and it's definitely not a movie you would like to find in the Bottom Top 100.Granted, it's not a good movie. Nothing you want to see more than once. Nothing you want to pay money for. Still, there's a story, a rather good soundtrack which does its job, and most honestly, the camera is pretty awesome.I give this one a 5/10. It's not a good flick, but definitely not as disastrous as some anti-Boll people pretend it to be.",

She said it was so bad she couldn't let us pay for it, even after it was explained that we only wanted to see it to see how bad it was.So anyway, we watched it.Okay, I must admit I didn't think it was THAT bad. I've certainly seen worse movies this year, (The Cave anyone?), and it was SOOOOOO much better than House Of The Dead. Captain Kirk indeed. And the much maligned text scroll that opens the movie, well it wasn't that long. And the CGI wasn't that bad. Sure it didn't make ANY sense, had no suspense, had a godawful script and crap characters but does it really deserve all the hate? Because there is a lot of hate.Methinks Uwe Boll did such a number on House Of The Dead, it's kind of bled over to Alone In The Dark, and will continue to color peoples' perception of him forever. And Ever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending him at all. It takes a special kind of director to birth such a pile of ass like H O T D. Ed Wood comes to mind. But was Alone In The Dark really that bad? Although Tara Reid WAS all kinds of wrongness times infinity. Her expression after she smacked Mr Slater in the face was priceless. I think the script called for 'Angry' (Which you'd think would've been one of the first lessons earned at acting school), but what we got was 'Constipated' crossed with 'I forgot to return my Library Book'. Stunning. Also, I must mention her line delivery. It appears that English is not her first language. Either that or she was being fed her lines via a hidden device in her ear. By a six year old.So this isn't really a review as such, which is appropriate cos' Alone In The Dark isn't really a movie as such. Yes there's noise and lights and 'dramatic' music, but that's all. Oh and a toweringly bad performance from Tara Reid (Bless). But I still didn't think it was THAT bad.Maybe because it was free.",

The ending, of which I wont speak of, beside saying that it does little but widen all of the stories inconsistencies.One of the story's only strong point is the suspense that keeps the viewers on their guard - and thats it.The acting is shallow, with characters who are unrealistic, who lack emotions, who's lines appear to have been delivered by robots and not professional - and renown actors.The special effects are good - if you can forgive the creatures' odd resemblance to the Aliens of the movie of the same name (all they lack is the head). The fight scene are entertaining, but they do not save the movie; they merely keep it from being utterly boring.3 out of 10",

BUT IT DOESN'T. the film begins with a bunch of paragraphs scrolling against a dark screen, read by some dude that is so monotonous you don't remember what you're hearing. They use that reading to substitute for the character development; for the basis of the entire movie. That's probably why you really don't care. they need to show, not tell.the movie is quite gruesome and painful to watch. so painful in fact, that the moment the movie starts you go \"why am i here???\". throughout the entire movie, i kept telling my friend \"this is the worst movie i've seen in my life\". that thought started during the first scene.when it boils down to it, the worst worst worst thing in this movie is the character development. people are going to be killed, that's inevitable, but we should CARE that they're being killed off. since we don't, and since they're terrible actors anyway, we're kind of relieved that they die. their lines suck, the plot sucks, the scenes suck, the flow sucks, the music sucked, and that is why this movie stinks.",

I didn't play the game the movie is based on, thus I am not influenced by it, but I just assume it is a cool, atmospheric one. The movie is neither, nor.The movie starts with a short sequence of a boy running from a group of soldiers. We are told that he fled from an orphanage. The nun that runs the building gave her group of 20 childes away to a government agency for demonic experiments (in the sense of the word). Quite patriotic of her, don't you think?In an instant, it is some twenty years later. The boy is a treasure hunter now (or something like that, it is never really revealed) and has to flee again. This time the villains are after an artifact that he found, that can open the door to a dark dimension full of demons. So far with the story, there isn't actually much more to it, really.The movie has all the clich\u00e9s, that a mystery thriller cannot live without: beasts, experiments on humans, unmarked helicopters, liquid-filled ammo (seems to be a new trend), mad scientists, some geek handing out cool equipment and dark places of course.The characters change their attitudes toward each other within the blink of an eye from rage to ... Now, what do you think? There MUST be a sex scene in every Hollywood-movie, right?Christian Slater: The character of Christian Slater stays shallow all the while. Did he ever express grief, compassion, fear, doubt or terror? Maybe yes, had they only shown his face close-up now and then. Okay, he has some mildly amusing scenes, but that's it. That's not enough to get in touch with a character or feel with him. Sorry, Chris, I'm sure next time you will be in the movie that brings you back! Tara Reid: Plays an archaeologist. She really looks cool in that movie, giving it an interesting look, but not much more. Her acting is sufficient. Stephen Dorff: Poor guy! He ruled in Blade and in some other cool movies. What are you doing in this dark place? Still, Stephen is the one with the most vivid character.The sidekicks are mostly cannon fodder with no given personalities. They just seem to fall and stumble through the badly written script, which does not offer possibilities for them to show that they are sophisticated human beings. If only they did it with some style, it would be easily excusable. Hint to the script writer: Just add a little tic or habit or attitude to them (adds a huge amount of life and makes us feel sorry for them, if they die).The logic in this movie seems to be beyond my intellectual abilities. Or is there none? It seems to me they put the characters together by force. Not to speak of the story threads that they introduced but never finished. Sometimes I just sat in the theater and thought: 'What the hell is this scene for?' Sometimes it's even worse than just the usual \"What, there is a monster? I think we should split up!\" And I can stand A LOT if I am at least entertained well, which wasn't the case here.The director does his job. He is not really gifted, but he can let a guy hold a camera. Wild, disturbing camera movements in the fight scenes are common nowadays, alright. So the action scenes are okay, sometimes even good, but did he ever work with actors before? Actors act and The Man makes sure, that the camera gets it. You should improve your abilities here. Just my opinion.The editor must have been living in a very dark place, too. It seems he made a pact with the script writer to ruin the story of the movie. Sometimes, when the camera fixes on a person, you think: Now it's time for the actor to show what he's paid for. Half a second later there's a cut. Huh? Humor is there too, slick one-liners and so on, but nothing memorable at all.The creature effects were quite nice in the way that the beasts flashed between visible and invisible. I liked that. The music was okay, but sometimes strained my endurance. A little more subtlety would have been better. Too bad poor Nightwish had to crown the end credits with their beautiful music. This movie ends as always nowadays, open to a sequel (hope there will be none).Summary: Don't waste your precious money on that movie! Now and then I even expressed my discontent with the movie to my neighbor, which I NEVER did before in my life! At least I didn't leave the theater. Total Time Toilet. Therefore: 3 *Watch in cinema? No Rent it? It you have nothing better to do in your life Buy it? Are you kidding?",

Having that said...I think the character of edward carnby could have been better accomplished than what it was, and I think that the spirit, the feeling, of the game wasn't truly there... I think this tries to resemble the most with the survival horror/puzzle action feeling of the AitD 4, not grasping some key stuff of the game... I think uwe boll only looked at some of the characteristics of the game like the creatures being afraid of the dark and stuff like that and translated directly to the movie, not thinking of the why it was there and the feeling of the previous aitd games and the background of edward...The acting was poor, not because of the actors I think, but mainly because of stuff like... Putting glasses in a woman doesn't make her a scientist!The story had some good points and the action sequence against the swarm of xenomes was averagly directed. I think that the worst of the story was the way it was directed... And I think that the love scene was completely misplaced/unnecessary... I think that it's one of those \"this has horror in the movie genre name so we must provide a love scene\" case.It's a movie with poor acting, some good points in the storyline, mostly bad directed, with some good ideas in the action sequences but not well conducted... I still think that the movie is watchable with friends, even with those flaws, being this a completely average movie with no inovation.Also I have a comment to make... I have seen many people bashing on Tara Reid... Sometimes when the acting isn't good or great the fault isn't solely in the actor... If we'd put Kenneth Brannagh in a role of a \"Ed wood film\" character, than I think must of us would go \"What the hell?\" and think Kenneth couldn't act to save is life, when that's an false assumption... Not because of the story, but because of the director... It's like a sports team... More than 50% is due to the coach... Also Sean Penn, that's one of today's en vogue and best actors, had the reputation of not being the best of actors, being an average actor, and with roles in movies such as \"The mystic river\" that image shifted a much higher level. I think that tara reid has room for improvement and we shouldn't bash and actor/actress in a general case... Each movie is different... Just like Silvester Stallone... His role in Rocky I and Copland were, IMHO, played well...",

            "content": "This film's main flaw is that it's terribly dull. It is not, however, an unspeakable atrocity against cinema, as some of the other posts here suggest. First, all the (relatively) nice things I can say. Uwe Boll obviously has a tremendous talent - as a producer. I'm serious, when you look at how well and how often he puts together the financing for these films, it's a miracle. Using German tax laws, he manages to put out a film a year at least. All genre films, with recognisable leads and often based on identifiable properties. I admire him immensely for this. If he just took up the producer angle full time and worked on setting up properties for other directors, he could be one of the all time great genre producers with a happening little studio, like Juilo Fernandez at Filmax. However, as a director I have some issues - he's certainly not an incompetent hack as some have suggested - the comparisons with Ed Wood in particular are inappropriate - but whilst he can put together a couple of good shots when they are all edited together the effect is underwhelming. The main flaw is that he cannot create a coherent narrative, always going for a flashy shot when something simpler may do the job better. I'd forgive this if he instead invested the film with vast amounts of atmosphere - take Lucio Fulchi, who often ballsed-up the talky scenes in favour of zooming in on actors mouths so that the camera had something to do, but at his best - Don't Torture a Duckling, One on Top of the Other, Lizard in a Woman's Skin, The Beyond and The Psychic - he could invest a film with a great morbid atmosphere, so that the whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. Lynch is another. Boll is missing this vital component .Either the narrative has to work or the atmosphere (if both, great, but one or the other will do) but here we have a film that lumbers from scene to scene to no great effect and yet fails to achieve the arcane, apocalyptic mystery that I think it's searching for.The acting is variable - Slater does Slater, which is okay and why he was hired, and he seems to be having a pretty good time. Yet with this and Mindhunters, it's two direct to DVD flicks in a month here in the UK and his career is seemingly settling into this rut, so I hope he can enjoy himself whilst he's in it - some actors, the great Michael Biehn for example, can do some fine work in the worst movies and always rise above the material, giving the brain some food regardless of the movie. Dorff seems to have quietly gone into career free fall since the period when, although not in the biggest films, looked as though he was taking exactly the roles he wanted for his own reasons - Blood and Wine, City of Industry, SFW - and getting what he could from them. Post Blade (which he was great in) he seems to be following the dollar signs a little more, but for less return. If he plays it right, in another decade he could be a great B character actor (as Cold Comfort Manor shows), but the time for super stardom has passed him. He's perfunctory here, yelling a bit when the script requires it and delivering clunky dialogue as though it makes sense, but the sense of a man enjoying his work is absent. Tara Reid is a joke. I don't dislike her, but she can't act and doesn't even take off her bra for the risible-but-necessary sex scene: why did she think she was hired? She delivers her lines as if at a read through, without grasping or attempting to impart any meaning. None of the other actors make even the vaguest impression, mainly because they don't have the screen time to build \"characters\" - in a script which isn't doing anyone any favours in this department. Some of the earlier comments make it clear that the epic crawl of information (well, the entire plot) that kicks off the film was an addition after the previews, due to audiences finding the film incomprehensible. But when you start with a 1m30s intro that highlights twists that aren't made clear until over an hour into the film, you do kill any sense of mystery.It's not worth watching to laugh at, if you want true incompetence watch Samurai Cop, which highlights why this is nowhere near as bad as some have said - the film-making is competent throughout, it just doesn't add to much. I do feel sorry for Boll and his collaborators for the kicking they have been given, but at least they got paid for doing it and they'll all get the chance to do it again. And Boll is possibly revelling in the critic-proof nature of his financing arrangements. but as I said at the top, if he wants to be admired as well as funded, he should stick to putting the deals and the packages together and let other directors have a shot at the filming.Speaking again of Fulchi, the final shot caught me as a homage to City of the Living Dead and given Boll's other references to films such as Equilibrium, this may be intentional. but where as in that film it felt like the inevitable pay off to such a grim, nihilistic film, Here it seems like an empty gesture. Fulchi was a great misanthrope, maybe Boll's just too nice a guy.",

Why this man is allowed anywhere near a movie camera or film studio simply does not make the slightest bit of sense.The one significant achievement of this movie is that it did consistently get worse at it went along, and progressively made less and less sense. Alone in the Dark is the second foray into American released film-making by Uwe Boll, and it appears he did not learn much from his first attempt. While this movie is a tad better than House of the Dead, it would be a lot like is saying a 47% is better than a 46.9%. On more than one occasion, I had to stifle my disbelief with alcohol. Even then, the movie was just terrible. Alone in the Dark is a confused film, as it tries to go into different genres. It tries to fit in action, horror, and sci-fi all into one movie, and the way that it tries to pull it off just doesn't work. The problem with the movie is not only is it too busy, but the movie isn't very exciting. The action sequences are fairly ho-hum, the sci-fi isn't anything new, and the horror is not remotely scary and the plot of Alone in the Dark is confusing in itself. The actors' performances are nothing to get excited about. Christian Slater has seen better days, and he tries to make do with the material that he has. Stephen Doriff gave a good performance, but his talent is wasted with little time in the movie. Tara Reid should also never have been cast in this movie, she is out of her depth on a few occasions, and giving her character a pair of glass's in an attempt to make her look intelligent really backfired.Uwe Boll's problem on the other hand, is not that the man receives funding to do his movies. Okay, I suppose that is a problem, but I'm not talking about it the same way that most other people will. Uwe knows what goes into making an action scene or a horror scene, yet he doesn't know what exactly makes it work.My advice?

All you have to do is ask yourself \"What would be the most stupid, clich\u00e9 & pointless thing to happen now?\" The results: Astounding accuracy.There is simply no reason to have made this movie, and no excuse for having released it. It's bad enough to base a movie on a video game, but a bad ATARI game?? The \"Contains Spoiler\" button is entirely useless for this film, since there's no story to follow, and therefore, no ending to ruin. We knew when we started it (my spouse & myself) that it was a bad movie; we tuned it in on purpose, as we were mocking & trashing movies way before MST came along. If you enjoy doing that, this is one for you!Story: Nonexistent. My guess is that they had the three writers it took to dumb it down so far each play the game. Once. Then write it down. There were VERY long expositional titles at the beginning, the reason for which I suspect is that the first scenes of the film were SO bad, they cut them all. Characters: Plastic, one-dimensional, clich\u00e9, and disposable. We're given nothing to care about, and no character to identify with. It was intended to be Christian Slater, of course, but Mr. Slater manages to conjure indifference to his characters in most movies he's made. He is also not to be forgiven for the Broadway \"The Glass Menagerie\" collusion, also in 2005 when this \"film\" was released. Mediocre to begin with, offending members of Actors Equity was not a smart career move. Tara Reid was just as dull, & no chemistry existed between her & Slater, nor anyone else. Reid, whom I've never found interesting, has hit 30, and her midriff-baring costumes and blonde hair have probably carried her as far as she's going to go. The rest of the cast, utterly forgettable & horribly directed; the only mystery is what Stephen Dorff was doing in this movie?The dividing line between Uwe Boll's scenes and those of the 1st & 2nd unit directors is the widest that I have ever seen. The unit directors turned in wretched work, and it seems like the only instruction they gave the actors in those scenes was \"Don't blink, it makes it more tense and exciting.\" Wrong!The CG effects, which one would suppose were intended to be a selling point, were clearly and nearly entirely lifted from the game. Monsters pop up in video games unexpectedly and for no reason except to shoot yourself some points. No more logic than that in the movie.This is cinematic garbage, and there is no saving grace anywhere in it. Well, there IS the fact that it eventually ends. While my spouse & I had a rollicking time trashing it, that's about all it's good for. Anyone looking for a good movie should avoid this one like the plague.",

Just ONE plot, please! Then we have to endure bad guys who can't be killed with a bullet through the heart, but CAN be killed if you make them fall on a sharp stick. We see Tara Reid trying to be a brilliant archaeologist (no, it didn't work) and her former love (Christian Slater) as an investigator of the paranormal who jumps at the slightest sound - he is constantly looking over his shoulder, yet after fighting off the hit-man-who-would-not-die, who was after something in his possession, he goes home and hits the sack - apparently the bad guys don't know where he lives, even though they knew his complete itinerary up until this point. He even fails to close his apartment door all the way. Is that supposed to be this film's equivalent of - I don't know the 'official' term for it - (foreshadowing something that doesn't happen after all, so then we relax our guard, and then it DOES happen now that we thought it wouldn't)? Because if it is, they forgot to have that something surprise us by actually HAPPENING. We then learn that the bad guys are controlled by something amazingly like the symbiote snakes from Stargate SG1. They can only be killed by direct sunlight - or by special photonic bullets used by the secret government agency that pops up to also fight the monsters. But Slater's character was controlled buy one as a child, but it was killed when he was nearly electrocuted. But the monsters can control electrical current, since they make the lights go out whenever they're around - am I the only person confused by that? Skip to the end. They open the portal to another world and the monsters can now completely take over the world. So how to close the portal again? Close the door using the same key the ancient civilization used - the same one they used to open the door minutes earlier? Nah. Too easy. Leave the door open, and blow up the room where the door is located. That should do it. Now skip to Slater's voice-over where he tells us that the portal has been closed again. But wait - now he's telling us that it looks like civilization is being destroyed by these monsters again, just like the last time. Maybe I wasn't paying attention at the part of the movie that explained how that makes any sense. Oh, no! The last scene is Slater and Reid walking down the street in a major city that was somehow completely evacuated overnight (the message at the bottom of the screen tells us so). The camera rushes up behind them - it must be one of the monsters that can't survive in the daylight - but it's 8:45 am (the on-screen message said it's so) and the sun is out - but Slater and Reid spin around to face the camera, looks of terror on their faces ... The End.Well, I suppose I DID include some spoilers despite my desire not to do so - but then again, how can you spoil something that is already so rotten that it stinks this bad?!",

            "content": "It was the worst movie i have ever seen... ever. Not only was it the hardest plot to follow the plot made no sense! I think I fell asleep in the middle of it actually. Then i woke up when i heard the sexual tension music and all of a sudden Reid and Slatter were doing it. And that scene was so random! On the case of the movie it said that Reid was Slaters ex, yet i found that very hard to believe considering IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED! And the part(s) that made me realize that renting this movie was the dumbest thing i have ever done was the first shooting scene when they all looked like people from a video game doing the story line sequence, and the part when they are in the lab after they open the door and are trying to close it, it looked like Slater had forgotten his moves or something because he runs away from the closing door, then runs back and pretends to hold it open while the Dorff \"runs\" out,(he even through in some grunts to make it sound like the door was powerful) when clearly Dorff was in no danger of getting stuck behind the closed door. I laughed. Anyway, I have seen some pretty bad movies, you know those ones that never make it into theaters they are just played on HBO in the weirdo section of On Demand. This has got to be one of the worst. All the acting and gore was just so unbelievable. Last House on the Left gets a better rating than this.I feel bad for Stepen Dorff, he was in Cold Creek Manor and that was pretty decent, then he was thrown into this mess. Well we all get a little desperate sometimes right?",

OK, what is wrong with the people who made this movie? I mean, I can't picture what they were thinking when they made this!! Seriously Uwe Boll find a day job man, stop trying to direct movies!!! I want to make sure I'm not the only one who finds the love scene between Carnby (Christian Slater) and Aline (Tara Reid) one of the most random, out of plot, non-sense and definitely non-sexy love scene since the history of time!! Also in the second shooting when they are at their house, Aline had a hand gun, nevertheless she was shooting at the same rate (or even faster) than the agents that had the ultimate prototype M4s, SHE HAD A FRICKING HAND GUN!!! And what's up with the pocket sized bombs that can blow up concrete walls, and oh that's right they can also blow up Hell, Literally!! And seriously, if there's a dead body and you are going to blow up a wall in front of it, be considerate: remove it when there's 4 seconds on the timer.... -.-! Also i must point out the bad guy of which i cannot remember his name at the moment, he was supposed to be the most powerful of them all right? he injects himself with blood from the demons, and can control them and what not, well when he's killed, he dies with a single knife thrown at his chest when it took three shots and a metal spike breaking its spinal cord to kill one of the regulars, C'MON!! Now to the ending, OK correct me if i'm wrong but the creatures weren't supposed to stay IN the DARK? the main characters are walking in the middle of the day for God sakes!!! well but i'll give one pro to this movie, the way it all ended, i mean they DESERVED TO DIE!!!!",

Throughout the entire movie, I kept getting the feeling that I was watching a cheap, poor version of Resident Evil, only no zombies.That being said, I think that the game series that this movie is based on is a good one. I also think that overall they did a pretty good job on this movie. They even scored some fairly well known actors for parts. However, even though I did somewhat enjoy this movie, I was left feeling a bit unfulfilled at the end.This is not a movie that deserves a sequel, and there is no definitive conclusion to the story at the end of the movie. I also got the feeling that the movie was rushed into production and completion. Many of the so-called \"action\" scenes, were decent, but could have been a lot better with more time and care spent into drawing the viewer into them.The basis for this movie could have produced a movie that left people gripped to their seats in terror throughout the entire adrenaline rush of the film. Instead, they made several classic mistakes. Given the story of the movie, they should have done a much more \"first season X-Files\" approach to things. Meaning simply, scare you by what you don't see, instead of what you do. Make the audience guess...\"did I really see that?\", \"did I see what I thought I saw?\", etc.The actors did an overall good job on their parts, but again, it wasn't that easy to get into the movie, because they didn't do a whole lot of character development. So, it was hard for the audience to get into \"caring for\" and \"fearing for\" the various characters in the film.Overall, I'd say this was a fun movie to watch, but it fell very short of what it could have been. It could have been a movie that made the Resident Evil series look like something for a 1st grader. Instead it came across as something that just left you wanting.",

Tara Reid is such a terrible actor I have no idea how she gets cast in anything. She was embarrassingly bad in this. It actually made me uncomfortable watching her. She is expressionless and dull.

You're not working for us anymore\" and about 10 minutes later the same character says \"What are you going to do no\". . There is no passion behind the acting, the characters don't live in the movie they are like puppets, objects, life forms ( definitively not humans ) without a soul. Also those section 713 ( is this correct, well I call them so ) people, they act like from a cheap movie where some special forces have to stop some bad guys.The effects looked like done with a 15$ animation software. Cheaply realized, there is no WOW effect when seeing those \"monsters\", actually they're in the movie for what . . . one minute. Something people fear of should be visible for at least 5 minutes.We get to know some facts by the \"voice\" and then the rest of the movie we have to figure out who who is. Some characters are mentioned for a couple of times, they're connected with others in the movie, but their story isn't built up. Only the keywords, you can call it this way, are told and the rest is up to your imagination.For the beginning . . . It would have been better that they show how those guys come to get the kids and one of them runs away, he's running, hiding, full of fear . . . and then the camera zooms in to the eyes. You hear how the kid is breathing, and then the sound changes, you hear how an older person breathes, the camera zooms out and you see this kid many years later hiding from authorities down in Peru or Chile ( wherever he was for the artifact ) running away, because he has stolen some old cultural artifact. He's also chased by some guy that works for this professor . . . . and then back to the US this chase keeps going on. Edward Carnby kills this big guy and while escaping from the scene the cops get him. Since this paranormal guys have access to many databases and see that Carnby is at the police station and they get him out, take the artifact and tell him to stay out of the paranormal things because he's not in the team anymore. Carnby's contact at the section smuggles the artifact out of the headquarters and while meeting with him, this doc get's killed . . . and so on.There is no tension in the movie, it's somehow flat, simple, dry spoken. The action scenes, if we could call them action scenes, are based on shootings. It's like in those action B-movies where you shoot everything to debris and then clean up the mess with non-existent intellectual power, mind tricks . . .Also the ending . . . I didn't get the point why this section 713 has done this to the kids. Maybe I didn't listen to the movie, but I didn't get the point of this little experiment. No, no, no . . . This movie is not even long enough to work out the story. A movie that tells such a story should be at least 130 minutes long. How would The lord of the rings look like if the story was told in 90 minutes? I think it would look bad.Aynway, Alone in the Dark is a movie that should be screened in movie classes so people can learn out of the mistakes that have been done here. Upcoming actors, directors, FX people, etc, should see how their future projects shouldn't look like. At lest something positive about the movie.",

If you've seen the commercials for this film they clearly show alieanesque creatures popping up behind a security guard and stabbing him through the head. And I promise you this movie delivers exactly what it promises -- Gratuitus violence that you do not have to think about.The evil creatures are cool looking but unoriginal. The machine gun fights and gore are fun. Seeing Slater on the big screen was a great treat for me and all my girlfriends. Although we were wondering why a guy would go to all the trouble of taking off his belt before bed if he wasn't going to take off the pants too. Sorry, no nudity in this film for either gender to enjoy. Slater does a decent job portraying a character you might expected to see on X-files. But Tara Reid really stinks up the screen. Her lines are delivered flat and quiet. I would have preferred her character to simply not exist; after all, I would think that Slater's character would be more well rounded if he was not only the action-hero but also the geeky archaeologist (an Indiana Jones for the new millennium).If you ever watch the made for TV movies on Space Channel or Spike I think you'll enjoy this movie because it's definitely a step up from them. Some of the camera shots swing a little wide and the fly-by on the car driving across the bridge is just hilarious -- the camera is actually bobbing up and down. It's obviously a lower budget flick. I would recommend going to see this one in the dollar theaters.If you go to this film just sit back, relax, enjoy the firefights and laugh at some of the goofy plot twists.

I remember jumping out of my chair as what looked like a five year-old's finger painting, supposed to be a zombie, crawled across the screen toward my character. It proves that scariness isn't accomplished by simply having high-end graphics and state of the art effects. Other than the first fight scene and the ending city shot, the film has little merit. Slater's performance I have to admit was decent considering the atrocious script, but usually he's better when he has other bigger names to help him along. However, what few genuine moments that start to creep through are snuffed out by Tara Reid's lines. I can't really blame the actors for the demise; the film was obviously poorly planed, poorly directed, and had no resemblance of the fright of the original story. The one actor that deserves a salute for climbing atop the crud heap of a film is Stephen Dorff. But even if you put Al Pacino in a Ed Wood film, you still have a Ed Wood film.",

Especially, don't miss the love scene - it's oddly cut with no reason, so the more little emotion that could have been felt is killed in the egg. Every monster's appearance is a copy-paste of Alien.

The dialogue by the actors was good at times & pathetic at times (especially Tara Reid's), & the special effects ( especially the bullet going through the block of ice) was amazing.

            "content": "'Alone in the dark', such an appropriate title. Because that is exactly where you will find yourself if you attempt to rent this movie with friends. The film was directed (and misdirected) by German director, Uwe Boll. With only one previous film under his belt, 'Doctor Boll' has become infamous for creating 2003's outrageously bad video game adaptation 'House of the dead'. Well in January 2005 the mad scientist of video game movies struck again with 'Alone in the dark'. Brace yourselves.'Alone in the dark' was loosely adapted from the popular Atari video game of the same name. But whatever made the game popular was apparently not present in the movie.The movie is ghastly bad. It opens with a 'Star Wars' like white-text-on-black-background scroll that seems to be setting up the story. Except it goes on, and on, for ten incomprehensible paragraphs. And then, as if Boll thinks his audiences don't read, it is seemingly narrated by an over-enthused radio deejay turning the introduction into an ultimately confusing waste of time. After the scroll has mercilessly concluded we are launched into a prologue set 22 years earlier in an orphanage where a child is being chased through the woods.Finally we make it to the present day where there is a world of darkness beyond ours filled with monsters that wiped out an entire civilization called \"the Abkani\". A government agency known as 713 must defeat the remainder of the monsters before they destroy mankind. The main character Edward (Christian Slater), who was once apart of this agency, is a \"paranormal investigator\" (wtf?) trying to solve the mystery of his orphaned childhood. There is also a sub-plot involving mind-controlling parasites if you can believe it.The mysteriousness of the plot is further added to by the arrival of party girl Tara Reid, outrageously miscast as an archaeologist. Her character, Aline was apparently a former lover of Edwards and, as if every clich\u00e9 imaginable hasn't already been used, greets Edward with a punch in the face and \"I thought you were dead a-hole\".The production quality of this movie is average. The fight scenes appear to have been choreographed by a Kung Fu master and Boll has overused the slow motion matrix-like effect. The wardrobe looks as though a hip-hop video will start at any second. Some of the actors appear to have not learned their lines properly and stumble during simple word exchanges. Reid clearly doesn't know the meaning of any of the four syllable science words she has to say and gives a very unconvincing performance as a smart person. Throughout the beginning of the movie her portrayal of an archaeologist includes wearing glasses and scribbling nonsense on a clipboard when she's not even working on anything. I couldn't help a silent chuckle as her character said \"I need to analyze these artifacts some more\".The dialogue is even worse. Slater has countless cryptic lines about his fear of the dark including \"being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive\" and \"There's a price to pay for bringing darkness into the light\". All the while Reid sounds like she's reading movie taglines uttering, \"Some doors are meant to stay shut\". Every line read by everyone else is intended to deliver a new piece of vital information. No character development. No plot development. No good.The acting, or lack of it, may be worthy of 'the Days of our lives'. All the actors appear as if they're embarrassed to be there. The CGI monsters give a more convincing performance then most of the cast.Behind the scenes doesn't look much better either. Partnered up with screenwriter Elan Matsai (who might I add also wrote a movie called MVP2: Most Vertical Primate), Boll has managed to create the worst film of the decade. That is the only accomplishment here. Now all the other bad film makers can be proud that they didn't make 'Alone in the dark'.It's hard to find a film that is so inept on almost every level. Production quality, editing, the musical score, acting, even the extras seem to have been chosen for their background incompetence.On the bright side, this movie could have been really very good had there been some acknowledgement in the opening scroll that the whole thing was meant to be a joke. But it isn't. Doctor Boll is serious. So take a look around while watching 'Alone in the dark', because you may just find yourself alone in the theater as well.",

Atari done a wrong choice for the filmmakers because \"Alone in the dark\" would have been a cooler movie with the direction of Guillermo Del Toro or another director of your choice that has the habit to work in dark atmospheres...I don't know what's the exact mood brought by the game but Uwe Boll had given that movie a Goth-Metal/Matrix imprint... So I can't give a vote less than 6 because with groups like Nightwish, In Flames and so on for the soundtrack, the \"Dark mood\" is well rendered and also if I didn't played the other chapters of the game, this movie is quite enjoyable...(maybe my neighbors, the Germans, liked it too much just only for their musical products included in this project (they are so proud of everything that is marked \"made in Germany\" and the German metal is the daily soundtrack in Germany)",

Don't take my word for it; read the interview with LucasArts President, Jim Ward, in the March issue of Game Informer. Ward and LucasArts are emulating Uwe's strategy. Uwe understands that when a contemporary video game franchise sells thirty-five million copies the marketing inertia for a cinematic tie-in is enormous. Revenue potential eclipses the current Hollywood trend to revive nostalgic comic book superheroes of the baby-boom generation.Of course, to be successful the movie must be entertaining and ALONE IN THE DARK is! Protagonist Edward Carnby, played by Christian Slater, must unravel the mystery of an evil parallel universe sealed by an ancient Indian tribe. Along the way he discovers the secrets of the orphanage he was raised in as he deciphers the clues that lead him to his true identity. Christian's performance is superb. His subdued, laid back demeanor is a canvas for the melodramatic chaos that engulfs him. Edward's love interest, a museum caretaker played by Tara Reid, is his constant companion, providing a steady supply of eye candy for the male audience. Tara treats us to a competent performance without overacting. The two stars complement each other with a believable chemistry that comes to a head during a sexual encounter that is at once intimate and sensual. I hope this relationship will continue to develop in a future sequel. Nothing is sexier than Tara in jeans blowing away the evil dominions! ALONE IN THE DARK is not a perfect film. The special effects are top tier while the gore factor is over the top. I understand this is a subjective evaluation and that too much for some may not be enough for others. In my opinion less is more. Repetition diminishes the shock value of outrageous violence. When a head is split in half the emotional impact is unnerving. When the same head is shown a few minutes later it feels like the filmmaker wants props for doing such a good job. Some scenes are overloaded with stroboscopic lighting that diminishes the perception of high production values, while running the risk of inducing headaches.As I watched ALONE IN THE DARK I paid attention to audience reactions. I was sitting near some teenage girls who were gasping, shrieking, and taking turns hiding their eyes as girlfriends encouraged each other to look. At the same time a group of boys that had entered the theater together and were sitting directly behind me were laughing spontaneously. Diametrically opposed reactions with a common denominator: Everyone was having fun! Uwe Boll has his detractors, as every artist who pushes the envelope does. However, I don't know of any films any of them have made. I do know that some of the best actors and actresses in the business (including an Oscar winner) are clamoring to be involved in an Uwe Boll project. Uwe's got big balls and he's not afraid to tell it like it is. He's going to make a lot of money and entertain a lot of people along the way. I expect big things from this filmmaker and I anticipate he will deliver and, am looking forward to BLOODRAYNE, HUNTER THE RECKONING, FAR CRY, and list goes on ...",

The first game was about the first supernatural adventure of Edward Carnby, a private investigator who was going broke in a hurry.

Turns out the house was infested with demons because it was built by an evil sea captain who performed unholy rituals in an attempt to become immortal. Carnby purges the house of monsters and escapes. Despite the games very base graphics, the plot did a lot to turn polygraphic figures into unsettling monsters.The series apparently was a hit, because it branched off into two more games. \"Alone In The Dark 2\" had a less interesting plot, created with more fighting to appeal to the shoot-em-up gamers. This time a bunch of pirates, made immortal by voodoo, kidnapped a girl to suck the life out of her to maintain their life. Carnby was called in to save her. \"Alone In The Dark 3\" went back to the game's roots, balancing fighting with puzzle solving and a good plot. Carnby was called in for the last time to find out what happened to a film crew shooting a westner in a ghost town. He finds out that they awakened the spirits of undead bandits, who were seeking to use some sort of explosive mineral they found during their lifetime to destroy part of the California coast.The series was left for dead for a long time. Then I-motion tried to get back into the software game by producing \"Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare\". But the plot changed, drastically. Originally set in the late '20's, early '30's, the scene was now present day. The original private eye Carnby, a man in his mid 30's, was replaced with this hot shot pseudo-secret agent type. The plot was okay, though it had some anti-Judeo Christian theme to it. The new Carnby went to a New England manor called \"Shadow Island\" to find out who killed a friend of his. He finds out that an anthropologist had gone insane and was performing Native American rituals to open a doorway to let supernatural, subterranean monsters run free all over the Earth.The new game was a really bad maligning of the old plot. And this movie couldn't even do the new game justice. The heroes were never really \"alone\", since they had a freakin' army with them. There were entirely too many people in this movie; it was less a horror movie and more some kind of sci fi flick, and not a good one. The acting was hackneyed, the effects overblown, the scares predictable. It was like a bad version of \"Aliens\". All in all, the movie was mediocre as a standalone movie and an utter bomb as a decent cinematic reproduction of \"Alone In The Dark\".",

Her acting was awful, almost laughable. She tried to play a scientific type role, including wearing a pair of geeky black rimmed glasses, but she ended up looking like she belonged an a high school drama club rendition of some bad Broadway musical.Christian Slater was no better and what was with the long suede jacket? Please give me a break! His acting was somewhat better than Reid but overall he stunk too. I think it's time to hang up his acting career and he best find a different job, because in this movie he seemed old and washed out.The movie just kept going on and on with no understandable, logical story line, or should say they didn't stick to one discernible story line through out the movie, they just kept flipping or shuffling from plot to plot all with different goals? Does that make any sense? NO? I didn't think so, but that is exactly what happened in the movie. Maybe you will be able to figure it out for yourself.",

While it lost some of the campiness of House of the Dead, Boll's style and personality still shows through in AitD. Boll is the King of Video Game Movies.Boll treats AitD with a tenderness not generally found in movies of this genre. While other movies based on games are often very tongue-in-cheek, Boll takes his work very seriously (though he maintains a sense of humour.) Fans of House of the Dead will be happy to see that AitD had more budget to work with. The special effects are on par with most horror movies these days, and there are recognizable actors in the cast (Christian Slater, Tara Reid, et al.) It's really nice to see Boll shine when he is given more space to move in.The movie had some great action sequences featuring motion-activated gattling guns and helicopters. It is very obvious that to Boll action should be fast-paced and include lots of bullets, and I agree.I'm tired of all these 'serious' horror movies that feature some single mom and her kid being chased around by barely visible ghosts. I don't want to watch The Ring being ripped off over and over again. I want to sit back and watch guys shoot the holy hell out of big scary things that are ripping them apart. I want giant explosions and helicopters. Uwe Boll gives me what I want every time, and I adore him for it. God Bless you, Herr Boll.",

This is my first review, so I might not be perfect at it, so forgive me if this review isn't good.Alone in the Dark is one of my favorite movies. I'm a big Christian Slater fan, and this is my favorite one of his movies. I will never understand why this movie is considered one of the worst of all time.I've never played any of the Alone in the Dark games, so I wasn't really expecting anything when I saw this movie. When I did watch it, I had a great time, and loved it so much that I got it on dvd for Christmas.One thing that a lot of people complain about is the acting in the movie, but I thought that all of the acting (aside from Tara Reid's) was passable. Maybe I've just seen acting so much worse that my bad acting detector stopped working properly.The action sequences in the movie might not be the best of all time, but they're still fun to watch. I understand that the video games are not action packed, but like I said, I've never played the games, so I don't really mind. The action in this movie isn't bad in my opinion, and is very entertaining.The monsters, while they are Xenomorph rip-offs, are pretty awesome. They look really cool, and are pretty menacing. They aren't as cool as Xenomorphs, but they're still pretty cool.My only complaint about this movie is Tara Reid's performance. It isn't the worst that I've seen, but it wasn't the best either. It doesn't ruin the movie for me, but it is the only thing that I don't like about the movie.Alone in the Dark is a movie that I think everyone should watch at least once. Don't go in with high expectations, and you'll have a good time. I give Alone in the Dark a perfect 10/10.",

After helming the appalling 'House of the Dead' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys get it? To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets. Avoid at all costs.",

Be warned.After reading some of the reviews/ previews of this film I was set up for it being completely rubbish, and went in expecting it to be complete rubbish, and was therefore pleasantly surprised when it was just plain bad.OK the plot what there is of it is cobbled together from bits of the Back-story of Alone in the Dark 4 (to all those who were wondering where 713 and the Abkani came from that would be where as far as I can remember). This would not be such a bad thing if it wasn't hashed to gather in such a bad way, once you work out what the plot is about it is acutely quite good. It just gets a little lost, mostly through the bad dialogue and directing.The Acting is up to the standard of eastenders (soap opera for thus who don't know what it is), not completely wooden but half of them were supposed to be Zombies. The actors do nothing to bring their characters to life, they just seem like peses being moved around the set by the cretin of a director, at the end Steven Dorf's character Gallantly scarifies himself to save the others, although instead of the oh how heroic to face certain death to save his friends reaction that it should have gotten it was, more what's he doing? Why didn't they just put the bomb on a timer in the first place? And where did all the people go at the end? Pleas don't make a sequel.The Action sequences (I'll get on to why on earth this film had action sequences later) were incredibly bad, the fight at the begging between Edward and the Zombie dude was so badly filmed/ edited, the scenes were over exposed, jerky, and cut together so fast you had no idea what was going on and if you tired to follow it you got a hernia. (One minor fob with this sequence: When Eddy shoots the Zombie he fires one round, when you get the Matrix slow (yes they used Matrix slowmo's) the ice shatters just before the bullet passes through it. OK so I am being really picky.) A later sequence where the 713 agents are in a gun battle with Zombies and I think one of the creatures is so dark you ant make out what is supposed to be happening, and moist of the scene is just badly framed shots of people shooting guns with really OTT badly ked CG mussel flairs.This was surprised to be a horror/ thriller, it isn't. You can tell this by the presents of a car chance, who in their right mind puts a car chance in a horror film. Also my opinion it's not relay that scary when the good gives have rail guns. It doesn't really build up suspense very well, mostly because that would require it making sense. OK keeping the viewer in the dark (forgive the pun) is what makes a good thriller but what is tolled needs to make sense, and possibly not give in the form of mini essay on the backstay, which really should have been expanded up on more.After saying all that the first half dose a passable impression of being an alright horror/ thriller, but the second half dose far to good an impression of a B rated action flick, which really dose spoil it.Some of the CG was done quite well though, I really liked the affect when Eddy shoots the monster with the light resin (where the hell did that come from, they could have at least thought of a plausible explanation for that) the affect was nice, although in my opinion it went down far to easily. The monsters themselves did seem reminiscent of Alone in the Dark 4's monsters, although thy were part plant (don't ask me).All in all it could have been good, the plot when it maid sense, and I needed a piece of paper and post its to make it make sense, was good and had potential.In fact that is my main opinion of this film it had so match potential, it just didn't live up to it. In my opinion Uewi Biol should be hung drawn and quartered.Really don't pay good money to see it but if it comes round on TV then its worth a look, if just to laugh at how bad the acting is.",

These sequences are with U.S. special agents and helicopters involved. This is exaggerate and it offends true game fans! Also, there aren't neither Alan nor Obed Morton!

Really bad.The story is very confusing and you can see how Uwe and his crew tried to fix that part by throwing in a long text roll in the beginning. Here, of course, you get to know the basic story which is incredibly lame. Some mad evil guy who experiments with orphans... blah blah. Another big problem is how the movie is nothing like you expect it to be. You might think it's a horror film, but Uwe Boll has filled this film with over-the-top and out of place special effects. I'll give you an example. The beginning of the film is PACKED with slow-motion sequences which are very unnecessary, in one sequence the bad guy who chases Edward pushes and old man who slightly stumbles, all in slow motion. The rest of the film is filled with scenes where the weird agency who investigates electro-magnetic pulses fights off hordes of weird scorpion monsters which are an incredible rip-off of Alien. The monsters look like the monster from Alien, which is called a Xenomorph. But in this film the monsters are called Xenoms. Wow, the difference is huge.Also, I have never seen a movie with less developed characters. Seriously, all you get to know about anyone is the fact that Edward grew up in an orphanage. Otherwise you basically get a name, I can remember three or four characters, even though I know nothing about them, which really made me uninterested if they would meet their fate. Casting Tara Reid as a scientist is the weirdest decision ever.2/10",

If all the pieces fell into place, it could have been a good movie. So what happened? Uwe Boll.I think he is trying so hard to make the movie cool, and you can see that in his attempt to put in \"cool\" action sequences. His use of tracers on the guns (bullet that lights up so you see where you shoot) is pretty amazing. Not amazing in a good way, but he even uses it in a pistol. I'm sure if they were shooting with paint-ball guns in this movie, he'd still use tracers.The acting, story and dialog is very weak, the intro has a bunch of text being read by some man and it seems to take forever to go through it. The first few minutes of the movie tries to give you all sorts of information, but it's so false and stupid I actually wondered how these actors could agree to do this flick. The movie also has lots and lots of flaws, it's just too much to get into, but it's all there. Unfortunately for Tara Reid, she is the worst actor in this movie, she's good looking but it seems she's just there to have a girl in the picture, she doesn't say much so she's just along for the ride.I would also like to give my award to this movie for the worst sex scene in history of movies. It came out of nowhere and did nothing for the characters, they just continued like nothing ever happened. The chemistry between Slater and Reid's characters is so bad they could have removed one character and you'd never know. Even if Slater were carrying a skull instead of Tara Reid, you'd never know.Then there is the sound and music, I'm pretty sure I've heard the music somewhere before and the sounds are somewhat boring. A few times it does pretty well, but most of the time it's just boring and doesn't work.Uwe Boll's \"House of the dead\" tried to be creative and maybe even tried to bring something new to this genre of movies, it failed. \"Alone in the Dark\" is basically \"House of the dead\" with other actors and different setting. If you compare both of them, you'll see that they are very similar, and the ending really shows just that. I really hope this isn't a standard ending in his movies, it might be his message to the world: \"The evil won't stop\" which can also mean \"I won't stop\" - which to me, is even worse than having monsters and zombies running around the streets.",

What was the budget on it? 20 million? Can you believe someone shelled out money for this? Well, sure they did. And I'm sure in the end, it made it's money. Whether watching the 5 minute opening crawl, or Christian Slater dragging around a dazed and confused Tara Reid, you cannot help but love this movie's sheer audacity for lunacy. This movie is likely to live on forever, as a cult hit. It's kinda like Plan 9 without the heart. Fun for all. I recommend it for the young. I recommend for the old. Alone in the Dark is...well, a movie.",

Firstly the strongest point of this movie is how well the script is bind together.The characters have their backgrounds explained extremely well and have their motive are perfectly explained.Stereotype characters like the hot-female-archaeologist and the not-wearing-armor-commando simply do no exist in this movie!!Everything is original and fresh and i am sure it will set the benchmark for all scriptwriters to follow.Academy award nominee for sure. Also the action scenes are rewriting the way the action movie genre should be made.In 1999 the Matrix came and shows as the slow-motion effects and extreme gunfight and kung-fu fight.Now in 2004 A.I.T.D. show how fighting scenes should be made using advanced slow-mo effects combined with first-year karate school class fighting.Also gun-fighting using rapidly cut-scenes so you wont understand what is happening gives more to the atmosphere of lostness in the movie.And i wont forget to note to the originality of this movies monsters (It is know that the Aliens movie that is coming out next year would steal the look of the monsters but Uwe Boll would be suing them don't worry fans!)Also by giving the special effects of the monsters a \"crappy\" and with \"bad-motion\" style makes the movie looks like some 70s classic movie where the special effects just appeared(Star wars!)This fact make this movie appear in the top sci-fi movies of all time among with the action ones.There are more to notice like the original movie scope and flawless movie pace that doesn't make you sleep but i rather watch this movie again that commenting on it.Uwe Bollyou changed my life with this movie.I want to be a filmmaker like you...Enjoy it",

If it was I'm glad I never heard of it or played it, because this movie was a complete turd burger. The movie deals with Alien B SQUAD(alien designs that i think that were based of the guys art the the Aliens were based off of). They live deep underground and had been let out through a portal long ago by an ancient race. Fast forward to the future and some evil crazy scientist finds out and some how splices their genes in some orphaned children. They grow up and one of them happens to grow up to be Christian Slatter, who must have been desperate or bored cause it sure looks it. He used to ironically work for this evil type scientist and a super secret government agency that monitors the Alien B SQUAD who can't be seen in the dark. only if light is shined on them. For a added twist or just bad writing(i believe the later) his on again off again girl friend happens to be working for the evil type scientist as they collect artifacts from the acnient people the Alien B SQUAD destroyed.IF it sounds confused and way convoluted it is. Non of it makes any sense really past it's basic plot. The acting, what's there, is bad. The special effects are laughable and the aliens arn't that impressive. They almost look like the demon dogs from Ghost Busters except a bit bigger and a little uglier. And for added stinkage wait for the pathetic love scene that comes out of no where with Slatter and the female lead. Both me and my brother who went to see it just went \"Huh?\" If you want to see a movie that doesn't make much sense go for it. But there are way better things you can do alone in the dark.",

Stephen Dorff who I've always liked was very disappointing. Worst of all is the direction of the movie. For some reason, the movie can't decide whether or not it wants to be an action thriller, a haunted house movie, an Alien-ripoff or an Indiana-Jones-flavoured film. And it seems to focus a lot on the extra characters who've never been properly introduced. At the end, when the extra characters die, we never really feel a thing for them. The monster effects were adequate but unimpressive. The ending made absolutely no sense. Please do not watch this movie. Two hours of your life depends on it.",

Now the only thing we see in the theater is Christian Slater running around like the incredible talentless actor he is with no real purpose at all. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is hopeless and the entire motion picture is a disgrace to any theater with just a little self respect.The only thing i see brought from the games are the names of some of the characters.

That being said, this movie was 96 minutes of pure unadulterated trite drivel.The three \"Stars\" of this film, Slater, Reid & Dorff seem to have no connection to their characters what so ever, it's as if they are walking clich\u00e9s. They would have been better off wearing name-tags throughout the movie stating, \"Hi, I'm a grown man with a tortured past\", \"Hi, I'm cute Archaeologist that can read 10,000 year old hieroglyphs like it was plain English\", \"Hi, I'm Stephen Dorff, and the only emotions I know how to play are anger and rage\". By the way, those were the \"Spoilers\", yea, this movie is \"Deep\"! To sum all this up, I think if Hollywood is going to make anymore movies based on video games, they should look into games with better story lines, or potential.

Well, that's probably the only thing correct for the whole film. You've probably heard numerous people say it was THAT bad... and how much I'd like to tell you it's 'not that bad'... sorry... it is...Christian Slater frolics around looking gloomy with a strangely misplaced buckle on his coat. Tara Reid is of as much importance as a 'number 10'-button on a cellular phone. To be quite honest, one of the only bright spots was Stephen Dorff, who seems to be wanting to make the best out of it. Yet his lines are dull, his character is dull and his screen time is dull.Well so much for the actors. Now the 'battle'-scenes. The strange 'music video'-look of the battle was one that made my toes curl. The combination of shorts shots and metal, happily causes epilepsy, but is above all: USELESS. These action sequences add as much as a nipple twist on Normandy Beach. It actually just makes you want to see the next scene, before you start foaming your mouth and imitating Old Yeller.Off course, as soon as you see the text crawl at the beginning, you're in for a good laugh. The 'plot' is one of the most horrible ones I've ever heard of. There's is no structure, no twists, just a lot of running and screaming an silly extra's from dawn of the Dead (1978).The continuity was simply retarded, the special effects were okay, but seen before, not inventive and way too dark(Yes, Alone in the Dark, I get it).The truth is, there is almost nothing good about this film, yet I will gladly award it 2/10.

I a tempted to think that, perhaps, this script was written, in bits and parts, by different people who never met, and them kinda band-aided together to see just how wrecthed a product they could make.

I remember the movie lasting barely two weeks at the box office, and getting a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.com. After listening to my friend's rambling about how this was the worst movie ever made, that the director Uwe Boll needed to be be loaded as cargo on a kamikaze plane, I decided to stay clear of it entirely.Well, by some funny accident, I saw it anyway. I rented Shaun of the Dead last night and found a DVD for Alone in the Dark sitting snugly in its place with \"Haha, LOSER,\" written across disk instead. I figured that since this would probably be the only time I would ever be able to see it, because I would have never rented it on my own time.I must admit that having extremely low expectations had something to do with it, but I didn't find this movie to be nearly as bad as most people said it was. Sure folks, it's bad, maybe even Razzie worthy, but it had enough style to stay entertaining. The movie opens up with some painfully slow text that moves up the screen, spoon-feeding you the plot within 60 seconds. One thing to note is that this was actually a bit of a bonus, because without it the actual movie would have been too confusing to stand. The action sets in fast enough, and our main hero does battle with some random character who's role isn't even made clear until HALFWAY through the film. That's the major weakness of Alone in the Dark. The plot and story telling isn't exactly solid gold, it's more like rusted copper. The movie is inept, confusing, hard to follow for the first 30 minutes. There are a lot of things that could have made it much better. A different style of editing, better music, and some proper research on military tactics and protocol could have really done wonders for the whole project.As far as acting, the only thing it has going for it is Christian Slater, who pulls off a great performance. The rest of the cast is mediocre at best, and the line delivery is sometimes clumsy enough to land most of them in a special education school.The score is about twice as messy as the script for the film. It's horrible, and the guy who composed it should be doing music for elevators. The action that goes with it is some of the most stylish and entertaining I've seen, but a lot of it is pointless, and just isn't a part of the story. The monsters themselves are extremely cool, and for the first time since The Lost World we're reminded that shading and atmosphere are just as important as the CGI itself. It's damn good, and the creatures look realistic enough to be put in a zoo.On that note, there's enough in Alone in the Dark for me to enjoy it at least, but it's a mess of mindless action, horrid writing and some of worst music I've heard in a long time.4/10 stars",

Regardless of the extremely poor acting (characters express emotion by moving their eyebrows up and down) and bad lines; regardless of the ridiculous slow motion scenes that made the audience fall of their chairs laughing; regardless of poor animation, plot, concept and non-originality; the movie plays out just like one of those childhood fantasies.You get the feel that only Boll knows exactly what is going on; everyone else is led in a whirlwind of nonsensical crap. OK, so the Abkani are an ancient civilization and were wiped off the face of the planet. OK, now we've found out that this guy was an orphan. Wait, what was the deal with that old guy and the mutinous crew? Oh, a bloodthirsty creature escaped? Wait, it's afraid of light? Huh? Also worth mentioning, there is a major blooper in the end that is so glaring you wonder how anyone, even Boll, missed it; the creatures, which are said to avoid daylight as \"prolonged exposure to sunlight is lethal\"; the creatures are shown shying away from even gun-mounted flashlights. However, in the ending scene, which is set in bright sunlight, the protagonists are rushed and killed by a creature. Wait, what's that about exposure to sunlight?

(If it starts to look like a can of red paint exploded, or looks like someone cleverly painted *blood* on a scene you have gone overboard) 2: The use of useless and or random sex scenes. (I personally think that a good movie doesn't need this, and if a movie really needs to have one of these scenes then it should be classified as porn) 3: Horrible continuity problems. Please check your films carefully after filming. In Alone in the Dark the sand worm scene when the lady was killed by the sandworms and left to die just before the last person leaves you see her start to get up. Hello, didn't she just die? Oh and watch that the script matches the movie. The last scene when Christian Slater says \"The gate had finally been closed\" Umm it was blown up, not closed. I could honestly keep telling you what you need to check before sending the film to print, but I think others will have their say soon enough.

It should be possible to make a good movie out of the original story, but it seems they never tried, and found out how to make a sci-fi horror movie which spreads horror itself.My biggest horror was sitting out this movie. I showered myself for hours after seeing this movie, as if I was raped through my eyes. I tried to find out if this form of publishing can not be seen as an act of violence, but I fear they have their lawyers ready.This movie should be banned from shops at once and destroyed without any trace or we will feel ashamed forever.Think about our children and do the right thing.",

You might be tempted to watch on, thinking innocently that no screenwriter over age 11 would write something this formulaic. And, after all, Christian Slater's in it, and he wouldn't star in it if it was a total stinker, would he? You'd be wrong.I will devote the rest of this post to making sure you don't even waste even a second of your time (not to mention the $4 charge at Blockbuster) watching this misbegotten train wreck of a movie. Look at it this way: I suffered thorough it to spare you, my dear reader. You may thank me later.This movie manages to make even the rock-bottom standards for any movie based on a video game seem set, by comparison, impossibly high. I've never played \"Alone in the Dark,\" but I can only hope that the plot, acting and special effects are better than the movie version. The only thing that doesn't fall short of expectations is Tara Reid. I don't mean that in a good way.There's no camp value or unintentional humor to redeem it -- unless you count the grim fascination of seeing the once-promising Christian Slater at the absolute nadir of his acting career. The closest parallel I can think of is Courtney Love, who at least lifts her shirt every now and then to justify her existence.If you want scary, rent the far superior straight-to-video \"Dead Birds\".

As I was watching I just kept thinking, I should have just been happy that I liked the game, and not wasted my time watching the movie. There were only a couple vague similarities between the game and the movie. They mostly reside in the character name Edward Carnby. In the game the owner of the mansion, which you never saw in the movie, had opened a hell mouth and hellish beings were crossing into our plane and into his house. He was killed by the beings, but not before he was able to get a hold of one of the two investigators you could play as. When the game started you began in the attic of the old manor. and had to work your way out past ghosts, hell hounds, winged demons, and a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of other hellish creatures.

I know that Silent's Hill director was a fanatic of S H, that was one of the main reasons to hire him. What I really wanna know is if this Uwe Boll is familiarized with games, as far as I'm concerned he made 3 movies based on video games, I didn't watch Blood Rayne yet, are the developers of the games not watching the movies or what?,maybe he's a cool gamer but as a director sucks big time, he doesn't know how to end a scene, his endless totally senseless scenes are really boring.

I would rather have they make this one over, and place the setting in the start or middle of the 20th century, in the mansion where it all takes place in the game, so that the movie for a twist actually might become true towards its original source. Otherwise Toybox made fine effects. The SFX were OK, but the soundtracks were really bad. Only great part musically is at the end of the movie. So you'll be looking forward to the end of the movie.

Not being aware that there was a preexisting video game of the same name probably didn't help this viewer, as a slight 'heads-up' in terms of proposed intentions might have assisted in making some sense of this garbled train wreck of a film, but even that remains dubious.Christian Slater phones-in one of his better phoned-in performances, Tara Reid almost outperforms a novice porn actress in terms of line-delivery, and Stephen Dorff is, well, just too small a man to fill the character assigned to him. In fact, every aspect of this contrivance is conspicuously scaled-down. The actors seem diminutive not only in performance ability, but in actual physical stature. Slater seems small in his leather duster, Reid resembles a tweenage shopper at the Monster Mall, and Stephen Dorff is.... well, Stephen Dorff. Having seen 'Cecil B. Demented' one can hardly shake the image of him as a mini megalomaniacal director - and his attempts in 'Alone' at being a grizzled Squad Leader fall short. Pun intended. Even the monsters are smaller and less-capable as they alternate from terrifying, omnipotent uber-menaces to clumsy, dog-like henchmen from scene to scene.Unlike similar disjointed efforts that can provoke laughs because of preposterousness, this one only provokes groans. From the Magna Carta-sized screen text at the beginning, to the Hessian Aggression Heavy Metal end theme, this film-making team should be chastised for not having donated their budget to a charitable foundation instead of releasing this annoying spectacle.",

I also think that the Alone in the Dark story and world makes for a perfect Horror/Thriller/Detective movie, but don't be fooled by the genre label. We are presented with a story that I think is appropriate and interesting, but it's presented in such a bad way that you after a while has forgotten all about the story and instead wonder if you are watching a bad music video. Or maybe a children's cartoon, due to the childish comments that sometimes is made when trying to advance the plot.At one point in the movie we are also presented with a soft sex scene, which doesn't add anything to the movie, instead it's increasing the feeling that we are watching a long and bad music video.The director seams to have added the music from his own personal favorite collection without any thought of that the music should at least add to the atmosphere of the movie. But instead of scary music that adds to the tension and excitement, which should have been an element in an Alone in the Dark movie, we have to listen to cool hard rock while our invincible superhero is blasting his way through the hordes of evil monsters that is after him. Although I like the music, it totally destroys any tiny bit of atmosphere that might have been there.And what I have already briefly mentioned is that our hero, Edward Carnby, is engaged in open combat instead of trying to build up a good horror tension. A feeling of where you don't know what are out in the dark trying to get you, like in the video games, which had us all on our heels while we played them. No, Edward is never alone in the dark in this movie.The whole experience makes me wonder if the director has even played at least one Alone in the Dark game for at least five minutes. It more feels like his been disappointed by that he hasn't been chosen to make a Blade movie, and wants to show the world that he could have made a Blade movie (which isn't much to brag about), or if he has had any education in storytelling at all.I'm so disappointed in this movie that I had to sign up here, vote, and make my first review.

(Cause normally when you let creatures of the underworld out, the person doing it is expecting power of some sort) The friggin psychotic doctor or whoever he was (already I am forgetting them...thank god) injects himself with the blood of one of the creatures and from what I saw, gained nothing! Well, except that the creatures didn't go off and kill him. But other than that, nothing. He didn't seem to get any super strength, powers, or anything. If he did, the movie never showed it. POINTLESS.I still don't get what happened to Carnby, or the complete story with the orphan children deal. Then the ending... Horrible. I really can't go on.First I figured it was cause I zoned out and just missed something during my trips to get drinks and clean up. So I came on here to check out user comments and I have yet to see one comment where someone actually liked the film. If I had known this, I would have saved my 3.69! The only scene I actually liked was when Carnby's apartment went all dark, there was a pause, then the music started as Carnby and Cedrac lit up the place with their guns. It was more like a music video than anything else. I actually rewinded it and watched it again. The only two minutes I was happy during this film.Well, one thing good came out of this film. That song at the ending credits was good, but thanks to other viewers I have been warned to NOT buy the soundtrack. It would be similar to ramming a hot poker in my eye. So I am gonna find out who did that song and get it. Yay for me.P.S. This isn't even worth to catch on cable. 96min of your life will be wasted. Do something else that is productive. Like spend an extra hour in the shower. Trust me.",

The song got me more excited than I was throughout the entire film and though a biased Nightwish fan, the premise of a film's attraction being eclipsed by its theme song than its cinematic merit indeed says much better replied to with a slight nod of the head before you turn away.",

So I decide to BUY the movie and see it for myself if it actually could be THAT bad. To then discover that it's like any other Video Game movie. Resident Evil and the follower Resident Evil: Apocalypse is video game based movies that has an actress who started her career as a model. Now, Tara Reid has actually worked within commercials. I'm not saying that it makes her a better actor, but please, she is better then Sarah Michelle Gellar who plays Buffy - the big blonde vampire slayer. They even made a follow up and movies out of Buffy. Who wants to see a follow up on her demonic boyfriend Angel who can be compared with Vin Diesel's so called \"acting\". None of them can act. Angel probably even acts better then Vin Diesel and guess what those two has in common! Bad acting and good looks! So what if we would see a follow up on Aline Cedrac? Alone with Aline? Or Alone with Aline: 2? My point is exactly that no one cares about acting in an \"all action\" movie or series! They want to see blondes and good-looking guys that kicks some bad guys/girls in a amazing way!So there are a few glitches in the story, but this movie should have been a longer movie with more background. Other from that, I can't see what there is to complain about. All in all, who can make a Vide Game better then this or then Resident Evil? I doubt anyone could do this movie better when it comes to effects and actresses or actors. All that is needed, is someone who could have directed them more. Because to blame the actor to be bad is easy, but this is not one of those movies where they lack in talent. This is a movie where the one to blame is Uwe Boll, because he should have used the actors and the actress to give their full ambition in this movie. So, if any of you out there, is so sure that this movie is bad, I would like to know how you ever could get a Video Game movie as the games. Because I am sure that no one can make a video game movie as good as the video game.So all I can see is a lack of directing and story. Other from that, this movie is completely action! And that what was I expected. Because that's what video games is about, right? And I believe Tara Reid acts better then that character on your video game. So unless your character in the game can give such a pretty face as Tara Reid can then you have nothing on the Alone in the Dark-movie. If you didn't want anyone to put a face on your characters, then you should keep yourself to the video game and not the movie. In which, I doubt you would even play the game if it wouldn't contain action.It's an action movie. What did you expect? What Uwe Boll did, was to make the game into a action movie. A >action< movie. I want to point out that the action movie contains special effects, monsters and a lot of guns and >action<. So if you didn't know, a video game being all action and being made into all action can't be as bad as everyone points out.I like it. Why? Because I bought an action movie and got an action movie.If there were one movie that was the biggest joke in the universe it would be \"Boa vs. Python\" and not at all \"Alone in the dark\".",

            "content": "My word! I'm quite surprised how this movie managed to get higher than one star no to mention two... Its not even really a B-rate movie, rather than an imitation of one, and at that its a horrible imitation of even that... The story is told in a way that doesn't really catch the attention of anyone, and the core of the film is blood and guts, with a sprinkling of some amazing music, (I have no idea why anyone would let their music be used in something as awful as this) and flashy lights. This creates a perfect dish, if the fight has some sort of meaning... but here it seems they just randomly occur, and lots of people in cheap costumes die, in a pool of their own blood, which looks remarkably like cooking oil with coloring. This brings me to the computer graphics. I don't have much to say about this topic, other than its a load of... well fertilizer. If the guys in the CG department would have just sat around in a park counting clouds, I'm confident to say, that we would have been much better off. Thats about it for the CG. Take a look at a couple of scenes as well... for example, the gattlings are firing, but the ammo strip fails to move even a bit, while this machine doesn't even spill out any spent shells. perhaps some editing would be needed in the scene, where they just arrived at the bottom of that shaft, and one of the girls dies, when the remaining people decide to move on, just as they leave the shot, the girl starts to sit up... hmmm... isn't she supposed to be dead(?!?). In one other scene somewhere near the end of the film, when the old bloke bites the dust, a couple of shots later his corpse magically disappears! All in all, this abomination has an extreme air of cheapness... no, worse, cause if it were cheap at least it would have some character. This way tho' this is a soulless film. It tries to scare you from time to time, it even gives suspense a try, it all works out very poorly. Another shot in the gut is the acting. Not one ounce of emotion is conveyed. Not even a teeny little bit. Its like trying to cook by reading a cooking book. Let me explain. All the ingredients are there. A long line of good games, action adventure, almost everything you need in a moderately good movie, but if you're clumsy, you just will not be able to make the dis as good, as a chef would, and is not going to look anything like the picture beside the recipe. The picture being the website... i was actually expecting something a little like Silent Hill. If you've downloaded this film, and I'm pretty sure you have because it would be a waste of money to have acquired it in any other way, ill tell you what to do: open the drive that the film is on, open the directory its in, select the file, press delete, click \"Yes\", and empty your recycle bin. If you happen to have it on a CD, DVD, etc. and you have it on your drive and you're just about to watch it, then open the drive the disc is in, remove the disc, find the CD or DVD case, get a can of lighter fluid, go outside empty the can of lighter fluid on the disc(s) and case(es), strike a match, light the pile of filth you just layed on the ground, stand back and enjoy. Feel the comfort that your friends never need laugh at you, because they accidentally saw the file or disc or case or whatever that had the words: \"Alone in the Dark movie\" written on them. If i had to choose between \"Alone in the Dark\" or alone with a shark, well... id say: wait a sec let me get my trunks...",

            "content": "I can't believe I've got the chance to watch this. Directed by Uwe Boll, (who his company claims to be the \"World Market Leade in Video Game Adaptions\"), it is supposed to be based on the same name of a popular video game but in reality, there is not a single reference to any of the games save the name of Edward Carnaby. The film starts with Edward Carnaby escaping from the orphanage where weird experiments are conducted on children. He escapes this and hides in an electrical outlet where he gets an electric shock. Forward some decades later and he's a paranoia detective from there he shoots zombies and monsters and finds secrets that no one else has discovered.The film starts with a scrolling prologue which lasts about 5 minutes and I must say, it was a really painful experience to watch so decided I skipped it and head straight to the action. Boy, did I find myself cringing severely. It was added after test audiences reported that they were confused by the plot (and rightfully so).The acting in this film is atrocious, some of the worst performances I have seen in the past 5 years or so. Christian Slater is completely misplaced in this film as he tries to look tough with all those guns he's holding. Tara Reid looks totally lost 100% of the time having no relevance to the film. Stephen Dorff tries too hard....'nuff said. In all, the dialogue in this film is just plain awful. The only thing I find funny in the whole of AITD is Boll's comments about Reid and looking smart with glasses.The soundtrack is again plain awful and highly inappropriate, in my opinion. It's as pointless as the film itself and bad rock music is forced in the viewer's ear. The film uses to much of it to make up for the atrocious plot. What can I say about the writing? I've seen 2nd rate fan fiction writers which are vastly superior to this.Editing: Very bad, the editing feels all choppy in general. Boll uses heavy emphasis on slow motion and very quick cuts to make any gore scenes really gruesome. Now lets go on about the direction. Uwe Boll can't direct a movie at all and this film just proves it. Every last scene is cringe worthy (except the credits when the cringe factor is diminished). He has carelessly thought up some of the most ridiculous ideas that could make the most arrogant studio exec faint. In particular, he changed the gritty, tense atmosphere (set in early 20th Century Louisianna) to an action oriented film (set in present day with a sci-fi atmosphere and a detective with loads of guns). In the original games (and original script), there was no slimy badly rendered CG monsters, no pointless gun fights, no ridiculous car chase sequence and no gratuitous sex scenes. It was him who suggested the idea to have all of these added to the film. The camera-work is also to blame for this sloppy production. It feels very nauseating at inappropriate times. For example, Boll thought it would be a good (or more accurately in his own words \"excellent\") idea to move the camera around when there is no action and stops still when there is action, it stays absolutely still. As a result of this, this is the cinematic equivlent to riding a roller coaster while intoxicated.My major gripe is at the end where *SPOILERS AHEAD* the monsters who are supposed to be afraid of the light attack Slater and Reid in broad daylight. Does that mean that the monsters are pretending to be afraid of the dark just to tease Slater and Reid's characters? Probably not, it's just a technical goof which Boll failed to see in the cutting room. To call his ending as \"Lynchian\" is an insult to the great David Lynch himself. At least with Lynch, he actually carefully thought through his ideas as he wrote his scripts. *END SPOILER*In short, Alone in the Dark is some of the worst films I've ever seen in the past 10 years. Horrible acting, dialogue, editing, direction, plot, soundtrack and much more. Boll's works will make other bad films like Manos, the Hands of Fate look Oscar worthy. I've seen Z-Grade films of similar calibre which are far better than this. My advice? Avoid this sub-par \"film\" and get Hostel instead.",

Early in the film she stumbles across a dead body and experiences what anyone would consider a traumatic time, yet when someone asks her how she's doing she's \"Just shaken up\" and has to catalogue some more artifacts. The dialogue was awful. There was absolutely no credible conversation. Every line was delivered to explain something, thereby killing just about any mystery that could have been generated (but then again the introduction killed that, too). Ancient Native American civilizations and mysterious paranormal stuff being tracked by a super-secret government organization? Maybe in another movie that would have been even remotely interesting, but in this movie it just falls on its face and rolls in the mud a few times while getting prodded with an electric shock rod and spit upon by school children. I guess after scoring Reid, Slater, and Dorff there was no budget left for anything else that makes a movie. It's a \"B\" movie all the way, and that's almost an insult to \"B\" movies.

The camera was dynamic, incorporating some very nice tracking shots and aerial photography.

This is the type of film which is so bad that it actually made me angry at the end. It's not even so-bad-it's-good material, it's just really painful to sit through. Overall, director Uwe Boll has proven to us that he hasn't got a clue on how to make a movie, and it's a very good thing that he recently retired from the filmmaking industry.

            "content": "There is so little that works in \"Alone in the Dark\" that you would think it would be easier to just list the things the movie did correct but you'll be hard-pressed to think of anything. The story is a mess, but here goes anyway: Thousands of years ago, an ancient people named the Abkani opened a doorway into another dimension filled with monsters. The people managed to seal the door but it came at a terrible price and the entire civilization vanished. Our story follows Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), a former paranormal investigator under Bureau 713 who is investigating his past and researching a series of Abkani artifacts. As more and more artifacts are discovered, it becomes clear that someone is trying to assemble them to re-create the key to the other dimension. Edward, along with Aline Cedrac (his ex-girlfriend, played by Tara Reid) and members of Bureau 713 must stop the mysterious forces at work before it's too late.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the film you can tell this is going to be bad. The movie begins with a long text crawl explaining about the monsters, the Abkani and what happened thousands of years ago. This is a movie! Why can't we see this instead of hearing about it? Not only that, but the whole text crawl is narrated Christian Slater as well. Why? After wracking my brain I was able to come up with a brief outline of the plot but the story is incredibly difficult to follow. Several plot elements are very vaguely mentioned or are quickly introduced then dropped. There are side plots involving conspiracies, human-monster hybrids, past relationships between the characters and more that often lead nowhere, do not pay off or seem to contradict the actions of the characters. It doesn't help that the acting is pretty bad (the worst offender being Tara Reid) and the special effects are terrible. It's not that the monsters look all that bad, they're nothing special but decently made; it's the little things that just scream \"amateur hour\". For example, there's a scene where a zombified woman is running towards a character and she's gunned down with a single bullet to the head. If you're paying even the littlest amount of attention though, you'll notice that the bullet (which was added digitally) doesn't even come close to hitting its mark so she just falls over for no reason. Obvious, unexplainable bloopers like that one can be seen here or there during the film. A perfect example is a scene towards the end where a character is killed due to incompetence, the characters leave the room with the body and you can see the the actress begin to get up again before the shot is cut. Did director Uwe Boll never hear of a retake? It's like no one cared or was paying attention movie. My favorite bad moment is a seduction scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater that is so bad, it's LEGENDARY. So here's the setup: The two of them haven't seen each other for years and they've just been attacked at the museum. They part ways and he goes back to his house, which is some kind of warehouse to rest. For unknown reasons, he leaves the door unlocked (despite having been attacked by strangers multiple times during the day) and his ex-girlfriend, who really resents him because his arrival marked her near-death at the hand of xenomorph-knockoffs, walks in. She finds him sleeping and then starts making out with him. We then have a soft-core sex scene (no nudity, the one thing that could have at least been somewhat enjoyable) and it fades to black. Why? Shut up. That's why.\nBeing badly acted, with shoddy special effects and an incoherent plot would have been enough to dismiss the movie as trash, but it gets even worse because \"Alone in the Dark\" is boring. It's never thrilling because the mysterious activities by the villains don't make any sense and are never explained. It's never exciting because the action sequences are so badly put together and the characters so bland you don't care about any of them. It's never frightening either. There isn't even a single scene where someone is alone in the dark and frightened. What does that tell you? If all of the reasons I listed weren't enough, how about a couple more? We get some locked doors that only stay locked as long as the plot demands it, a scene where the actors talks about four photos but the camera shows five, totally inappropriate music that breaks the mood and leaves you scratching your head, a ton of destruction that doesn't mean a thing, badly written, stilted dialogue throughout, and as a cherry on top, an evil, child-exploiting nun. This woman ran an orphanage and sold the children off to a mad scientist so he could experiment on them. What kind of experiments? Well our villain wanted to create half-monster, half-human hybrids... of course! When the actions of this film begin to play out, our evil nun suddenly begins feeling bad about her actions and ends up committing suicide. If you're going to be an evil nun, at least commit to it! \nHonestly, I thought this movie was going to be a lot of fun to ridicule, but it really wasn't, it's just plain awful. I can't recommend that you check this movie out for any reason, even morbid curiosity because even though there are moments where it is so bad it's laughable, it really is a dull, dreary experience to watch it. Among Uwe Boll's films, \"Alone in the Dark\" is one of the worst and that's saying something. (On Dvd, July 5, 2013)",

Between the laughable acting and nickel-and-dime special effects, Uwe Bol has crafted one of the greatest comedies of the past 10 years, yet for some reason this was marketed as a sci-fi/horror thriller. Like me, about halfway through, you'll start expecting Ashton Kutcher or Candid Camera to pop up to tell the whole cast and crew they've all been had. I'm just kidding.

            "content": "Uwe Boll proves to us once again how much of shitty director he is. Trying to get through this mess of a film was hard. I hated every single aspect of this movie. The acting was absolutely atrocious and one note throughout. Christian Slater delivered a dull performance, Stephen Dorff gave a bland performance as a bland FBI agent, and every scene with Tara Reid was painful to sit through because every time she talked she sounded like a robot and she has got to be one of the worst actresses I have ever seen in a movie in such a long time. The story and the way it was presented was just one note, convoluted, and confusing. It was hard to follow and everything that was happening didn't make any sense. The action here was terrible and badly shot and the cgi on the monsters was also terrible. There were too many scenes that were shot in total darkness (just like in Alien vs Predator Requiem) and as a result, you can't tell what the monsters fully looked like and there were times where you could barely tell what the monsters were doing to the humans. Why does Hollywood keep letting Uwe Boll make movies? He is one of the most untalented directors we have working in the business and he has never done a single good movie in his whole life. He is only doing movies to try to make a profit and there is not a single redeeming quality in his style. Hollywood can't seem to make any good video game adaptations and the most solid one I have seen was Doom. Overall, this movie ends up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen and in my opinion, this was even worse than House of the Dead. If you want to watch a great monster movie, watch James Cameron's Aliens and skip this piece of shit and you will be glad you did.",

I hope that those checks contained a lot of 0's. Alone in the Dark contains one of Uwe Boll's most annoying trademarks, and that is the shitty action sequences. They are all shot in such boring angels, that I almost fell asleep during them. Plus, they are literally shot in the dark so you cant tell what the fuck is happening. The special effects in this movie are so bad, even Stephen Sommers would say \"Damn do those effects look bad.\" There are parts so bad I almost felt embarassed, like in one scene a soldier was supposed to be dead and yet while people are walking away she lifts her head up. I mean, how did that get past editing?  Some people say that Uwe Boll is the new Ed Wood, no, at leat Ed Wood had a passion for filmmaking, Uwe Boll on the other hand just doesn't give a fuck.

I heard people don't like Slater much, I'm not sure why but even with that, he tried in this, he tried to make this better but not even the most valiant of efforts could save this. This movie didnt even feel real, it just felt like this movie was someone's dream because nothing had any weight, very little made sense and it was so over the top but underwhelmingly wooden at the same time. This movie has the problem of too much going on but at the same time not having a thing happen in it. I could write all the mistakes but I'm sure someone has, it's just juvenile mistakes that are in this, it's like a ten year old wrote the script. Theres just so simple errors. Theres also a giant error of not making a horror film scary but anyway. Some guy says something about three people but he's showing 4 pictures! WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THAT? It's just insultingly stupid. I'm not one for saying that someone's acting is 'bad' because I sure as hell couldn't do what they do but hell, I could have done a better job then what everyone did here, besides Slater, everyone was just too serious or not serious enough, wooden and bored. I've done some school plays in my time and that doesn't mean that I'm suddenly an acting expert but this stuff here was terrible. I still have no idea how I actually felt when watching it, because even though there were people with guns shooting things it just didnt feel real it just felt like scenes taken from other movies because everything was disjointed and I said earlier about it being like a dream because nothing seemed to matter... It's so bad it's a mystery... I just... No... I can't do it. I'm not just one of those people who follow the crowd and hate on it just because everyone else did, it's actually that bad... REALLY THAT BAD. I usually don't listen to critics either because I could be missing out on a gem just because some snob didnt like it but seriously they are right, STAY AWAY. IT'S GOT 1% FOR A REASON. It could have been good, even with all the negative things l heard and I kept an open mind because the synopsis of the film I read seemed interesting and the initial narration by Slater was intriguing but pretty much after he gets in that cab at the start it all falls apart. But, as I have to give it atleast half a star I will say that the soundtrack was very nice, for some reason it was a soothing soundtrack with very soft instruments and I liked that, too bad I can't find it anywhere. The music in the action scenes was awful and was so loud you couldn't hear anything and you couldn't even see anything because it was filmed in the dark (huh huh, get it?) but anyway I'm back on negatives. Oh, if you liked slo-mo, this is the movie for you.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll has been refer to as the new Ed Wood of cinema, these claims are completely false. At least with Ed Wood films you could laugh at his poorly made movie where Uwe Boll movies are just pathetic and a pain to watch. \r\n\r\nWhat's the best way not to start your movie? With a text crawl that last a minute and half read by a boring narrator. What's worse is our star is Christian Slater who you might as guess gives a Razzie Winning performance here. This movie is honestly filled with more wooden actors than wooden trees. The plot is essentially a contradiction of itself filled plot holes after plot holes. It's very stupid to say the least, non is more evidence with the scene when Slater is in a car chase and the taxi he's in won't start up. So if you have someone who's chasing you backing up their car to crash into you again, WHY in the world would you get out of the car in the direction the car is going to hit you. Yet despite us never seeing Slater chaser never getting out of the car, he disappears to only climb over a fence, walk on a bridge and then attacks Slater. Why he didn't attack Slater directly is anyone guess? The first action scene is very implausible, Slater shoots the guy chasing him with a gun several times including in the heart yet it's getting impale by a sharp object that kills him. This is surprisingly not the dumbest moment in the movie. What is the dumbest moment in this movie when am agent is showing Slater pictures of people that have disappeared he says that there are only 3 pictures, but, he actually showing him 4 people. The agent also says these three people have nothing in common expect they grew up in the same orphanage. IDIOTS! One very notable flaws comes from the ending in which an entire army of monsters which were never explained or shown attacked the city with entire evacuation of the city in one night. Yet somehow despite the monster attack the city is surprisingly clean with no indication of any destruction in the city. And it ends with Slater character being killed despite the movie constantly establishing the creatures weakness being light and this ending rips off The Evil Dead ending.\r\n\r\nAs for the horror aspect of the movie there really weak, Uwe Boll actually tries to scare people with flickering lights. There's also a scene in which it's film in a way in which someone is following Slater, but no ones actually which results in one of many completely pointless moments. You have better chance of being terrify by Casper the friend ghost even terrifying than anything in this movie. The worst element about the horror aspect is the heavy metal music which is out of place for this movie. As for the dialogue it's horrible. Some notable bad lines includes \"Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you\", well that's obvious. Another bad line includes \"If you're going to build a puzzle? Why hide the pieces so far apart?\", it's a puzzle of course it's to be hard to solve. The action scenes themselves are somehow even worst than Steven Seagal. Nearly every action scene is shot in the dark and terrible lightning makes sure you don't see what's going on. Everything is poorly done here from continuity errors, hue plot holes, poor direction, and nothing is right here. Yet despite it being a very poor movie, it did deliver some laughs with some priceless bad acting and a death scene in which a zombie is killed despite the bullet clearly flying over her head. It's one of most poorly made movie I've ever seen, but in all fairness I've seen allot worse than this.\r\n\r\nAs for this Uwe Boll being called the new Ed Wood must stop. Uwe Boll is in no way the new Ed Wood. Ed Wood actually has an audience that enjoy his movies no matter how poor they are where Uwe Boll does not have an audience for his very awful movies. If there's anyone you should compare Uwe Boll to is Jorge Ameer. You might be wondering who's Jorge Ameer is, he's a talent-less director much as the same level of Uwe Boll, but even worse. In case you don't believe me, just type in The Singing Forest and see what the community has to say about one of his better efforts.\r\n\r\nAlone In The Dark should stay in the dark there's no audience for this movie and there's hardly anything worth salvaging in this movie. Simply stay away from this movie, it's not worth you time.",

Anyways from what I gather from looking at the plot(if there was one), some experiments were experimented on some children with some pyschic abilities on a local house until one of them escaped resulting to the rest of them to escape as well.  Several years later and adults with them coming telekinetically linking them together to form a bond to seek answers of their existence with a squadron to assist them.

It's nothing more than just grabbing gamer's attention for the sake of making money, considering that he never plays video games in his life. No wonder why Alone In The Dark was a complete dreadful film. The story had nothing to do with the actual video game, so it doesn't look like Alone In The Dark to me. It just looks something else entirely. Even die hard movie lovers, like myself, will tell how bad this movie was. It was so bad that it's funny. It's right there with The Room and The Wicker Man remake. Everything from this film were laughable, from predictable acting, to the crappy special effects, and all the way to the cheesy dialogues.

            "content": "1.2/10\r\n\r\nUwe Boll's \"Alone in the Dark\" has nothing to do with the somewhat-forgotten and underrated 1982 slasher film of the same name. It is, instead, a big-screen adaptation of the popular video game franchise; which comes to no surprise, since Boll is infamous for merging video games with cinema and creating the most repulsively bad and intellectually assaultive pieces of shit ever. This is my first Uwe Boll film, and now I see why he has been greeted by such infamy; he deserves every last bit of criticism. Here, he's taken a good premise and rendered it stupefying and nigh impossible to watch. If there's one thing that makes it endurable, it's the amount of time you'll bust a gut laughing your ass off. Believe me folks; this one is a real stinker.\r\n \r\nSo the film opens with an overlong text that speaks of the back-story to the film, which is read aloud, to our dismay. The back-story involves an ancient tribe called the Abskani. Apparently, they worshipped otherworldly demons, who would take over the world upon being summoned. And now, they have finally been let loose onto the modern world, and we have to watch as Boll allows these badly animated CGI beasties to roam free and do little more than just kill people.\r\n\r\nBut of course, there must be characters; and oh man, are there ever. You've got a paranormal investigator (Christian Slater), his girlfriend (Tara Reid), and some guy in police clothing (Stephen Dorff) intent on being badass. He isn't.\r\n\r\nIs there even a need to name these individuals? Boll cares about them just about as much as I do. A few are given the kind of back-stories that should be considered necessary, even if they are lame all-the-same. Still, every single character feels out-of-place and born of a million clich\u00e9s; and the actors portraying them have each seen better days, or at least the mass majority of them have. They're just plain bad here; and they aren't even the worst to be found here when it comes to performances. No, if you know your bad movies; then you'll know that the acting that REALLY, REALLY sucks comes from the supporting cast. That's one thing that Boll seems to understand, but that's about it.\r\n\r\nI knew the movie was going to suck. I watched it because I was in the mood for something that was bad in just about every aspect of its being. So I can't say I'm disappointing when \"Alone in the Dark\", a film  with a perfectly interesting idea going for it, turns out to be an insanely illogical and disgustingly under-made little horror movie. Boll's idea of suspense seems to be some dimly lit places (often times, the dark cinematography seemed unintentional rather than the reverse) and slimy lizards and their worm offspring that pounce from the shadowy regions of the earth and kill you. Sure, that can be creepy and effective, but the director gets nothing right and screws up any possibility for goodness. It isn't entertaining and it isn't scary; with the exception of a gratuitous and poorly-filmed sex scene between Slater and Reid. Now THAT, my friends, is some scary shit.\r\n\r\nI have not played the Alone in the Dark video games, and by the looks of things, neither has Boll. The fans reacted negatively to the lack of faithfulness in the film adaptation's story; which is a load of bull otherwise. Nothing could have saved it or improved it in terms of quality; the fact that it doesn't even stick to the franchise that it's built around makes it all the more down-right pathetic. And as it is, I've said all I can say about \"Alone in the Dark\". I hated it; every moment of it. It's silly, stupid, and if you're going to watch it at all; watch it for the surplus of unintentional laughs. And whether you like it or not, a laugh is a laugh. And unintentional, guilty joy is the only emotion you'll feel when watching a movie directed by the master of cinematic crap himself. So embrace whatever you can feel and continue to detest the rest of the ride.  Where \"Alone in the Dark\" stands, as cinema, is all in the title.",

Sadly for a bad movie junkie such as me; Boll's 2005 trash fest wasn't as bad as I had feared, like BATTLEFIELD EARTH [2000] despite being irritating and rather annoying this film had its odd moments of un-intentional comedy. However the confusing and half-baked plot line which lacks a lot of continuity and logic, Tara Reid as a totally unconvincing scientist and of course the over use of slow-mo & strobe lighting during a gun battle make this a very bad film. Aside from the odd moment of un-intentional comedy I found this film weak which is why a solid rating of 30% is in order.",

It's not a bad one either. \r\n\r\nWith movies like these, if you can handle then it's either a test of your manhood or just plain stupidity. If you finish it you're either a man or just stupid for having watched it in the first place. Take your pick. It could be both. \r\n\r\nActing/characters: Well, I don't need to tell you how bad it is because you've heard it a million times before. The characters are very laughable and they have no motive for doing what they do at all. They make the stupidest choices without any reason at all. The acting is just as bad as the characters. I normally cut actors a bit of slack because bad acting is usually (not always) 50% a bad screenplay and maybe 25% a bad director who controls all of the emotions and acting choices of the actors. But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone in this movie acts as stupid as their characters are. 0/10 \r\n\r\nPlot: This plot is as nonsensical as you get. You're expected to know a lot of things that you are never told. They attach significance to a lot of things without telling the audience why they are important or what happens if things go wrong. Do the bad guys want to take over the world? Do they want to just kill the good guys and just leave it there? Who is behind it and why? Is the main villain we see just some pawn or a host body or is he the mastermind of all of this? Why do a highly trained army of government secret alien defense soldiers never have to reload and can't hit anything? The plot holes are bigger than George Clooney's head when he won Best Supporting Actor (the same year this came out actually). It was just a mess. Plus the ending just added another giant plot hole to everything. Nice going. I looked on 5 or 6 different websites trying to get a decent plot explanation for this film. I found pretty much nothing. I did find this though. It's as close as we're going to get. 0/10 \r\n\r\nBob B. The Movie Master's review:\r\n\r\nYou know how Uwe Boll is called the Hitler of filmmaking. They are exactly right. This movie looks so bad. I mean, he didn't get enough budget, didn't get a good solid cast and he forgot to make it true to the game. There seems as though there is some suspense in the trailer, but there isn't. I now declare Uwe Boll the Hitler of movie making! 2/10\r\n\r\nOverall Rating: 1/10",

A Boll production is always an entertaining way to eat up an hour and a half... But seriously, the guy HAS to start reading his scripts prior to filming.\n\nNever is there any kind of characterization found in his movies (and hiring the likes of Tara Reid to bring the already flimsy characters to life does not help matters any). People just do things because the script demands it be so, not for any kind of plot or character-related motivation. That's not even to mention the giant gaps in the storyline itself. So many times did I find myself saying \"gee, I guess that person died... for some reason.\" idk. Maybe the guy just forgets to film stuff and doesn't realize he can go back for reshoots.\n\nSo yeah, Boll, you frustrate me to no end. Your movies could easily be better than they are.

This is a competently directed movie with some decent acting and pretty good special effects, but what ultimately let's it down is the plot.  I say plot, but that would be overly gracious.  What little storyline there is, is stretched out to fill the running time, but is so badly created, that at times it becomes unintelligible.  To be truthful, it was only when I read the description on Flixster that I actually understood what was supposed to be going on.  For any gamers out there have played an installment in the \"Alone In The Dark\" series, please, please do not expect a movie that will come anywhere close to what you would expect.  The only reason I have given it the rating I have, is the fact that (as I mentioned above) the production values were quite high, and at times the visuals look very slick.",

Yes, his films are schlocky and really cheesy, but I felt that among the few I've seen, I've had quite a lot of fun watching them...except this piece of shit. Alone In The Dark is one of the all-time worst horror films and action films I've ever seen. The storyline is horribly confusing, the acting is absolutely horrendous (Especially the acting by Tara Reid. Really, a fucking archaeologist? If she's an archaeologist, then I'm a fucking brilliant mathematician!), the action scenes are utterly boring (How do you make shooting monsters and zombies boring? HOW?!), and it is also far too boring and awful to be salvaged for trashy fun. I honestly couldn't believe just how awful this thing was and I watched the unrated director's cut, which is supposed to be the improved version! If that was the improved version, I hate to think of how much worse the theatrical cut is. It should also tell you how bad this film is when Uwe Boll himself said it was bad (Not to mention, as he stated in the commentary of the director's cut, that he also thought casting Tara Reid was a really bad idea). The only things I can really compliment about the film is the music score, the awesomely cheesy death metal soundtrack it spawned, and the kick-ass poster. Other than those things, there is nothing else positive I can say about this dire action/horror flick.",

When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens, who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby, who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke, and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.\r\n\r\nThis film is poor. Uwe Boll cannot direct something serious enough for me to care about. None of the characters are remotely interesting and the plot is so bland and lifeless its like they aren`t even trying. Uwe Boll doesn`t love films at all. He just uses it as a way to make cash no matter how terrible they are.\r\n\r\nChristian Slater has nothing to deliver on screen. There isn`t anything. No charisma,no sex appeal,no action...Nothing. He is just dull to watch. Tara Reid can barely act. She was fine in American Pie but in this,its clear she has just completely lost all talent when wearing those glasses (which don`t even look good on her).\r\n\r\nOverall laughable. Don`t take it seriously. Uwe Boll makes poor films that deserved to be trashed because he has no talent whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRating - 24% - C-",

Raised in an orphanage, he is prone to having nightmares that involve him as a child that he can't explain.  As the movie progresses, he finds he and the current Bureau 713 are searching for the same answers involving a long lost tribe called the Abkani and rare artifacts from their era that are being found throughout the world.\r\n\r\nA monster movie in the style of The Relic, but no where having the casting power of a Tom Sizemore or Penelope Ann Miller, this film tries to showcase its monster and does an ok job at it, however the rest of the film falls short.",

This is a film that fails to hit the mark on so many levels, it's not even possible to salvage even if you'd remove all the crap scenes with Tara Reid. Alone in the Dark is a misguided attempt at creating an action Horror film, and it fails. This is one film that just doesn't deliver. You end up wondering why this film wasf8inanced in the first place and you're astounded at how Boll could pull something like this off. Alone in the Dark is the prime example as to why Video game to screen adaptations are horrible ideas for films, and they rarely work. Alone in the Dark is a poorly made film and you realize that Uwe Boll doesn't care about directing a good film that he's only in the business for the money. His films sell, so there's no reason for him to direct a good film, although he's managed to make three good flick s out of the fifteen or so he's made. This might have been an interesting idea for a film if it would have been handled properly. There were signs of potential, but it quickly became apparent that it was a pure joke fest. Everything that might have been interesting is wasted from the poorly conceived script, which feels rushed, with no heart put into its story to the washed up actors; this film was set to fail right before the cameras were set to roll. Avoid this horror flick, as it a mess from start to finish, and there's nothing good to come out of it aside from the heavy metal soundtrack.",

A common complaint is the so called horrible performances from Christian Slater and Tara Reid.

The only reason it got 10% is on my computer you can't put 0%. Videos that you watch in Science and History class in school have better entertainment value than Boll's.

In the beginning, it does work as an unintentional comedy, but even that wears out its welcome pretty fast.  There's just something about the wooden way that people talk; they all deliver their lines like they are reading them for the first time in a 1970's adult movie.  There is an exchange of dialogue in the movie that literally goes: \"What is it?\"  \"Nothing.  The hair on the back of my neck just stood up.\"...  Yeah, if Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around, it would not surprise me in the least if they riffed this.  To call this a campy B-movie would be giving it a compliment.

            "content": "You know when a movie is in trouble when its foreword lasts so long that you have trouble finishing the first five lines before the next five scroll up to replace them. Clearly, Lions Gate Films hired a narrator so that audiences could keep up. Sadly, the heavily detailed preamble in \"House of the Dead\" director Uwe Boll's newest video game masquerading as a movie \"Alone In The Dark\" is so obtuse that you may want to ignore it and wait for the characters to repeat bits and pieces of it in their dialogue. Frequently, producers add prefaces because they are afraid that there is no other way to convey such an abundance of back story. Seriously, who goes to the movies to read? Most people want to watch and react rather than read. This is why many moviegoers shun films with subtitles. Anyway, this derivative, below-average, formula-driven creature feature lacks the production values and the polish that German-born helmer Boll brought to his earlier epic \"House of the Dead.\" Believe it or not, \"House of the Dead\" looks like a four-star masterpiece compared to this largely humorless, overly complicated, clich\u00c3\u00a9d-ridden, supernatural claptrap about huge, leaping, cranium-crushing, lizards of the \"Alien\" variety that number into the thousands like the bugs in \"Starship Troopers.\" No, \"Alone in the Dark\" is neither bad enough to qualify as campy, like those guilty-pleasure, 1950s' sci-fi monster mashes, nor does it take the creature feature flick to the next level, like the vastly underrated \"Alien vs. Predator.\" Among a predominantly no-name cast, Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff appear to be killing time for a paycheck in this excuse for lots of second-rate blood & gore.\n\nFashionably unshaven, with a tattoo on one shoulder and a spaghetti-western duster draped over his buff physique, actor Christian Slater impersonates a haunted 'paranormal investigator' on the trail of a mystery about a lost Native American tribe called the Abskani. This advanced society thrived during the age of the hunters and gatherers. They opened a gateway between light and darkness and unleashed the spawn of Hell. As the Tara Reid character observes during a lull in the action: \"Some doors aren't meant to be opened.\" Could she have been talking about the doors to all the movie theaters where this substandard, superficial adventure is being shown? These hideous demons are supposedly so ghastly that the Indians locked them up in a gold-plated Pandora's Box. Designed as they are by a special effects company called Toy Box, the monsters appear pretty phony.\n\nAs a rough and tumble hero patterned in the Indiana Jones mold, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater of \"True Romance\") has just discovered an ancient artifact in the Amazon basin that promises to unlock the secrets of the Abskani and these demon lizards called Xenoes. Once Carnby deplanes, an apparently invincible assailant tries to relieve our hero of that precious relic. This thuggish brute takes a couple of 9mm slugs in the chest and shrugs them off like bee-stings. Carnby finally disposes of him by body-slamming him atop a large ice-pick. Unfortunately, this drawn-out match amounts to the best thing in this anti-climatic opus. Eventually, we learn from the hopelessly overwrought script (by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer) that a crazed scientist, Professor Hudgens (newcomer Mathew Walker), abducted Carnby and nineteen other kids from a Catholic orphanage and used them as guinea pigs in his nefarious experiments. Hudgens wanted to merge man with nature as the ill-fated Abskani tried. After Walker forced a slimy, squirming, centipede-like critter down all their gullets that attached itself to their spines, Carnby managed to escape and kill his parasite. The other nineteen weren't as lucky. Twenty-two years later, amid nightmares, they drop what they're doing in their everyday lives and mutate into murderous ashen-faced zombies. Meanwhile, a trigger-happy, paranormal, SWAT-team style outfit called Bureau 713, headed by Commander Burke (Kiefer Sutherland look-a-like Stephen Dorff of \"Blade\"), wants to wipe out these dastardly devils. Inevitably, Carnby looks for help from his girlfriend, Aline Cedrac (an abominably miscast Tara Reid of \"American Pie\"), a brilliant but bespectacled archaeologist who wears clothes that bare her midriff but conceal her belly button. She also has a funny way of saying 'Newfoundland.' Although neither Slater nor she conjures up any chemistry as lovers, Reid has one great scene where she punches him out for failing to let her know about his whereabouts. This scene and the first fight scene are about as good as it gets.\n\nAlthough the overexposed, washed-out photography adds an edgy quality to the narrative, it makes everybody look unattractive in their pancake-thick make-up. The monsters don't appear very realistic and never pose a tangible threat. The gore is cheesy by anybody's standards. The dialogue sounds like a play-by-play commentary. The characters spend too much time telling us where the plot is propelling them or uttering inconsequential fluff to keep your attention from drifting. Most of the action occurs in a creepy mine shaft or an abandoned warehouse. At least, \"House of the Dead\" was fun, while \"Alone in the Dark\" suffers from a case of prefabricated plot. Slater and Dorff both bring more dignity to this mediocre movie than it deserves. Meanwhile, this swiftly-paced, 96-minute potboiler reaches its predictable climax without arousing the least bit of sympathy for our heroes or modern civilization.\n\nExpect to see \"Alone in the Dark'' on the Sci-Fi Channel where the commercials will provide some relief from this noisy tedium.",

As the film started I first noticed the camera quality wasn\u0092t up to scratch but I put up with it. The acting in the film was dreadful and I was laughing from the minute the taxi driver opened his mouth, it\u0092s a real pity because I like Christian Slater allot especially his direct to DVD movie The Good Sheppard but this is completely terrible and what the hell was he wearing? I\u0092ve never seen a less heterosexual attire in a movie ever; he certainly didn\u0092t pull of that tank top he had to wear.\r\n\r\nI tried to remain optimistic about the film but when the first fight scene come into the play I just wanted to cry. The music used was absolute horrendous and every time even a punch was thrown the slow motion would be used, I bet if they put the slow all those scenes to regular speeds you would iron out a good ten minutes of the film. The fight scene reminded me of the plot from a porn film (Jenna Jameson\u0092s pirate film called Conquest in particular) just without the actual entertainment after the scene is set...\r\n\r\nThere was one particular part(s) of the film that had me laughing, every time they discovered a secret artefact or whatever it was this cheesy magical wind shim sounding noise would play to basically tell you, the viewer, that this little pebble the guy is currently holding is special. During the film you will see one sex scene which starts with Tarra Reid attempting to erotically touch the scars that cover Christian\u0092s back, well that certainly wasn\u0092t sexy.\r\n\r\nI wondered and better wondered what the $20,000,000 budget for this film was spent on; I mean there didn\u0092t seem to be that much CGI that would take up all the money and it was almost like they cut the budget in certain areas to save money but that was just Uwe\u0092s lack of abilities leaking through. Towards the end there is a last desperate gamble that was obviously an attempt to copy the film Alien in which a black sloppy monster is hanging from the ceiling and when our poor victim turns round he gets a face full of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing about this film yet is after severely disliking this I started getting curious of Uwe Boll\u0092s other \u0091films\u0092 as he defiantly is the modern equivalent of Ed Wood and at least his passion is to be admired.",

Horror, according to my little unabridged here, is \"an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying or revolting; a shuddering fear\".  So now that we've established what is horrific, let's get the following out of the way; this movie is horrific, in every sense of the word.  You won't find yourself contemplating supernatural horrors, or even the depths of human depravity during the few minutes you will be able stomach this bile.\n   Instead the horror will stem from absolutely horrid casting (Tara Reid as an archeologist, if wearing glasses and slapping a keyboard whilst saying inane things like \"I THINK ITS ABKANI, IT MIGHT BE ABKANI, IT'S ABKANI\" counts as archaeology), locations that look like the same set converted multiple times for the variety of purposes, props that are . . . laughable (all of the soldiers are wearing painball gear complete with elbow and knee pads and the ancient artifacts are cast of a crappy crappy resin mold), the extras have no idea where they're supposed to be \"shooting\" and so the action scenes, already bogged down by misplaced heavy metal, and .5 second camera cuts that prevent anything from being actually seen other than rifle blooms and the occasional poorly rendered CG ugly thing, and then we come to the acting.  If there were poorer acting in this film, which is about on par with a very bad SciFi original production, I might be inclined to recommend it as a good drinking game movie.  There is, however, nothing worth redeeming in this piece of utter trash.  Alone in the Dark has nothing of what made the vintage video game series so appealing, as the crew seemed to be intent on making an action movie from a horror video game.\n   If the opportunity to watch this movie ever presents itself, do something more fun and productive; like smashing your head against the wall, or jumping off a roof.",

Its another crock of shit Directed (and i use that would lightly) by Uwe Boll. This man couldnt direct an old lady to the post office as he's making a career out of directing ham fisted Video game adapts. The lighting is awful, the use of slow mo action shots is awful and everything else between is awful. I have flushed more artistic efforts down the toilet.

As such I expected it to be a lot worse. It's still a bad movie. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, the action is too ridiculous for its own good, and for what's supposed to be based on a horror video game franchise there's no atmosphere or terror to be found. It's just that unlike so much of his later work I didn't find it painful to sit through.That's because this came out around the beginning of Boll's career when he was still making movies with the best of intentions. Meaning it's free of things like his genuinely frightening political ideologies, the toxic personality he developed in response to the overwhelmingly hateful criticism he received from his detractors, and the overbearing self-defense blanket of unjustified arrogance that only served to make his following flicks that much harder to watch. Alone in the Dark is just an extremely unsuccessful attempt at a big Hollywood blockbuster from a man who, while likely able to recognize a good film when he sees one, had no idea how to actually make one.4.5/10",

The acting was horrendous in every way. The only actor who should showed some kind of talent was Stephen Dorff, and even he sucked. Christian Slater seemed bored and uncaring about his role.

The movies he makes are nothing but fodder for professional critics to stretch their comedy writing chops, and I love to read articles on how much they hate his movies and make fun of them.

It does it all, and it does it all badly to the point of wondering if you're being punk'd by Ashton Kutcher.  I can safely say that I found nothing to be redeeming in this movie: from Christian Slater's outfit and dialogue, to the fact that Tara Reid is supposed to be a scientist because she puts on glasses to make her \"look smart\".  They might as well have had her attempt an English accent, but then I'm sure the United States would be forced to apologize profusely for that insult to their country and accent.  That being said, I actually love to watch this movie, if only for the chance to laugh.  Maybe I'm sick, but movies like these make me appreciate the real gems even more so.

(very good console) and found myself transported to a dark and sureal story line with horror, suspence, mystery, and even religous lingo thrown in, and the survival aspect was best ever. this movie on the other hand had little to no suspence, the answer to the mystery was obvious, and the acting........ Is undescribably bad. there is no redeeming qualities in it. the story was nothing like the game, the remake was about the devil rising, and all of it was set in central park new york. the old game was set in a mansion. this one was set in a city. no central park, just a city. Is there anything that i can say that describes how stupid and assonine that is? The answer is no, I can not. And that's just the start of the crap, including the fact that it has the biggest loop hole in the world. So big that the grand canyon is a little crack in the pavement compared to it. At the end of the movie, there is a city that all the residents have been aparently eaten by the monsters. And there are no bodies, or blood. Oh my god. How does that work. If godzilla raged through that city, it would be destroyed. And there might be survivors, but there is no one there, and everything is intact. Great clean up job, guys. I am impressed. It would be like having a house of the dead movie with barely having the house of the dead. Wait, that exists. Okay... It would be like having a resident evil movie with no Chris Redfield, or Jill or wesker. Wait, that exists! What is wrong with movies today!",

If you finish it you're either a man or just stupid for having watched it in the first place. Take your pick. It could be both.Acting/characters: Well, I don't need to tell you how bad it is because you've heard it a million times before. The characters are very laughable and they have no motive for doing what they do at all. They make the stupidest choices without any reason at all. The acting is just as bad as the characters. I normally cut actors a bit of slack because bad acting is usually (not always) 50% a bad screenplay and maybe 25% a bad director who controls all of the emotions and acting choices of the actors. But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone in this movie acts as stupid as their characters are. 0/10Plot: This plot is as nonsensical as you get. You're expected to know a lot of things that you are never told. They attach significance to a lot of things without telling the audience why they are important or what happens if things go wrong. Do the bad guys want to take over the world? Do they want to just kill the good guys and just leave it there? Who is behind it and why? Is the main villain we see just some pawn or a host body or is he the mastermind of all of this? Why do a highly trained army of government secret alien defense soldiers never have to reload and can't hit anything? The plot holes are bigger than George Clooney's head when he won Best Supporting Actor (the same year this came out actually). It was just a mess. Plus the ending just added another giant plot hole to everything. Nice going. I looked on 5 or 6 different websites trying to get a decent plot explanation for this film. I found pretty much nothing. I did find this though. It's as close as we're going to get. 0/10http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/11343-aloneScreenplay: This was the worst part. The screenplay of this film made the acting and the plot very bad. There were many many cringe-worthy lines. I expected to laugh at a lot of the 'serious' lines, but they didn't even deserve that. They sounded like they were written by a drunk 8 year old. 0/10Likableness: Like I said before, the plot was stupid, the acting was bad, and the screenplay was horrid too. I expected to come in at least laughing at the lines and getting entertainment value that way, but I didn't. Plus the special effects were some of the worst I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't suggest this one (although I don't mind that Irukandji suggested this one to me). It's fun to bash films like this. They certainly deserve it. 0/10Final score: 0/40 (H)TRIVIA TIME: 1. The lengthy opening text crawl was added after numerous test audience members said they were confused by the plot.2. After execs read the green draft of the shooting script, the film got an additional $10 million. Uwe Boll poured the money into special effects.3. Every piece of body armor worn by the various extra foot soldiers during major battle scenes is paintball body protection made by JT USA.4. Nuclear Blast spend $30,000 on the soundtrack rights to promote their bands.",

The movie doesn't even try to use the source material, instead going for something that shouldn't even exist. I mean, they went as far as to have a dead person get up again, and even animating bullets missing people WHO SAID BULLET JUST KILLED. What really takes the cake is the non existing storyline, pre-into to acting actors, and a gods awe-full music score. In fact, I'm sure the only reason that Uwe Boll made this movie, was so that he could exploit a loop hole and use it as a tax write off, so that he gets paid a lot of money in compensation. And this isn't the first time he's done this to a video game. Seriously, avoid at all costs, even if those costs are vital organs, loved ones, or having to be wide awake for a root canal, in a truck, in a high speed chase being preformed by Orin Scrivello.",

Uwe Boll is a legendary director. He is famous for making some of the worst movies in recent history, using a German tax shelter to fiance his movies (German stupid money was the applied term) and challenging his critiques to a boxing match including inviting Quentin Taratino and Roger Avary. It was called \u201cPut up or shut up\u201d. He took 5 challengers and defeated them all by beating them all up. One was even an amateur boxer with some skills / experience (Uwe Boll also is an amateur boxer and has lot of years of training on his resume). This was the stuff of legends and you will find it on YouTube (Uwe Boll boxing). Back to the movie. The movie is loosely based on the really good \u201cAlone in the Dark The new Nightmare\u201d videogame. You get what you expect. His movies have no good stories, acting or coherence. The only decision for you is if it is just really bad or so bad that it is entertaining. For me I enjoyed this movie while I must admit that it is a guilty pleasure. I should have not rated this above a 3 and even that is maybe to good. Overall a silly and enjoyable movie. I must say that I respected Uwe Boll and say you should learn from him because he had success. Machiavelli said something like \u201cLearn from the sucessful people no matter if you like or dislike them because they know the game\u201d.",

It lasts for an hour and a half but it seems as long as a complete 10-season series. Sceanrio is disparate, inconsistent, impossible to clearly understand. Lighting is remarkably awful: 80% of the scenes are shot in almost total darkness. All protagonists are unattractive and have this strange emotionless acting. Decors and environments are terrible, and espacially the costumes since Boll used paintball armors to equip policemen. Music and sound effects are horrible and incoherent too. Dialogues are dull and flat. There is absolutely no link between the actual movie title, the eponymous video game and the plot of the movie. Who could have bet on the fact that a movie called 'Alone In the Dark' would show dozens of warriors against thousands of creatures? No one is actually alone, even if we are actually in the dark all along.Only good point I found is that special effects on creatures are not that bad. However I can't say the same for special effects on deaths. A few (and only a few) frames and scenes are actually inspired. It deserves a 2/10 because of this and because this film does not have the real petty intention towards us. We have much to learn from the countless mistakes it makes.",
