            "review_title": "The best show Nickelodeon has aired",
            "content": "OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn't the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.Sadly, after The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon never seemed to follow in the footsteps of Avatar which I found upsetting. Kids need more shows like this, if I'm being honest.",

Sorry, no substitutions.I am a prolific reviewer here (over 1350 reviews) which is a polite way of saying I watch too much TV and have too much time on my hands.When I first watched this series I made the same \"mistake\" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I \"assumed\" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.(And some really deep metaphysical concepts -- like the island where everything is connected. That is a reference to one of the oldest religions in the world.)I know what you are thinking. I tried to get into Korra but all I kept seeing there were the many errors the producers made in trying to improve on something which simply cannot be improved on.It is official. I am calling it.The best overall series in the history of TV.And it just gets better with age.((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",

            "content": "Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn't be underestimated. For a while I didn't even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic Nicktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really fantastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren't kidding: the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hungry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I've ever seen. It's an achievement of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn't perfect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characters and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.In fact, the only minor complaint I would have against the second season (not sure yet about the third) is that it borrows quite heavily from the Empire Stikes Back (i.e. the 'one-who-will-save-us-all' mythology from Joseph Campbell is off training with an old master, feels his friend(s) in pain and danger in the future, rushes off before finishing training, bad things ensue, etc). But really, all of the characters get developed quite well, and if anything the development of the character Prince Zuko, a scarred son of Ozai who has been banished until he can bring back the Avatar along with his banished uncle Iroh, is astonishing in its complexity. We don't care about this character at first, in the first season he comes off like a whiner with Iroh as the wonderful comic relief (think Pokemon if the brother and sister weren't so annoying). But by season two a whole other dimension comes into play: who are you, and what are you doing with yourself? The trek with the three main characters, and the extra characters like Toph (a little blind girl who is one of those great bad-asses you have to see to believe), is one that is sophisticated enough to bring in adults, and for kids it's often just rollicking fun when it isn't deep or dark. The villains are convincing and scary, the humor hits when it needs to (and sometimes it can be just downright trippy and hilarious, like the second episode of season two, the Cave of Two Lovers), and the animation is often breathtaking. As they say on the internet now: it's made of Win!",

            "content": "Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see.",

            "content": "This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall. Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic plot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and angst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming quest, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change them over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, many intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythological and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely written and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them. Next I will cover the show's borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I believe I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will never again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second to no other show, and it's balance of colour is never anything less than sublime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also staggeringly versatile. The show's epic mythos is also very strong, and demands to be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes inspiration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver it's unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjunction with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave philosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades. In conclusion, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, and it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotional response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled each time. My favourite television show, of all time.",

Sorry, I disagree completely. Avatar:The Last Airbender in my opinion doesn't deserve to be included down there with ChalkZone and Rocket Power, if anything this is one of Nick's best shows along with Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy and Angry Beavers.The concept may appear simple and basic on paper, but as the show progresses the storytelling is grander, more epic and perhaps even more powerful. The animation is excellent, the music is great, the writing is consistently strong and the stories are outstanding in my opinion. And the characters, heroes and villains, have depth to them and are very likable. Avatar:The Last Airbender also benefits from superb voice work.In conclusion, this is a brilliant show and somewhat underestimated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Satisfyingly Well-Rounded",
            "content": "This series has brought out the child in me. I have been watching a series of TV marathons, and started to grow tired of the situation comedies which are there for humour and the serious dramas where everything is so dark and real. I wanted an adventure that is fun and I don't have to see all of the dark, realistic moments. This show was perfect for that. It brought out my inner child with its silly, fun and happy nature, yet still had an exciting, well rounded and intense story. It hit almost every mark.I disagree with people who say that if you dislike the first season, you'll dislike the rest. No, this series does change. I actually didn't really like the first season. It was too childish and relied on childish humour too much. The characters felt rather two dimensional and the story didn't appeal to me. But as the series progresses, the characters have turning points. You don't know when they change, but you can see that they're growing up. I didn't even know Aang (voiced by Zach Tyler) had changed until the last episode, where I realised that he had gradually became grown up and was no longer a naive child.You do gradually find yourself getting attached to the characters. They begin to feel three dimensional, which is a sign of a brilliant show. I even grew feelings for and felt sorry for who I assumed would be the main antagonist of the show. Zuko (voiced by Dante Basco) gradually gets his own back story. He's in his confusing hormonal year, sixteen. He can't tell right from wrong and is becoming his own person. Throughout the series, we see him gradually evolve until he makes a big change in the final season.Not only this, but for once I straight away warmed to a newly introduced character. 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is certainly great with new additions. Toph (voiced by Jessie Flower) quickly became my favourite character due to how bad-ass and adorable she is in her own way. So 'Avatar' certainly succeeds with its characters, which is what I mainly look for in a show. Each character undergoes changes, which also changes the show from being extremely childish and rather boring to more of an intense, family show.Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have both created an amazing, well rounded show. Not just these two deserve credit, though, as I believe each of the crew did an amazing job. Many writers and directors have contributed. It has a somewhat Japanese feel too it. I believe the writing in the show is Japanese, as well as parts of certain beliefs and lifestyles. It also looks very much like an anime. It's sort of like an American, children's anime. The Japanese influence is definitely noticeable.Quite possibly the best thing about the series is how well-rounded it is. There's a sense of accomplishment when you reach the end. The entire journey that the characters must undertake is explained at the beginning, and that journey is what happened throughout the show. We had the structure of the entire series right from the beginning, and that's what we got. We waited patiently, watching Aang on a long adventure with his friends, Katara (voiced by Mae Whitman), Sokka (voiced by Jack De Sena), Appa (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) and Toph, until the huge, climactic finale which ended everything satisfyingly.So, as you can tell from my review, this is a brilliant series. Rounding my votes up (adding the ratings together and dividing them by the number of episodes), I got an average of 7.9/10. That's mainly due to the series being rather slow, in a way. It's well-rounded, but not all of the episodes are great. I would still give the series an 8/10, though, because I wasn't satisfied with the first season. The reason it got a 9/10 is because it is a children's show. I would have loved all of it as a child. So it isn't perfect, but it's better than an 8/10.This series brought out the inner child of me. It was fun, and adventurous and reminded me to enjoy certain things which I have forgotten about. I even began to find certain bits of child humour funny, such as Sokka's jokes at times. It deserves the attention is gets as it should fully satisfy both children and adult alike. Technically, I'm still a child, but I'm close enough to an adult to enjoy the stuff adults do. This series got everything right, and I enjoyed it more and more as it progressed. I look forward to one day seeing this series' successor, 'The Legend of Korra'.Edit: I finished the series earlier and I now, for some reason, extremely miss it. I'm considering giving it a 10/10 instead...",

The protagonists were very relatable and easy to root for. Although the show tried to convince us that \"the Avatar team members\" were just kids, they all looked and acted at least a few years older, especially Aang (he really doesn't sell a 12-year-old kid, especially in season 2 and 3). But that's a good thing. I liked it better for it. Prince Zuko is another great example. He was supposed to be around 16, but seemed more like 18, if not even 19. Again, I preferred it this way.Characters' archers were done splendidly. Especially Zuko's. His journey was by far the most transforming and I liked how he struggled to choose between good and evil. Aang's crush on Katara was cute at first, and I thought nothing of it, but then it has developed into something more, even if it did take a long time for it. Their love was definitely something to root for.And last but not least, Sokka and Toph. Both were absolutely amazing. One a warrior with a fun side, always saying something funny, but also really looking out for his sister and other friends, and the other a blind girl with unimaginable power. Even animal companions had their own characters. Loved it. And the finale! It was amazing. One of the best ones in the history of TV shows. \"Avatar\" really built up to it. Just go see it. I couldn't recommend more.PS: If you haven't watched yet \"The Legend of Korra\", which is supposed to be Avatar's sequel, please don't. It destroys everything \"The Last Airbender\" holds dear. You'll just end up depressed. instead, pretend it doesn't exist. Trust me, it's better this way.",

What really made this show are characters; each and every one of them - from the king of the Earth Kingdom, to the very Avatar.

            "content": "When I first heard of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" I was more than a little skeptic. The fact that it was airing on Nickelodeon was probably the reason I just kind of shook my head. Then about three months ago, on a complete whim, I bought the first two chapters of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" on DVD from Barnes & Noble Booksellers and, boy, was I blown away! This is one of the most humorous, fun, action-packed, and generally all-around entertaining cartoons I've seen in the longest time. It's just a pity that shows like \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" are such a rarity these days. I'll be turning 21 on the 12th of next month; 13 years ago around this time at the age of 7, I remember that Nickelodeon had some of the best of children's programming on cable television. Then, 10 years ago, Nick began to slide into idiocy and continues to do so as I write this. Then around 1999, I gave up on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network completely. My opinion of both channels hasn't changed. But \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" what I presume is an attempt to add a little pseudo-Anime'-style animation to its lineup in order to catch stragglers from other cultures (and perhaps Nick-weary adults like myself), is a breath of fresh air for this once-tired soul. While I don't think today's kids may completely understand the overall significance of some of this show's philosophy, subtext and terms (how many 5-year-olds know what an \"avatar\" is?), they may not have to be versed in Eastern Thought to get everything. \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" a fusion of Eastern philosophy, Hinduism and martial arts, is set in a far-off land (dare I say, a Middle-Earth clone?) where four tribes rule the world and the most gifted members of each tribe have mastery over the Four Greek Elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The mastery of each of these is the term \"bending,\" the ability to manipulate each element and use it for creative or destructive purposes. The Avatar, a sort of Christ-/Buddha-like figure, has mastery over all elements and is the most powerful bender of all. The main plot of the story gets underway when the Fire Nation grows too powerful and sets off on a campaign of world domination. But they first need the Avatar, who has mysteriously disappeared. Prince Zuko, from the Fire Nation, is leading a mission to capture the Avatar and gain re-admittance back to his kingdom. Two Water Tribe teenagers, a brother and sister named Sokka and Katara, respectively, make the discovery of a lifetime when they find that Aang, a 12-year-old Airbender who was frozen in a block of ice and also happens to be the last of his kind, is the new Avatar. But he still has many skills to master in a very short period of time, and the show follows the trio's journey to the North Pole with the mammoth six-legged bison Appa and the lemur Momo. If only more shows on Nickelodeon could follow the promise that \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has. What boggles my mind about this cartoon is its style, which, it really has that is completely original, even though the influence of Japanese Anime' is obviously apparent. We get some fairly funny jokes here and there, way out-there philosophy, and kung-fu-style element-bending battles that are pretty hard to top; it's the single greatest piece of imagination in today's children's programming! But my praise for \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" doesn't really restore my faith in this channel (unless they wipe the slate clean and bring back all the original programs from my youthful years), it just reaffirms a hunch that they do have an ounce of competency left when it comes to entertainment.10/10",

The characters and their development are finely crafted. The world-building is nothing short of glorious. And though the story is your basic \"chosen one fights an evil empire,\" the show goes beyond black-and-white morality, with characters wondering about the moral implications of their actions.It's a shame Nickelodeon or any other channel has not had more animated fare like this. Sure, there was Korra, but the writing in that devolved quickly, and I only got a little bit into the second season before I gave up on it.

            "content": "When I fist heard of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was a little septic. It seemed like it would just turn out to be another cheesy, serialized anime whose only purpose is to make cash. That, and when I watched the first Avatar episode, I noticed that it wasn't a 'true' anime. Avatar is, what I call, 'hybrid' anime: in other words, anime created here in North America. This only added to my skepticism. I have had bad experiences with hybrid anime. Shows like Martin Mystery and Totally Spies are hybrids, and watching them nearly makes me gag. The anime style is chosen for no reason other than to attract audiences. Their movements are quick, jerky, and you can tell they try way to hard to mimic traditional anime style, but in that sense, they fail horribly. Their written is witless and linear (i.e: the jokes in Totally Spies all relate to some sort of stereotype of girls, like hair, nails, etc) and the plot lines are all contrived (i.e: every episode of Martin Mystery). Yet Avatar: The Last Airbender succeeded where all other 'hybrids' had failed. The anime style was chosen for artistic reasons, and each of the character's movements are very fluid, and almost reach movie quality. There are typical anime elements that give the show a surreal touch without taking it over the edge, such as Appa, the flying bison, or the Spirit World. The action scenes probably impressed me the most, as the animators focus mainly on the ensuing battle, and not so much as the reactions of the fighter's or the onlookers. Each battle has a point, as well, and not just some random duel. The character's are very well drawn out, not just in an animated-sense, but also the depth of each character. But more importantly, we see these characters evolve through their adversities, and we see how they struggle to cope with their tasks, which sometimes require them to question their morals. Again, the humour in Avatar is genuine, and always makes me laugh, whether it be a quick quip from Sako, the running joke of the Cabbage Man, or even the coincidential irony. Even it's serious moments are well written, and the character's words have a deeper meaning. One of my favourite quotes is, \"Part of being a man is knowing where you are needed\". But what impressed me the most is how deep Avatar actually goes. The show has it's own mythology that is easy to follow, but sports a deeper meaning. Each tribe or nation represents a different element, but the fire nation is the main antagonist in Avatar. Yet we gain insight as to why this is. Fire is probably the most dangerous element, as it is essentially alive, and can destroy almost anything. This give us insight into the fire nation's need for power. Yet the fire nation has its own morals too, and we occasionally see things from their side, a technique that helps us gain better understanding for the fire nation, and even creates pathos for character's like Prince Zuko. Each tribe has it's own special abilities, relating to their element, and this relationship between man and nature is a common motif that permeates through many anime movies and shows (Hayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"Nausicaa\" are excellent examples of this). Various symbols of Chinese mythology also show up in the series (i.e: panda bear's, dragons, etc.) giving the show another level of depth. Avatar is, at its core, a story of growing up and facing fate, no matter how hard it is. I am so glad I was introduced to Avatar, and I am pleasantly surprised by its depth and wit. The voice acting fits the character's perfectly, and even the music is a joy to listen to. I would gladly recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender to practically anyone.",

Without a doubt, this is one of the freshest shows that have ever been invented. The characters were wonderfully and fantastically fleshed out, right from its flawed and brave heroes and heroines to its sadistic and sympathetic villains.Not only that, the universe created is astounding, and even comparable to the universe of The Lord of the Rings. Even more, with the different bending techniques shown: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. The fighting techniques were almost perfect, simple and yet extremely detailed. The storyline was intricate and delicately intertwined with each character, full of revealing information that helps you understand, all the while developing into a final climax which bursts out and leaves you breathless.The animation left me at a loss for words. It was crisp, clear, and full of detail, every line drawn out beautifully, from the first season to the third, the animation gets better progressively. The backgrounds and landscapes were awesome: Book One opens with the icy blue atmosphere and muted greys of a winter season, then bursting into a green and flowering, as well as shaded brown spring in Book Two, and finally opening into a golden-red summer wreathed with sun in Book Three.The script, on the other hand, was put together marvellously, incorporating witty quotes and perfect conversation. The voice acting was excellent, each voice actor blending emotions into their respective character and making us truly feel for them when they get hurt, when they experience sadness or happiness and so forth, and make us really come to care for them in time. My personal favourite is Katara - gutsy, independent, and fiercely stubborn, but there's a lot to be said for Aang, who learns to grow up and face his responsibilities, and also for the trustworthy and steadfast Sokka as well as the sarcastic but emotional and reliable Toph, and Zuko, who is angsty and troubled at first, but later becomes more courageous and willing to face his fears.All in all, this is not a show to be missed. This is one of those cartoons which are for both adults and children to enjoy. This show, as prejudiced it may seem, actually makes your imagination explode (I admit I'd have loved to be a Waterbender) and burst to life as battles and confrontations are fought. Truly, it really will be remembered in years to come.",

For the youngsters who like fun, adventurous, comedic and magical animated shows and for teenagers, adults, and seniors who like immersive, continuous and meaningful lore, storytelling and maturity.Throughout this beautiful journey, we learn to grow with the characters. Each character suffers a loss that we can in some way relate to and they react accordingly to the evils the world is throwing at them and do their best to adapt. Nothing ever feels like convenience just to forward the plot, EVERYTHING feels so natural and I think that's why I love this show. The characters are so naturally built that its nearly IMPOSSIBLE to choose a favorite. Even the \"bad guys\" have depths to their motives. All of the characters in this show are never good or bad because the plot wants them to be (with the minor exception of Fire Lord Ozai, whos wicked nature and motives are later unraveled in the comics. Also, I HIGHLY implore you to read the books if you want to continue your Avatar journey).

It was a series about the wanderings of the flying bison Appa, and I watched it to the end. It was amazing what difficulties had overcome this huge beast in search of his master, which was linked to more than just your friend, here felt a deep emotional attachment. I got to watch the animated series on and very quickly became involved in the dynamic plot \u2014 each episode contains references to the previous one, and the narrative is built in a single track of what is happening with the characters. I watched until the end and remained in pleasant surprise and admiration: after all, there are really talented directors who can shoot these masterpieces of animation that can be interesting for both children, teens and adults!The story I will not retell, I can only say that here the idea of saving the world takes on a special, you might say, universal scale: the world is understood not simply as the absence of war, but as the consent, support and understanding between the four Nations of Water, Earth, Fire and Air. How would like to hope that our world, now is currently distant from the peaceful coexistence of different peoples, at least in the distant future would be even remotely similar to the one that was created by Aang and his friends. It is through Faith, Hope and Love the main characters managed to win and establish peace on Earth, no matter how Utopian it may sound. After all, as Lion-Turtle said to Aang : \"Only a true mind can cope with lies and illusions. Only a true heart can cope with the poison of hatred. From the beginning of time, Darkness thrived in the Void, but it always gave way to Pure Light. Wait for this Light, and he will come\", and I'm with Aang believe that it should be and always will be.Having watched the animated series before the end of recently, I can recommend it for both children and adults, because it says plain and understandable things that we should not forget and establish our lives on that .",

It's my favorite show on Nick, one of my favorites on all of TV. The best parts are definitely the plot line and the world that Konietzko and Dimartino have created. This is definitely one of the most complex cartoons on television.I tune in every week just wondering what will happen; will Aang move any closer to mastering the elements? What's Zuko's plan to capture the Avatar this week? And is there a love relationship growing between Aang and Katara?Once you start watching this show, you won't be able to stop. It's THAT good. Every new episode only adds to the legend of the Avatar, and if you haven't seen it, I suggest you see it soon, because you are missing something great. I predict that \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" will become the best cartoon in Nickelodeon history, if it isn't already. 12/10",

            "content": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars officially ended not too long ago and I was left with a void within myself. I believed that series was one of a kind: a nuanced, sometimes very dark show meant for kids but could be enjoyed by adults as well with superbly written characters that evolve with the show's progression.A few friends recommended (or demanded) that I watch Avatar: The Last Airbender if I had any love or respect for animation at all. I figured since Dave Filoni worked on this show too, it was worth a shot.I'm writing this at 3 in the morning because I'm already halfway through the final season and I finished the show 3-4 days ago.I thank God this series exists. No other show I've ever seen has left me with such an immense feeling of fulfillment and pure joy. In a word, this show is purely... MAGNIFICENT!Avatar: The Last Airbender is a monumental achievement in storytelling that deserves every last bit of overwhelming praise it has received. Aang, Sokka, Katara, Toph, Zuko, Iroh, Suki, Azula, Ozai, Roku, even Appa and Momo are written beautifully and their characters mature and evolve with the story. The environments are breathtaking: from the walls of Ba Sing Se to the frozen wastelands of the Southern Water Tribe, and from the tranquil village on Kyoshi Island to the courtyards of the Fire Nation Royal Palace... what can I say? It's all a feast for the eyes and ears.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn a thing or two along the way, the journey is worth it. What I would give to sit down for a cup of tea with Uncle Iroh, speed down the slides of Omashu, or travel the world atop a flying bison. Hell, I'd settle just to experience it for the first time all over again.The most deserved 10/10 I've ever given.Leaves from the vine\nFalling so slow\nLike fragile tiny shells\nDrifting in the foam\nLittle soldier boy\nCome marching home\nBrave soldier boy\nCome marching home",

It's good to know that children that watch this show may actually learn what it takes to have a good story. The research put into the story is amazing. The bending styles all coincide with different styles of fighting and can be seen in every episode. The show itself is also planned out, as minor questions formed in one episode may not be answered for another 10 some episodes later, so it's not just another Nick \"story\" show like Danny Phantom, all episodes are connected and well planned out. I wouldn't doubt that the next 3 seasons are already written. The character development and writing can match even some of the best television writers out there, it may even be able to stand toe-to-toe with the works of Joss Whedon.I give the show an easy 10/10, especially if you watch all the shows in order.",

Most notably the best one is Zuko's. But of course we get plenty from the other characters too. There are moments that I genuinely cried from how well this show was taken care of especially during the emotional moments. I really commend on how well a show is if it can make us really feel unexpected for a villain. One of the villains is the most hated one, but getting to understand that villain more and then witnessing an emotional breakdown from said villain honestly got me emotional because of how well executed it was.

My favorite I realised after a few episodes was Zuko. Everything he went through was just so full of suspense and tragedy you'll really enjoy watching his journey even though it's not always turning out good for him.Avatar: The Last Airbender is not just a cartoon, it's an expirience I'll recommend to anyone who likes engaging storytelling and creative world building.",

After finishing, I was stunned. Stunned at how a show could be this good and so deep and rich in story telling and character. Although this is technically a kids show, it's one of the most emotionally powerful written shows I have ever seen. The show even had a lot of goofy humor geared more for kids, but somehow the show balances the humor and oversell narrative of the story perfectly. I've never seen a show yet movie do this so well. This show is truly an achievement in story telling, character study , development and world building. It deserves all the awards possible. I will say even movies or video games in my opinion aren't written as well as this show was. Kudos to the writers and creators of creating a masterpiece. This show is a rare achievement in how stories cans narratives can be told in media and entertainment. Why can't tv shows be made this good again?

While the story is a little cartoony at first, it soon evolves into a true epic of Aang fulfilling his destiny with the help of his friends, while other characters are at initially enemies go through unexpected paths (Prince Zuko's story arc is arguably just as important as Aang's). Simple put, one of the finest cartoons ever made, and a must watch for anyone.",

Of course, this isn't true, but it's a beautiful sentiment, and one that is extrapolated excellently by the creators and writer of The Last Airbender.Continuing on with this theme, the show makes approachable many different problems that touch on both coming of age in general, as well as growing up in a world at war. The gang of protagonist characters deal with crushes as well as refugee camps and are faced not only with the need to make decisions, but also the consequences of their actions.At the very beginning of Season 1, we meet protagonist Aang who must confront the consequences of his actions, and the antagonist, Zuko, who believes that he must achieve his destiny. These two serve as character foils throughout the series, serving as another great mechanism to approach the pains of growing up.On a different note, the animation and world-building are incredible. The planet that the show is set on, and the natural rules governing it, largely differ from our own, but are quite recognizable. Moreover, the show and its fantastic creatures are beautiful, creative, and stay with the audience even after turning off the TV.",

The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened.

It is a children's show which is a must watch for every adult and is pertinent to the modern time though the setting is ancient. Mysticism, magic and spirituality all find a happy mix with reality in this show. Far too often, present day tv takes the supernatural a step too far to awe the audience but doesn't really justify the need for the same. But in Avatar's case, right from the beginning, every single element has its place that even a massive island sized lion turtle doesn't seem out of place. I also need to mention how the ending of many tv shows, movies etc fail to hit the mark after running the story through the course. Avatar had an ending which was true to the nature of the protagonist and side characters and did not leave me yearning for more as each and every string was connected. The fight between good vs evil was nuanced with themes of familial relations, friendship, fight against sexism, collective will of the people, xenophobia, themes of ethinic cleansing, orwelian notions of state etc etc. Avatar, like I said may just be a child's show but it also happens to be a simplified magnum opus on life itself.",

There is just so much to love about this show! The characters, the storytelling, the fight scenes, everything is so well done. I found myself feeling so sorry to these characters, as their struggles are relatable. Zuko was my favorite. His struggle with identify, destiny, and honor was one of the best character development arcs I've ever seen (especially for a kids show!). Iroh always had inspirational wisdom and was a great character to look up to. Sakaa provided some much needed humor, Kataara was the moral compass of the group, and Aang was an all around great protagonist. The show also ends at the perfect time. After 3 books I felt that the show had built up a decent amount of lore while also not overstaying its welcome. I also liked how the show had a sense of direction, as most shows don't have that after the first couple of seasons. I can't even believe this was on Nickelodeon??!!

For the next three years, I was hooked into the journey of Avatar Aang and his friends trying to end a hundred year war. It took me a few years to truly understand the messages behind the show, but once I did, I realized how important it is to show this to children. This series covers topics like immigration and refugees, war effects on civilian populations, child abuse and abandonment, genocide, environmental conservation, and many other philosophies that the rest of the world should be living by. It tells the stories of Aang, the last of his race who must come to terms with his loneliness and realize his purpose in life and bring peace to the world, and Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who goes on an Odyssey to capture the Avatar and regain his honor. The two parties go on countless spiritual journeys and learn lessons about life, love, acceptance, and friendship. The series teaches the viewer to forge their own path in life, as well as lessons about your inner balance. This is the perfect kids show, watchable at any age. I'm eighteen, I watch shows like The Walking Dead and The Sopranos. I only really appreciate mature, deep shows. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most mature shows to exist, and it just happens to me marketable to kids. Parents, look this show up. You might just enjoy it yourself. \nP.S.

The main cast is comprised entirely of characters that could have easily been made into the main protagonist of their own story. All of them are compelling and add substantially to the series. There are a few episodes that focus on characters other than Aang, and rather than missing the main character's story, you seamlessly find interest in the character currently being developed. There are very few stories out there that develop such strong characters.All of the components of animated storytelling come together here to create an artistic masterpiece. The creators clearly loved their creation and spared no effort to fully develop the details of the world. There are things so small that they easily could have been set aside but weren't. I honestly can't think of a single aspect of this series that I think could have been measurably improved.

This is a huge comeback from the previous stuff presented by Nickelodeon. It's an adventure that when started you don't want it to stop. I wouldn't be surprised if one day this were to be considered a classic, its certainly one of my favorites. And the reason being is that it follows all my requirements for a perfect television program or movie and that is a good storyline and a good set of characters. Though for some reason we don't get to see that a lot, especially on TV, but Avatar hosts a wide selection of dynamic and relatable characters as well as a creative, well thought through storyline.The premise sets us in a world filled with humans, amazing creatures, and spirits. In this world there goes a war between 4 separate cultures based upon the four elements of Fire, Air, Earth and Water that has been going for 100 years and it is the Avatar's job to stop the fighting and reinstall balance to the world. However he cannot do it alone so he teams up with water bender Katara and her sarcastic brother Sokka who march on an epic journey into a world that has forgotten the meaning of peace. There's a lesson to be learnt in every episode you watch and every episode picks up or affects the other in some way. I also enjoy the amazingly accurate Japanese cultural referencing, like for example the martial arts moves used in the action sequences, if you look it up you would find that a lot of those moves actually exist.You can't go wrong with Avatar, it's a story of war mixed with heart and comedy supported by awesome characters and excellent animation. I give this series a perfect 10/10 no regrets",

            "content": "This all happened last year, I came across Avatar after I think I remember seeing the famous Lin meme where she was shrugging. I actually gave this show up after the first episode, I didn't see much in it and honestly wasn't interested. I quit for a few months but summer came around and I went to my cousins house and they were watching the same show I gave up on. And I came to my senses that I didn't give it enough time since only watching one ep won't make the difference and that would be a decision that I will definitely not regret. I finished it in less than 5 days, one time watching 20 episodes in one day. A show that hits closer to home than no other movie/series and one of the few that made me tear up almost. Now Im back to rewatching it this summer since I have to do a review on this show, like who doesn't do a review for their favorite movie/show.Very minor flaws and issues, seriously the flaws and questions that you had could easily be answered by googling. A solid start but the story simply got better and better with each season and episode. Even the filler eps are surprisingly watchable and interesting. It has superb pacing with so many themes and meanings and each episode had its own unique tone. It is raw, filled with emotions, and is wonderfully directed. Most of the lower rated eps take place in season 1 or in ATLA terms Book 1: Water which is mostly focused for younger audiences. Book 2: Earth which had the best character device, with the introduction of Toph and Azula, and having the best charcater development, and with long and consistent story arcs and also impressive standalone eps such as Zuko Alone and Tales of Ba Sing Se. Book 3: Fire is more like Book 1 with quiet alot of filler eps but unlike Book 1: Water the filler eps have some relevancy to the characters and plot and also the unique vibe Book 3 had compared to the two other seasons. But seriously though Book 2 and Book 3 are hard to choose between, both have great action, heart felt moments, iconic lines, and some genuine writing but I think Book 3 edges it since it is the final season and also it because it has the best and most emotional fight.The characters are also one of the highest notes about this show. They are really well written with alot of development from most of them especially Zuko. The dynamics between them are wonderful and beautitful to see, it has a \"homey\"/\"family\" type of vibe to it. They all have some sort of origin aobut them which makes them more genuine and realistic. They are so different from one another and they all have their own flaws and unique personalities. You can care about them, you can understand their pain.The animation was on point especially the fight scenes which were spectacular, they put alot of thought and research into the fighting styles and the icongraphy with the anime like resembelance! The characters looked great and the world design was amazing. The undetailed graphics and the character designs seemed like the biggest problem for the visuals of the series but they gradually get better with each season , I mean Avatar did have three different animation studios. The music was great with heavy inspiration from asian culture and a beautiful use of instruments in certain scenes with beautiful vocals. The voice acting was also great.I can go on and on about how great it is. You HAVE to watch it and If you have never heard about this show I guess you have been living under a rock for the past 10 years no offense. For all ages young and old and even after 13 years the fandom is still stronger than ever. This show is one of those shows where you can't judge by how it simply looks, I mean being on a televesion channel that is for little kids and having an idea that was so unorthodox and unique, it will make you back away a bit even I had trouble getting adjusted to it. But ATLA will shock you, and it will shock you hard. My favorite show of all time forever in my heart, it will remain the greatest show I have ever watched. Gonna watch this again and again till I die, absolutely beautiful. Every movie/series/show I have watched ATLA will remain king on my list.Memorable: YES Rewatchable: YES.",

            "review_title": "A Fantastic Series for All Ages - Deconstructed",
            "content": "I was first introduced to this show as a child, and have just recently re-watched the series through to completion to relive that glory from a more critical perspective. From art, to music, to storytelling, I don't believe a better animated series exists.I'll start by deconstructing the music. While there are western themes, the soundtrack often relies on elements of eastern cultures. Each tribe, each village, and each city has their own unique blend of music ringing through the streets, representative of their people, and in a more meta sense, representative of the underlying emotion of the episode. The music is even carefully picked for each title card, with each title card playing a melody representative of another piece or event later in the episode. Percussion instruments are used to denote urgency, strings offer a more relaxing tone, and woodwinds are often used for parties, allowing the viewer to easily understand the mood of the episode on a subconscious level.Of course, the ideas portrayed in this whimsical world wouldn't be nearly as easy to comprehend without the amazing animation throughout the show. It's important to note how expressive the characters are, and how uniquely their emotions are depicted, but the core elements of the show require more thorough investigation. Without spoiling anything, the basic premise of the show involves \"bending\", the concept of using art forms to manipulate one or more of the natural elements. Between problem solving and fight scenes, this idea is put to use in numerous creative ways, with each component carefully detailed. Scars are consistent, a gust of air changes the path of fire and snuffs it out, earth can be molded like clay or shattered like stone, and all of it combines into a visual masterpiece. Even color selection allows for storytelling and visual appeal, with each group of people donning various colors to represent their nation, or other colors to disguise themselves or otherwise invoke an emotion from the viewers.While the young (and young at heart) will be fascinated by audio-visual components alone, the writing is likely the most absurdly stunning show. Jokes are reference episodes later, small foreshadowing always comes into play, and the plot always flows perfectly. Societies are well-written, and even shown thoroughly enough that something as simple as a board game (Pai Sho, to those who are interested), is written out clearly enough to have been made into a real board game, not published by the writers but by the dedicated fans. The show follows the adventures of a group of children struggling to cope with the war-ravaged remains of society brought on by one nation's attempt to seize control of the world. While they are often successful, the group has to face death, abandonment, betrayal, and deception at every turn. Even more adult themes like sexism, racism, and ethics come into play as soon as the first few episodes. As the main characters grow in number, so do the problems that must be faced, as each nation has complex interactions with the others that can lead to smaller fights in the midst of a much more crucial war. Balance is a key theme in the show, with two pairs of elements that complement each other. Water is quick and cunning, while earth is strong and blunt; fire is fierce and difficult to control, while air is graceful and light. Characters often have a \"good\" side and a \"bad\" side, which combine into a well-balanced, wise character by the end of their respective arc. Factions betray natural order by interfering directly with nature, or by interfering with each other's power. In each dispute, the Avatar must act as the medium, the symbol of perfect balance, restoring order to all that has become chaotic. However, the weight of such power is not easy to handle, and it is made even more challenging when bestowed upon a child thrust into the war without the time to even cope with his emotions and developing mind.In summary, this show is DARK. It puts many other shows to shame in its adult storytelling. Children are forced to wage war against a threat that completely outmatches them, and the results of each of their actions weigh heavily on the world as a whole. Throughout the show, it is kept remarkably positive and whimsical, with most intermediary episodes involving the more fun and adventurous results of the group's travels. Through a combination of art, music, and writing, the show is a cinematic miracle that has inspired me personally in many ways. To anyone even remotely curious about the show, it's worth the time, especially if you can commit to the three seasons in order to see the stunning character development and story arcs. I take what I learned from this show to heart, and I know I'm not alone.",

            "content": "Anyone who watches this series will notice the rather simple, straightforward storyline, but that should in no way be discouraging to the viewer. What makes \"Avatar\" stand out from the crowd are the production values and invention present, both of which are outstanding. There is something new to discover at nearly every turn of this series, ultimately realizing a world of its own that seems to expand indefinitely. The story itself, despite its simplicity, is actually very strong and presented in an enthralling manner that explores the various facets of the series: the history of the nations, the customs of the people and so on. All of this is written with an uncommon degree of intelligence and becomes progressively better in execution, culminating in a sensational climax that remains the best finale I have ever seen to a television series.Character-wise, this series leaves little to be desired. Much like \"Hey Arnold\", it boasts a fairly large cast, with a good allocation of time amongst the different characters. In other words, everyone gets their chance to be at the center of something, even the antagonists. All of them not only change over the course of the series, but have a significant effect on each other, providing an excellent group dynamic that takes some intriguing turns. Out of all the kids programming I have seen (including the Digimon franchise) Avatar serves as the best and most compelling example of this. The main hero, Aang, is a nice combination of traditional hero aspects (bravery, personal responsibility, nobility etc.), but what makes him so interesting is that these characteristics are adapted to his age; he is only 12 years old (maturity-wise). I liked how the writers were careful to not make him into a static, perfect character and instead allowed him to be a kid. He is very happy-go-lucky and optimistic\u0085he also makes mistakes, often feels inadequate to his challenges and even acts impulsively, but still works to overcome his faults; plenty of heartening moments show his positive effect on people. That his more lighthearted behavior hides his grave burden is not lost on this show.Aang's three friends, likewise, have distinct personalities that do not conform to the usual cookie-cutter types seen in cartoons. Sokka is the closest to falling into this category (the comic-relief goofball), but he is quickly shown to be a resourceful and capable ally, just one lacking in experience. His sister, Katara, is well portrayed as the emotional center of the group, particularly during a trek through a desert that culminates in an emotional wallop of a scene. Indeed, this show gleefully breaks the mold by portraying its female characters as multi-faceted and resilient. The standout, though, is probably the conflicted and determined Zuko, notable for being able to walk the thin line between overt angst and the weariness of hardship and uncertainty. The writers even had the boldness to insert a romantic element. Now, this type of thing has the potential to be disastrous, but here it is allowed to gradually develop over the course of all 3 segments of the show, and works because none of those involved are treated as shallow accessories, but as individuals with feelings and tribulations. In other words, they actually facilitate the characteristic growth of one another. These examples, and many others, enable the audience to become emotionally invested in the personal journeys of the cast, which is quite a feat for a Nick-Toon.Just as impressive as any of these are the animation and artwork. Constantly, Avatar features amazing visuals that fully bring the settings to life and make use of the common anime technique of accentuating the features of the face to heighten expression (one reason why a live-action version of this story would never work). As is the case with various other journey based series, such as \"Pokemon\", \"Digimon Frontier\" and even \"Star Wars\", every segment possesses a dominant setting type. This helps bring a sense of freshness to each season and gradually shifts the mood in preparation for the final conflict. I particularly liked the diversity seen in the earth setting and the contrast between the deserts and the cities. There is such richness to this world that simply moving through it with the merry band makes the experience worthwhile. Even moving past all of the fundamentals, another commendable aspect of this series is, simply, the action. Anyone with whom I have discussed superheroes with will tell you that I am a fan of simple superpowers, which obviously are abound here. One reason for this is that simplified abilities encourage the writers to be a little more creative with the action sequences, and over the course of Avatar you see all sorts of interesting ways that the heroes and villains use bending to their advantage. Flame whips and daggers, lacerating air currents, earth armor and, of course, metal-bending are but a few examples of this. In fact, the action sequences are not only well-executed but also serve as a testament to the creators' willingness to go that extra step; the fighting styles of each nation are based on different real life martial arts specialties. The distinguishing characteristic, though, is the relatively reverent approach. Whereas most TV shows would fall into the trap of treating the bending abilities as conventional superpowers, the staff of this one made the smart decision to treat them more like spiritual disciplines.I am really only scratching the surface with this one; there are so many more characters, sequences, story elements and artistic achievements that could serve to demonstrate why I admire it to such a degree. I suppose the best verdict I can give is this: \"Avatar, the Last Airbender\" truly is one of the modern classics and one of the greatest animated programs ever made. If you have not seen it, find it and watch it. In fact, watch it with anyone. You won't regret it.",

Aang is a great example of the hero's journey, unlike many of the modern day heroes who are presented as basically perfect and essentially Mary Sues.I would recommend this awesome show to everyone. 10/10.",

            "content": "According to Wikipedia, Nick considers the target demographic of Avatar to be 6-11 year-olds. As an 18 year old who has watched the entire show, and who is eagerly awaiting the next episode, I have to wonder what they are thinking. The show features a diverse array of characters, each with story, issues, and flaws. The development and maturation of the younger characters as they encounter a world in crisis and interact with each other is evident throughout the show and is well executed. The world of Avatar draws heavily from various Asian cultures to create an environment for the story that, if not entirely original, is fully realized and feels like a real place with real history and culture. The effects of elemental bending and spirit entities on the societies of Avatar are well thought-out and serve to distinguish Avatar from other Asian themed shows, giving it a unique feel (it is definitely not Anime). The creators clearly strive for realism, in both the fight scenes and in the world the characters inhabit, though blood, swearing, and graphic deaths are notably absent, since it is supposed to be a kid's show. For example, The creators consult with a martial arts expert on every episode to precisely determine how bending moves should look, based on selected real styles. Also, All writing is done in Chinese calligraphy by consultation with an expert. The people who make Avatar have managed to create a story that, while especially suitable for younger people, has elements that resonate with all age groups. Overcoming difficult situations, trusting others and yourself, the necessity of self-discipline and effort, and the value of moderation and balance are central themes in the show. I don't want to include any spoilers, so suffice it to say that the plot is compelling as well. I should also mention that the show is frequently hilarious. There is frequent use of humor, but it rarely detracts from other aspects of the show, and generally only adds to the story's quality.",

I loved the show as a child but like many I didn't understand the depth of the show.Now 12 years later after it being put on Netflix again and a whole week of binge watching I can say this is the most intelligent, mind blowing, beautifully crafted animations of all time.The way that this show deals with topics such as sexism, genocide, colonialism, and war was handled greatly. It borrows ideas from books like The art of war and displays them magnificently. It also allowed people who were originally seen as the \"bad guys\" in depth character arcs. This allows for great character development for everyone on the show. You'll even feel empathy for animals that don't exist by the time you finish this show. To top it all of they do this within twenty three minute episodes.The show also made some really great female characters that had depth and great story arcs. They could have easily made them simple love interests but they didn't. They instead allowed them to hold their own just like their male counterparts. There is honestly not one weak female in the entire show.Also the animation is out of this world. It gets better and better as the seasons. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and the beauty of the four elements is shown greatly.Cartoons honestly can't get any better than this.

Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are the creators and executive producers of the series. Nickelodeon has nothing to do with the creative process or anything of the sort. All Nick does is air the show on their awful network and slap their annoying watermark in the bottom right corner.That being said, the show is truly amazing. The characterization is great and the voice actors fit the characters well. The animation is of a fairly good quality, although it's clear that some corners are cut with the animation at times.The reason I say the show is amazing is because of the concepts. The martial arts and bending of the elements are a real joy to watch, and you can tell that a lot of thought was put into it. I would recommend this to anyone who still has enough imagination to fully appreciate it, (a rarity in recent times), and to anyone mature enough to be able to enjoy something that a kid could enjoy as well, (sadly enough it seems these days people think something has to be full of torture and death to be entertaining.)",

And although much is made of Zuko's development in particular, I find Azula's transformation to be even better done, especially with the animation of her and how it changes with her mind state.I have never seen another cartoon come to the level of writing or wisdom that Avatar offers, and I doubt I ever will.",

However, you can't put 9.6 on your IMDb review, so I guess I'll just round up. Avatar: the Last Airbender stands head and shoulders above any other children's programming, and mostly only contends against Batman: the Animated Series for top seat. Avatar has one huge advantage on Batman - Avatar has a running plot where the characters evolve, change, and learn new things. For me, that's what puts it just a nudge ahead to claim the top spot.Avatar created a vibrant, original world with deep philosophies, colorful characters, epic confrontations, and real emotional stakes. The Four Nations may very well be a modern Middle-Earth. The show combined top-tier animation with linear, profound storytelling, and excellent voice acting. The show had great drama, comedy, and action, and switched naturally between them.What can I even complain about? Well, it sure was disappointing that Mako passed away while recording season 2, so they had to re-cast him. Frankly, you can't compete with the master. Also, in season 1, there are a few episodes that could be considered filler, and don't advance the story or characters that much. Remember, though, that this was done at a time when the fanbase was still growing, so they couldn't just dive into the story. Aside from these few nitpicks, this show is superior in every way. It's definitely a modern classic, and I would recommend the show to anyone and everyone.",

            "content": "It still amazes me how unbelievably awesome this show is. Taking so many elements from Chinese and Japanese culture, Nickelodeon presented us with something fresh and new, making our jaws practically drop with an incredible saga that marked itself as one of the greatest animated series of all time.We all know the story by now: long ago, the four nations (Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads) lived in harmony thanks to the power and effort of the continuously reincarnating Avatar, master of all four elements. When the Avatar disappeared, the Fire Nation sets out to conquer the world, throwing everything off balance. One hundred years later, the newest avatar Aang and his sky bison Appa are discovered by a faithful young water bender named Katara and her comical older brother Sokka. Together, our heroes set out to help Aang master the elements, make new friends, and defeat the Fire Nation once and for all to save the world while Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation struggles to find his own destiny.Pure genius! This series has it all: complex characters, an intertwined story, impressive animation, memorable music, epic action scenes, great comedy, bizarre creatures, etc. Almost every character is a true delight to watch, each having their own strengths, weaknesses, and funny little quirks. By watching all the episodes in order, you can see how much they've changed from being ordinary people to legendary heroes/villains as they fight for what they believe as right. Character development is truly superb here and the journeys they take are proof of that.There's more to like here too. The action scenes are some of the best, each time showing a character coming up with new ways to fight any enemy or two...or a hundred. Fluid animation and catchy music further add to the excitement of these battles. The creatures of the world of Avatar are rather interesting, often being hybrids of actual animals while some of them, the beings of the spirit world for instance, are strange and otherworldly. Comedy is to be commended as the jokes are simple but effective and the characters make hilarious facial expressions that are reminiscent of how anime people express themselves.In conclusion, Avatar the Last Airbender is everything you would like about an action-adventure series. This incredible journey is just breath-taking and I defy anyone out there who would say otherwise. Even the highly disappointing live-action movie pales in comparison to this awesome saga. I implore you to check it out, watch the episodes in order, and marvel at the greatness that is Avatar.",

The four nations are distinguished by their elements and each of the nations is distinct, with different appearances and cultures. Also the way each nation lives makes sense, with the air nomad temples in the skies, the water nation in the poles, the earth nation surrounded by walls and the fire nation having progressed more compared to the other nations, like they're in the industrial era. Character traits can also be linked to the qualities of the element they bend, which I find really interesting. The bending of elements is also so well realised with each bending style being based on a different martial art. When we look at great worlds in shows, such as Middle earth and Westeros; all these worlds feel lived in and there is history to draw upon and Avatar does that really well.The characters are also great. I love all these characters and each have character journeys that come together to satisfying conclusions. The care of these characters is what makes the show stand out to the rest and that care is maintain throughout the show, right to the very end.The level of maturity is also what amazes me. Heavy themes are explored throughout the show; war is the basis of the show going so far as to show the genocide of a people. Abuse is also explored in the context of a father and son relationship. These themes are handled with care and really well.Animation and music are both to the highest level, and I love all the voice casting. Action is also really well executed and realised, where there is so much creativity with the bending of the elements so it never becomes stale. I cannot praise the writing enough, and something to mention is that the show is really funny; the comedy lands like all the time which I find really rare today.Avatar: the last airbender is a show I can't recommend enough to people of all ages.

Korra & Avatar are both amazing, story driven shows, with some of the best characters out there. Please keep making these shows.Toff and Sokka's banter, especially towards the end of the series, is really funny. And the animation has a lot of subtle details on the one hand, and really visually stunning fight scenes. I'm also really sad we don't get to see these voice actors do more. I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that by the end of Avatar and the last season of Korra, both shows were getting into trouble. the thing is, animated shows are more expensive then Disney channels usual choice of get a few annoying kids on two sets and record them doing nothing. Please, for the love of god Hollywood. MAKE MORE SHOWS LIKE AVATAR!!",

The creators managed to create a world filled with beauty as well as an intriguing fauna and flora. And yet, believable due to it's cultural and ethnic diversity and complexity,Action? Yes, it's present, but the best thing about it? Avatar carries it in a FRESH way, unlike most \"mindless action\" shows out there (like most of it's elements) and with enhancing touches of Asia all over it. That results in action packed scenes that keep the viewer on the edge, but are also beautifully designed based on traditional martial arts style.On top of it all? Gorgeous and detailed background art and beautiful animation in a unique mix of eastern and western style bring said world to life, and surprisingly clever dialog seal the deal and turn this show into an epic adventure with a solid plot executed as close to perfection as this humble reviewer has ever seen.",

Now as a 20 year old, I can appreciate many of the complexities of the story that I didn't quite grasp as a kid. The thing is, as a kid, the show was funny and action-packed enough to keep me entertained. But as an adult, the show is well written, and deep enough to keep me hooked.I must admit i'm a sucker for a good fantasy story, enjoying stories like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. This, however, is (in my opinion) the perfect mix of comedy, story/world building, and action. It is great for all ages, and gets a 10/10 from me for all those reasons AND its amazing rewatchability. Each time you rewatch it, you'll pick up on small details and foreshadowing that you didn't notice on the first few times you watched the show.This show is a perfect mix of all things that make a fun and entertaining show. It's a kids show but I guarantee you will not be sorry watching this no matter your age.",

            "content": "With all the cartoons Nickelodeon has come out with in the past few years, I have to say Avatar: The Last Airbender definitely takes the cake. From the very first episode to the last, Avatar never failed to impress me. Even though I was never a huge anime fan, I applaud the good quality, Asian-style animation. The mature themes in Avatar also make it stand out from Nickelodeons other shows. The show addresses serious subjects like what is good or evil, the balance between man and nature, and spirituality. Being partly a comedy, there is plenty of humor that at times made me literally laugh out loud, but it also a drama, with the characters being very memorable and lifelike.I find the fact that the people of this world can \"bend\" elements very original, and well executed. There are natural laws that the cartoonists set for this world, like how one can only bend the element of their respective Nation (water, fire, earth, or air). Only the Avatar, chosen to protect the balance of the world between the four Nations, can bend all four elements. In this show, the Avatar is an Airbender named Aang, who along Sokka and Katara from the Water Tribe, set off to stop the imperialistic Fire Nation from taking over the world. The characters are in constant life-or-death situations, which makes it part of the action/adventure genre. The fight scenes look cool, and watching the characters use psychic martial arts to manipulate their environment is awesome. Unlike most other children's shows, the main characters, the \"good guys,\" don't always win against the \"bad guys,\" or if they do it might be at a price. The characters, being flawed and human, sometimes find themselves questioning what is right or wrong, or even if what they are doing good or evil.The creators of this show borrow elements of culture from the Chinese, Japanese, Indians, and Inuits. The world of Avatar is unique, complete with its own history and visually stunning natural landscapes and cities. Some people make fun of it by calling it a \"fake anime,\" saying that it was a bunch of American animators who copied Japanese cartoons. But I fail to see how this is a bad thing. They are simply blurring the lines between Western and Eastern animation, and in the end making a product that takes the best of both worlds.I can't say Nickelodeon has had any cartoons this good since this show has ended. They made a live action movie off of the first season directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which was absolutely terrible and nearly ruined the show for many fans. Hopefully they can redeem this franchise with the upcoming spin off series The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra, set to come out in mid-2012. If they keep the humor, great animation, and mature themes as they did in the first series, I will definitely watch Legend of Korra when it comes out.",

A big leap. And furthermore, it's on Nick. Nick viewers aren't used to to shows like this. Shows with developing characters, and a deep story. But despite that, and what you may hear from others, Avatar is a popular show. I wouldn't be surprised if this show went far. It has humor, a good bit of it, and those cute anime faces we all love (well, anime fans). It has action. It even gives us a reason to cry once and a while (if you like the show enough). And romance, of course, if you look for it. Overall, this show is worth a watch. However, you have to start from the beginning, so you know what's going on. I give it a 9/10.",

Lots of powerful male and female characters; complexity in the enemies, just like Ghibli films (especially Zuko but not just him); very stylistic if spare animation art; a healthy dose of humor; and above all, the epic plot, combined with excellent character development, make this show unique among children's animated series that I have seen. It might best be classified as Young Adult, but it is still hugely appealing to younger children. I loved it as well: even if I didn't see every episode, the kids filled me in. And the penultimate episode which featured Team Avatar watching a fire-nation play about their own exploits was pure genius.Watched November 2020-January 2021\nWatched Again: February-early March 2021 (not quite binge-watching: 1-2 shows each weekday, 2-4 each weekend day)Favorite Characters:\nSebastian: Appa and Sokka\nSienna: Appa and Toph\nPaul: Uncle Iroh.",

Zuko was possibly the best written character in any show I can think of with his brilliant redemption arc. It was a fantastic show and I found myself having 20 favourite episodes.And then when I didn't think it could get any better, I watched Sozin's comet.

I would simply stop in the middle of an episode and discuss characters, their actions and motivations with my son - this show has great stories about courage, compassion, morality, diversity, responsibility and growing up.

No character is left unexamined and the writers have managed to create a realistic-feeling world for them to inhabit. Many of the concepts are derived from Eastern philosophy, martial arts and traditions boasting a most diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and settings.

It has a very distinct style and characters who are easy to fall in love with. It's suitable for kids and adults.Wait, it's better than suitable. It's absolutely recommended for people of all ages and deserves its spot on IMDB's top 20 TV.

It retains a strong moral identity and never loses its backbone. It dabbles in philosophy and ethics without sacrificing its moralism or compromising its fantastically fleshed out characters.Avatar is simply a television classic. It is a western love letter to anime, and it nails it. Seriously, don't let your ego stand in the way of experiencing Avatar.Binge all 30 hours or so of this on Netflix and you'll understand why a 33 year old man in 2020 can be moved nearly to tears by a Nickelodeon cartoon made in 2005.",

            "content": "Wow. I can't believe this is my first ever IMDB review that isn't spoiler free. You know a series or film is a true masterpiece when you can't seem to write a review for it that doesn't contain spoilers.Wow. Just wow. I have never seen such amazing world building in any story I've seen or read. I have never felt so many emotions while watching a cartoon. This is truly the American equivalent of Majo No Tabitabi. This is Majo No Tabitabi but it's a war fantasy instead of a coming-of-age fantasy. I think that Majo No Tabitabi is a 10\\10 masterpiece, and because of that, I also think that Avatar : The Last Airbender is also a 10\\10 masterpiece (Also, I know Avatar : The Last Airbender premiered 15 years before Majo No Tabitabi).Anyways, on to my points :1. Story\nGood Story Traits - Zuko's redemption is just as emotional and believable as Shoya's redemption in Koe No Katachi (Which is also a masterpiece). The friendship between Aang, Katara and Sokka is a friendship that feels less of a cartoon friendship but more of an actual friendship you would see in real life. All of the characters are well-written and unique in their own way. Not to mention, this is the best world building I have ever seen in a story. The war is engaging and I always want to see if it's gonna end well or if it's gonna get worse. The elements thing is super interesting. The lore is so fun to learn about. Seriously, I was always exited when they introduce something new about the lore and magic system of this amazing and magical elemental world. Also, this is one of the most satisfying cartoon endings ever. I was straight up bawling my eyes out when Aang and Katara kissed in the finale. This series is like Violet Evergarden except it was premiered in 2005 instead of 20218. While Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece of an anime that take mainly focuses on a former soldier lady trying to find herself back into society after the end of a war, Avatar : The Last Airbender is basically the same thing but the war is still ongoing and there's also magic (Magic is not present in Violet Evergarden since it's supposed to be a realistic post war story, unless you count Violet's Auto Memory Doll job as \"magic). And I know I keep on comparing this cartoon series to anime series that premiered years after this ended, I really think comparing it makes sense. Even tho Violet Evergarden premiered in Winter 2018 and Majo No Tabitabi premiered in Fall 2020, they both still feel like more anime versions of this series. And besides, Violet Evergarden, Majo No Tabitabi and Avatar : The Last Airbender are all 10\\10 masterpieces in my eyes, so I can compare them all I want! Also, I only compared Avatar : The Last Aibender to Koe No Katachi because both it's \"villains\" had super emotional and believable redemptions, and bsides the redemptions, there's no other similarities they share (Besides being animated). Koe No Katachi isn't even a fantasy. Anyways, Avatar's world building is quite like no other fantasy world and I honestly think that no other story could top it's amazing writing when it comes to building it's world, conflict, plot and characters. Every location in this series is magically unique and I want to travel there if they are real. Also, the lore of this world feels like Southeast Asian mythology. As a Southeast Asian (Specifically Filipino), I appreciate how instead of being mainly inspired by European mythology like most fantasy series, it got more inspired by Southeast Asian mythology, giving us the representation that's super rare in American media in 2005. Of course, there's a lot of things in this world that are obviously inspired more by European mythology, but majority of the lore and world is inspired by Southeast Asian mythology, and obviously as a Filipino, I adore that! The war story feels like World War II with magic and that's pretty fun since World War II is a super interesting topic in history. It's like the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom are the allies while the Fire Nation is the axis powers. And the Air Nomads... Idk I guess they're the countries that got absolutely destroyed by the axis in the war.Bad Story Traits - There are none, there are absolutely none. This is a perfect 10\\10 masterpiece.2. Animation\nGood Animation Traits - Absolutely stunning backgrounds and memorable designs. I swear the animals are so cute I want to adopt them. The element bending scenes are super intense and they feel real. The designs for the cities give me medieval Europe vibes. It makes me feel like I'm living in Western or Southern Europe even tho I'm literally sitting here in Southeast Asia. It kinda feels weird that the outfits are Asian inspired while the backgrounds are European inspired, but that's okay because it still fits well with the story of a fantasy version of World War II.Bad Animation Traits - Like I said this is an absolute 10\\10 masterpiece so if there's nothing wrong with the story there's nothing wrong with the animation.Overall this series is perfect. I haven't seen The Legend Of Korra yet but I think I'm gonna watch the first episode later after I have written this review. I hope The Legend Of Korra is just as better as this tho. But even if The Legend Of Korra ends up also becoming a masterpiece, it will never overthrown this. Avatar : The Last Airbender is a perfect 10\\10 masterpiece that will never be overthrown by any other story ever.",

The Avatar is the only person who can bend all four elements, Earth, wind, fire, and air. But at the age of twelve, he is frozen in a block of ice. 100 years later, Sokka and Katara of the southern water tribe find him and free him. Turns out that in 100 years, the fire nation has taken over, and all other airbenders have become extinct. Now Aang must master the four elements, that way he can take down the fire lord. But he is being hunted, by the fire lords son Zuko.This is a really good show, I has some great action, good voice work, terrific animation, and even some good comedic moments.

            "content": "This really is a kids/family show like no other. Rarely have I seen a family show so effortlessly communicate such a rich and mature story to children without pandering or talking down to viewers or watering down more emotionally intense moments of the story. It's a beautiful looking show too, with all the backgrounds either hand drawn or watercolour, creating a very unique and original looking and very well established world along with some great effort put into character design, which was also hand drawn, whether it was done in Adobe Flash or not. The only complaint for the animation I have is that sometimes the colour pallete can look a bit muddy and dull, but doesn't actually subtract from the overall atmosphere of the story, because of course this show has its darker aspects, which I commendThe funny thing is, is that I never watched this show as a kid. As someone who had their childhood in the entirety of the 2000s decade, as well as access to Foxtel and Nickelodeon. I would activley watch every Nickelodeon show except for this one. I would watch Rugrats, Spongebob, Wild Thorberrys, Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Odd Parents, everything except Avatar, and I still don't understand why it's outward appearance was unappealing to me, but I guess I'll try to explainHaving a show based around magic around the four elements of Water, Earth, Fire and Air felt strangely limited to me, which is funny when you think about it, because I knew it already different from other franchises like Harry Potter which showcased a multitude of different types of spells with layered functions. I just didn't know just how far they could go with a framework that in my mind felt limited. I also had similar complaints about the show's locations. But I was almost instantly proven wrong when I actually started watching it. They truly go above and beyond of just what elemental bending powers are and what can be done with it. By the time the series is over, everything that you could have imagined that could have been exploited with elemental bending, the shows creators would have probably already thought of and exhausted before moving on to another ideas and possibilities.The characters themselves are also very likeable and memorable. There are no throwaway characters in Avatar, every character is layered and complex with each of their own arcs and time to shine. Prince Zuko is an incredible antagonist with such layered depth, where we gradually start to understand exactly the way he's feeling and why the way he is as the show goes on. Oh and spoiler alert, probably has one of the best redemption arcs I have ever seen. Aang himself is so infectiously likeable with a radiating childlike wonder and friendliness to an extent is pretty rare to find in most other kids shows as much as he does. You constantly feel like your on this journey with him as the seasons go by and how he learns and grows throughout with all the carefully planned plot points, locations and memorable moments. Sokka and Katara are also excellent supporting characters, aswell as Appa being their trusty transport buddy.And then there's Zuko's uncle, General Iroh. Seriously who doesn't love this guy? What an incredible supporting character, he is definitely the most memorable character of the show behind Aang, with such charm and wisdom. When I was watching the seiries on Netflix for the first time last year, I would often remember small nuggets of what he said on the back of my mind when I was going about my day and falling asleep at night, you really feel inspired by this character and wish to be more like him, which is very powerful because there are very few fictional character that have even made me think that at all.Overall, this is basically everything done right in a kids show and in a way, was kind of a saving grace for kids/family programming in the 2000s alongside the 2005 reboot of Doctor Who, and I'm not saying that TV media was as a whole in any way bad during that decade, but you could tell that there was a considerable decline in quality in certain aspects with the rise of reality TV. Nickelodeon was still going strong in the early 2000s with the release of Spongebob Squarepants in 1999, following the boom of the 90s nicktoons. But Avatar proved quality over quantity in the following decade, that one show could outshine many previous releases and then some.So yes, I did thoroughly enjoy Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I'm happy that I actually finally watched it too, and I really hope Netflix doesn't pull it down, because it's the best way to easily access the show now to easily binge. It is short however with only 3 seasons, but it's shorter length is made up in richness of story and character, and I'm happy they didn't feel the need to stretch it out over more seasons and just kept the story the way it is, and it's really a miracle a show aimed at kids even exists at all, and all I have to say is that I wish there were more shows like it of just how it was executed and did what it did. It really is the show that keeps on giving.",

            "content": "It's amazing what you can discover (or in this case rediscover) on Netflix. There I was scrolling through the shows and there I found something from my childhood Avatar the Last Airbender which I loved when it first came on, I watched season 1&2 in their entirety but missed a few episodes of season 3 and as I don't like leaving things unfinished I watched season 1-3 over the weekend. Now I was expecting the same thing that happened when I watched some Power Ranger episodes that it is actually not that good and should have just left it alone, not tainting the perfect image in my head. However I can say with no doubt that this show is timeless and a must watch for any child as well as being thoroughly entertaining for grown ups. This show lends it self to both a young and old audience (the season 2 and 3 do this the best) There are characters, story arcs, plot points and jokes that I found just as interesting (and humorous) as I did when I first watched it 10 years ago. The story set in this fantastically created fictional world where there are four nations the fire nation (the baddies of the show) the water tribes of the North and south poles) the earth Kingdom and the air temples of the North, East south and west. And in these four nations are these people who can bend the elements of there respected nation. It is about this boy Aang who is the next avatar (someone who can bend all four elements) who after a shocking discovery leaves his home in the southern air temple and ends up getting frozen in ice for a hundred years. He is then discovered by brother and sister Katara and Sokka who are from the southern water tribe and after he is awakened from his 100 year slumber he discovers that the fire nation have been at war with the world for a 100 years and that his people have disappeared. He return is soon picked up by Prince Zuko of the fire nation who has been banished only to return when he captures the avatar and is accompanied by his Uncle Iroh. Aang also learns that he must master all four elements to stop the fire nations plan that will destroy the balance of the world. The story itself is great expanding epic but it's some of the smaller plot lines that can either be intriguing, funny or even emotionally evoking. And the characters are fantastic, Aang has a sort of captain America vibe to him in the sense that the world has changed so much from what he remembered it and he has to adapt to that but he also if fun carefree (most of the time) and has a strong bond with his friends and his pets Appa ( a flying bison with six legs...no really) and momo a mischievous flying lemur. Katara is a very strong female character which is not surprising since she and her brother lost their mother at a young age and their father is now fighting in the war as well as her being the last water bender from the South Pole. She and Aang also have a will they won't they romantic storyline that is very sweet and doesn't feel too cheesy or forced. Sokka is a bit of a screw up and the comic relief but he is also trying to fill his fathers shoes and be a great leader like him. Later on in season two we get many more characters on both sides like toph a young female blind earth bender who is funny and forthright, Azula who is Zukos sister and favoured child of their father and many more. All are great but two who really stand out for me are Zuko and uncle Iroh. Zuko as a villain for the majority of the show isn't doing this for purely evil reasons, he wants to capture the avatar because he wants to return home and have his glory and more importantly his fathers love returned to him, making him very interesting and conflicted in the later series. And Iroh is a old wise war veteran who is absolutely hilarious at some points, badass at others and tear jerking at others and there relationship is a very strong bond, the father/son I never had type that is very well done. In fact this show is very well made in general though it does suffer from a couple of episodes that aren't really necessary and only there to make it X amount of episodes, but since breaking bad and game of thrones also suffer from that it's not really a bit complaint. All in all this show was meant for kids and yes there are elements of that with some character moments, story arcs and so on but even those are still enjoyable to an older audience. When I finished this show late on Sunday night I felt this mixture of sadness and happiness that I only feel when I finish something so great that even though I understand that it had to finished at some point I still wanted more. 10/10 Also if your off put from watching this due to that atrocious film by M. Nightshamaladingdong then let me tell you that has nothing on this show may as well just forget it all together.",

Deus Ex Machina (Latin for a god in a machine) is an old saying used to reference when Greek plays would solve the crises they depicted through divine intervention. Aristotle considered it an overused and frustrating literary device.Now Deus Ex Machina refers to when towards the end of a story something happens completely outside of the plot's prior context to solve the situation.Aang's victory over Ozai was a Deus Ex Machina.Yes, I am aware of the fact that the existence of Lion Turtles was priorly established but Aristotle made it clear in the Poetics that if Apollo were to appear at the end of Oedipus Rex it would be a Deus Ex Machina. Apollo's off-stage activity in Oedipus is kind of a big deal.That said I do acknowledge the fact that Avatar is a children's cartoon and it is unlikely that Nickelodeon would have allowed for one of its main characters to kill Ozai. As such I am willing to be forgiving of this flaw (though I would consider it egregious almost anywhere else).Everything else about Avatar, I love. Sokka is a hilarious character and actually had great character development. Uncle Iroh was hilarious comic relief and an excellent mentor figure.Katara in the Southern Raiders morphed into one of the show's most nuanced and complex characters.And (spoilers) everything about Prince Zuko's redemptive arc is great. I would actually consider it my favourite redemptive arc in all of fiction.While Long Feng and Princess Azula are great villains.And the show delivers an excellent blend of comedy and drama.If it weren't for the Deus Ex Machina at the end, I would have given it 10 instead of 9.",

He travels around the world as he tries to master all four skills, but the fire benders who had ravaged his temple and killed his people keep trying to stop him.

And another plus is that the animation is great, in fact it is so great that Nickelodeon spends about $1 million on each show. It costs more than making 2 Spongebob episodes. Its basically about a child prodigy with unique air bending powers, who is the Avatar master of all 4 elements, who must save the world from the Fire Nation along with his friends. Katara a water bender, and Sokka, Katara's warrior brother,Appa a giant flying bison, and Momo Aang's(the avatar)pet lemur. Basically the future for Earth is at stake and the people depend on Aang to save them.",

            "content": "As an animated series conceived and aired primarily for the young teenager audience, Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA), is a seminal accomplishment of its genre. While the cartoon can be seen to relate a simple story on the surface, it is able to pack many mature themes within its episodes that can be gleaned and appreciated by adult watchers. The principal characters have satisfying journeys through the course of the show and the art, animation, voice acting and soundtrack are gorgeous.That said, its restricted target audience does keep it from explicit portrayal of numerous aspects. It also has a slow build-up with the initial few episodes appearing quite childish. Some of the villains are given minimal to no character development, the world appears exceedingly small given the frequency with which nemeses encounter each other, and a lot of the plot progression becomes exceedingly rushed near the end of the series.ATLA does an excellent job at what it set out to do, namely creating a beautiful and enthralling animated series primarily meant for teenagers while conveying more serious themes with appropriate gravitas that can be reflected on by adults.",

            "content": "Shows that are good for the whole family are very, very difficult. Most of them are great for children and terrible for everybody else. The very concept of the \"family\" genre is generally a false pretense. However, Avatar is truly a show for the whole family.Very few episodes, if any, can be considered filler. The homage and love of Asian culture is evident and will certainly provoke educational questions in a young mind, and the theme and learning lesson in each episode is more or less directly stated, but restrained enough that any child can take something from it and few adults will be irritated by it.The world building isn't perfect, but it's damn close. The viewer is consistently fed enough images of the greater world that it's inner workings are plenty without evoking endless questions. Oh, it will evoke questions: \"Why din't they just make an ice bridge? Why doesn't the avatar just fly everybody away?\" It'll happen, but unlike many fantastical series, it won't ruin your experience. For example, my question (as always, at this point) is why aren't there guns? Why is the fire nation, a nation that has access to incredibly advanced technology and machinery, still using trebuchets on their warships? There's no answer to that question, but unlike most shows, I easily forget this question. In general, everything works cohesively enough that it's easy for an unreasonably skeptical adult such as myself to forget their misgivings and enjoy the story.Oh my gosh, the sound design? It's perfect. It's consistently perfect. It's no easy task to make the process of manipulating water, fire, sand, rock, and lightning sound natural, and this show does it flawlessly. The fact that few people even think about the sound design is a testament to how convincing it is.The story is good. Actually, it's REALLY good. I don't even want to take the time to dive deeply, it's just really good. The characters are great, the visual storytelling is superb. It takes you back to a time when animators drew everything. Sure, there's plenty of 3D effects and assets to help out, but this show feels genuine and innately human in its animation style. I can feel the time that every frame took, and that's important.Overall, as far as American TV-Y7 rated shows go, this and Spongebob Squarepants have to be the best. Seriously. Give it your time, you won't be disappointed.",

It is associated with qualities of practicality, restraint, and materialism, and with the physical, sensuous aspects of life. It represents strength, abundance, stability, and femininity. Earth is represented by burying objects in the earth, herbalism, and making images out of wood or stone. Earth's place on the pentagram is the lower left point.Fire:-Fire is considered to be primarily hot and secondarily dry. It is associated with the qualities of energy, assertiveness, and passion. Fire represents energy, inspiration, passion, and masculinity. Fire is represented in the forms of burning objects, love spells, baking, and lighting candles and fires. Fire's place on the pentagram is the lower right point.Air:-Air is considered to be primarily moist and secondarily warm. It is associated with the qualities of mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate. It represents Mind, intellect, consciousness, study, communication, and masculinity. Air's place on the pentagram is the upper left point.Water:-Water is considered to be both cold and wet. It is associated with the qualities of emotion and intuition. It represents emotions, wisdom, the soul, and femininity. It is represented in the forms of pouring water over objects, brew making, healing spells, ritual bathing, and tossing objects into bodies of water. Water's place on the pentagram is the upper right point.Spirit (Avatar State):- The Combination of four. You are in spiritual state. It is beyond our everyday experience, things composed of pure energy. Bodily, it represents spirit, thought, and creative energy. It represents our ability to think and to communicate, as well as our creativity. It can also be associated with power, creativity, spontaneity, and inventiveness. Through this state we connect to everyone through the entire universe.Now, to the real part. I have never seen such a wonderful and a phenomenal anime show. The characters are handled really well. The comedy, the adventure, the action, the romance, the friendship are handled really well. A very valuable to respect each and everyone's life. Including that of the animals and plants as well.

About two years ago I noticed a lot of others re-watching Avatar and went back to watch it myself. This time though it wasn't the action or colors that held my interest It was the characters, the story, and its surprisingly advanced themes. Almost none of the characters are flat or one sided. From the main antagonist having a moral crisis to a street vendor completing an off screen story arc Avatar does not fail in the development department. The story isn't just a string of small vignettes like many other \"narrative\" focused shows. It has defined beginning, middle, and ending story lines. In season one the audience sees the basic story setup for the whole series and its own climax and partial resolution. The second season gave depth to the shows main characters and had its own climax and partial resolution. While the final season ties up many loose ends and of course completes the series. All this is happening while amazing adult life lesson and themes are sprinkled around in every episode. Over the course of the show we're given dozens of eastern anecdotes and shown themes like redemption, ambiguity, indifference, conditioning, and sacrifice. With these three major pluses going for the show I have to recommend this to everyone. It will not fail to catch, hold, and turn your interest over its three seasons.",

The avatar disappears. 100 years later...A young boy(12 years old) is the avatar and has been given that task of saving the world from the Fire Nation. A comet is coming, and Aang has to kill Firelord OZAI(leader of Fire Nation) before a comet(Sozin's Comet) arrives and gives every fire bender unstoppable power.The story line is very good and the characters really grow on you. It's great. It's not like the usual anime that Nickolodean show. It's different. It's fresh. I love it. The plot has everything in bundles. Action, Romance(not so much), Comedy and just about everything genre you could think of. The Cliffhangers and suspense is done in a different way at the end of different episodes.The fighting scenes are sublime. Absolutely great. The producers consulted a trained martial artist before every episode to make the moves as realistic as possible. And it really shows.I would recommend this show to everyone, any age , anyone.

Or I may have just been lucky to see them in order, I can't remember. The show was one of my favorite things to watch at the time and I love the messages the story gives. This show has great character development and really drives the story in each episode. The morals that are placed in the story are great. I'm a big fan of the comedic relief that is in each and every episode, while still giving the story it's inner workings which may not be upbeat at times. This show is great for most people and I would easily recommend it to people.The show originally being an American cartoon made me a little worried as I'm not a big fan of those cartoon shows, with very few I will hold in high admiration. The show has an amazing story which I can't get over. The great fire nation war on all the nations and the world's last hope being freed by the South Pole's last water bender. As the Avatar travels the world to master the elements, running from fire nation prince Zuko, his friends and him teaches the audience many lessons that are important in life. From respecting everyone equally to even some of the most challenging things, like respectfully following ancient practices to keep our history alive.I have little time on my hands but when I do have time, It is very hard to get me to like a show as much as I did this one.

            "content": "What's to say about Avatar: The Last Airbender? This show is pretty darn popular, its success has even lead to the creation of a feature film, and two more to come. But there is in fact a lot to be said about this show. Why do I think so? Because, this is much more than just another kid's show, and there's a lot of people out there that simply don't know this yet. There's a lot of people out there that still wouldn't even consider sitting down and using (approximately) 25 hours of their time to discover the fictional tale of the last airbender, and these same people may find it becoming one of their favourites if they did. I sure was in that position; I was already surprised when I found out it was only 60 episodes long, and the creators hadn't cashed in on its success by prolonging it any longer. I really thought Avatar was basically the American equivalent of Naruto in that respect, but now I understand. No, the people who made this show didn't make a show so that they could keep it going as long as they could and make as much cash as possible. On the contrary, they did us, the rest of the world, a great favour by producing a kid's show this good - and respectable - in so many areas.Though I obviously haven't hesitated to call it a kid's show (it was broadcast on Nickelodeon, after all), there are many reason's behind my calling it 'more than just another kid's show'. This action/adventure series is exactly what that kind of show should be; smart, funny and exciting. Let's start with 'smart'. The plot isn't Neon Genesis Evangelion style deep, and thank God it isn't. However, what makes it smart is how it presents its story, characters and ideas. The characters here are incredibly believable ones, and the way they are presented is not only entertaining on a basic, fun level, but a deeper level that examines what it means to be human very effectively. Speaking of this, one specific character can't be justified in not being mentioned: Zuko. Character development is another strong area with the show, and again, on this point, Zuko has to be focused on. Zuko is all over the place from beginning to end in regards to what he feels, thinks and believes in. He really is one of, if not the greatest example of a character being used to examine what it means to be human that I have ever seen. If I had to choose a favourite character, it would be him, if only for the emotional attachment I felt to him by the time the show was reaching its final episodes. I really cared about the guy. I don't want to go into too much detail, but you'll understand if you witness his story for yourself. Avatar features a whole host of interesting moral dilemmas, characters and causes worth caring about, and more.It is for these reasons that I must give the series' creators my kudos, as what makes the show smart in these respects is good for us all. I'm 18 years old, and I enjoyed the interesting characters and ideas of Avatar, and I'm sure people of all ages could. But what also came to mind as I was watching the epic, amazing finale is that it's also a great thing that it is a kid's show. Characters this deep and real and ideas this relevant aren't things you see in your average episode of SpongeBob, and while SpongeBob is great for what it is (really), Avatar is something that would be good and beneficial for your kids to watch. Azula's descending into madness in the last episodes may be the kind of thing that I'm sure turned at least a few parent's heads. Let's face it, a lot of parents are a bit overprotective when it comes to what their kids are watching nowadays; however, Azula is just another example of the show being real with its viewers, including the kids. It's still a kid's adventure show, and not the most realistic thing ever televised, but it goes where a lot of kid's shows dare not to in a mature and intelligent way. I know that this is the kind of show I'd love my future kids to watch; full of conflict (heck, it's a war story), but one that would really teach them something. After everything, Aang's final choice (I'm not going to spoil anything too badly here) about how to resolve everything is definitely something I'd want my kids to see, and remember.On a more brief note, of course, the show is also funny and exciting. There were some truly hilarious and well-executed comedic moments all- throughout season one, two and three, and the action just plain rocked. I was on the edge of my seat watching fight scenes like Aang vs. Azula on 'the drill' (season two highlight sup) and the final battle. The entertainment the show offered on this level was a great compliment to everything else that already made it excellent. Speaking of the end, although I'd already enjoyed the series so far and heard that it was epic, I was still very impressed. It would have been nice to actually see just a couple more things resolved, but otherwise it was brilliant.Now, what more can I say about Avatar: The Last Airbender? If you're not opposed to a good action/adventure story, but haven't seen it yet, all I can say is give it a chance, no matter what age you are. If you have kids, watch it with them. The fact that people actually sat down and made a kid's show like this gives me a lot more faith in my fellow man.",

That's the beauty about Avatar, the writing is perfect!The show has its filler episodes as do most cartoons, but the main episodes that push the plot forward are really done well, you can see the effort in the animation.All in all, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a wonderful cartoon for both children and adults.",

I can always return to it and never be bored, and feel the same amount of excitement as I did when I first watched it. I only rated it a 9 because it does have a couple problems, but they a barely noticeable and at best are nitpicks.

            "content": "I watched Avatar: The Last Airbender on TV a couple times, and I became to be very impressed by it. My brother and I rented every DVD and watched every episode of this masterpiece and we were blown away. There hasn't been, and there never will be another kid's show as brilliant and as epic as this one.First, the animation. Not only is it beautiful, but it is also unique. It's almost a mixture of cartoon animation and anime, though it's not officially anime. Compared to the other kid shows on today, which are mostly lazy computer animated characters with big heads and no depth, Avatar has the best animation of them all. The landscapes are beautiful, breathtaking, and impossible to not take seriously.Next, the plot. The story follows the same basic plot line throughout: Aang has to defeat the Firelord in order to bring balance to the world and unite the separate nations. The story is epic and powerful, with a lot of other important and interesting subplots and lessons we could all learn. Whoever wrote the stories for each episode were not only geniuses, but they knew what they were doing and they did an incredible job.The Characters. I've never had so many favorite characters from one show before. They each have their own quirks, their own style, and they all can be loved and related to. Aang is the main character we can all relate to, having to accomplish a great task and unsure if he is able to do it. He really is someone to cheer for throughout the show. Katara is lovable, with her gentle spirit and her motherly tendencies. She is also someone to admire. When she is angry, she will stand and fight for her and her friends no matter what, and she never gives up. Sokka is the main comic relief of the show, and he never stops making me laugh. He is also has a good heart and an unyielding loyalty to his friends. Toph is sarcastic, powerful, and just plain awesome. Zuko at first is someone to hate, but not for long. It takes a few episodes to see what has made him so angry and confused about himself, and he turns into a character to really feel sorry for (example: the story of how he got his scar). He makes a turnaround and he becomes yet another lovable character. Now Iroh, Zuko's uncle has to be the best character of them all. He's calm, funny, and seemingly a bit lazy, but he really is a wise old man, and sort of a \"good guy on the bad guy side\". He's very fatherly towards Zuko and he's very caring and patient with him, even at his worst. Not only that, but in combat, Iroh kicks BUTT. He really does. My personal favorite part of the show what when he asks: \"Do you know how I got the nickname 'The Dragon of the West'?\" and he spews fire out of his mouth. PURE AWESOMENESS. All the characters are worth watching and admiring in this show.The feeling this show leaves behind is powerful, and it really makes you want to know what happens in the next episode. What I loved about the very last episode was, not only was the conclusion of the show completely EPIC, but it also answered questions, brought closure to the characters' conflicts, and it left a feeling of great satisfaction at the end that everything had worked out perfectly.This is the best show that Nickelodeon has ever produced. After this show ended and Spongebob began to decline, Nick has never been worth watching. What they need to do is look hard at this show, and try to work out some new shows that kick butt as well as this show did.",

            "content": "Avatar is one of those once-in-a-blue-moon kind of series that is up there with Batman: The Animated Series and Animaniacs as one of the greatest kids' cartoon shows ever. With a wildly colourful world, sprawling mythology, lovable and multidimensional characters, sharp writing and a level of maturity extremely rarely seen in kids' shows, it's a flat-out masterpiece. The characters grow and change over time in believable and significant ways. The tone always stays consistent. The comedy is laugh-out loud funny without resorting to low-brow humor or adult jokes. The stakes rise every season, yet the show never devolves into brainless action. The writing is very sharp and manages to explore complex and unusual themes like broken families, finding one's way in life, loss, responsibility and escapism not often seen in kids' shows. The show's main cast consists of well-rounded and believable characters with distinct personalities and flaws, and they all are interesting in their own ways. The series spends a lot of time exploring their pasts and finding out how they turned out the way they are. Some characters don't quite reach this level, but to count that as a major flaw would be just nitpicking. What separates Avatar even further from the majority of cartoon series is its overarching story with a clear goal and villain defined from almost the word go. Yet this setup never wears itself out during the three seasons, instead taking its time in raising the stakes. Some episodes around two thirds into the series go to really dark places and you'll find yourself thinking \"Did that just happen in a kids' show?\" The action scenes are very exciting and creative, taking place in places like underground caves, on top of mountains and on zeppelins.Unfortunately, the show doesn't always use its potential to the fullest, opting mostly for separate one-episode story lines instead of one continuous story. Some of the tension raised at the start of season 3 gets lost as the series goes back to its standard formula after a very striking start. It doesn't really bring the direness of the situation across, but I guess there's only so much darkness you can have in a kids' show. Recommendation: As one of the best cartoons of all time, The Last Airbender is a magnificent series to viewers of all ages that will stand the test of time. As a kids' show it's a full 10, but due to the sometimes wonky story structure and some wasted potential, overall it's a nine.",

At first, I had not much interest, but now after I recently re-watched the entire show within only a week, honestly, it deserves the cult following and legacy it has made. This is certainly not just some children's show. It is a classic that everyone should watch at some point in their lives. I have several things I would like to inform the reader about in this review.First, the art style and storytelling. The drawing style of mixing western animation with anime was fitting considering it focuses on a lot of Asiatic themes such as chakras, bending, and martial arts. The series also has excellent character development. It focuses on the main protagonist, Aang, on his journey to becoming the master of all four elements. I enjoyed the character development in this show as with all shows with a definite plot.Next, the themes I also enjoy the fact the people in this are inspired by real-world cultures and eras. For example, the fire bender soldier's armor and apparel look like a cross between Japanese and Mongolian warriors, and water benders look like a mix of Alaska native and other Arctic native cultures. The series also has life lessons that you would expect in a children's show. However, while this has very some very heartfelt moments, it does have many dark themes such as war, tyranny, genocide, and many other themes some would think not to belong in children's entertainment.There are many other things I could talk about in this review, but I would hate to spoil it for the reader. The only thing I will say is if you have Netflix, you need to watch this. It is the best series since Spongebob Squarepants. I recommend it.",

The series opens with a two-parter, \"The Boy In The Iceberg\" and \"The Avatar Returns\". Each episode of the series has a short introductory segment that provides some background for novices. For adult viewers, this 100-year-war is a little problematic because it doesn't make much sense. Katara is a novice waterbender, and her brother Sokka appears to be a terrible navigator. We also meet Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation, who is on a quest to find the Avatar.Season 2: Season 2 adds to the cast while also delving deeper into the characters. This is especially true in the case of Iroh and Zuko, who have a touching past involving Iroh's late son. With uncertainties regarding Zuko's objectives and a suspenseful final episode, the series comes to a close.Season 3: \"The Book of Fire,\" holds the darkest chapters, including the imprisonment and torture of a major character. Life in America looks and feels a lot like life in the Fire Nation as Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and eventually Zuko experience it.",

So in that light, perhaps it is perfection.This show will mean many different things to many different people and everyone will react differently to the messages, themes and subjects portrayed throughout but while it is divine to induldge in the settings, art, animation, music and story, the most magical part is how despite being seemingly abstract and fantasty, the characters are the most earthly, grounded representations of us imaginable.Every emotion, encounter, struggle, loss, hope, happniess, friendship and bond shared between the characters is shared by the viewer in kind. I have learnt more about myself through the wisdom and growth displayed therein and I constantly strive to challenge my own perception and ability to be the best I can be.Life is not perfect; we all make mistakes, learn from them, live, breathe and move on and that is the very reason why this show is perfect - It is the fullest representation of us.",

As a kid, I watched Drake and Josh, iCarly, Zack and Cody, but none seemed to be as mature as Avatar. Avatar was unique in its premise in that it explored genocide, war and cruelty: themes not seen in other kid shows at all.Each episode seems to have a grand purpose or to carry the themes or events from prior episodes. There are some filler episodes, but they are rare. Another aspect of the show that is amazing is the complex characters like Zuko. His transition from foe to ally was the best arc of the series and I was pleased to see that he was given a redemptive storyline.Despite the heavy topics and fascinating characters, it is still a kid's show and it is mired in that type of humor. I do believe that anyone of any age can watch the series because an adult can glean the messages of the show more clearly. An adult can also educate their child and bond with them.The Legend of Korra is a fantastic sequel series and builds upon the mythology of Avatar: The Last Airbender. I was a little too old when that came out unfortunately. Still, both series have fascinating characters and storylines that I have not seen in any other TV show or film; that is how unique and complex the world of Avatar is.I highly recommend this series.

There are great computer animations like Shrek, How to train your dragon, etc. but for the traditional animations i have reserves.BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED( haha) when I watched Avatar: The Last Airbender. What a great animation this is. Filled with heart, joy, laughs, but at the same time dark, showing the casualties of the wars, at times very intense. The characters were incredible and so full of life. Never have I felt attachment to a animated character before, but i did with Aang, Sokka, uncle Iroh and ESPECIALLY with one of the best characters ever on TV - Zuko. Zuko's character development and story arc were the best thing for me in this series. He went through so many transformations and crises, it was amazing to watch it. The story and the world created by the writers of the show was astonishing.I didn't get into the show until Season 2, for me the first season was slow and repetitive but the second and third is where the show catapulted into the skies. The finale was one of the best in almost any show (can't beat Breaking Bad's \"Felina\" ), every story arc was completed and almost no questions were left unanswered( except maybe Zuko's mother but I can live with that).The best animated shows for me are this amazing show and South Park. I love both of them but can't compare them because they are the absolute opposites.\"But I believe TV series like this can save the world\"",

It's deeper meaning and inner wisdom can genuinely change you as a person. It teaches you right from wrong, love from hate, happiness from sorrow... It's not just a show, but a guide to living a fulfilling life. Avatar: The Last Airbender is as memorable as it is beautiful. To start off, the animation is breathtaking. Play any episode and pause it at any scene and at any second and you can print it as a poster and hang it in your bedroom. Every single frame tells a story. The music and sound mix in general is also the epitome of sound in animation. Every note perfectly executed to the mood and every sound just... Works. From the individual musical themes of each character to the sounds of rushing water from a powerful water bender, the show just nails it. While on the topic of sound, the casting of the voice actors is sublime. It's hard to imagine a real life voice behind the characters, and that's what makes it great. I never hear the actor, but rather the character. Every line is delivered perfectly to distinguish the shows nature of comedy vs. drama. And when these two genres are combined (with the right execution) it creates an amazing experience for almost any audience. The story line is obviously the most important factor; without a story there is no show. The very concept is genius and the story behind the concept is simply amazing. If you haven't delved into this show yet, I would advise that you do. In an effort to not give away any spoilers, I will say that it's simply like nothing else, and you will be captivated within the first 10 minutes. By the end of season one, you will have associated yourself with one of the four elements (astronomically speaking it will be freakishly accurate) and you'll want to see how your story unfolds. Just give Avatar: The Last Airbender a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed. So good you might be inspired to get a tattoo, or at the very least... A bumper sticker that reads \"Yip Yip\".",

It features the life of three travellers, Aang, the last of a race of air'benders' who can control air, Katara, a water 'bender' and her brother who comes from the water tribe. The extended plot concerns a war between the Fire Nation and the peoples of the planet, which is shown at the beginning of every episode in map format, so it's easy to learn all the basics of the storyline even if you haven't seen all of it. But i recommend you do, for it's a great quality animation. From what iv'e seen i think the next series ought to be bonzer. In particular i like the way the actual elements are animated when 'bended'. Rather than using the 'overdone' methods of Disney or flash, this uses a realistic system which, if 'bending' did exist in our dimension, would appear very similar. The background, 'setting', has the usual Asian inspired feel of all the martial arts/magic genre, but is very well drawn and makes shows like 'skunk fu' seem pathetic. The show is also entertaining too, and the humour, when it appears, is good. I think this series has great potential, maybe even a movie. Don't cancel it soon, we need to have something to show for all the years of good animation struggling against tacky flash.",

Before he started his vlogs, I had heard of Avatar: The Last Airbender as it was on GMTV On Saturday mornings. Back then, I only caught a glimpse of the show and it didn't catch my eye. But now I've grown up, Doug finished his vlogs and I decided I would try watching. And I'm so glad I did.Literally from the first episode, not only was I hooked but I managed to watch the entire series in just 3 days. This show is not only phenomenal for a kids show but for a TV show in general. The characters, the story, the animation and the premise, all of it completely flawless in its execution. It's probably the only show I've ever watched which managed to balance comedy, action and drama perfectly. And think about it. This was a show originally on Nickelodeon. It is simply incredible that it managed to be so good.Finally to end my review, I would like to explain the main reason this is my new favourite show. I would like to compare it to my original favourite TV show, Doctor Who. I know it's a weird comparison but hear me out. It is true that Doctor Who has some fantastic episodes in its library, like Blink or Midnight. Despite this, these episodes and a lot of the other great ones, didn't always fit into the main plot of the season. They were just episodes on their own. With Avatar: The Last Airbender, almost all 61 episodes in the series fitted together, creating one giant story which answered every question and filled on all plot holes. I have never seen an show of a movie do this. People need to look away from the fact this is a children's show and really look at what an outstanding achievement this show is.",

After watching the first 2 episodes I still wasn't sure whether or not this series had potential, I guess the problem was I was too eager to watch cool bending fights unfold, since now that I re-watched the series this episodes serve as pretty good introduction.But, when I finished episode 3 I knew; from that point on,that this series had it in him.The series's narrative has been worshiped by critics and viewers alike; myself included, it feels consistent, partialy because every season shares the same story but because every episode is entertaining and pretty great overall. The characters are very well written, displaying various dimensions of their personality and present realistic emotions/ feelings that can relate to any human being despite living in a different contextThe animation style is gorgeous, making element bending look even cooler than what the concept sounds like (seriously, trust me on this one), slashes of water and bolts of fire dance harmoniously during fights, clashing vibrantly in a splash of coulours.After I finished every last episode there is, I couldn't help but feel hollow and found it hard to go back to viewing regular animation with my younger brother after spending so much time watching quality animation.I feel like I've bickered long enough about how amazing the series is so i'll just say this: to whoever feels a little skeptical about this series because it's \"fake anime\" or a kid's show; don't hold back, it delivers much more than what it seems, and in my eyes, this series is just as good a kid's show than a regular TV show.",

All the people that watched Avatar have a favorite element, I am sure. But the cool thing is all the elements are different and therefore we like each of them for a different reason.

The voice acting and writing picked up very quickly. There are so many great characters: Zuko, Azula, Iroh, Toph - even Sokka (the comic relief) was fantastic. If you were to let your kids watch 1 series, it would be a coin toss between fraggle rock and the last air bender. The last air bender has more violence - but the acting and story are so brilliant, it's hard to pass this one up. The writers went onto a second series (legend of Korra).

Those who are lucky posses the power to bend one of the four elements (and every advantage given by them as you'll later see) resulting in some serious battles.

            "content": "This is one of the best rated TV shows, and it is easy to see why. Animated or not, it doesn't matter. This show has a single story that builds slowly through the seasons to a dramatic finale. If you have a preteen, and want something to watch with them, this is what you are looking for. (Assuming you haven't seen it)It isn't perfect, especially in season 1, there are some episodes that are a bit on the rougher side. I don't remember where it is exactly in the story, but the first season was definitely on the silly side. One episode is cute, especially for younger kids; but cringe-worthy for an adult to watch.I get the feeling that they were having demographic troubles in the early episodes, because there is enough stuff that refers to super younger kids that it doesn't mesh well with the extremely mature and thoughtful side of the later seasons. It is also on the earlier side of the 'META' story concept, and they didn't add as much 'adult friendly' content as you will find in, say 'Gravity Falls'.As the show predates Gravity Falls by about a decade, I think you can understand that this show was still cutting edge. If you want to go back further, try out 'Batman: The Animated Series' for a decade before Avatar. You can quickly see that producers were testing out the ability to field a more 'serious' carton, but were nervous that there wouldn't be enough 'silly' in it to capture the attention of the youngest audiences.Still this show is well written, and follows KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) and it pays out big. A simple, but powerful story, and they improved their pacing, not spoiled it. The best rated episode is the last, and it is truly worth watching the full show for. Adult or child should enjoy the full story.Although, without a kid, I would strongly recommend episodes you feel are a bit too boring. The story isn't that deep.",

            "content": "Well, where do I begin...The first time I saw this show, I was around 7 years old. I am now 18, and I have seen it all the way through at least 5 times now. I loved the show as a kid, but of course I didn't understand most of its themes and what made it great. As a teenager, I have recently seen the series during this summer yet again... and I enjoyed it even more so than I did as a kid.I think the overall structure and premise of this show is truly exceptional. After the first few episodes, we learn how the show will end since it is revealed that Aang learn all four elements and defeat the Fire Lord in order to end the Hundred Years war. Because of the plot point that Aang has the summer to prepare, the show is able to take its time to develop its outstanding main cast of characters through many of their somewhat random adventures.Avatar: The Last Airbender is essentially a coming of age show. The main characters are mostly kids in their early teenage years, and the show focuses on how the main gang mature throughout their journey. We see Aang struggle with the immense pressure and duties of being the Avatar, the world's savior, as well as being a twelve year old boy.jokes, but eventually develops into a true tactician and leader. Toph, despite being blind, becomes the world's greatest earthbender, and we see her slowly open up and learn what friendship means. Iroh is the show's most direct source of philosophy and wisdom. Katara is usually the person who keeps the group together, but in one of the best episodes of the series, we see her instability with the death of her mother.These characters are phenomenal, but the standout character of Avatar in my opinion is Zuko, who has one of the greatest redemption arcs I have ever seen. There is so much to be said about Zuko, but I'll leave the analysis of his character to someone else on this site. Even though he spends most of the show trying to capture Aang (and horribly failing at it), I couldn't help but root for him. You'll want him to just be a good person, but he makes so many mistakes, and all of them are so heartbreaking to watch. Zuko's story is one about struggle and destiny, and it is incredibly gripping.The animation and score here is outstanding, although admittedly the first season's visuals look quite dated (I would say the third season's animation is incredible even when compared to today's standards). I think the Last Agni Kai is one of the best examples of these two aspects of the show (as well as one of the best scenes in the show in general). Scenes where a hero is winning the fight against his/her sworn enemy are usually accompanied by triumphant horns, but here it is accompanied by somber strings, since in this case it is a fight to the death between brother and sister, people who are supposed to care for each other. Combine the tragic score with the beautiful saturated colors of red and blue flames, and you have a true piece of art. Trust me, when you get to this scene, you will just sit there in awe. It's that good. I would also like to highlight the brilliance of the track titled \"Avatar's Love,'' which is played several times in the series including the very last scene of the show and never fails to give me chills. The initial strings convey the triumph and relief of the gang finally saving the world, while the kalimba reminds the listener what it took the cast to get to this moment. And the final strings, oh boy. Gets me every time.In conclusion, Avatar: The Last Airbender is my favorite show of all time, despite it not being the best show I have seen. Watching the show as an 18 year old, the first season was somewhat tough to go through, as many of the episodes are extremely childish with very simple lessons (it was broadcast on Nickelodeon, after all). Also, the humor is objectively childish, although I did find myself laughing at select scenes even now. But yeah, that's it. Those are my only gripes with this show. The Last Airbender has made me who I am today, and I could not recommend it enough.",

            "content": "Since this show recently came onto Netflix, I decided to share my thoughts on it. I watched this show for the very first time in 2019 and I instantly fell in love with it. From the dynamic characters to the intriguing world, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a show that remains to be truly special even after all these years being off the air. I love how this show represents Asian/Inuit culture throughout every single element in this show. It also showcases the best redemption arc for a character ever in all of media. Another thing that makes this show truly special is that none of the characters are badly written. Each character is so interesting and dynamic in their own way that it's hard to actually \"hate\" any of them- like Azula for example. And even though it's a kids show, it still doesn't shy away from serious topics such as genocide, grief, murder, politics, etc. I love how they also try to show that even in the fire nation (the bad guys) there are good people who are just trying to do as they're told and/or trying to survive. The relationships in this show are also done very well. From the romantic relationships to the platonic ones, each feels real and makes sense. This show has it all: a great balance of comedy and drama, amazing characters, a cool world, spectacular world building, and more. If you haven't watched this show yet, seriously go watch it. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

In addition, the fighting scene is very good, super to my appetite.",

Even the ride at Kings Island was way too scary to be a kid ride. The ride is cool and the show is out of this world. I hope it stays! The characters actually have souls, which is what i can't say for the rest of nicks characters. Everything is alive in the show. No useless humor or stupid plots. It's suspenseful and leaves you literally on your seat wanting more. Sometimes i even cheer with Aang and the gang. Sometimes i feel depressed because of Zuko. It is the best show i ever seen, and i want it to stay! GO AVATAR!",

The last time I saw the show, was the best time because when you know when somethings gonna happen and it happens, It gives you major Goosebumps. Overall I like The show not only because it has great design, a great story line and a great plot but because it teaches a never ending lesson of life( This may be confusing because I am just a 13 year old). Well but If you are looking for shows like this masterpiece You have come to the right place. Shows similar to Avatar are The Dragon Prince which is written by the head writer of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and who can forget the sequel to Avatar The Last Airbender, The Legend Of Korra. Avatar:The Last Airbender is the best Animated show of the 2000's.",

            "content": "I believe Avatar is underapreciated because it is on Nickelodean. Since Nick is famous for its retarded shows with the same story lines just using different characters, and its rather idiotic atmosphere, Avatar doesn't belong there. I would much rather see Avatar flourish on Toonami or Diseny. You need to see Avatar, even if it is an \"Amerime\" (american anime).Avatar: The Last Airbender is an amazing show. The storyline is original, even if it uses elemental magics (which has been used a dozen times over). What makes Avatar unique is their way of using those elemental magics and the entire Avatar storyline behind the reincarnated Avatars behind the main character Aang's past is amazingly well done. Another thing that makes Avatar a must-see is its wonderful animation. The characters are cel-shaded very clean, and the scenery is amazing as well as the world they must travel in. Everything is sophisticated and wonderful.And another huge thing in the show that makes it special is its extremely well-designed characters and backstories behind them. You have the main good guys, whom each character has a very detailed backstory (Aang, Sokka, Katara). Then, you have the main bad guys, (Zuko and his uncle), whos backstories actually cause you to feel sorry for them. And then, you have the BAD bad guys (the admiral) who is going against Zuko to take the Avatar. This makes you actually hope that Zuko and his uncle will win, but then you remember they are the bad guys. Then, there is the BAD BAD bad guys (The Fire Lord and his daughter) who are against everyone. By watching the show, you begin to feel more affection for Zuko even if he is evil, because of how greatly designed the characters are.With great animation, character designs, and storyline, this series has stolen my attention away from other cartoons. I HIGHLY Recommend AVATAR.In my way of rating shows, I usually look for how good the animation, character designs, and storyline are. When I look for a good storyline, I usually look for a great balance of humor, action, and romance. This series has it all. Sokka, usually being the comic relief, adds to the humor as well as the funny anime expressions some characters have. Another humorous thing about the show is the random Cabbage Man that appears in the episodes, as well as that screaming and foaming villager. (I never understood that screaming villager, but still hilarious.) Then, there's the action. All of the elemental bending provides some pretty cool action scenes, very well animated as well. Then, there's the romance subplots. Aang likes Katara, and Sokka falls for 3 other girls in the series, one of which was killed giving her life to the Moon Spirit.My only complaints are that they had a pretty cool storyline behind the Spirit World, but they only use it like, 3 times in the episodes. Another complaint is that some very slight flaws in the series, like when Zuko moves Aangs' body while he's in the Spirit World, Katara says that its his only way back and if his body moves he won't be able to get back in. Yet, Aang easily surpasses this and enters in his body where Zuko has taken it, and the show never gave an explanation for how he did that.So, to narrow it all down, Avatar is a must see. 9 out of 10. Wonderful!",

But once I was at my granma's house with my sister and we were watching TV and I turned to Nick and there was Avatar. My sister said that it was a decent show so we watched that one series. And I really liked it I can't say I imidietly fell in love but I really liked the characters and I laughed a lot. So I watched it and soon even though liked it I forgot about it. But than I again not meaning to turned it on and there it was - another series and I liked it more than the first one. Since than I started watching it on TV and after a while decided to watch it in English so I download it and with original acting I just really fell in love.So there are four nations so to say. Four nation which have the ability to will four elements. Water, earth, air and fire. And the nation of fire decided to start a war to claim all the lands. In this world the role of an Avatar is to keep balance but Avatar disapiers just before the war starts. And after 100 year of brutal war a new Avatar is found by out heroes Katara and Sokka and there you go.First let's start with the world of The legend of Aang. It's incredible. The civilization is like of 14th century. It's just huge. We end up being in such amazing places.The plot is really clever and balanced. They won't tell you everything at first. Like you would find out what happened to the previous Avatar like in the 2nd season. At first you don't even understand how the magic work. I mean do all people have it, od special people have it? But eventually they tell you everything you want to know. Sometimes story is very lit sometimes it gets dark.The characters. They are just so clever made. My favorite would be... no I love them all.The show is very funny. I mean you'll laugh your ass off. But in the pre-last series there was a moment where I jumped from my seat in horror.The animation is beautiful. RIP Simpsons. I'm just kidding I live them as well.So overall I can say that it's the best show there is at list for me. It gained a special place in my heart where it always be.",

            "content": "Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Avatar: The Last Airbender, is one of the greatest shows aired by Nick - one of the best animated shows I have seen in a long time, and among the most original. It's beautifully animated, epic in scale, laugh-out-loud funny, genuinely moving, and surprisingly romantic at points.The main plot is this - the world is separated into 4 nations based on the 4 elements; the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. They distinguish themselves by their Benders, people born with the ability to manipulate one of the elements. However, there is one person who can control all 4 - the Avatar, a powerful being reincarnated again and again into the different nations, who is the bringer of peace. However, 100 years before the events of the show, the Avatar vanished when the world was on the brink of war, with the Fire Nation attempting to seize power. The show focuses on 12-year-old Aang, the Avatar and last of the Air Nomads, who was frozen in the ice for a century, and has been thawed out only to find the world in tatters. Now he must master the other 3 elements, defeat the Fire Nation, and restore peace once more.The show is a serial - it continues the story rather than having a bunch of random episodes strung together in a season like so many other children's cartoons, which is wonderful. There are filler episodes, of course, but these are few and far between, and if they don't accelerate the plot, they do add little moments of character development that are useful as well.It's also, as I have said, very funny - the primary \"comic relief\" is the character Sokka, but virtually every character, central or not, has their humorous moments. Despite that, the humour never distracts from what's going on, and never diminishes the dramatic and touching moments that also frequent the show. In fact, they enhance them, by giving the drama such a lighthearted contrast.The show does have it's faults - some of the more overly-dramatic characters (*cough*Zuko*cough*) can get irritating at times, and there are moments where the newly discovered abilities of Aang and the other Benders seem a little too convenient, like they were thought up on the spot whenever the writers couldn't figure out how else to resolve the conflicts. But other than that (and I was really nitpicking there), there is virtually nothing wrong with it.Overall, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a fantastic ride. I highly recommend either getting your hands on the Series DVD's, or watching the show online (try animefuel.com - just a warning, it's often busy and can't be accessed every now and again). I have never enjoyed a serial show - let alone one for kids - so much.",

            "content": "This show should be required viewing for everyone from ages 8 to 100. I could rant about what makes it so perfect for days, but today I'll break down what's so special about it.Animation: The animation is perfect. The battle scenes are so beautifully animated, but special shout out to Azula and Zuko's Agni Kai. The red against blue background is a gorgeously designed metaphor for good against evil. And the martial arts are flawlessly executed-if I didn't know better, with all their flips, slides and landings, I would think Azula and Zuko were Olympic gymnasts!Story: Oh lord, where do I begin on the story? The story is so simple, but executed with such sweeping buildup. Every episode clicks together like a puzzle until you have a epic that could rival Lord of the Rings in amazingness. It goes to mature places for a cartoon marketed primarily towards kids, but does it in a way that is accessible and not too deep. In my opinion, this is one of the shows that broke the mold for what kids expect in terms of story in cartoons.Characters: The character development in this show is off the charts! Katara goes from being a naive girl to a passionate young woman, Aang grows from a goofy little kid to a noble boy, Sokka learns about his worth, Zuko redeems himself, and Toph gains the courage to ask for help. The characters are relatably flawed, showing that even though they're children with magical powers, they still suffer from insecurities, hormones, bullying, unrequited crushes and mood swings.Music: Jeremy Zuckerman's score is spellbinding. Avatar's Love and the main theme are the standouts. They are beautifully composed, and reflect the feeling at the root of this show. Zuckerman even won a well-deserved Peabody Award for his scorework.Representation: Literally every character in this show is some kind of race other than white, so the representation is insane. Katara and Sokka are Inuit, Aang is Indian, Zuko is Japanese, and Toph and Suki are Chinese. So our main characters are all different races, which is a breath of fresh air. I'm glad that kids of all races have someone positive to see themselves in thanks to this show.So, 10/10! This show is perfection in every way possible, and watching it feels like coming home. If only everyone could have access to this show....then the world would be a better place!",

The magic is greater than ever!The characters and stereotypes are nothing new, nothing I havent seen in countless other shows.. but EVERY character was simply PERFECT! I dont know how they did it, but not one aspect was overdone. Aang was the common goofy kid hero you see in many Anime shows.. but the goofiness was never overdone as is so common.. exactly the right amount.. never too much. Although he was a 12 year old kid easily bettering characters who have been mastering bending for twice/thrice the time he's been alive.. But they somehow they just gave him exactly the right amount of hero.. He was never a Mary Sue... and it just felt natural. Even Sokka who was the typical clown character never felt too goofy. The creators and writers of this show could and should give a Hollywood a masterclass on building characters.And talk about strong female characters.. Katara, Azula, Toph.. 3 strong female characters for 3 very different reasons. How many shows can boast that! And again not one of them was a Mary Sue (you may have gathered by now that I HATE Mary Sue characters). Even Azula, who was the closest they got to a Mary Sue never felt forced. I hated her as the villain and loved her at the same time.. It was brilliant!Lets not forget the actors and the casting.. The LEGENDARY Andrea Romano simply outdid herself this time.. The casting and voices were just.. I'll say it again.. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! As was the voice acting.. So sad Zach Eisen didnt do much voice work after this show... He created a character that for me can never ever be replaced.. sigh...And that tribute to the great Mako was.. WOW...I can go on but I think so many others on these reviews have said it so much better..I hear that Netflix and the creators are planning a live action remake. I dont know about this. I know the masters are at the helm this time around so I cant see it being anything but great, but.. You cannot better something that is already perfect.. The only thing that I see happening is comparisons on where it falls short.. There are so many aspects still unexplored in the Avatar universe... Guru Laghima's teachings. The Spirit World..

I can't wait until the 3rd season starts! : ) There are several elements of this cartoon that make me rejoice. The female characters are strong and intelligent. They are depicted as individuals and are not silly, which I was so glad to see. The main character Aang, is easy to relate to. He is a real boy with periods of self-doubt and jealousy that crop up through out the series; while also juggling the awesome responsibilities of being the last Airbender as well as the Avatar. Zuko, who has to capture the Avatar to retain his place within the Fire Nation is an interesting antagonist that is also going through a metamorphosis as well.The plot is well-written with a predetermined destination, the dialogue is fast and witty, and the creative elements are spectacular.

            "content": "I don't watch Nickelodeon. In fact, I barely watch TV these days. I accidentally saw this TV show being mentioned on the internet. Since there were so few good TV shows at the time (and now it's even worse) I decided to give Avatar: The Last Airbender a chance (even though I'm not in this type of animation) and I was pleasantly surprised! In fact, I was a bit shocked, since Avatar: The Last Airbender is aimed at minors and yet it's more intelligent and more rooted in realism (when it comes to politics, for example) than any other TV show (for adults) that I know. Everything about the show is excellent. The title character, his companions and all other characters are excellent. Each episode is enjoyable. Avatar: The Last Airbender is an enormous breath of fresh air. Finally a TV show that isn't all about sex, drugs or anything like that! Amazing (especially since it is made in the 2000s)! Finally a TV show that is moral! Avatar: The Last Airbender is the only TV show that I have given a 10 out of 10. I have never given any other TV show or movie a 10.Human civilization is divided into four nations: the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. The Fire Nation (much like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union) is trying to conquer the other nations. In each nation there are \"benders\", that is to say people who have the ability to manipulate the eponymous element of their nation. The Avatar is the master of all four elements and the only one who can \"bend\" all four elements. Aang, the latest Avatar, is discovered by two Water Tribe locals. Even though it's animated, it's most definitely not to be taken lightly. Aside from the fantasy, everything else is highly realistically portrayed. It's truly amazing, especially for a show that is not aimed at only adults. There are no other shows like this one.Every episode is awesome. The characters are enjoyable. The music is not superb, but still good. The animation is well done. The overall story is superb.Overall, I would recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender over any other TV show. It's definitely the best TV show that I have seen so far!",

I was therefore very hesitant to check out the original material.I'm happy to admit my initial expectations were proved wrong. ATLA is a masterpiece and its sequel Legend Of Korra turned out to be even better. Aang is instantly likable. He has a spontaneous and childlike quality to him that makes me him nothing short of endearing. I also really enjoyed seeing Katara, Sokka and especially Zuko and Toph. Zuko is now one of my all time favorite characters. I never expected to like him as much as I did at the end. What a character development. The structure of the story is simply marvelous. The build up is slow but riveting. It's told from the dueling point of views of Aang and Zuko. Complete opposites on the surface. But the deeper you dig, the more similar they become. And seeing them grow from enemies to best friends was incredible. My favorite scene is their dance at the fire temple. The music and drums really pulls you into the moment. Don't get me started on the humor! Sokka and Toph completely own it on the comedy department. I could go on and on about what a fantastic experience watching this show was but I don't want to spoil too much. All I can say is watch it. It's really worth it. You will only wish you had seen it sooner.",

I never thought I would ever say a cartoon is my favorite show, but here I am taking time to write up a review on IMDb about it. The show is simply a masterpiece. It's everything I hoped LOST would end up being: smart and entertaining, with a well-planned story arc that ends before becoming ridiculous or stale (LOST, to my dismay, fell far, far short).This is a show that all ages can appreciate and enjoy. The character development is superb, the animation is fantastic and the story is both sound and believable. 10/10 rating and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

Also, it's so nice when a show knows how it will end before it even starts. Sure there's a filler episode here and there, but you can tell that each episode is building to an epic finale, and boy does it deliver.Lastly, there is no better developed character I can think of in any show that can compare to Zuko. To start out as an antagonist, and end as one of the most likable characters in the show is an amazing accomplishment in character development.

The series is of course a fantasy, in a world where there are people who can get out of their hands or spell or attack - of fire / water / air / earth The series tells the story of Aang, an air- spell whose nation was completely destroyed by the brutal fire nation. Aang, who froze himself in the glacier, awakens 100 years later with his flying bison Appa into a terrible world in which the fire nation approaches global domination, terrorist and dictatorial domination. Ang awakens when he is found by younger brothers from the water nation - Sokka and Katara, and together with them he sets out on a journey that has lasted 62 wonderful episodes, and 4 seasons. During the journey, Ang and Katara fall in love and the plot tells it perfectly. The plot of the series is fascinating, the best season in my opinion is the first. During the wonderful journey, so many wonderful and fascinating stories unfold in the children's journey, I prefer not to expose them to those who have not seen her - and to you who have not seen her - I just feel sorry for you, because you miss one of the best series the world has ever known. I'm not inclined to give a rating of 10 - and the series is one of the few pages on IMDb that will get me 10. It's hard to explain what's so good about it, you just have to see to understand. Finally, for me this is the best series I have ever seen, and the legend of Cora undoubtedly continues the excellence of an avatar - but for me it will always be less nostalgic than Avatar, and a little less good.",

            "content": "Let's start off by saying that despite the Asian influence in this show, it is not anime, as the minds behind the series are Americans. The beauty of this show is that it ended, and it ended at the right moment, because let's face it, any show that is pretty serialized, and had an ending in sight from the start, shouldn't exceed 50-60 episodes, otherwise it gets bland and loaded with fillers, or it steers too far off its original plot (Lost, Heroes, Prison Break are all prime examples). This show had very few fillers, and if they were, you had to realize that the target audience of the channel that it aired on, Nickelodeon, was the 2-11 age demographic, so you needed the light-hearted moments, comedic moments that a child enjoys. But when it wasn't light-hearted or comedic, or childish when there was a serious moment, it got serious, without ever being too serious, or being too stereotypical of what \"serious\" is in the TV landscape.What I admire about the storytelling is how is balances itself, it had to tell story lines from 3 different angles each season, Season 1: Aang, Zuko and Zhao. Season 2: Aang, Zuko and Azula. Season 3: Aang, Zuko and Azula again, yet it always gave each character enough screen time to develop the story, rather than focus in too much on one character or group. It was as mentioned before, a nice balance of serious and comedic, it was serialized enough that you wanted to watch the next episode, but episodic enough, you could jump into a previous episode and enjoy it without being completely lost. It then managed to build up tension, especially in the second season, where it was like all three parties, Aang and gang, Zuko and Azula would all eventually crash, and they did, in the Catacombs of Ba Sing Se, in the episode \"The Crossroads of Destiny\", which is an episode which I consider one of the best ever episode of all time, and I've seen a lot of quality TV.This show really is a testament to animations, it took you far away into a fantasy land where you wanted to go, but you knew you never could, but it was realistic, and not over stylized, think Naruto or Dragon Ball Z, but not only that, but in the situation itself, could nearly happen, and has almost happened in the past, one nation nearly achieving World Domination.So, I highly recommend this to anyone who is smart, if you're a fan of Zack and Cody or whatever stuff airs on Nickelodeon or Disney these days, then keep watching that stuff and grow up ignorant to real issues, but this is a great show, I genuinely cannot find fault in it, it isn't too violent, so it is appropriate for a six year old, I won't go into the plots or anything, you can discover that for yourself.",

As a fan of animation and fantasy, I was immediately drawn in by the series' stunning animation and action sequences. But it was the character development and believable characters that truly set this show apart from todays ones.Throughout the series, I watched as the main characters, Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Zuko, grew and changed in ways that felt real and relatable. Their arcs were masterfully crafted, with motivations and obstacles that were both believable and emotionally resonant. The show's diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique stories and perspectives, added depth and richness to the world-building.Aang's journey from a carefree child to a powerful leader was particularly moving for me. And Zuko's transformation from a villainous prince to a complex and relatable character was nothing short of genius. The themes of love, family, and sacrifice that were woven throughout the series made for a powerful and emotionally resonant viewing experience.As a fan, I cannot recommend this show enough. \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is a true masterpiece that stands the test of time. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves animation, fantasy, and well-written and well-developed characters. It will always hold a special place in my heart.",

Recently it has made a huge comeback and is considered one of the best shows in the world. So what makes Avatar: TLA so good? First the bending abilities in the story are inspired by true martial arts techniques, which makes them accurate and visually impressive. Second the characters are the headline. Each character is special in his own way and creates amounts of emotion and identification. My favorite character for example is Zuko, his character arc in my opinion was the best of all. From an antagonist to a hero and a man to his own fate. Zuko has definitely made a huge impression on the viewers. Third is the heart of the show: this show is like uncle iroh. Funny and compassionate. Even if there were exaggerated moments (looking at you katara), I find this series at its best when it comes to emotion. I have to admit when I watched the series for the first time I had no idea of its impact on the viewers and how popular it was at the time, even now with its comeback to the streaming service Netflix, Avatar: TLA has broke records and critics all over are applauding to this wonderful series. Personally I think it's great but I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan or say it's better than other tv seriess. I just enjoyed it very much.",

Then quite by accident I watched a mini marathon of a show made change my mind, at least somewhat. That show is called Avatar.Set in a fictional world where Earth, Air, Water and Fire are manipulated as weapons of war by people called 'benders', Avatar is based around a young man named Aang, frozen in ice and seclude from the world for over a hundred years, he emerges during a time of war, the Fire Nation stands poised for domination, the Water Tribe and Earth Nation scrambling and fighting for the survival of their homelands. Aang being the last remaining member of the long dead nation of Air Nomads,he is also the powerful being known as the Avatar, the one who must master all four elements in order to keep balance within the world, realizing the war will rip the world apart Aang, along with a small band of friends & allies, he must make a long journey through the world to master the power within himself in order to face his density.The beauty of Avatar is overwhelming at times, using the main stays of Japanese animation, the slow and yet beautiful movement of kung fu, and some deep spiritual motives, the action based series is built around a emotional story of a makeshift family trying stay together in the fires of war, it is highly dramatic all while having a lovely streak of humor as well.If you are looking for animated series both your kids and yourself can watch then have a look at this amazing and touching series.

There was so much emotion, so much story in that once scene, I readily admit I wept. Second, the scene with Aang and the Lion-turtle-we know Aang by the end, know him deeply. We know that it would kill him to take another life, even when that would be entirely justified (of course, the Fire Lord). The show itself condones the violent act as necessary-no ultra-pacifist message to beat into our heads-we just know that Aang can't bring himself to do it. The Lion-turtle's advice allows him the perfect ending to a perfect story.I cannot being to describe my feelings for this show. I love it, and you will too.",

I know that the show was made with a child audience in mind, but I have talked to people who have never watched the show before and got turned off by the first half. If you are a newcomer to the show I think it's best to inform you that this show starts off very light and fun, but gradually gets darker and more serious.

The story is compelling, leaving us hooked from episode 1, and rather sad to see season 3 drawing to a close. I'm 19, and have seen bits and pieces of the show when it originally aired, but never got a chance to watch it all in sequence. I knew it was a fun show with a cool concept, but what surprised me (and has kept me so interested) was the level of depth. Zuko, for instance, is a compelling antihero (which is a rare concept in children's programming) who is struggling with morality, honor, and duty. He is aided (often in ways he doesn't realize) by his wise uncle Iroh. Iroh serves as both comic relief and a source of genuine wisdom (as opposed to the meaningless adages) throughout the show, and is again a character with depth and substance. The Series's 3 main protagonists (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) develop magnificently as characters, to the point where you find yourself remarking on how much younger they seem in earlier episodes and flashbacks. And while you watch the show, you can feel yourself growing with them, sharing their journey as they do combat with firelords, seamonsters, and their own teenage lifestyles. Honestly, I have been enjoying this show to its fullest, and while it's not quite Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, it certainly isn't Kung Fu Panda.

After watching other critically acclaimed shows like Breaking Bad, I decided to try something different, so I picked up this show and started watching. First few episodes I was hesitant, but then the show grew on me. The characters, music, dialogue and animation are all fantastic, especially the action scenes. The overarching story is truly epic, and after the finale I was sad until I found out Korra existed. I even ended up reading all the comics taking place after the show, that's how likable the shows characters are. Seriously, just watch it, you won't regret it.",

The humour can get old or just not appeal to all audiences. And I believe that, like most things, nostalgia can make something seem better than it is or better to some than others. Also I believe that it held up better 15 years ago. It's not a perfect show but it's very very good, and does many things right.It has fantastic characters who all get the proper development and it's all done in almost the best way possible. It's got fantastic writing and story and pacing. It's has so many well displayed themes and works simultaneously as a kids show and a show for all ages. It's very immersive and develops the atmosphere and world it takes place in.Remember, just because may think something is perfect doesn't mean everyone will like it. But if you are a fan of story telling, fantasy, adventure, action, characters, animation, or just tv and entertainment in general I recommend you watch it.",

Also the pacing is very smooth, going fast enough to not get boring but not too fast that it is hard to follow. Another quality is that there is no pointless episodes (except for S1 E11 and S2 E15, thought they are still worth watching).Overall this show is perfect (except for S1 E14, that bored me) highly recommend if you want something to watch while waiting for whatever show you follow to come back.",

            "content": "Avatar combines the greatest aspects of American cartoons and Japanese anime.Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the story of Aang(an airbender and the \"Avatar\", or master of the 4 elements, fire, water, earth and air) and his friends Katara(a waterbender) and her brother Saaka as they travel to find waterbending, earthbending and firebending masters for Aang, so that he can learn all the elements and defeat the evil Fire Lord Ozai and his treacherous followers in the Fire Nation.The story also focuses on the banished Fire Prince Zuko as he chases Aang and company across the globe with hopes of capturing the Avatar and regaining his honor and the love of his father. Zuko, the emotional outcast of the story, and the relationship with his family, and especially that of his Uncle Iroh(whom he travels with for the first season or so) is tear-jerkingly crafted and beautifully executed.The story and the world it takes place in is fun and interesting, the characters, good and evil are lovable, and the animation is the most detailed and flawless I've ever seen come from an American studio.The action and fight scenes in this show are jaw-droppingly detailed and beautifully choreographed; even though it is a Nickelodeon production and is primarily meant for kids it still has the most entertaining action of any animated show I've ever watched - but there in lies its single weakness.Had this show been produced for Cartoon Network, the action could have been much more violent and the themes much more mature, which I personally would have preferred. However, since it is a kids show, I'll give it credit for putting together some serious entertainment without resorting to peoples arms and heads getting blown off in a bloody frenzy.9/10",

            "content": "In case you were wondering, THIS IS NOT SILLY LITTLE KIDS SHOW!!! Yes, it airs on a kid based network, and yes kids will like the bending action, but to understand the complexity and the beauty of some of these episodes, you have to be a teen or adult. I'm a teenage girl, and I have a life, believe me. I'm not some strange kid who spends all their time watching TV. This is the kind of show I LIVE for! Okay, I admit it. I didn't really care for this shows first season. Back then it was mostly a \"kids show.\" I'd seen an episode or two and judged it. But after not watching Avatar for the longest time, I tuned back in (out of boredom and curiosity) about halfway through season 2. And boy am I glad I did!! Because that's when Avatar's plot really got intense.Avatar (Avatar: the last Airbender being the official name) is about a world where a percentage of the people have the power to control one of the four elements. This is called bending. There are water, earth, fire and airbenders, whom live in four different nations throughout the world. There is one individual who has the power to learn all four elements and keeps the world in balance, called the Avatar. But when the Fire Nation declares war for ultimate power, the Avatar strangely disappears. After 100 years of war, a brother and sister discover the Avatar, an airbender, encased in an Ice-burg, frozen in time. Now he must learn to cope with his destiny, master the elements, and save the world before a comet comes at summers end, giving the fire nation unstoppable power. New allies are made and sides are chosen, as the Avatar learns to except his inevitable destiny.Oh my god, the drama, the action, the romance, and even a bit of comedy, this show has all you could possibly ask for!! The shocking cliff hangers and teasers for Avatar will leave you rolling around on the floor\u0096 I'm not kidding guys!! Never have I been so addicted to any show, ever.And what amazing themes, like destiny, balance, love, power, war. (Watch, \"The Guru\" and you know what I'm talking about.) I've never felt just so enlightened, or amazed at anything as I have with this show. Just the heart-pounding emotion and (oh my god) drama that pours of the season 2 finale! Oh my god what can I say.And don't even get me started on the fandom. And the shipping!! It's a crazy world out there, the world of shipping. Once you go in, you can't get out. Everyone wants their ship to be cannon, and that's half the fun! It's vicious let me tell you, just brutal! (Oh and Kataang for the win by the way!! Wooo!!) If you're going to get into Avatar, I would suggest you watch one of the better episodes before judging it. For example, \"The Awakening,\" \"The Desert,\" \"The Chase,\" \"Lake Laogai,\" just to name a couple! (I would have said \"The Guru,\" and \"The Crossroads of Destiny,\" but that would give away WAY too much! The two episodes that make up the season 2 finale are the BEST so far in my opinion!) And with season 3 just having premiered on September 21st, and new episodes for 10 straight weeks, the Avatar fandom has a lot to look forward to!! My god, season 3's been promised to be the best, most dramatic season yet, and it's the last season too. So if you're just getting ready to become an \"avatard,\" as we call ourselves, you picked a good time, cause we've got a hell of a good season ahead of us!! The good times are here again!",

Also, it includes some great dramatic elements prepared for kids yet still smart.

But I never remembered actually finishing it, just watching a lot of episodes multiple times. Now a whole bunch of years later I decided to finally sit down and watch the entire series. It was incredible how much I still remembered, a testament to the show.In general this a perfect show. Still to this day it's effective and feels like one of its kind. No wonder it still has a following these days.The characters are diverse and written wonderfully with rich backgrounds and satisfying arcs, especially for Aang where it really comes together in the finale after his entire journey.The world feel alive and is incredibly well designed, it feels unique but familiar, like an alternate society. But it doesn't feel alien. The mysticism, symbolism, its all there. It really is art.Oh and how can I forget about the score/music. Especially in the finale they do some incredible things but overall, the themes are incredible. And the main theme never gets old. Just so many instantly recognizable tracks.The script, story.. It's all rock solid, no changes in quality or weird events that don't fit in. The only minor difference was the sad change of voice actor of Iroh who's original voice actor passed. To me it was noticeable, Mako (Iroh) had a warmth in his voice acting that felt missing later on.Now the show does mature, which is a good thing, but that does mean the early season feels very kid focused and childish, with lots of silly humor and personally I found it a little tough to get through. Luckily the show matures and whilst there is still silliness, there's much less of it. There are some minor plot-holes/corrections, especially regarding the avatar state, but it didn't bother me.Towards the end, it's impossible not to tear up at certain moments, it's a journey and you really get sucked into it. There is a cliff-ish hanger regarding Zuko, which sadly wasn't followed up upon. But the cliffhanger isn't part of the main story being told so it doesn't feel that bad.Fantastic, recommend.",

Better than any show, movie, video game, ANY form of entertainment or anything at all ever. (I have seen em' all, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, All the other Nick/Cartoon Network/Disney/countless shows and movies and even video game stories like Halo). Now that I have said that, I would like to thank Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko endlessly for the unparalleled thought, work, effort, love, and genuineness that you put into this masterpiece, and to everyone involved.I started watching this show when I was 8 years old in February of 2005 when Nickelodeon was hyping it up just as they do with all of their new shows. It was something I could totally relate to and learn from considering I was really growing up during that time. It is a show for ALL AGES because that's how great it is. I was almost 12 when the final 2-hour series finale ended and let me just say This finale... just... just... unbelievable. My emotions were the greatest that they have ever been. It was perfection and entertainment at its finest. This show could not have ended any other way. It was the perfect ending to a perfect show. It was so great that I cried for an hour and couldn't eat anything or go to sleep that night. It left a void in me. It was a heartbreaking Saturday night when it was all over and I was 11 at the time. Ever since that day my life changed and I am still getting teary thinking about it. I've re-watched episodes over and over, even when the show was still airing, I would re-watch until the new episode came on.I don't even know if this is a review anymore as much as it is my appreciation for this beautiful masterpiece. The Avatar crew did a good job with their follow-up show \"The Legend of Korra\", which was made because of extremely high fan support and demand for more avatar. But ever since I learned they would be making this \"sequel show\" I knew that it would never be the same. You can't follow up a once-in-a- billion-year phenomenon like Avatar: The Last Airbender.Finishing up, I would just like to thank Mike and Bryan again for everything and I really do hope to meet them one day. I beg them to just keep giving us fans out here more like their comics, artwork, soundtracks, and even the Legend of Korra (I hope season 3 & 4 are better than season 2 and especially 1). I'm extremely grateful I had avatar growing up and watching new episodes live from the very beginning to the very end. I'm almost 18 now and I am writing this review just to get my feelings about avatar out there. I would recommend this show to every last human being in every last corner of the earth because like I said in my opening statement, It is the greatest... thing... ever.",

Everything in the show has a purpose, nothing ever feels superfluous or like the creators were just trying to pad out an episode. A rare find indeed and I think we'll be waiting a long time for another animated series of this quality.",

            "content": "OK, so I was 7 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn't the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.Sadly, after The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon never seemed to follow in the footsteps of Avatar which I found upsetting. Kids need more shows like this, if I'm being honest.",

Something like \"Simply astonishing!\". But IMDb wants more, and for this show I am very happy to oblige.\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is simply, in the true sense of the word - awesome. The storytelling is engrossing, the characters are perfect, and the animation is wonderful. It's all just amazing. I missed it the first time through and frankly had no real interest in it, despite a fondness for animation in general. But after catching the last two episodes by chance, I was impressed and decided to try and follow the entire series when it was re-run from the beginning. From the start - and much to my surprise - I became hooked. It got to the point where I would schedule my time so that I wouldn't miss an episode in the serial.Now I've just completed the entire series and have begun watching it again from the beginning. No, I am not a nut! But the storytelling is so good, it's even better the second time around. There is a holistic cohesion to the plot that is more appreciable after having seen it before. You pick up on details that astonish you. What a wonderful creation! I am a grown adult with mature tastes. My exposure to Nickelodeon programming comes from my daughter. It is because of this that I happened upon Avatar. While I also like the older SpongeBobs (he's far too whiny in the later episodes), Avatar has become the most happy payoff from my parental association with Nick.Perhaps this review is short on detail, but I'd end up writing for hours if I started to dig deeper into specifics. Let me just say that Avatar is well worth your time and attention. Watch it in order, from the beginning. It is, in a word: BRILLIANT!",

But here goes anyway, when I first started watching the series I was enthralled by the adventures that the trio went on, the compelling dynamics of their relationship and their believable antagonists kept me watching. It was interesting how natural and relatable these relationships seemed yet were still enshrouded with mystery.As the series progressed the characters became so rich and vivid that I became worried along with them, nervous for their futures and hopeful for a good outcome by the end. I was also impressed by the meticulous care and detail put into every second of the animation. Because usually, when I'm into a good story I feel let down a times when a character is miraculously saved by plot armour or when they escape from a gaping plot hole. But this feeling never came up, and I was throughly satisfied by the end of each episode, with arguably not a single miss in the entire series. Proof alone that so much time and love was put into this show.The bending of the elements really keeps things entertaining from a visual standpoint, watching my favourite characters become better and better at air, water, earth and fire bending is so satisfying and makes them look so badass, especially towards the end.But most importantly for me the show represents our own struggles and wisdoms that are given to us on the personal journey to truth and happiness. Each character has their own unique outlook on life and on the problems that are presented to them throughout the story, and like jigsaw pieces they all fit together by the end. And the end result looks even better than it did on the box.",

The world made sense and was very consistent, even holistic to a point. The Hero's Journey was incorporated very well into Aang's story. I'm also a sucker for redemption arcs and it was done well for Zuko. I could relate to almost all the characters very well.The only things preventing me from giving this a 9 or a 10 are the fact that I'd have liked to see more of Aang's training and development (a couple of episodes, though still fun, felt a bit like filler and I feel like this attention could have been shifted) and how Zuko was handled at the end of season 2.Now I'm not saying Zuko shouldn't have turned against the Avatar again, it made sense for him to take up the chance he had lost before to restore his honor. However, what then was this whole metamorphosis about? If he truly changed his character and wasn't handling out of selfish reasons anymore, why did he switch sides, and if he wasn't, why did he go through the metamorphosis? Also, when he switched sides again (twice), shouldn't he have gone through the metamorphosis again as well? I was totally convinced that Zuko was just trying to gain his sister's and the fire nation's trust to be able to help the Avatar at a crucial moment from the inside.",

In these nations are special people who can \"bend\" the elements. However every generation there is one person who can control all four elements called the Avatar. Its his job to keep peace and harmony among the nations, but, when the Fire Nation wages war on the other nations he disappears. A hundred years later in the South Pole a boy trying to become a warrior named Sokka and his sister who's trying to become a master waterbender find a boy in an iceberg. When they get him out they find out he's the next Avatar and the last of the airbenders. Since then they have to travel the world to teach Aang all of the elements and find someway to end this hundred year war while he also deals with the fact that he being a boy of 12 has to save the world.The shows animation is beautiful while its action sequences are practically breath-taking. And the characters are also charming in great ways. It is very easy to fall for them, with their charm, wit, and giving refreshing comedy to the show makes it impossible to not care for them at all. Even the back-stories are fun. We dive into the characters lives and find out what they've been through while also finding new emotional levels to connect the audience with the characters.Another element in the show I enjoyed was that Aang is constantly at war with himself. He wants to be a normal boy but he knows he's the only person who can stop the Fire Nation. Throughout the show he starts doubting himself and begins to question whether or not he can do it. And that helps keep up the drama and makes it all the more fun to watch as he struggles with this reality. I found this show fun and suspenseful thanks to the great action sequences.

The world is separated into four nations; Water, Earth, Fire and Air. The divine entity that possesses the ability to master all four elements and keep in touch to the spirit world is called the Avatar. The Avatar is born into one of the four nations and is taught the other three bending techniques during his/her life and is basically the peace keeper of the world. The basic story begins 100 years after the Fire Nation attacks the other nations and begins a world war. To make matters worse the Avatar vanishes without a trace. That's where Aang comes in.Aang is a young Air nomad who has been trapped in an iceberg for 100 years and is found by two teens from the Water Tribe, Katara and Sokka. Aang soon realizes he and his flying bison, Appa, have been in stasis for over 100 years and the world has been flung into a near hopeless state. And to add more insult to injury, Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation has made it his obsession to tracking down the Avatar and bringing him before Fire Lord Ozai(his father) and restoring his honor. He is accompanied by his seemingly lazy uncle Iroh, who has more secrets than he leads to believe. This is the basic premise behind the show and I have one word for it as a whole... amazing. It is really rare when a show that's aimed for children nowadays can be so mature yet not take itself too seriously at the same time. Everything about this show is magnificent. The characters are all likable, the animation is beautiful, and the Asian influences are all exceptionally done. And the show only gets better as it goes on. Near the middle of Season 1, Aang realizes his true destiny is to stop the Fire Lord from drawing immense fire bending power from a comet that will arrive in the summer of the next year and has to travel the world searching for masters to teach him the bending skills. This leads to a thrilling climax at the end of Season 1 where the Fire Nation leads an attack on a huge Waterbending city which leads to some of the best action in the whole season.Season 2 introduces a new main character, Toph. Toph is a blind young girl who learned the art of seeing through Earthbending and joins the gang as Aang's teacher. We're also introduced to Zuko's sister Azula and her friends Ty Lee and Mai. Azula is one of the darkest villains I have ever seen in a TV show, animated or otherwise. We get a lot of character development out of the characters too. Most of all Zuko. We learn about his past, his relationship with his family and just why he wants to capture Aang so much. Season 3 is probably the most epic of the bunch(and probably the darkest). More character development fleshes out the characters and makes them more human and relateable. The series finale is one epic battle against Aang and Ozai while others fight against the Fire Nation for their freedom. The ending is very satisfying and the battle scenes have some of the best animation out of the whole series.I haven't even covered most of what makes this show so great but if you're really intrigued I definitely recommend looking it up. With a great voice cast, a great plot, and beautiful animation this is without a doubt the best show to come out of Nickelodeon.",

This show is not just for kids, it's for everyone. Each character is so unique and different, so any viewer could find one to relate to. Each character also has a unique flaw. Therefore, if you see yourself in a character, the show allows you to recognize faults within yourself that would otherwise be difficult to find. The arc of Prince Zuko is the best redemption arc OF ALL TIME. We see a boy banished by his own father with serious mental and physical abuse as a result, who finds his true purpose in life and helps save the world. Uncle Iroh, Aang, and Zuko are the best characters on the show (and Appa if you so please). Uncle Iroh has also had difficulties with finding his purpose in life, so he is there to help Zuko along the way- no matter how stubborn and mean Zuko can be. Aang is personally one of my favorite characters ever made. A 12 year old boy who's fate is to save the entire world is incredibly difficult, but Aang does it- without causing any casualties. Aang is an extremely pure and loving character that you can't help but feel the emotions he has just deeply as he presents them. My favorite episode is \"The Firebending Masters\", it is so monumental for the show and indescribably beautiful. I do warn you that you will sob countless time during certain episodes (\"Appa's Lost Days\" and \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\" specifically). This show is not just for children because it has SO many deeper meanings that you can only find when you rediscover it as adult. Mental illness, worldly conflicts, death, abuse, wisdom, and much more. I will continue to rewatch this show for the rest of my life because I learn things from it and get immense joy watching the characters succeed. I recommend you do the same.",

This is a tale that stays true through all three seasons. I must mention there was a movie adaptation, but I honestly don't know why the director and producers made a poor and somewhat disrespectful live action. I think they didn't watch it the show properly.This show is testament to great writing and direction. The characters are well developed and you end up finding one that resonates with you. I for one loved the story of prince Zuko, I even liked Appa the pet flying bison. That's right even Aang's pet had more character than many tv shows without even uttering a word. Without giving much spoilers, it's a tale of triumph through suffering, finding the many colours of life along their journey to find the rainbow.",

            "content": "This show is incredible. With everyone currently obsessing over anime nowadays, this show is one that i feel is overlooked, mostly because it is an American made cartoon and is not technically anime. The show is centered around a war between the fire nation and the rest of the world including the Water tribe and the earth kingdom (The air nomads were not involved as they were all killed off by the fire lord to prevent the re-incarnation of the avatar). The world is full of people called benders, who have the ability to manipulate and control a specific element e.g. earth, fire, water, air. The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements, yet he disappeared at the start of the war. Aang has been frozen in ice for 100 years, since the war started. He is awakened by Katara, a water bender from the south pole, and her brother Sokka. It is quickly revealed that Aang is in fact the Avatar who disappeared at the start of the war and is the last air bender in the world. The rest of the show then focuses on his journey across the world to master the 4 elements and defeat the fire lord, ending the war.The show is bursting with originality, from the overall premise of the plot to the beautifully crafted lore behind it. The characters are all fantastic and fill their own respective character roles very well. Aang is a goofy 12 year old kid afraid of the responsibility that has been thrust upon him and has to learn to accept the fact that he is tasked to save the world. Katara is the caring and sensible mother figure, usually with a very level head. Sokka is the funny guy constantly cracking one liners, and ones that cause real genuine laughter and never cease to be funny. Even the characters of Appa and Momo, Aang's animal companions, are extremely lovable and even provide some great moments of themselves, one of the main story arcs of series 2 revolving around Appa (a flying \"Sky Bison\"). The many other characters in the show are also all amazing, although there are two many to write about. It also switches seamlessly from fun and goofy comedy to awesome and awe inspiring action. If i have convinced one person to watch this show from this review, i will consider it a success. This show is amazing and is my personal favorite show of all time",

The show brings up important life topics such as: family, love, friendship, trust, emotional growth, abuse of power, righteousness, loyalty and many more. In addition the character development of every single character in the show is so well shown. You see each character's background which allows you to understand the reason behind their actions and opinions, at the same time however you also get to see all events that make them change outdated opinions or events that allow them to overcome their pain. Another thing has to do with bending. The way they represent bending and the separation of \"cultures\" is extremely important and relevant to today's society. You see how the ones with the most power abuse it to remain in control and to suffocate the less powerful.\nIt is one great show and I very highly recommend it to people of all ages.",

Whereas the traditional anime involves less movement than this and uses the lip-flap, this show does not. For that, I am very glad.Mostly, the Avatar revolves around the war that was started by the Fire Nation, and shows the emotional situations that so many of the characters find themselves in. Prince Zuko, for example, must capture the Avatar so that he may return home, but he is beginning to wonder if he should continue on. Aang, the playful and adventurous 12-year-old Airbender, is literally carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, which is constantly overwhelming him. Only he can restore peace to the world, and when you're just a kid, fighting an entire army of Firebenders can prove to be very frightening.I love this show, and I give it a 9 out of 10. I look forward to seeing many more Avatar shows in the future.",

The plot was excellent, I love the people who do the voices, and it's so cool to see them bending all those elements. Unlike most shows on Nick, Avatar isn't always black and white i.e., when Zuko appears to be good, goes bad, then becomes good again. In the series you've got Aang, the fun loving Avatar, Katara, the strong water-bender, Sokka the fierce, but silly warrior, and Toph a blind, wisecracking earth-bender.

The 5 elements idea is the main aspect(even though 4 elements- air,fire,water,earth was considered in series leaving Sky).The plot is very simple but also very exhaustive and creative. Even a child can understand the plot but also a person can write a thesis on it.Secondly the action, this series has a action which is on it's own a different kind. In this series action is mixed with philosophy. But it is above par when compared to other series. The excitement through the seasons remains high and constant. It also includes some tactics(a lot) and politics.Character development- EACH AND EVERY CHARACTER HAS GREAT IMPORTANCE even though some characters are made for sarcasm (like cabbage man, sokka),the sarcasm is very effectively produced. Another thing is many of the characters are PERFECTLY DEVELOPED and are VERY CREATIVE CHARACTERS. THE WORLD IN THIS SERIES IS VERY BEAUTIFULLY SHOWN WITH WONDERFUL ABILITIES TO CHARACTERS.MUSIC/OPENING-music is too good, it is very pleasant to hear, It is like the gentle shower falling on leaves. OPENING IS PERFECT IN ONE WORLD. Romance- The katara aang(kataang) romance is epic, It is very hard to describe,BUT don't worry just watch the SHOW.ENDING-BOOM BOOM FULL OF ACTION and one of the best endings ever seen.FINALLY, IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IRRESPECTIVE OF AGE, WATCH IT THINK OVER IT, FINALLY TOO GOOD FOR THIS EARTH.",

I think this is because it isn't afraid to take its time and really flesh out the characters. I know lots of people who love this show but personally, I still think it doesn't get enough credit.

Inspired by real world cultures and mythologies, yet with enough original content to be completely unique, you constantly want to see and know more of it.The writing as a whole is pristine. Overall it gives a strong impression that the writers always knew exactly where they were going. Old plot points resurface in clever ways throughout the series, twists are surprising but feel right, and I can't think of a single thread left untied at the end.Basically, nothing could be improved about this show, and it's such a perfect story package that I hardly even wish there was more of it.

ATLA feels immature or cringy at times, it has a boring evil main villain, and some episodes are slow.

Me and my brother, and even my mom, were blown away by its incredible creativeness, characters and story. Lucky for us, we were in the middle of a marathon, so we watched it for the whole day.And now, about four years later, I watch the whole series again, but now with the original English voices, and I'm still totally blown away: if not more than before!All of the seasons of the series are genius in all ways: the characters' personalities, the environments, the creatures, the story/stories, the whole concept! The imaginary and creativity is unbelievable: the flying sky bison Appa, which is the Avatar Aang's animal guide, is nothing I could have even dreamed of. The concept of the cities, like Ba Sing Se, is fantastic. The acting is least said decent, and there's a lot of humour in it. The music is sometimes a bit drawn out, but otherwise it fits the series very good.But of course, there are some weak points too. Since it's a cartoon for children, it's sometimes a bit corny, clich\u00e9 and puny, but it's still a joy to watch.The bending and the physics are sometimes very exaggerated, but somehow that fits kind of well to the story; it makes it more enigmatic and fantasy-inspired. The acting is also sometimes a little weak, especially from the children actors' side, and there are some \"over-obvious\" sentences that they say just to add to the story, and make sure for the viewers to get things confirmed.But overall, it's an incredible masterpiece, that truly deserves its critically acclaimed spot. Now when a whole new series of Avatar is in the making, I just can't wait to get the same breathtaking feeling again. It's just amazing.",

            "content": "Let me first say that I was part of the generation that grew up with this show. After another one of my regular splurges of ATLA, I decided to read reviews of the show on IMDb. From newly introduced fans coming from Netflix, Doug Walkers vlogs,and other life long fans (of all ages and geographical points of origins), I was addicted to reading vehement stranger's ravings about one of my favorite shows, my favorite show (only Breaking Bad came close). And now I m having that unstoppable urge to profess my love as well, to maybe a hand full of people who would grace over this review just if it appeared to long.That is why I'll try and be quick about something I can talk endlessly about. This series feels like a book series(thanks impart to its use of \"chapters\" and \"books\"), but better because its really a TV cartoon; stories that would keep you glued to the page now dance in front of you with brilliant pseudo anime, South Korean and American hybrid animation. The story is a fantastic action comedy lore that is surrounded in a exciting world. Taking from Old Asian influences (Mainly Japanese, Chinese, Tibetan Monk, Inuit and some Indian), and mystical aspects like spirits, bending the elements and a wide variety of fantastical and creative animals; this show's world is completely its own. It also has some of the best action, show casing a meticulous attention to its martial arts (Tai Chi, Bagua, Northern Shoalin, Hung Gar, and Southern Praying Mantis). Avatar has terrific music that ,even with a low budget, is boisterous, melodious, and utilizes instruments from all over the world. But onto content. Every Episode is an adventure that almost always connects to the larger plot(and if it doesn't who gives a s@#t). To be fair, in the first season the show seems to have a system of new and secular adventures every week, but it quickly proves to be more. The stories and over all plot are full of fun, action adventure, drama, life lessons, history, love, comedy heartbreak, and more. The characters are lovable and real, they can change and are coupled with great voice acting across the board. Aang's transformation into a fully realized avatar, and Zuko's quest for honor are at the front of this tale and are perfectly paralleled in the story, but also rival characters' tales from any other media. The story is grand, its characters alive, and the outcome is a show that you'll watch over and over. As my title points out I have an interesting view on the show. That this shows greatest attribute is (as it originally aired on Nickelodeon): it's for all ages. Usually people say its not just for kids, but I like to look at it the other way. I'm not blind to the network's original demographic towards kids, but at no point did Mike and Bryan (the creators) make something that adults couldn't grab onto. They being adults, made it something beautiful that they would enjoy and by extension all adults would enjoy. In the same way Harry Potter can touch everybody. Maybe a better point: I often hear that the show is great, but it would have been better it it had more realistic violence or drama. But to that I say no it wouldn't. The true wonder of Avatar is how children can enjoy it just as much as adults, that there was something on TV that allowed a 9 year old girl and a 50 year old man could equally enjoy. And they each knew exactly what was happening and why it was spectacular. Everybody becomes a child to this story and world that becomes a reality, and every child gets to experience high level TV and Storytelling. This show transcends most everything that can often stand in the way of true entertainment. If you haven't watched this show yet, do so now, and if you're like me, cherish an incredible show, and wait for the days when you can provide it to you're children.P.S: The Shyamalan Movie is Garbage, and Legend of Korra is an equally fantastic and higher quality sequel that expands the avatar universe (its only hindrance is Avatar: The Last Airbender's shadow and a small lack of execution in the writing as of now)",

If I am asked what my favorite book is I say The Fountainhead, or The Great Gatsby. But, if someone ever asks me what my favorite television show is the answer is always the same: Avatar: The Last Airbender.The show excels in many areas but it's true success lies in the fact that it's characters age/ mature with the show. If you watch the The Boy in the Iceberg/ The Avatar Returns, and then watch Sozen's comet you will barely even recognize the protagonists. Katara starts out as a young, naive girl who can barely even make a wave, she becomes a strong, motherly, courageous woman who is able to actually freeze opponents in mid-air. Aang is an innocent, and fun-loving child who doesn't want to face his destiny, he becomes the Avatar master of all four elements and the leader of the free world. These developments are well thought out and developed, making the characters seem so natural that they could be real.Another great aspect of this show is it's antagonists. These are not shallow, heartless characters. All of them are motivated by something, whether it be greed, power, honor, or money. The inner conflict that these villains face increases interest and desire to know more about their pasts and futures.The show has one main story but it is the sub-plots that truly drive it. From discovering fake airbenders, to the brainwashing facilities of Ba Sing Se, to the Day of the Black Sun this show will be forever loved and adored by its fans all over the world.It knew how to begin, and it knew when to end, a great show and a triumph on all levels. 10/10",

It took me 16 years to get back at this series. Back in 2005, I got to watch the first season of this show in Nickelodeon and I was awed and blown away by the story of the show. But I did not get to finish it as my cable service provider removed Nickelodeon from their services. I remember being so sad and angry they did that. I was rooting for the show and its story so much. I could not do anything about it and I moved on and finally after many years, I thought about it in these corona days. I heard it is available in Netflix but somehow it was removed when I searched for it. I searched in other streaming platforms too but did not find it. I almost gave up and finally decided to search hard for it in the internet and found it with great difficulty and downloaded all the episodes. All the episodes I watched back then is still etched in my memory that when I got to watch it again a few days back, all the nostalgia hit me so strong that tears came out of my eyes when I first saw the title animation and the amazing music. I could not believe what I was watching. The story, the action, the amazing animation, the soulful background music, the ending, it is perfect and taught me many things even as an adult now. This show is for everyone as many people said in the reviews. This is my first review eventhough I was in IMDb for years. Perfect timing to write my first review of a perfect show. Avatar brought back my childhood, felt so nostalgic and many emotions that I could not explain while watching this show. It's been an honour for me to get to watch this stunner of a show.",

I am a total fan of anime (owning 100s of series) and I have to say this is about the closest I have seen an NA animated series come to real anime - that's high praise indeed. Story arc and character development are fantastic. You want to see what happens to the characters because you either root for or against them and you want to see how it ends. This is a totally addictive series which I went through 4 or 5 episodes at a sitting.My only minor quibble would be that the video quality on the DVDs is not the best, being blurry/ jaggy - especially Disc 1 of Book 1 - whether due to compression techniques or whatnot. This especially stands out on a large 1080p TV, upscaling aside.Overall - great series. You can see where it borrows from anime, especially Miyazaki, but this strengthens rather than detracts from the show. Excellent.",

This show is about spiritual experience that leads to the realization that love, peace, acceptance, and being present in the moment are the purpose of life. other than the complex things that are hidden behind the mask of an innocent kids show, there are many many positive subliminal messages that are aimed towards children. messages that are there to teach them about love, about listening, about accepting, about will, and about passion. messages that contradict our social norms, or maybe not contradict, but rather just there to remind us what's really important, because in the day to day life we tend to forget..This show is for everyone. it's funny, special, it can be dramatic but the main focus is on the flow of the world. the flow of \"destiny\" you can call it that. the flow of energy or life, doesn't matter the word. the flow of things I suppose.\nThis series is clean of ego or control of anything. it makes you feel free.",

During this time, the Fire Nation destroys his people and he is the only one remaining.When he is free from this iceberg he befriends a brother and sister, who are far from lame sidekicks, both having their own strengths that are built on as the show goes on.

SPOILERS AHEAD.Nickelodeon usually comes up with random cartoons with random humor and episodes, its shows never have an ongoing story, which is why I love Avatar so much. I'm also really into fantasy, which only made me love it more.I'm not as into anime as many would think I'd be, but after seeing Avatar I've been more interested in anime...or rather American anime, as that is what Avatar is.The characters are perfect, the action is breath-taking, the plot is awesome, and I absolutely *adore* the music. Another aspect that makes me respect Avatar is the fact that it has its mature and dramatic parts and mixes it with comic relief. Also, the animation is excellent.The show is about Aang, a 12-year-old boy who is also the Avatar, the master of all elements. He is the last living Airbender in the entire world, his people slaughtered by the merciless Firebenders, and although he knows he is the world's only hope, having the weight of the world on his shoulders causes him to be a reluctant hero (especially after hearing that he has a deadline), causing him to run away and accidentally put himself in suspended animation for 100 years. He meets with Katara, a 14-year-old Waterbender, and Sokka, Katara's 15-year-old warrior brother. The three of them travel around the world for Aang to learn the three remaining elements, water, earth, and fire. They have to avoid Prince Zuko, a 16-year-old banished prince and Firebender, and his brat sister Princess Azula. Eventually they meet with Toph, a 12-year-old blind Earthbender who joins the team and teaches Aang earth-bending while Katara teaches him water-bending.I love this show; there isn't a single episode I haven't seen, or at least seen a little of it. There are only three episodes in the first season I haven't seen completely, and none of the episodes in the second season have I missed. This is a really awesome show, and I highly recommend it to anybody who loves romance, drama, action, and, of course, plenty of humor and fun.",

            "content": "It's been almost 20 years since this show very first premiered back in early 2005, becoming an instant and extremely popular success, and even to this day, it is STILL just as popular as it was and has not lost any bit of its charm that made it a smashing success. When the series finale aired in late summer 2008, it broke a record (at the time) for becoming the most watched program in an entire week and an entire day, with an audience of 5.8 million viewers, including me, in the United States alone! The animation is absolutely amazing. The \"fighting styles\" done in the series are actually based on 4 different real-life martial arts: Tai Chi, Hung Gar, Northern Shaolin, and Ba Gua. The show's creators had real martial arts masters, or Sifus, come in to consult the animation. The writing in the show is actual real Chinese calligraphy. The spirituality in the show to some extent is based on our real world spirituality as well. The cast includes an all-star cast such as Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Dante Basco, Mako (up until his death in 2007, then was replaced by Greg Baldwin), and even Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker himself as the show's absolute main villain. Some secondary villains are played by Jason Isaacs, Clancy Brown (Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob), and Grey DeLisle. Some lesser and/or supporting roles include the voices of Andre Sogliuzzo, George Takei, Tsai Chin, Kevin Michael Richardson, Rene Auberjonois, Tara Strong, and more. When the show starts, it starts mostly on a goofy low-violent note, but then gets more and more dark and epic, like most shows do. Be aware that things will get to the point that it may be too scary for younger audiences, especially in Season 3. Those particular episodes are Season 3 episodes 8 and 9 and they are considered to be the darkest episodes in the entire show. Despite the show taking place in a fictional world, this show does tackle A LOT of serious real-world issues that younger audiences will either find disturbing or probably have a hard time understanding, depending on how young they are or the particular issue itself. Most of the issues recur throughout the show repeatedly as they are usually used to represent the severity of the situation, while the others are presented in only one or two episodes. The numerous real-world issues the show tackles are (in no particular order) dangers of imperialism, near elimination of a culture, favoritism, absent parents, childhood trauma/abuse, prisoners of war, struggles of refugees, prejudice against strangers, government misinformation, sexism, propaganda, losing a loved one, abusing political power, discrimination based on physical abilities, animal abuse, insecurities/body image, elitism, sanctity of life/struggling to uphold your values, and morality. But all that aside, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE!",

When I first starting watching it, I was skeptical, as these show aren't really my type, but I soon realized what was happening to me. I was watching a simple show, the emphasizes themes like love, trust and ambition. I mean everything about it is so perfect, it's impossible not to love it. There are three things that most marked me about this show. First the scenery. Every place is simply awe-inspiring and beautiful, and each detail is developed with such precision. The geography contrast and coordination between each of the four Nations is incredible. Second, the story line. The story at first is simple to understand, if not a little bit cheesy: a mysterious boy found to be the \"Avatar\", has to save the whole world from the grasp of the Fire Nation. But the plot is so well developed, each aspect of the story is imply perfect. Third and last, the characters. One of my criteria for greatness in any piece of television, is how much can the director attach you to his characters. I have never felt this way for anything else, except maybe for \"Friends\". All the characters are so unique and interesting, and they all play their part to perfection. My personal favorite was Iroh of the Fire Nation, as I cried twice during the third season because of him. All my friends have called me a loser for watching Avatar, but I know it is because they think it is just another stupid show with no point, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. This show has taught me so many things, and I believe everyone should watch it. It is truly a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This show is absolutely incredible, and is a must for all ages.Season 1- 9.2/10This season is where it began, I think because of a fewer weaker episodes like \"The Great Divide\", it was a bit weaker than the later seasons . However, it was still a very enjoyable season to watch. The main strengths of this season, was introducing Aang as the main character and his back story. Also, we got to know Katara and Soka in more detail. In this season we have Zuko as the main villain, and Aang's main mission is to learn to waterbend. This leads him to the North Pole, which where the two part finale took place which was breathtaking.Season 2- 9.6/10This was the strongest season in my opinion. It started off with the \"The Avatar State\" which was a great episode to start off the series. This episode gave us an in depth explanation on the avatar state. The whole season was much more fast paced than the first season and introduced the character Toph. She really was an incredible character and a crucial part to the story. This season also has one of the best episodes in the series \"Zuko Alone\". Which is another strong point, because it's this season which Zuko really starts on a journey of one of the best character arcs in the series. Also, we really begin to understand his character and the struggles he has gone through in his life. The main goal in this season was Aang to learn earth bending and to find something he lost which was very important to him. The main villain is Azula, who is an immensely complex and intelligent villain. The season finale was epic, and for me it was this season that made me appreciate all the main characters. It made me realise how important each one was to the story.Season 3-9.8/10The first half of this season was a lot weaker than season 2 in my opinion except a couple of episodes. However, after that, this season really shows us how great this tv show actually is. One such exemption from the first half is known as the \"Avatar and the Firelord\". This was a masterpiece, it is a backstory that ties in lots of unanswered questions from the previous seasons. Another incredible episode is \"The Firebending Masters\" this was the perfect way to introduce Aang into firebending, and perfect to further develop Zuko. The main goal of this season was to defeat the fire lord and learn all of the other 3 elements as aang already mastered air, he now needed to master water, earth and fire. Finally, the season finale was phenomenal. Every single character, played their part. The scenes with Zuko and Azula were out of this world, and the animation was stunning.Overall, I would strongly recommend this tv show. I watched it the first time when I was only 9 years old, and I have watched it multiple times ever since. The show has many themes, great stories, fantastic character development and amazing world building.",

This is one of three shows I have ever seen that has both humor and drama down to a point. It is also the only show that has this down so well that I have yet to see an episode that I disliked enough not to watch it over and over and over...Every one of the characters seemed real. So real I can see the people around me in them all the time. It was amazing.Don't think this is a kid's show. Yes, it's appropriate for kids. But if you give it a chance, adults, teenagers, and kids alike will be swept up in the plot, sucked in by the animation, and kidnapped from your preconceptions of the show by the characters within a few episodes.

Generally, children don't require in depth story lines as well as deep characters for them to like a TV series, they only require cute characters and bright colors.But now that I'm in University, I can finally review this series as a mature person, and truth be told, I'm still hooked.When one initially watches Avatar: The Last Airbender, initial thoughts are of a typical Sunday Morning cartoon where there is a distinct good guy and a distinct bad guy.This however, is an extremely simplified view point.Avatar: The Last Airbender has the emotional depth that most mature TV series are unable to succeed. The character building, the animation as well as the voice acting will all pull you into this wonderful world of fantasy and action.Avatar: The Last Airbender is successful in what it aims to do and more. Not only does it allow kids to relate to the series with cute character as well as pretty animations, it succeeds in gaining the interest of people who would usually consider cartoons and animations immature.",

Although it was made by American creators, it has many qualities of Japanese anime. The animation was done by Japanese artists as well.The show is about a kid named Aang, the last living air-bender who was frozen inside a ice ball for 100 years. He was found by siblings Katara and Sokka. They join him on his quest to stop the Fire nation from taking over the world. Along the way we meet many interesting characters and experience many genuinely happy and sad moments.The antagonists of the show, the fire lord and his 2 children are equally well written characters. Both Zuko and Azula have fantastic character arcs. The fire lord is kind of 1 dimensional but he is voiced by Mark Hamill. There are many other side characters who are not only entertaining but also take this show to an amazing height.This is the kind of show that every kid needs to watch growing up. Even as an adult watching this, this show teaches so many things.",

            "content": "In a clever mix of ancient Chinese culture and art, and modern relatable characters, Avatar: The Last Airbender is an absolute joy for all ages. I was very pleasantly surprised when I tuned in for the first episode in 2005 and saw, not the same recycled atypical Nickelodeon story line and boring and/or nonexistent character arcs; but a rich visual pallet and an incredible sprawling epic of a story, coupled with very relatable, likable, and undeniably REAL characters. This show has elements of romance, drama, comedy, action, suspense, heartbreak and downright epicness to it...and it's a show aimed at 12-15 year old kids! I can think of no real problems with the show, except to say that it was a bit rushed in its third and final season, and as a result, there were certain things I would have personally like to have seen more polished. However, the rest of the series is just so well done that it completely immerses you in the story and what's happening on screen - something that Hollywood films rarely do well - that these minor problems don't even matter. The best way to think about Avatar is to think of it in terms of the Original Star Wars films: The first installment was all around great. It set up the characters perfectly, and it eventually ended with a huge bang and hyped the audience for the next installment. The second installment straight up took it to another level all together. The characters all come into their own, showcasing new skills and actively evolving as real people. On top of that, the events and situations of the season only serve to make it much darker and give it a much richer tone and once the endgame eventually came, it left the audience saying, \"What the hell are we supposed to think now?\" Everybody ends on a low note, nobody ends on a high note, and it hooked the audience flawlessly. The third took the audience visually in a whole new direction, showcasing the talent of the animators and the shear artistic vision of the creators, but toward the end it just got a little sloppy. It seemed like the creators were a little more concerned with showing everybody where they had been rather than the final endgame of the series. There was one loose end in fact, that really annoyed me personally, and that was what happened to Zuko's Mother, Ursa. But in hindsight, if that's really the only gripe that I have with the show, that doesn't really say much. But as I said, in the end, it just amounted to this EPIC story about love, trust, betrayal, family, redemption and a great coming of age story. How many franchises can you honestly say that about? Not many.In summary, if you like films like Star wars and (yes), even Lord of the Rings, then you will undoubtedly love Avatar: The Last Airbender. It was a culmination of elements, (no pun intended), that came together and made Avatar what it was (and still is) and made it so enjoyable to watch. I'm 19 now and I still love it, and I'm psyched out of my mind for the upcoming spin off series, Avatar: The Legend of Korra, set to air in mid-2012. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend Avatar, and you can go pick up the series on 3 box sets at any given retail store for little of nothing now that the show has ended. I really hope you liked this review and take in into consideration. 10/10 easy.",

Humor is also great with some pretty damn funny moments especially during season 2. The story is the real highlight of the show, it feels like a massive adventure and Season 1 introduces the whole premise of the show really well. The animation is impressive, despite being only available in DVD quality, the art is well detailed and animation smoothness is superior to many Anime I have seen, this is truly on- par or better than Japanese shows I have seen which is surprising considering American animation is generally thought as not being that great.All this with a solid ending makes this a truly superb show and I highly recommend watching this if you are looking for a good TV show to watch or want to get into Anime as this is a good sort-of introduction into the art style.",

Now I'm not a cartoon fan at all. But this story is at the top of my list with favourite series, alongside with the JJR's the lord of the rings/Hobbir/Silmarillion and Steven Kings Dark Towers.The story of Avatar Aang is a 3 chapter story about how a little boy with enormous powers fights of the evil in his world. In that process our main character grows in personality, power and learns about the world around him and human relationships. It's a story about friendship, love, honer and wisdom. The story is ongoing from A-Z with little sub story's trough out the series.To my opinion not just a story for kids, but also for adults because there is underplaying deeper scene to it than any other cartoon I've seen.

            "content": "I will be the first to admit that I had completely ignored this show, as I pretty much stopped caring about Nickelodeon by the time I was 15. I am now 19 and it is only within the past few months that I became interested, and decided to give it a go. And boy oh boy was that one of the greatest ideas of my life.Oddly enough, what got me interested was the trailer for the film, which I will not even comment on here, but you can read my review of that on The Last Airbender (2010) page. Anyway, I decided to watch the show, thinking that the trailer made it look pretty epic. \"Even if it's annoying, maybe at least the battles will look cool,\" I thought.I should go back in time and slap myself in the friggin face and screamed: \"STOP THINKING YOUR TOO COOL FOR NICKELODEON! WATCH THIS AWESOME SHOW!\" and then the slapping would commence.Seriously, this is without a doubt one of the greatest television shows ever. Not just \"greatest cartoons\" or \"greatest Nick shows,\" no, no, no. This is ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME. Never before has traditional animation had such three-dimensional characters. There hasn't been action sequences this cool since \"Samurai Jack.\" Not to mention the gut-busting humor that never resorts to pop culture or just utter annoyance (eff you, Spongebob) for a good laugh...an occasional fart joke maybe, but never annoying.Not to mention I'm a 19 year old guy who digs \"Saw\" and Rob Zombie and stuff... and this show managed to sometimes shock me or even tug at my heartstrings. Especiialy the episode that pays homage to Mako, the late voice actor who portrays the utterly awesome Uncle Iroh. If you don't well up a little during his segment in The Tales of Ba Sing Se, you have NO SOUL.This review is for all those people my age who have overlooked this show because of that unfortunate Nickelodeon thing. Give this a shot like I did. You will not be sorry. If this be Nickelodeon's swan song to excellent programming, then they went out with a bang. A super gigantic mega huge bang that completely and totally rocks, full of rock and roll and dragons and other stuff too awesome to be described.",

            "content": "I've only just started watching this show and already I've bought the full first season on DVD, I just couldn't help myself. I wouldn't call it \"fake\" anime, since it is most certainly inspired by it, but at the same time it is completely western. There are certainly elements of anime in it, especially in the way action and humour are played off each other. The style is similar to anime as well, and yet has a distinct look that declares it to be something else entirely.Another interesting thing about Avatar is that the humour is very western. Though it is based in a world that is clearly influenced by the cultures of the east, the jokes and humour are very clearly inspired by what we as westerners consider funny but it is combined with eastern humour in regards to expressions and reactions of the characters. (Of course many of the reactions are also more based in the west than the east. Maybe I haven't watched enough anime but I don't remember many where characters hit themselves in the forehead when someone says something dumb or strange. In most anime such a reaction would involve the characters falling over) The storyline itself is excellent. The characters themselves are round and dynamic. Even the villain at the beginning of the show grows and changes with his experiences. He has his own history and his a sympathetic character in his own right. The writers take the time in making the characters more real, in giving them their own stories and backgrounds. Few of the important characters are flat or static. Some you really can come to hate and some you can come to sympathize with. There is a sense that some of these characters could be real people. The storyline is interesting and keeps you wanting to watch and see what happens next. The writers are also clever in how they give strong characters weaknesses and creating characters that at first could seem weak but come to show that they have strengths of their own. I would say that this show, though a cartoon, takes a page out of the book of anime and makes itself accessible to children and adults. I certainly enjoy watching it and get several good chuckles out of each episode. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone. I certainly hope the writers are able to keep it up.",

All the major characters have great personalities, undergo major changes, and are plain impossible not to get attached to. They deal with some really serious issues too. Only rarely did I feel like I was watching something intended for kids alone. As a 28 year old viewer, the one thing that bothered me a bit was the shortage of real consequences. Adult viewers might expect a brutal war of conquest to be somewhat deadlier than this show makes it out to be.

After learning the fate of the world the avatar and his new friends travel the world to learn the other three elements to battle against the fire lord. While on his adventures he is often chased and pursued by fire lord ozais banished son prince zuko and his uncle iroh who attempt to capture the avatar to redeem himself in the eyes of the fire lord.Now I'll get into the review.To be very honest the shows first half starts off kind of boring and sometimes the pacing is to fast to digest what's happening (its a kids show so this might just an issue for us but nonetheless) it starts pacing itself better in the second half and starts which makes it way more entertaining and enjoyable. Overall the first season had some memorable and good moments near the end but it's insanely good. However that's where season 2 and 3 excel. A lot of times throughout the show (especially season 1) it can feel like some episodes don't have anything to do with the plot and are there just to fill time. They can be slow and pointless. But in season 2 and 3 they are less frequent and the story episodes sometimes get multiple parts and continuing where the last episode left off, which didn't happen as much in season 2. The story, characters, pacing, animation, voice acting and action all improve. Season 3 is easily the best and has to be one of my favourite cartoon or animation seasons of any show I've watched. After season 1 I thought this was good but wasn't great. But I was proved completely wrong by season 2 and 3. The story gets more emotional and deep and you start to actually care for the characters and their inner struggles of dealing with the weight of the world on their shoulders. I guarantee if you make it past season 1 you will definitely enjoy the whole show the rest of the way through. It's definitely a show I recommend to anyone seeing this, even if it's made for kids it's still a great show. 9/10 and it's definitely a rewatchable show and has tons of things to enjoy about it.",

            "content": "Avatar: The Last Airbender is a TV series I've been watching since I was nine or ten years old. When I first saw it, I was primarily interested in the goofy characters, the imaginative bending, and the progressing storyline. I hadn't developed a sense of great insight, but I nevertheless enjoyed it thoroughly, like how cartoons should be. This is what I love about the show: it can be an in-depth, character-developing and world-building story, but also a funny, visually entertaining and magical cartoon. I rewatched it a few years later, and my eyes were suddenly opened to a new world. I appreciated the character's genuine and original personalities, the inventive creatures, the tone that constantly switches between light and dark, the magnificent voice acting, the clever jokes and ultimately, the best part about the series: the character development. This isn't a cartoon like Spongebob where you can turn on an episode and don't need any context to understand what's happening; this show has an actual story. Each episode is a great chapter in a vast story. (And don't get me wrong, Spongebob is a wonderful show as well). As the story goes on, you see how the characters react to situations they're put into. This show forgets nothing-they can always relate back to previous experiences which influence the characters' current situation. Some of their reactions may be exciting, boring, disappointing, or even completely surprising. But the amazing thing about it is this-each and every one of the reactions and decisions made by the characters are completely realistic. These characters are completely human, particularly Zuko, my favorite character. He, specifically goes through several challenges and comes out of them in ways that you'd never expect. The animation is visually appealing, but surely not perfect. However, with the state of technology the show was in as it was made, it did very well for its circumstances. And you can bet I'm thrilled to getting the Blu-Ray when it released next week. The music is absolutely fantastic. It is touching, layered, thoughtful, and beautifully crafted. The ending music piece (titled, Peace, actually) is something I can always turn on and suddenly feel serenity, wherever I am. The humor is clever and distributed in many different ways among many different characters. It's constant, and absolutely laughable. Without the humor, this show would be completely different. It is critical in this series for it to work. Avatar: The Last Airbender has some of the most layered and entertaining characters, some of the most dazzling drawings and designs, some of the most surprising and jaw-dropping events, and some of the most touching moments I've ever had the incredible delight of viewing. If you have not seen this series, you're not doing yourself any favors by not watching it. And if you're not interested because you think it's anime, it's not. It's a Nick cartoon with mere Japanese-like style and setting. The biggest problem I have with the show is that I'm beginning to be bored with it a little bit; only because I've watched it about a million times. But it doesn't matter, because it's just simply amazing.",

Centuries past and is to be found by Katara and Sokka was brilliant. Along on Aang's journey to master the other elements really explains the struggles of what he needs to fulfill his destiny, along with his friends to back him up to never give up. Sometimes, in the show, there are funny moments that not most of the time the show isn't about action.

Aang is such a wonderful character, whose sweetness and innocence contrasts so well with the ruthless and cynical characters he comes into contact with. Prince Zuko is also a really fascinating character because he isn't just straight up bad, he is drawn with many shades of grey and is a very sympathetic \"villian.\" (I hope he joins Aang and his friends' side in the end!)

I love animation and have seen literally hundreds of series.There are a number of reasons I say this...1. The lightness of tone, which actually is a cover for a deep, powerful story of personal discovery and the futility and loss of a planetary war, among other things.2. The excellent voice work by all concerned.3. The profound messages gradually parcelled out over the episodes.4. The excellent handling of the different elemental powers: no type of elemental power is better than any other, it's the skill of the individual that counts.5. The friendships between the characters...this is just lovely.6. The development of the story through each episode. There is no real filler here as far as I see it, just a carefully planned story that makes perfect sense, and characters that always stay in character moment to moment.I am sure there is more to say, but I don't want to give any story away, so I will leave it there.Similar to Adventure Time, my second favourite animation series ever, the action seems quite childish at times, but if you look below the surface at the themes being addressed, you will find something more adult than 90% of 'adult' series.Wonderful, just wonderful.",

It deals with heavy issues in ways that everyone can understand. Its so fun to watch over and over again and it never gets boring.The basic plot of the story is that Aang, the last airbender, has to restore balance to the rest of the world.I would say this show is appropriate for everyone five and up, but that varies depending on how you handle slightly scary/frightening sequences.I stormy recommend watching Avatar the last aidbender!",

            "content": "In hindsight, a young boy teaming up with two siblings in a world where people can bend the elements to overcome the domination of a warlord doesn't seem that great, but the creators DiMartino and Konietzko have created a masterpiece.Most shows take time to settle with the audience but Avatar kicks off with humour, character development, amazing scenery and action straight off from the beginning. The animation works perfectly along with the show, displaying the characters and the action scenes seamlessly. The music amplifies the mood and tone and the voice work is spot on.The episodes themselves meld very well, every episode has something in it for the viewer whether it be a significant contribution to the main storyline or not. There is no filler here.The characters are amazingly portrayed in the cartoon. Their stories alone are amazing. The story of Zuko is the deepest and is one that the production crew can take a bow for. The characters change but their traits remain the same, they adapt to each other seamlessly and their struggles and success contribute to the cartoon as a whole.The research the creators did for the show is evident through the detail in 'fighting styles' and the different people in the four nations. The artwork in the temples are breathtaking, the scenes exude grandeur while the climatic portions receive the exclusivity and suspense they deserve. DiMartino and Konietzko knew what they were doing and they knew the show would span over 3 seasons. This planning paces the show perfectly, unveiling the story piece by piece more with suspense than cryptics. The result is a smooth storyline where the viewers aren't tired out by the length or left thirsty for more.Avatar isn't just another horrible attempt at anime by American producers, it's a masterpiece, one that should be soaked in from the top to bottom. I've watched it all at least 5 times by now and still end up feeling the emotion of watching Zuko's story, the humour with Sokka and Aang and the epic encounters throughout to the end.",

It is really universal in appeal and has a beautiful character driven plot in which the viewer develops a deep loyalty and love for Team Avatar as well as other characters as each person develops and grows from personal hardship and tests of character. These characters are well rounded and complex as we relate to their real struggles and celebrate in their victories, whether that be a positive transformation in ideals or a victory over the fire nation.This show encapsulates the distinctly human elements of friendship, the pressure of one's destiny, nature vs. nature and the great capacity for good and evil within us all, as well as, importantly, the power to change. Each character, it feels, reflects a value as well as struggle that we find within ourselves. Whether it be the intense grief, but the resolution to set things right by guiding others along righteous paths of Uncle Iroh, the struggle of identity of good and evil within Zuko or being overshadowed in ability yet keeping an unwavering loyalty and protection of his friends for Sokka. Each of these aspects, although not fully representative of these complex characters is subtly and artfully revealed each characters' back story and life experiences attributing a sense of authenticity to these rounded characters.Overall, it was made as a kid's cartoon, its appeal and intention is universal and remains a favourite among those who watch it to this day. Indeed, it is my favourite show also, and I would obviously recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "It's clearly one of the best TV shows I've ever seen in my life and I mean it. in every sense of the word.\nit's a bit too modestly reserved in some of its dialogues and a bit too kid-friendly gentle but what else to expect from a Nickelodeon series, do not get me wrong.\nBut, They are supposed to be teenagers and they look like adults, yet mostly talk like kids.\nA series that shows that animation can be more than just children's entertainment and one that has inspired me to do more.\nThe Anime Influence clearly has its place here because I think it created something new a Toonime\n(Half catoon and half anime like Japanese-American cuisine)I'm overwhelmed because that was the first series that actually made me laugh, cry, love, hate, fear, tremble, and applaud. (sometimes even in the same episode)\nHow clearly the whole of their prices earned quite a lot of influence and ended up in the right place so that was no exploited to long.The only problem I have is that Aang and Katara became a couple.\nSince my childhood, these stories where \"the male main character and the female main character come together at the end\" bother me. And that was already clear from the first scenes on, when they saw each other or the first time. For a series of so many different themes, topics and mature moments would it be much better if that had not been the case.From a narrative point of view and character arcs, character evolution and growth, it would be much better if Zuko and Katara had become a couple. I literally would not have changed anything in this series except this relationship. (Think what that would mean Symbolically)Somtimes I had, thanks to this, much trouble getting to the episodes and this redundant aspect has broken parts of the series. Because of that, we had to do in some episodes by dear cutie relationship blabla and the typical back and forth bickering from Julia Roberts movies.I could tolerate that, If in the end it turns out that Katara and Aang are not a couple but Zuko und Katara.\nBecause that is an important thing of growing up. And that would have put these boring scenes in a new light aswell this series a few places higher.\nThe character development goes miles ahead + that would be a good lesson for the young audience, that not the first one you met, it also \"the one\".But if that's my only problem with such a fantastic series, then there's little to say about it except it's almost perfect.\nI'll keep it in honor to keep watching it and can not wait to see how my kids will respond to.\nAvatar forever.",

            "content": "When it comes to the competition in children's cartoons these days, the bar seems to be set very low. While there may be many decent cartoons airing at the time, none seem to fill that hungry void in the TV market that will have kids waiting desperately for the next episode. Avatar seemed to fill the void. Characters are well developed, animation well done, story well plotted, and the list of pros can go on and on.To me the most appealing aspect of Avatar is the well planned out story and amazing fantasy world created by the writers. The story is set in a world where some people have a special ability; the ability to \"bend\" certain elements (fire, water , earth, air). Each of the elements have their own respective nation of these special element benders. For every generation, there is an avatar, someone that has the ability to master each of the four elements. In the generation that the story takes place in, the avatar has been missing for 100 years, in which time the world has become unbalanced and chaotic. While the avatar was missing, the fire nation took control and started an invasion of all the other nations. The show starts off as two teenagers in the south pole discover the long lost avatar in an iceberg, where Aang (the avatar) has been frozen in for a hundred years. The story line plot follows the two south pole teenagers: Sokka and his sister Katara as they help Aang master the four elements and try to save the world.As the gang travels the world in their quest, they meet a lot of enemies and friends that fans will come to love and hate. The characters in \"Avatar: The Last Air Bender\" are my favorite part of the show. Every major character is lovable, and in time even some of the enemies can be loved as well. Be prepared to remember things throughout the show, every episode contains something important that will play a big part in later episodes even some of the filler episodes. The writers do a great job of fleshing out the characters. You will come to know the background of almost all the major characters, even including the enemies.The fighting and action aspect of \"Avatar\" is another great part of the show. The four elements just cover the surface of combat in \"Avatar\". Within every element is a level of mastery that gives the bender new abilities. There is blood bending, lightning bending, and metal bending just to name a few. And every element has its own fighting style and real life counterpart to a real life martial arts. It doesn't hurt that the animation is smooth and flawless.In conclusion, \"Avatar\" is one of the most well crafted shows ever. With an excellent plot, characters, and animation three seasons of this show didn't seem to fill my hunger. Oh and speaking of the finale, \"Avatar\" had an epic ending that completely finished the story in a dramatic manner. A cartoon with this level of drama, action, romance, and humor should not be missed out by anyone of any age. Watch or you will surely miss a well crafted show.",

It has everything, from fast paced action scenes to romance, all tied together within a carefully planned plot. There are no dead ends, every detail is touched on eventually and no questions are left unanswered. And thats the way I like it! It is rare to find hiccups in the storyline, none that I can recall.Unlike traditional anime, such as Naruto, there is always something on. They've got the right idea, go straight to the point! No filler talk, no separate story arcs, apart from a few episodes (for example, the painted lady) where the only thing that happens is character development. It's OK, because I know most shows on nick (and Disney) has no storyline at all...I like how every episode has high quality animation. they actually move, and their mouths make different shapes! In anime, it is really annoying watching them open and close their mouths like puppets, I don't understand why they can't do that (maybe to make it easier to translate?)I want to end with a warning.

The animation is beautiful, as is the bending the characters do. What really sets Avatar apart though, is its representation of good vs evil. It shows repeatedly that positive emotion and love can always triumph in a realistic, not cheesy way. A large part of the show has significant eastern-spiritual influence, which is surprising and wonderful to see in a cartoon, and Aang often meditates and has knowledge of quite a bit Zen teaching.

And while that show continues to remain a big hit with kids and adults alike, of course there are plenty of other shows that the channel has to offer, from cartoon classics like the Fairly OddParents, Rugrats and The loud house to teen sitcoms like iCarly or Victorious.However, I was a little more sceptical when I noticed just how much people seemed to rave over a particular cartoon known as 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. I mean, this show happened a VERY long time ago during the mid-to-late 2000's era. And for a while, it did have me wondering \"How is this show still as popular with people today than it was back when it aired? And why is everyone going crazy about it?\".... there was only one way to figure that out.So for the first time in adulthood, I recently watched this entire series from start to finish. And in case you didn't know the story, Katara and her brother Sokka - who are members of the Water Tribe - end up finding a boy named Aang, believed to be the new Avatar - master of the four elements (Water, earth, fire and air), and the one destined to bring an end to the war and restore peace to the nations.Season 1 of course starts off a bit silly and slow-paced (as is the case with most TV shows I guess) but as we get into Seasons 2 & 3, this is where the story exceeds and it just keeps getting better & better! While the first season introduced us to our main cast: Aang, Katara, Sokka, Appa, Momo, Zuko and Iroh, the second season introduces us to some new characters like Toph; an Earthbending master who is blind but can use her feet to feel vibrations and fight her opponents.I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but for an action cartoon this show just does everything RIGHT - from the colourful visuals to character development in the later seasons. For example, Sokka starts off as just this cocky, stubborn, kind of this show-off character who's just along for the ride cracking jokes and all, but he really does become a better character, even teaming up with Zuko (a bad guy turned good guy) to rescue his girlfriend from a Fire Nation prison.And I love that show reminds me somehow of one of my favourite childhood shows - Storm Hawks - probably because of how their universes are crafted as well as the villains and how well written they are compared to other fictional bad guys.I would argue that it is one of those shows that you should watch from the beginning like with the Clone wars, Game of Thrones, Walking Dead (maybe?). But overall, it really is a show that must be seen and watched from start to finish in order to truly appreciate what it has to offer!Avatar is probably my new favourite cartoon of all-time and I can definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in adventure, fantasy, action, worldbuilding or if you just like anime but want to watch something similar. I'm definitely going to be watching this show again and again in the years to come!10/10... that is all!",

Zuko feels a need to please people because he was never valued by his father. He has an unending need to capture the Avatar because it will please his father. When he feels this is impossible he falls in on himself (Zuko alone). When he changes sides he feels the need to make all gaang to like him not just let him be there. This results in the \"life changing feild trips\" where his own experinces allow him to help the others.Zuko has Self-Destructive tendencies. He gets in fights he isn't sure he can win with Zhao and Azula and otherwise puts himself in unnecessary phsycial danger danger. He also subjects himseo to emotional situations that he knows will hurt him. He has little skill to handel his emotions or direct his energy and ambition destructing tends to be his outlit. Self-destructing also is an outlit for his own self-hate.Honour is an important concept within the culture of the fire nation. But Zuko has an over-attachment to this idea to the point that people feel the need to comment on it (Namely Azula & Iroh). He fixates on this idea because it was drilled into him it was the most important but he feels he lacks it and overcompensates. It becomes a fixation and a way in wich to search for meaning he is lacking and a way to justify his self esteem issues and anger.He has a tendency to be very dramatic in general and have extreme reactions. This is generally a reaction to a perceived slight against his ego, rejection or insults. I believe like the dangerous streak he deals with the emotional scars he was never taught to process his emotions and his self-image is completely shattered by being banished.His struggles with pretty intense Trust Issues. This is shown by the fact he denies help from most people and doesn't believe they want to help him. This is born from the fact that most people he grew up with were duplicitous.Shame is a prominent characteristic of Zuko's character. This is pointed out by uncle Iroh in Bitter Work. This comes I think from the lack of emotional support.Through his exposure to the earth kingdom, seeinf first hand devstation of the war and spiritual teaching from Iroh Zuko is able to reconcile his innate compassion and the love he did see from his mother as a kid with his belife in honour and strength. He learns a strength born from humility, love and family.Azula is a complex character who is gifted, clever, beautiful, and deeply psychologically injured. Her story is one of abuse, manipulation, and war. She was raised by abusive people in a cult of power and supremacy; by the age of 14, she was being used to put the same trauma out on the entire world.The prime driver for Azula's character is the necessity to retain control over her situation and due to her status as the princess of the world's dominant power, this is control over everything. Control and power are the only things Azula truly understands as valuable. This control also equals safety, safety from physical harm during a battle, and emotional harm by others. We can see this control manifest in her emotional distress at having even one hair out of place during her training (2x01). She uses her place of power to hold fear over other people, those she considers lesser than her, by invoking the fear of losing their place and physical harm. Her social power and skill in bending back up the threats.Azula's need for control started as a child who grew up being taught through the iron hand of Ozai who demanded perfection. Her status as a prodigy with fire bending, physical aptitude, and intelligence gave her positive attention from her father but also led her to be inculcated even stronger into the idea that fear is the only way. Her father taught with the fear of retribution for failure as much as any positive attention. The more blatant abuse Zuko suffered from their father for showing what was perceived as weakness and emotionality was another teacher that she must always control every part of her.Overall this show MIGHT seem like it's a childish movie but in reality it's a movie with amazing characters, tragic scenes, amazing fights, perfect story and just a wonderful world.",

            "content": "The writers were inspired coming up with this story, I honestly don't know how they did it. I've been an addict of good movies and TV shows since I was a kid, and Avatar takes the cake for me as the best told story of all time. I would put it up against Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings, etc. If you lived your life based off of the principles of this show it would outdo any religion or ethics class you could find. Don't be deceived by the fact that this show was on a kids network, it's absolutely brilliant and incredibly deep. I've watched this show probably 5+ times all the way through and it only gets better with time.The characters represent all of the same struggles we all face in life; fear, hypocrisy, guilt, revenge, forgiveness, redemption. All of the characters grapple with the challenge of fulfilling their \"destiny\" and realizing what that means for each of them. Aang and Zuko, in particular, start their journey on one path-believing their destiny is predetermined-and realize along the way that they have agency and the power to determine their own fate. The characters learn from the past and truly \"come of age\" by the end. The show has love, but it doesn't distract from the story or interrupt the bond and friendship between the characters.Avatar has several attributes that set it apart from many other shows. First off, it's patient. It doesn't ever give you what you want right away. You have to wait two full seasons before you finally see the fire lord. Some of the characters don't become likable until the very end of the series. The lessons are seasons in the making. Second, the show seamlessly introduces new characters, such as Toph, and makes the viewer love them as much as the original characters. Finally, the story is perfectly paced. From beginning to end, every episode is important to the overarching story and the development of the characters. There's no fluff and they don't overdo it. It's a perfectly told trilogy that leaves you begging for more. Other shows seem like they're figuring out the story, season by season and trying to come up with more material. Avatar is well thought out and flows perfectly from beginning to end. Also most finales are a complete let down, whereas Avatar's finale is the best part of the entire story. It wraps up the story and character arcs beautifully and lives up to the build up of the previous seasons.There are few shows/movies I would say this about, but it is a truly life-changing story. If you haven't watched it, give it an honest try. I couldn't recommend this show enough.",

It has brought upon me to laugh, feel sad and rage at some characters that have been introduced in the series. All these emotions is the pinnacle of how Avatar is so great. Not many anime/cartoons have done so and that's why Avatar has left itself to be one of the best to watch. There is nothing like it, action packed with martial arts, filled with comedy and based on philosophical meaning for older viewers. It is great for a family night together to watch. A very excellent, thought through production that has brought a very good viewing to my entertainment. Overall, Avatar is a must see series for those who do not mind the children animation. Avatar is EPIC!(Also a bit off topic) Forwarded to the previous comment - \"I think it has biblical references\" Although these are good observations, I must say there is none what so ever of any biblical references. Avatar has already shown itself to be based of some Asian cultures with its Buddhist and Taoism religions. Fire Nation as hell? True there is a physical resemblance but the creators never intended to make Fire Nation to look like hell. Plus the creators have already stated what religions they used in which I have already mentioned. It was not to teach the children about the bible but to provide philosophical meaning towards the older viewers. The children animation was only intended for their entertainment.",

Along the way, Aang discovers the Fire Nation is setting out to rule all 3 remaining tribes. After learning the 3 elements, the group set our to stop the Fire Nation.Avatar has something about it, something i can't quite put my finger on that makes it one of the best cartoon's I've ever seen. And my choice of movies would be from Guy Ritchie. The fact that the show can make the audience feel a number of emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, humor) make this one for the books. The great storyline, coupled with great action sequences and likable characters, make Avatar a recommendable series.",

The plot is just genius, with the nations, and I find the backstories of the Nations intriguing. Also, the characters are fascinating and enjoyable.

Despite being labeled as a 'kid' show, this show has some pretty adult themes and situations dealing with problems like love, betrayal and destiny.All in all it seems like a real budget show with a great dialogue and anime-like art which totally fits the show! The use of real things such as Chinese characters and Martial Arts styles for the moves are an added boast that make this show perfectly awesome!

The research that is put in making Bending style, the music so amazing, the legendary story with humble characters who struggle with their very being in a full-fledged global war. Every episode has a message, a meaning and development.

This is one of the most well written characters of all time and his character arc is BY FAR the best out of any I have ever seen!

The show starts off with two water tribe kids Kitara and Sokka who find the avatar in a frozen ice berg. The avatar in this land is a being who has power to all four elements which is earth, fire,water, and air. His duty as an avatar is protect and keep balance in the world. But when Aang the avatar is found he is just a little kid. He was frozen for 100 years and during that time a war was happening. The fire nation had declared war on all the other nations. They were responsible for the destruction of many cities and villages including the extension on air nomads which is what Aang is, he is the last air bender. With the help of Kitara and Sokka he will find teachers in different lands to help him master all four element and defeat the fire lord which is responsible for the war. In their journey new friends and love will emerge. They will discover many things that relate to their pasts and families.",

And yes, I'm a man, but so? I always grew up with cartoons that had interesting and strong women, like demona, April oneil( not strong but ambitious and funny) power puff girls, ( yes I watched them, but hey it had action!) And characters like this, katara, toph, azula, they all had incredible back stories and development, and they weren't just pretty faces. So through shows like this that have females with actual personality and brains lead me to always have a positive view of the female gender. Great show with a great message. I know demona was evil but I always had a thing for villains, whether it be male or female I always loved them, but she was more tragic than evil, and i always felt sad for her.",

To be honest, I don't know what I disliked about this show as a kid. I just remember wanting to watch something else, despite my friends telling me how great the show was.I decided to watch avatar properly for the first time being much older, because of the amazing reception and score it had on IMDB, and as you can see at my own amount of stars I absolutely loved it! It took me a couple of episodes to really be immersed, might be because of my previous experiences with the show, but after those first few episodes which aren't bad at all, I was hooked! The great storylines, amazing voice acting and outstanding writing and animation. Everything wrapped in a simple yet compelling narrative with a fleshed out world and distinct characters where every single one feels special.Every character drives the story forward or play a part in helping our main protagonists which of course is what brings all the heart and joy that avatar has. You develop a real connection with Aang, Katara, Toph and Sokka, you feel like a part of the team, and you understand Zuko, Azula, Iroh and Ozai. They don't feel like one dimensional characters, they have depth and quarrels with each other and themselves, they all have their own background and beliefs and each character develop as a person over the course of the show, and of course we got to give our respects to the cabbage man!This \"kids\" show will make you go through an array of emotions, as the performances and writing is absolutely super-b. The animation is still to this day beautiful and holds up by todays standards. It has a lot of charm and express a lot of emotions in both obvious and subtle ways. This of course isn't a thriller but in the end a show made for kids, but it can definitely be hearth wrenching and dark just as much as it is fun and light hearted. I absolutely loved this and I think everyone will, despite my own first impressions. As a kid I couldn't see the perfection of this wonderful show. A show that isn't just for kids but just as much for adults, which I am a true testament to. Avatar is outstanding and there is something for everyone in this show, no matter if you're a kid, teen or adult. This show has stood the test of time as a perfect animated show.10/10.",

Or if it were being recommended to me by 8 year olds, or FOR 8 year olds. What's baffling is the number of adults recommending this to other adults, as if it weren't a children's show.I gave it an honest effort. I got most of the way through the first season, very nearly to the end, because multiple people had told me it gets SO GOOD. But really, it's a children's show. It may get good for a children's show, but as an adult it has virtually no appeal. The protagonists are annoying children, who do the same annoying crap every episode. The antagonist is an annoying child, who does the same annoying crap every episode. Mako is an absolute delight as the uncle, but that's like saying the ocean was wet. Mako is ALWAYS a win. He is a goddamned national treasure. Mako aside though (and I am starting to feel like a broken record), it is a children's show. There is absolutely nothing in this for adults, unless it is the nostalgia for young adults who watched this and fell in love with it WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.So if you watched this as a child and loved it, apparently it really holds up and you'll probably love it again. If you're a child, for god's sake stop reading this review and go watch it. I'm sure it's fantastic. However, if you're an adult being told by other adults that this is SO GOOD, do yourself a favor and ignore them. It's a children's show, there's nothing in it you'll enjoy.",

There is the occasional childish humor (which, for the most part, I find somewhat smart and funny), but for the most part \"potty\" humor is avoided, which I appreciate. The plot is layered and intelligent, each character is well developed and has many dimensions, and it portrays real struggles--it's more than just mindless eye candy for children. On that note, the animation is also spectacular. People try to define it in certain classes of animation, but in the end it doesn't matter, it's very good. Some cons are sometimes the dialogue can be cheesy, even if it's important and furthers the story line. This include things like bursting saying random information which may be important to the viewer, but seems unlikely for it to be what the character would say at the time. Also, I am not a fan of the romance that develops with the main character because this is not a show about romance. I believe that a tenet of the show is the importance of love and friendship, but it comes off to me as saying that boys and girls can't be friends on television. It feels cheap. A third thing is while I really like the voice of Zuko, the acting is a little weak on his part, but that's up to interpretation. It's easy to list things I don't like, but there is a reason I gave it a 9. I would recommend to everybody that they pick this show up!",

Even though I was a kid when this aired, I hadn't watched it until I was 17 years old and I've rewatched it twice since then. So my review isn't clouded by nostalgia believe me when I say this is one of the best shows ever produced. Not even one of the best animated shows, just straight up one of the best. The storytelling and worldbuilding is amazing. The characters are lovable and flawed and realistic. The first season starts off kind of slow but the second and third season really make up for it. It is a children's show but the writing is fantastic, the story is really well thought out and especially in the later seasons it feels like every episode is really important to the ongoing story and character development. There are so many details that in every rewatch I found something new that I hadn't noticed before. You just know that the creators gave it their all and put so much love into the show. Even though it's a kids show it tackles themes of loss, genocide, imperialism and morality. It has great female characters that aren't your typical \"strong female characters\" (you know the type) but girls that are so well written and all so different from each other. I wish I had seen it as a kid because Katara and Toph are definitely characters I would have looked up to as a child. Zuko's character arc is one of the most interesting and well done character arcs in television, but really all of the characters go through so much growth and it's just straight up joy to watch them on their journey to defeat the fire lord. The world building and characters are what really makes this show great. And it's got something for everybody. Looking for cool action and fight scenes? Watch Atla. Looking for well written characters and interesting arcs? Watch Atla. Looking for interesting worldbuilding and lore that is explored throughout the whole show? Watch Atla. Looking for a diverse cast of characters that isn't all male? watch atla. Looking for a great score? atla. Looking for some escapism and comedy? Atla. Looking for a blind 12 year old girl beating everybody in her way up with ease and generally just being the coolest character? Atla.\nOk but seriously, I know I made it sound very serious but it's a lighthearted kid's show that just happens to handle all of it's contents so well that it manages to be a lighthearted kid's show while also talking about the terrors of war and all that. It's just really fun to watch and even if you don't like animation you should give it a try. I mean all mighty 12 year old pacifist monk and his ragtag group of kids who can control water, earth, fire and boomerang, travel the world and make all kind of meaningful connections while throwing said elements/boomerang at various bad guys just couldn't be a bad show.",

I've seen all of season one, and parts of season 2. I've been busy, but on Saturdays I catch up on what I missed, which started last week. For awhile, I had a fan fiction on the Nick website. Like I said, I've been busy, so I didn't have time to post anything and it got deleted. Oh well, I saved everything, so I could start it up again. But, anyway back to the series. People of all ages watch it. I met a girl who was 22 and she watches the show with her 7 year old....sister I think.....or was it daughter...maybe it was niece....anyway...so you see, this show is for all ages. I should know, I'm going to be 16 in a month. Great actors by-the-way.The show is basically about a boy on a quest to learn how to \"bend\" all four elements. Think of it as hydro-kinesics, for example, you know, moving water around with instead of your mind, you actually move it with your martial arts. If you watch carefully, \"waterbending\" is actually ti chi. The other three elements use three other kinds of martial arts.Anyway, this boy, named Aang (pronounced Ay-n-g), is an avatar. An avatar is a person who keeps peace between the four element nations, and can bend all four elements. Every time the avatar dies, he/she is reincarnated into the next nation. The pattern is fire, air, earth, and water. Aang was born to the air nomads. Aang finds out he is the avatar when he was 12 and ran away when he found out he was to be given a new mentor. Unfortunately, he disappears for 100 years when he is caught into a storm at the north pole and freezes himself in the water.Katara (kuh-tar-uh), who is 14, and her older brother Sokka (s-aw-kuh), who is 16, are on a fishing trip when they begin fighting. Katara is a water bender. Sokka is the worst warrior ever, but the only one left in the city (I explain that in a minute). While they are fighting, they come across an iceberg and stop for a break. Katara gets so upset that the berg begins to crack. Of course, when it opens, Aang is inside along with his flying bison, Appa (aw-puh).This is where the journey begins. The fire nation waged war against the other three nations soon after Aang disappeared. The war has lasted 100 years, but the only nation that has fallen is the air nation. The water nation is suffering, and the earth nation is still holding up its defenses. Aang is their only hope. Can he save the two remaining nations from the fire lord, Ozai (oh-z-eye) or will the world fall into flaming hands? Watch and you'll find out. Reruns for season one are played every night at five pm (on digital cable that is) or somewhere around there, depending on your time zone. For me, it's five o'clock. Season two reruns are on Saturdays at noon, (once again for my time zone). I hope this review helped.",

Also the action, well not enough in my opinion but when there is my god i love it the techniques and concepts are awesome i love it, not only are the concepts for bending so well done they incorporate real weapons and styles into there fights and unlike other cheesy shows where there moves are unreal or totally unorthodox,Airbender shows real moves real weapons and totally satisfies the picky martial artists... Also sometimes the plot is predictable but its just so bloody funny i could care less... Major Props to the writers animators and creator. I'm looking forward to many seasons.",

There's humor enough on many levels, so it's just as enjoyable for my eight-year-old daughter, as it is for my two teen-age boys, as it is for my husband and myself. Our hectic schedules don't allow us to catch every episode when they air, so we'll definitely be purchasing the DVD very soon. One of the things I like best about the show is its setting. It's enough like our own world to be familiar, and yet different enough to keep us surprised. The idea of bringing the elements into a form of martial arts is a nice twist. It will be interesting to see where Season Two takes the story. ~~Laura",

I watched every episode when it first came out and I loved it, actually I was obsessed with it. And very recently the blue ray version came out which I bought immediately, but I was worried, \"would this be as good as I remembered?\" And luckily the answer is yes. I enjoyed it more than when I first watched it. I was able to take in more of the beautiful artwork, the wonderfully designed and explained characters, and all of the phenomenal storytelling. There is so much character development that you almost feel like you know the characters (which is great until you finish the show because then you are a bit bummed). There was a quote by someone (I forgot whom it is from) that goes,\"you know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\" Well that's how it is for this show. I loved it then and I love it now. Whoever you are, I encourage you to watch this show, as it really is one of the best shows out there, for children, teens, and adults alike.",

In this Avatar world people are able to use a special form of fighting; some people can bend the elements, but the Avatar can bend all the elements. The world is now 100 years in war and for 100 years the Avatar has been missing. People are afraid that the Avatar never reincarnated to his next life because the airbenders are all gone. But soon it is Aang who appears to be the Avatar and only he can stop the on-going war which has taken many lives. But first he has to learn the other elements; water, earth and fire. He already is a good airbender.On the Avatar the Legend of Aang a lot of people worked on the script. But the story lines included in the episodes were always leading to something. Every character always had his own journey throughout the series and the writers developed those characters wonderful. Every episode is different but at the end ever storyline is leading to the same point. So \u2013 also the script was developed fantastic! With an animation TV show it is always much easier to cast somebody for a character than in Live Action. But Mako Iwamatsu and Dante Basco did such an fantastic job giving Iroh and Zuko a voice. Their voiced just suited so well with the character it is fantastic to listen to.I rate avatar 8/10. The Legend of Korra can never be better than The legend of Aang. It is important that people understand that. Korra was a good sequel but plot wise ATLA is much better. Also ATLA was the beginning and for that is always better than a sequel.",

The worldbuilding is original and amazing. The animation, art and music is gorgeous. The plot is a standard but extremely well implemented hero's journey, and you'll be deeply connected to the characters well before the end. There's no Japanese anime weirdness, no overused clich\u00e9s, an a nice mix of light humor and mature drama you wouldn't expect to see in a Nickelodeon cartoon of all things. And there's a truly amazing amount of detail in all of the show's content (As an example, the creators hired a real martial arts consultant to create/animate the different bending forms).No show is perfect, but the only real complaint I have is the quality of the release. Avatar was produced/released in 4:3 480p, the DVD was poorly mastered, and Nickelodeon still hasn't released the amazing soundtrack.Before you write this off as immature animation, do yourself a favor: get on Amazon Prime and watch it. Doesn't matter how old you are, bring your kids too. And don't give up after the first episode.Also, it's worth nothing that this was NOT originally intended to be a Nickelodeon cartoon, they just happened to be the network to pick it up.

Sokka was dorky, kinda stupid, a screwball, yet very cool, the kinda kid you'd want to hang with because he was so funny, even if it was an odd sense of humor. Aang was a fun, lovable, really bright kid, the most popular and talented kid we all wished to be like, but without the tremendous pressure to save the world.The story was mostly unique, and kept about as perfect a pace as one could ask for. The only issue I had with the pacing was in the third season, at the end they seemed to conveniently wrap up a few things, just so they could keep the number of episodes in the season comparable to the first two, but it was by no means unforgivable.The villains had huge depth of character, very well developed back stories and motivations, and each had their own agenda, which often did not coincide with other villain's agendas even though they were, in theory, on the same side. This provided for lots of conflict and realism as many times these agendas conflicted with each other. You don't find this kind of writing every day. Priceless.You find throughout the series that the people who are supposed to be the villains are really not that bad at all. Some were uppity and self important sure, maybe a little brainwashed by government propaganda, but aren't we all like that to some extent? Almost every episode had extras with great history, and the telling of each one added greatly to fleshing out the cultures involved.The issues the characters worked through during their journey presented some serious situations and topics, such as love, romance, loyalty, life and death, hate, self worth, and lots of morality issues. More than any other series I've seen, this one related to the human condition and the issues we face in life, all without being a heavy emo drama, which was very cool.***End spoilers*** In the end, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a great series with great characters and an epic story that will last a very long time. Avatar is worth watching again and again. You won't regret it.",

What if it is more than just that? \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" tells the story of a world divided in 4 nations according to the 4 elements of nature: Air, Fire, Earth and Water in which people can control those elements (hurl a fireball, create waves,...). The story starts in a time where the Avatar (a person who can control all 4 elements instead of just one) hasn't been seen in 100 years and the Fire Nation wages war on the entire world. At this time two teenage brother and sister find a boy in an iceberg who happens to be not just a \"regular boy\". \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is to me a great cartoon, and probably my favourite, and I have grown up seeing the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", \"Transformers\", \"Dragon Ball\",... It has childish bits of humour, (even though I find myself laughing at them), same objective (but I like that kind of thing) and suffers with Nickelodeon stupid schedules (seriously guys, I hated waiting for episodes and I've been waiting for only 3 months, not like other people who are by now desperate since January), but for a cartoon, it has plenty of character development, side-stories which actually make sense to the main storyline and if you like romances, it has a few too, it has a very well executed idea, the whole story of bending the elements, and a complex world with its war and past. Also it has a politics, cultural differences, warfare,... basically it can be a good lesson for older people as well. Conclusion: a great show with great animation and great fight scenes which not only is for kids but also for grown-ups because it has a very good background and a great story. Recommended!",

From its compelling characters to its intricately crafted plot, the show manages to captivate its viewers from start to finish.One of the greatest strengths of ATLA is its characters. Each of the show's main characters is given a distinct personality and backstory that makes them feel like real people. The main protagonist, Aang, is a young boy who is thrust into a role that he doesn't want but must accept if he wants to save the world. His journey of self-discovery and growth is both relatable and inspiring, making him a character that viewers can't help but root for. Additionally, his companions, Katara, Sokka, and Toph, are each given their own unique personalities and arcs that make them just as interesting to watch.Another strength of the show is its world-building. The world of Avatar is rich and detailed, with each nation having its own culture, customs, and history. The show does an excellent job of exploring these different nations and giving viewers a sense of their unique identities. Additionally, the show's use of bending, a form of elemental manipulation, adds a layer of depth to the world that is both fascinating and visually stunning.The show's plot is also masterfully crafted. It balances humor and drama in a way that feels organic and never forced. The overarching story of Aang's quest to defeat the Fire Nation and bring balance to the world is filled with twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Additionally, the show's use of themes such as friendship, redemption, and sacrifice add an emotional depth to the story that makes it resonate with viewers of all ages.In conclusion, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a must-watch show that is deserving of all the praise it has received. Its complex characters, rich world-building, and masterful storytelling make it a timeless classic that will continue to captivate audiences for years to come.",

            "review_title": "I'm sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece!",
            "content": "After much thought and consideration... I've decided to write a review for this show. Let me start by saying that I had my hopes so high for this show, since its rating is so high and all the reviews are in its favor and obviously I wanted to like it, to be moved, intrigued, mind-blown and overall entertained. And I got most of them... but overall this show felt pretty average to me. Usually before I choose a series to watch I normaly check the imdb all time 250 list of TV Shows in order to find one that seems interesting, has a pretty decent rating and the balance between its episodes ratings of over 9 and under 9 is decent too. Avatar: The Last Airbender seemed therefore decent enough for me to give it a shot. I'll try in this review to be as objective as I can and to mention both the good things it does and also the bad things.Starting with the good: The premise of the show of having people that can bend the 4 main elements of our world seemed pretty interesting. And the fact that one nation was in war with the other nations really caught my attention. The characters were ok and likeable overall... even though they were a bit cliched (more on that in the bad part) but what I loved about the characters in this show was their development, especially Zuko's and Iroh's (who was my favorite character by far) who were the only characters I truly liked a lot. The others were ok to say the least. The development of these two especially in seasons 2 and three were incredible and the episodes were so good that in someway for me saved this series from being just an ordinary \"Shaman King\"-like show for kids. Also, at times there were episodes so good that it reminded me of some of the best episodes from real TV shows like Prison Break, LOST, etc... And although season 1 and some episodes from season 2 were just like kids show, the rest of season 2 and season 3 were great and with tension and stakes, storytelling, character development and fitting ending. But the overall fun and excitement this show gave me over its three season course cannot be outweighted by the faults and flaws that in my opinion it had. It was overall a pretty good show that unfortunately didn't surprised me or shocked me through its development or twists in the story, but which had just enough to make it overall fun and worth watching.The bad stuff: Just like any TV Show or movie that takes place in an \"alternate Earth\" no matter its time period, just like Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones, etc... it lacks background. And what I mean by that is that it doesn't feel palpable or believable like a story that would take place on \"our Earth\". And that is through the fact that this show just like others introduces a new world that needs so much background to be believable. You would say \"why does it need?\". For me something that has a good foundation, good basic explanation for things that happen or exist in the show is overall good and believable. But something that is superficial and expects me to just don't care about that and defies my logic in order to like and accept that, doesn't really work for me. From the premise I had sooo many questions. Like why there are 4 nations? Why certain people could bend only a specific element and others other element? \"you may say that some powerful force (like in star wars)\" but that is just gibberish. Next, why were there an Avatar? Why only him could learn to control all elements? How did the Avatar reincarnation process happen? How , how and how? Why did the Fire Nation destroyed and conquered so many cities and tribes? And yes the last one is answered by stating that the Fire Nation only wanted to share technology with the other nations. But you do that through force and war, and killing inocent people? Really? Wasn't any other way to do that? Couldn't the writers find a better motivation for the fire nation's actions? It just seems safe writing because after all this was a kids show. Next... story and episodes: The story was overall good except the filler episodes. And those were like 50% of the show. And although there were good episodes and chracter development throughout the show for SOME chracters, others stayed the same. Aang remained just as childish as in the beginning. Soka was throughout the whole show just the third character with funny jokes and overall very cliched. And Katara was the cliche girl-who was in love with the main guy but didn't wanted to tell him that-type. Speaking of the development, Aang's learning of mastering the four elements is not shown throughtout the show to be growing and becoming better. It is shown only in 3 episodes separately for each of the other elements he didn't master and ocasionaly here and there some training in the filler episodes. But you don't get a sense that this guy is learning, is acumulating knowledge in how to control these four elements (or 3, since he was an airbender master). The only time it was brought out was in the last four episodes when he needed to face Ozai. But otherwise no development of his powers during the shows run. Even the opening theme (and this is laughably bad) kept the thing about him needing to learn more before he could save the world until the last episode. I mean wasn't he at least somewhat ready then? How else could he defeat Ozai? It is beyond my mind how no one seems to notice this and just keep praising this show and saying \"oh, this show is the best ever!\", when it has soo many problems. Next, the finale is pretty weak (I mean only the 4th part) but I wrote a review for that, you can check that out. I spoke there also about the villain. There were also episodes that were extremly overrated like \"The Crossroads of Destiny\" in which Aang - ***SPOILERS FROM HERE - was in danger of dying by Azula's lightning. That is never explained why he was vulnerable to her lightning although he was in the Avatar State and as it was shown earlier in season 1 finale he was pretty much invincible in that mode, or how did the lightning affected him, at least to try and make some decent sense. I know, it was only a shock tool to make you think he was going to die. But if you would have thought it through you would have realised (and not be shocked then) that he couldn't have died. Since he was the one the show said it was going to save the world. Therefore that shot left me cold, knowing that it had no value at all just shock, since he was going to survive and bring order in the world by the end of the show. Next, and that is probably just as much as disappointing and frustrating is that Zuko betrayed Aang when all the season his character was being build as one who was starting to doubt the side on which he was and go join Aang's side. That build-up was blown into pieces by an unexplicably turnaround by the season 2 finale where he sides with Azula inexplicably. That was just like Star Wars: The Last Jedi. You build a chracter towards a decision and then you make him take the oposite decision. That right there took all my chatarsis away. I didn't feel like my emotions that were being build for the finale could be released and therefore the ending being worth it. - SPOILERS END HERE***I could really go on and on, and talk about other stuff that disappointed me about this show, because my expectations were extremly high. Now I've learned a lesson, never have your hopes and expectations too high for anything. They might disappoint you just like this show disappointed me. In conclusion I would say that this show overall deserves an eight from me since it was very entertaining but at the same time flawed and with some problems that for me just can't make it a masterpiece like everyone is raging about.",

Producers and Nickelodeon have done a great job of producing an animation that portrays a parallel world that, while being fictional, fanciful and distant from our reality, has a lot to do with spiritual learning, Eastern philosophy, morality, ethics, and values that span centuries and generations. Even though that does not mean that the show has a focus limited to it. As the program is made for children, these subjects that at first seems to be shown in a \"too serious\" way, as a matter of fact they are accompanied by diverse fictional elements like the mastering of the four elements, very funny moments and dialogues and a little bit of the ideal doses of innocence and naivety, as expected for the targeted age group public. Actually it may be a positive, because besides the structure to please all kinds of public it also has some deeper issues behind it, all worthy of analysis and that leads you to reflection.It's an interesting mix that certainly changed the life and taught something to all those who watched and got involved with each story in every episode.",

They had deep, enriched, and wonderful plots that always hooked the viewer throughout the 22 minute episode and can really entertain anyone who is a fan. Rewatching this show multiple times never gets old and always entertain you and leaves you thinking about the characters. I would love watching Season 2 and Season 3. My personal favorite was Season 2 finale \"The Crossroads of Destiny\". But, I love every single bit of this wonderful show.",

So I'm reviewing it here so that I'll remember. It really is.This show has my favourite world-building of all time, and I'm a sucker for that stuff. The lore never ceases to surprise and intrigue with its beauty and depth. The animation is completely out of this world, and shows fantastic imagination and care; I can only hope that the upcoming Netflix series will live up to it, but I really don't know how it could. The character design is faultless and incredibly gratifying as the seasons progress; arcs feel real and understandable. One of the excellent things about this show is that it never forgets that the main characters are children, and it's much better for that - these aren't superheroes, they are kids whose lives have been cruelly altered by war, and their journeys are never over-simplified.ATLA has one of the most satisfying and well-paced storylines I could ever hope to experience. I take long gaps between rewatching because it allows me to experience the whole wonderful journey all over again, and it gets me every time. There are specific parts which still make me emotional just thinking about them; catch me crying listening to the (fantastic) score.Legend of Korra was a joy, but for me nothing will ever quite live up to the magic of this show. I feel lucky to be alive in the time when it was made.",

Also, I had dismissed Nickelodeon as children's fare. Better than Cartoon Network (anything is), but for kids nonetheless. Then less than a year ago I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was turning it into a film. Since good TV-to-film adaptations are rare, I decided to rent the series. Now, I sincerely hope that M. Night knows what he's doing. This show is amazing! All of the characters are well acted and believable, the mythology in the show is actually thought out, and it's a serial show. That means that the episodes actually have consequences on each other. This isn't \"Rewind TV\". The relationships of the characters are developed to perfection throughout the series: Zuko and his Uncle, Katara and Sokka, Katara and Aang; I have never rooted for two characters to be a couple like this since Jim and Pam in \"The Office\". This is the kind of love story that George Lucas wishes he had pulled off with Anakin and Padme, minus the whole Evil/Dark Side/Padme Dying/Darth Vader thing. And the finale: words cannot describe its perfection, except perfection. This show is highly recommended. Something the whole family will enjoy, literally.",

I've seen all three seasons, and am looking forward to seeing the movie, and I'm HOPING for a season four! This has such an amazing plot line! Aang and his friends have to save the world from some evil guy. Clich\u00e9 right? but it's more than that! everything is planned out and well thought and so, particular! I like how Aang's already mastered air, but he still has to learn all the other elements, and he learns one in each season. I remember when the commercials came on I was like. \"Oh God, another terrible Nick cartoon. Wonder how badly this one will flop.\" . . .yeah, I was hooked after two minutes, and a Kataanger (Aang and Katara Relationships supporter) before I knew Kataang was even an option.Sokka totally blows my right mind. He's the sexist, prejudiced, sarcastic, skeptic comedy relief character. His expressions and body language crack me up every time. I know almost all of his lines in all three seasons.Aang is a cutie. His fun-loving attitude and his crush on Katara is just a winner character. I know a lot of his lines too. I like season three Aang the most, because he's all flirty and fun and a lot like a teenager. I like how he just wants to be a kid but he can't be because of responsibilities and the weight of the world on his shoulders. And I like how he has a breakdown from time to time like normal people should. And he looks really hot bending all four elements at once.Katara. . .i want to be her. She's got gorgeous blue eyes, she's pretty, she's a waterbender, and she's got a sweet guy like Aang crushing on her. Her character development was amazing! She's got a sweet but tough side to her, and that makes her look super amazing when she's waterbending, because she can be beautiful when she waterbends, or she can look bad-ass. Like when she was about to kill the guy that killed her mom in Southern Raiders! AGH! she looked hard core.Toph is probably my favorite character. Her characteristics and her story are well thought out. Over-protective parents who keep her locked up, she runs away and says they let her go. Her spunky, sarcastic, blunt. . .very dry and funny humor gets me every time. And let's not forget she can bend metal?! how cool is that?! A twelve year old earthbending prodigy, and all because she's blind! wow! the story just has an amazing story line and amazing animation. 'Nuff said. . .i think.",

It's not only about bending and saving the world, the characters have stories, and you can connect and relate to them, there not just people there to play out a story. Please, go on YouTube or Kissanime and give this series a try! This is a true masterpiece I just wish I could have matured sooner.

It's not just for children though it's so good my dad even appreciated it and he's not a cartoon man. I can't recommend this show enough it's my all time favorite.

Overall, I really enjoyed revisiting, as well as finally finishing it. The animation is fluid and hands- down the best of the Japanese-influenced American shows broadcast in the country, the narrative is wonderfully paced and interesting, and the characters are memorable and engaging from square one. Props to Dante Basco and Mako especially for their portrayals of two of my new favorite characters of all time. I really dig that this was appreciated on release and has the massive following it does, as well as a good sequel series from what I hear. If you haven't seen it yet, this is a high recommendation from me to stop and immediately rent/buy this. You'll not be disappointed.Now I must post a few of my gripes with the show, -SPOILERS AHEAD- Now, overall, this show handles wonderfully when it comes to dealing life lessons and morality to young children, which was its primary audience. However, I sensed, especially in Books 2 and 3, a desperate struggle amongst the writers to avoid the mortality issue when it came to ANY character in the show, as well as most of the darker elements in the show, (see Bloodbending). In order to be lasting, and relatable, I felt it would be wise to address the fact that in shows dealing with these titanic struggles, there are losses on both sides, the Book 1 finale worked this in fine. When it came to Lake Laogai, they chickened out at outright telling the audience that a character was dying, and I believe subtlety was the best option they had and it mostly worked. However, Sozin's Comet gave the impression that the writers struggled to come up with a deus ex machina that they could write off as a fantastic element of the world. IT DID NOT RUIN THE FINALE, that's not what I have to say at all. I simply regret that fact that the writers seemed to think: \"D'oh we can't kill the Fire Lord! We can't defend/promote that!\" The deus did work, but it was a shot in the dark that just happened to work in context. Oh well, oh hell. When it comes to bloodbending, I simply wish they had gone all out and used it more to its darker advantages, ie REALLY DARK USAGES (see heart-stopping, SCANNERS!). Also, WHY THE HELL DIDN'T KATARA USE IT ON AZULA?!? I'm a messed up, grit-loving pop-culture buff; sue me for trying to make your children's show more interesting.",

Season 2 and 3 especially the latter were incredible (except the voice acting) but they are held back by the first season's nothing. Like nothing happens for like the first ten episodes! The plot just couldn't catch my attention with its predictability and lack of purpose and direction. It gives us a clear goal, but we take thirty detours that end up having no effect on our current goal. A positive that I really enjoyed is that after the first ten or so episodes, we focus on almost everybody but Aang. I really like it. It also focuses on a few mature themes even if they have to be more clear cut to keep its appeal to children. Also the ending to each season were some of the best I've seen of a kids show ever. There was just a slow beginning, average voice acting, some inconsistencies in the plot, and predictable plot. Overall season one was 7/10.\nSeason two was 8/10\nSeason three was 9/10",

This show will knows how to make something for all ages without just shoving in adult references every minute like a lot of media at the time. I am so glad that I watched this show on Netflix where I can binge it and not have to catch the episodes when they're on, watching these episodes in order is an experience I can't describe. Please watch this show if you haven't already and if you grew up on this show and missed some episodes and had trouble following the story, binge it now.

            "content": "1. It is competently made but all the concepts are derived from Japanese anime - so the reviewers saying its the best art ever made are wrong. Its the best thing they have seen. I refer them to Naruto (and especially Naruto Shipuden), which will truly blow their minds. After you have watched a few Japanese anime shows you can see that Avatar is just OK not the best thing since sliced bread. Its not new.2. Regardless of the above comment I would like to rate Avatar 8/10 but I can only give 6/10 because the storyline (main plot) is a mess, some of the stories are just boring & contrived, and there is too much middle-class American teenager TV culture (which ruins the fantasy). E.g. episode The Beach. In many episodes you just know that the characters are going to do exactly the thing they know is going to get them into trouble. At one time there is a scary time limit to the 'end of the world' but at other times it is totally forgotten and lots of clowning around wasting time without a care in the world is happening. In addition, they really milk the tropes too far. E.g. Zuko is so foul, traitorous, and angry all the time compared to his poor treatment as a child, that trying to make him out as having an internal struggle is just a joke. Sokka is always sceptical of everything supernatural no matter that everyone uses superpowers to bend the elements or that they have met numerous spirits and hang around with a guy that can contact the spirit world. Gets bit annoying after 10 episodes. Etc.3. Finally, the avatar learns how to fight using all sorts of bending but hardly ever uses anything but air bending, even in fights. He mastered fire bending but he won't use it to even light a cooking fire or a torch. And of course there are strange things like metal bending being a subset of earth bending, but it is used by the fire nation to build all of their machines because they are safe from earth benders. Everyone (earth & fire benders) uses metal cells to hold earth benders. The fire nation uses a huge fleet to attack everyone but some how the water benders never thought about sinking the ships by just filling them with water. The water benders can also bend ice. Apparently no-one has heard of unsinkable ships being sunk by icebergs either (Titanic anyone?). The air benders can only apparently fly with the help of kite wings. They can't create jets of air to help them fly. Earth benders can disappear into the ground and move about but they never use this ability to sneak around. Etc, etc, etc. These holes are endless.Its a good show but the 10/10 reviews are just stupid (as usual).",

This show's got the right amount of humor, action, mystery, and twists. Thank God that it's not like Prison Break or something where there's just too many twists to make the story even realistic. I somehow even got my entire family to start following the series, and usually they think cartoons are too childish.

I grew up with anime shows like Pokemon, Digimon and Dragonball Z, but anime or not, Avatar is by far my favourite show to watch, and Nick has really outdone itself. The title character is an airbender named Aang, and he is unwillingly the Avatar, master of all four elements, fire, water, earth, and air. The main theme of the show is Imperialism v.s. Nationalism, in the sense that the Fire Nation wants to take over the world, and the other nations are holding their ground. The Avatar's role is to maintain peace between the four nations, but in the case of Aang, he arrives a little too late to do anything about the war. This is why I believe that Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best shows that Nick has to offer, along with Spongebob, Danny Phantom and Fairly Oddparents.",

I'm not just gaga over how beautifully they're drawn this show has top notch voice actors some awesome action and a sweet story. Avatar has it all.

OK the draw-ed style is semi anime. Which is a big trend in cartoon drawers now, and should not be. We should get back to the details, the mood. However Avatar makes up for that with a dazzling character cast. Some with an underlying depth that will surface as you watch the series. Sokka is the shows comedy character, and yet he comes through when things get rough, however the character I mean the most is Prince Zuko. The banished sun of the Evil Fire Lord. On an forever going hunt for the last avatar, to capture him and re-win his fathers respect. Prince Zuko is the regular villain of the show, but he alone should be enough reason to watch through the series. Not because he is cool or badass (which he is), but because he is the character that shows the most of his personal sides through the series.

THere are so many characters in this series with their own back story that it gives the writers the option to bring them back easily. There isn't a plot by plot next mission to the next mission etc theme in this show. But small plots within a larger one that makes everything flow perfectly. Whats also so great is that its a battle of perspectives not good and evil, you have Ang who yes is good but hes just trying to stop the fire nation. Meanwhile you have a conflicted Zuko who you could say is evil but is just a victim of circumstance living in the fire nation and he must deal with his many conflicts throughout this story. Sakka is one of my favorite characters. Without him the show dies if you ask me. The fighting is fantastic and the humor is placed in the most perfect spots. This show keeps it lighthearted but serious at the same time. This is what storytelling is all about. If you watched nick back in the mid 80's they had several shows like this on their station but got away from that in the 90's. Now that this show is here we may see a trend in shows like this which is a good thing for a change.",

            "review_title": "An all around incredible show",
            "content": "Doing away with the blocky 2-D characters and stand alone episode stories, Avatar, The Last Airbender is a welcome change in American cartoons. First off, no one will disagree that the show looks absolutely beautiful and the world in which it takes place is one of the most creative settings I've ever seen. The character designs are dynamic and iconic, and each character is instantly recognizable to the viewer even when they change outfits or hairstyles (which does happen a number of times, either for practical purposes such as disguise or comedic purposes, or occasionally to simply show the passage of time, as happens with the character Zuko). In addition, the landscapes are always stunning, and each environment is unique. The world that this show creates is both zany and realistic, with elements that are familiar in some places and other elements that seem completely alien. The politics that occur between the nations of the world are believable and tense, although simplified slightly for a younger audience. This brings us to the next thing that amazed me about the show: its story. The story is complex but understandable, serious but generally not outright bleak, and mature but not without its own youthful sense of fantasy. The show treats the viewer with respect for their intelligence and offers drama, action, comedy, and even romance all in the guise of a show for children ages six to eleven (which, by the way, is younger than any of the show's main characters). \"Official\" target age group notwithstanding, even adults will find something to enjoy about this show, because the creators inject something for everyone. For younger viewers, there is goofy comedy and lovable characters, and for older viewers there is sometimes more mature humor or darker dramatic elements that will go right over the head of the show's younger audience. There is plenty of kung-fu action for male viewers, and there is also a healthy dose of material that will please female viewers. There is even underlying social commentary for those so inclined, and many episodes carry some kind of hidden moral weight to please uptight parents. Of course, the show goes out of its way not to assign gender roles; on the boy's side, rambunctious and flippant Sokka is contrasted with Aang, who is softer and more kind hearted, while on the girl's side, motherly Katara is contrasted with Toph, a total meat-head. This is another of the show's many strong points: every character is the best character. Each one has their own perks and flaws, some obvious, some hidden. Even the pets become fully developed characters with story arcs and unique personalities. While most stories tend to turn their antagonists into monsters, Avatar turns its primary antagonist, Prince Zuko, into a fully sympathetic character, on whom just as much of the story is focused as is on the protagonists. The viewer is often apt to find themselves rooting for Zuko and almost hoping that he can capture Aang and restore his honor. This is another thing about the characters: there are almost no characters who act the way they act without a purpose, and each purpose is explored and explained. Even when the purpose doesn't quite seem to fit (as is the case with General Iro, who lost his son in battle and failed to conquer his target, subsequently becoming an affable and relaxed old man, rather than a bitter soul as one would expect) the result always seems to fit in the context of the character. Even the show's later villains, who are much more monstrous than Zuko, have their own reasons for acting how they do; Mai is cold and pessimistic because she grew up in a household where she was never allowed the opportunity to express herself; Tai Li is bouncy and constantly happy-go-lucky because in her youth she had to compete to distinguish herself from her many identical siblings; Azula is sadistic and over-the-top evil because, well, she was just born that way, and everyone knows that and recognizes it, even herself. Of course, not all the characters are this way. The show's Big Bad, Fire Lord Ozai, has no real reason for being as evil as he is, but this is largely a nit-pick because nearly all of the show's other characters are so well developed. Speaking of which, I dare you to find a more lovably evil villain than Azula. Her best friends are terrified of her, her own mother called her a monster when she was a child (which she took as a compliment), she constantly terrorizes and dominates her older brother, Zuko, and the only time that we see her make any attempt at romance, she says, \"I like you, you like me, why, together we will become THE MOST POWERFUL COUPLE IN THE WORLD! (evil laughs)\" much to the terror and surprise of her could-be boyfriend. The characters are indeed my favorite aspect of the show, and picking favorites would only make my grave deeper, but what really makes them work is the story in which they are set. Almost as interesting as the ways in which the various characters interact with each other are the ways in which they interact with the world around them and how they deal with the events that come their way. Just as impressive is the masterful way that the show's creators have worked the characters and the story to make even the most pragmatic of viewers (such as myself) begin to genuinely care what happens next. Everyone can find some bit of themselves to pour into each of the characters and some grounds on which to identify with them, and everyone can find some aspect of their lives represented somehow in the story, bringing the show's fantastical and imaginative world a bit closer to home.",

It is amazing to me that after all this time, there has been one good show on Nickelodeon. Many people would classify Avatar under anime, but it isn't anime.

I mean bending elements... and also it has a lots of funny moments which I've laughed for minutes when I was watching it. and also it has a so cool name.. Avatar.. The last..... you know the rest. And one of the reasons I liked this animation is that there's no any racist thing or any insulting for any religion. and also it is safe to watch for kids because there's no any sexual scenes.. only a few moments which are not so dangerous. and musics are cool. and also there's one thing I want to say. \u0130t is really the best thing about this animation. When the Aang connects with the other avatars I mean when he goes into avatar mode , you're feeling the enormous power he has... and your body is thoroughly electrified from top to the bottom... It's like your body secretes hormones. I'm talking seriously. Watch avatar and sometimes when aang gets angry and goes into avatar mode you'll feel that enormous power in your veins. Literally. and also Katara is so beautiful ;) and also it makes you imagine what if I've that power... It's the best. But it finished only with 3 seasons... :'( that was so sad. Really. I mean I think they should have kept it up. The legend of korra is not as good as The last air bender... not even close. I mean anyway. This animation is Definitely something you have to watch before you die. Especially about hormones.. you'll feel it in your veins.",

            "review_title": "In a word, perfection.",
            "content": "When I saw that Netflix added this, I shared no time to binge watch the entire series.Like many, I watched Avatar when it came out on TV. I always loved the show and would even beg to go watch it with my neighbor who had the box set of all the seasons. This show has always been an integral part of my childhood so like many things it has always made me feel nostalgic. So when I began rewatching it, I feared it would be like most nostalgic things you revisit, a letdown. So often we overblow our memories on something, like a TV show. But as I started watching, I realized how dead wrong I was.So I guess a quick plot setup would help for those who haven't seen it yet. Basically Avatar is set in a world where there are people who can control one of four elements: Water, earth, fire or air. Each element also corresponds to a nation (although not everyone in each nation can bend the element). However, 100 years before the shows timeline, the Fire nation sets out to take over the world and only the avatar (the one who can control all the elements) can stop them. The main character Aang is the avatar and was frozen in ice for 100 years before being found by Sokka and Katara. The show centers around those three and their quest to help Aang learn all the elements and defeat the fire nation.Okay. So this would be an excellent plot for a more adult show or movie yet they choose it for a kids show. This means that the show has quite a serious underlying plot that I believe anyone at any age would enjoy. That said, it is a kids show so there is a lot of somewhat childish humor but not so much that it dumbs down the show. In fact, there is plenty of scenes that made me laugh and overall it's a very enjoyable premise.So, let's get to what makes this show perfect. I see many reasons as to why this show is quite possibly the best one ever made. First off is the uniqueness of the show. It has a very engaging premise and one that really draws you in. Second is the design. The show is very beautiful and looks amazing. Third is the characters. The characters really make this show what it is and are truly amazing. Finally I'll talk about the underlying themes that make this show so much more than action scenes and humor for kids.The idea of bending elements is incredibly cool and I think most adults as well as children find that world to be one that is perfect to get lost in while watching this show. The idea of bending allows for so many cool twists to the show and always makes it interesting. The bending aspect is also an ever evolving one with subcategories coming up quite often like metal bending or blood bending. This allows the show to always stay fresh, even over it's fairly short runtime. Let's talk about runtime for a second. In a day with shows over 10 seasons and hundreds of episodes, it's quite refreshing to have a show that can be watched in 3 days. However, the short nature of it may seen to mean they have less time for storytelling. Perhaps this is true, but what Nickelodeon did in 3 seasons is remarkable. There was not a single episode or point on the show where you feel like the writers were struggling to make good content or where the show got bland. Having 3 seasons forces you to make a very sense and high quality story, something Avatar does perfectly. The whole show flows very well and is akin to very little else in that manner. How many shows do you know that don't run too long and run out of energy at the end? Going back to the unique premise, every episode adds some kind of bending type, or animal or new character. It's truly amazing to rewatch it and lose none of this thrill of the show. The writers also did a great job of really allowing you to feel like you understand the world and those in it. The premise and flow of this show are perfect.So this show is an anime. But it was made in America. This means you definitely get the best of both worlds. You get the beautiful Japanese art style with the landscape and characters. Although the show is starting to show it's age, it's still beautiful to look at. It has vibrant colors and at times changes the art style to spice things up. The facial expressions are sometimes over the top but overall, it's executed perfectly. Often times with anime the fight scenes are wayyy over the top, and yes the fight scenes here are dramatic but I think the shows strikes the perfect balance between too bland and too over the top. In fact, the fight scenes are really well done. The incorporation of the 4 elements is always a pleasure to see and never gets old. I guess art style is subjective, but in my humble opinion, I think the show is quite beautiful and even gets better over time.Now onto what makes this show perfect: the characters. Often in kids shows, the characters are pretty static and are just there for a good laugh. Take SpongeBob for example. All the characters there are the same and never grow. However, because avatar has a storyline (which is so rare in kids shows and is probably what allows this show to be perfect) the characters basically have to develop. Talking about ever character would take forever so let's just take one: Zuko. Zuko starts the show as basically the main enemy. He is deadset on capturing the avatar and is quite narrow-minded. His uncle iroh really cares about him and wants him to change but has trouble getting him to change. However, the show does a character arc that takes most of the series and is executed perfectly. Over time, Zuko begins to realize how futile his search is. He starts to realize that his father isn't worth it to fight for honor from. So as the series goes on, Iroh convinces Zuko that he needs to shape his own path. Over time, Zuko learns that his path is to help Aang and stop the fire nation. However, the writers of the show also wrote in specific episodes to show how Zuko develops and how he begins to realize that the fire nation is evil. The character arc with Zuko is amazing, incredible and worthy of infinite praise. He does a full 180 and it all makes sense and is written perfectly. This is just one character, almost all of the characters have some kind of arc and none of them are poorly written, bar one. This is my only problem with the show, and it's not particularly big. The big baddie that Aang has to fight at the end is Ozai, the fire Lord. Generally a good villan must be sympathetic or have a sad past or have a valid point in their struggles. The joker is a great example of a perfect villian. However, Ozai is bad because bad. He has no redeeming qualities and is just the big blob of evil. His intentions are purely for control of the world which is quite honestly not a bad MO for a villian, but his character is so superficial. But even then, Ozai's grandfather wanted to spread the prosperity of the fire nation with the world, hence why he started the war. But Ozai lost that original sentiment and is just out to rule the world. But overall, not bad for a kids show. Even the small characters almost all have two occurances in the show. The last season and the last few episodes tie in the almost all the characters in an Avengers Endgame type way. The characters are great and over the course of 3 seasons, you really feel connected to then and close to them. It's really amazing.Now to wrap up I'd like to touch on some nuanced themes that run throughout. One I see as very interesting is the clear ties it has to Communism. Okay Communism in a kids show? Nw way right? Hear me out. I think Ba Sing Se is a great example of this. First of all the whole city is surrounded by two walls, keeping the people in and enemies out. The government is clearly totalitarian but the king is just a puppet. The city is really controlled by an underground agency that keeps the \"peace\" at Bay. They use propaganda, censorship and brainwashing to push their agendas. Sound familiar. I would argue that Ba Sing Se is a perfect example of Communism and what it can lead to. However, the show takes a more brave new world approach insofar as the people are unaware that they are basically prisoners of the government and quite frankly, they don't care. It is a very subtle dystopian state. Now, this is all deep stuff, but it's really deep considering this is a kids show. This is just one example of many different messages and ideas that the show puts forward. It's crazy to think that a kids show as so many mature and complete ideas, yet it does and it makes the show amazing.So, Avatar. After almost 10 years, revisiting it has been a pleasure, to say the least. The show is literally better than I remembered and never failed it amaze me. I'm so glad that this show exists and it will always be close to my heart. So give it a watch, I guarantee that no matter how old you are, you won't be disappointed.",

The artwork and animation are very well done and the show seems to have the right mix of comedy, action, violence, Asian culture,and mysticism. These elements, combined with well-developed characters and a decent storyline/plot make the show appeal to a wide range of age groups. It also seems that the show has blended the best of anime with American style animation -- think of the best elements of Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, and The Hakkenden (an anime show/movie from the early 90's)with touches of Disney-style animation elements. I also like the show for what is not in it -- namely the \"trading card\" duels that seem to plague many anime shows today. It also features voice actors like Mako who seem to enhance the quality of the show even further.My only fear concerning the future of the show is that they reduce the production budget or start cutting corners in the third season -- right now it is a high-quality show that I would recommend is worth a look from people of all ages.",

We would watch new episodes when we were all together on Fridays and stuff like that, and joke around in the pool about how we could water-bend. But this show provides deep characters with backgrounds, faults, and dreams, a rarity in Nick shows. It sorta reminds me of old school Nick. And trust me, i am not a big fan of anime, but I hardly notice it with this show. i find myself so drawn into the characters and the plots, wishing and hoping for the characters to succeed as I do in a show like Grey's Anatomy. And this show teaches so much in terms of life lessons, that one race isn't better than the other, that even the smallest person can make a difference. And personally Prince Zuko is hot.

This show had great animations and an excellent story line. When Azula fought Zuko in the Agni Kai was stunning; the blue and red flames colliding. The negative reviews are saying \"oh it's a rip off of anime\", however I watch anime and the designs are the same but I feel like it is completely different from anime in its own good way. Saying that it is not creative is naive because most ideas nowadays are just recycled anyways; it is very difficult to come up with an original idea. I know it seemed clich\u00e9 and recycled (Aang being the chosen one) but the writers still did a very good job with the show. It maybe partially overrated but my main reason for that is because this show is initially for the younger generation! Children shows are meant to teach children morals in life. Come on people it even debuted on \"NICKELODEON\" which is obviously not a hard core anime network so stop comparing it to anime.",

            "content": "Yes, it's all true - great story (for the most part), developed characters, lots of fun - it's all there, and it's highly addictive. Got me hooked right from the start. But it could've been so much more... Here the creators had a completely new world, to mold as they please, and all they did was to fill it with all the outdated oriental mysticism they could find. No imagination whatsoever, just borrowing every existing mambo-jumbo from the ancient Chinese, Japanese, and Hindu traditions. The same goes to the animals, cultures, architecture, clothing - just a random jumble of existing things, no novelty. Even the characters seem borrowed. For instance, Toph is just another version of He-Man (as crazy as it might seem), and Azula is clearly based on Mandy, even if you forget that they share the same voice. Another complaint is animation quality. Although it's certainly superb by Nick's usual standards, it comes up short when compared to modern animation series, and that includes the latest anime as well. In a series which relies so heavily on action scenes, I think they could've done a better job. And even though I'm generally a fan of anime, those silly facial gimmicks like large sweat drops and \"angry lines\" are my least favorite part, and I'd like to see it as little as possible. Avatar uses these gimmicks all too often, especially for a fake anime. As for the storyline, one of my problems is predictability. For example, I had no problem guessing the true identity of the Blue Spirit or the Painted Lady right from the start, or predicting that Ty Lee will betray Azula, and so on. And I'm generally very bad at things like that.Now for the good parts. Although the creators borrowed everything from oriental traditions, at least they enlisted some real experts on the subject. Kudos on that. Too bad they didn't add an astronomer to the bunch - some episodes cry for an expert in that field, especially the one with the solar eclipse. I also enjoyed seeing so many familiar names in the cast - apparently whatever money they saved on animation they used to hire some excellent actors. The second season was a bit too sad for my liking (though I loved the addition of Toph to the group), and I don't think that the plot justified all that tragedy, but the third season compensated for it with excellent, sophisticated, and funny (and not in a usual shallow way) episodes. As the ending approached, I was increasingly afraid that they might ruin the ending like they did for \"Basquash\", or, worse yet, end it with a cliffhanger like \"Angel\" or \"Mortal Kombat\", or even leave it unfinished like \"Invader Zim\". Fortunately, none of that had happened, and the ending was proper and (almost) decisive, albeit predictable and kind of flat, but tolerably so. I also felt that too many story lines were left hanging. I would've liked to see Toph's parents coming to their senses, Zuko returning his stolen ostrich-horse with apology, Azula in an asbestos mental institution, and a few other things. Normally, so many deficiencies wouldn't merit 8 out of 10, but I was so hooked to this series from the first episode to the last and then all over again, that I guess it deserves a fat bonus.",

Some people believe that this show did not have to have the jokes and funny comments but the show would have been boring without them.

This means I will solely judge the show on its own, with all the positive (no bias) and negative (no comparative values) implications thereof. With that out of the way, let me say that \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is an extraordinary piece of art. The animation, already decent from the get-go, seems to just get better and better as the story progresses. The characters are universally well-developed and likable (with Toph and Sokka being my personal favorites), the plot flows smoothly, and the combination of action and humor is splendid.Of course, there are also downsides. Not everyone will like the fact that Avatar is probably the biggest Ship Tease in existence; and some of the characters play the immaturity card a bit too often for my liking.All in all, however, Avatar's critical accolades are so jubilant for a reason: It's just that good. I'd recommend it for viewers of all ages (for the record, I'm in my early twenties) and many different genre preferences (Avatar has epic battles for action aficionados, hilarious humor for comedy fans, and several official {and plenty of plausible unofficial} pairings for the romantics.)Bottom Line: After carefully factoring in plot (8/10), voice acting (10/10), animation (9/10) and humor (10/10), I'll just ignore all those calculations and simply slap a big, fat 10/10 on the show for its sheer entertainment value.",

The animation, the story, the characters and the art of bending the elements - the avatarverse made wonders with my imagination. Today, in my mid-twenties, I can look back and understand why this series had such an impact on me. First of all, it's a war story that focuses more on it's consequences rather than on it's motives (which is rare), most of the cultural references are asian and the characters are amazingly diverse. This show really thinks out of the box and came at a time where diversity and inclusiveness weren't even that common on television, and still today Avatar is waaaay ahead than other contents in this department. During the three seasons we're taken on ride through amazing character arcs, complex politics, the weight of power, the importance of friendship and the toll responsibility and duty can have on someone. Some say it's a kid's show, I say it's a lesson on how to be human, kind and brave. It really doesn't disappoint, the storytelling is consistent, it isn't rushed and it doesn't leave you feeling cheated, it has a satisfying ending that manages not only to be true to the characters journeys but to also be unique, epic and bring closure to their arcs. If you go on this journey bare in mind that it has a bit of a slow start, but I assure you, by the time \"The Storm\" (ep 12) hits you'll be hooked! I loved growing up with Avatar in my childhood, and to be able to fully understand it's uniqueness and cleverness after all this years just made me appreciate this show even more. Really hope a lot of people get see this masterpiece of animation, it's worth it. ;)Ps: And remember: \"there's no war in Ba Sing Se\"",

            "content": "The premise for Avatar is a great one, the universe is brilliant, the animation is very good, but that's all. It seems like the creators don't quite know how to handle all the power they've given to the characters. Fighting techniques and technology in action sequences are pretty boring. You can summon fire but you're still using knifes and medieval war machines? Serious lack of imagination there. This sort of top-of-the-head mundane approach to what could otherwise be an epic and innovative narrative, pretty much pervades the whole series on all levels and leaves it unfulfilled. The storytelling is rushed and primitive with no space for nuance and no respect for rhythm. This robs both the characters' depth and the worlds' seductiveness. Dialogues have no pauses, landscapes have no protagonism. This in my view is the biggest flaw of avatar and the one reason why it has no soul. The esoteric side of element bending and Shintoism was another great fountain of inspiration not allowed to gush forth. In the end Avatar is all action, and not very inventive at it either. But don't let me discourage you from watching it. It's still an entertaining an fun show as long as you can bear all its critical flaws and aren't frustrated for its infantile shallowness.",

While incredibly fictional, it is also includes aspects that ring non-fiction. The Avatar world will go down as one of the most creatively constructed fantasy universes in history, alongside the greats like GOT, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Secondly, the story tackles real life issues and historical catastrophes, like war, exile, genocide, as well as mondaine issues such as love and friendship. The sheer amount of life lessons and philosophies packed into both Avatar the Last Airbender and Legend of Korra is incredible, drawing heavy inspiration from Buddhism and Hinduism alike. Finally, the show despite being catered towards children becomes more enjoyable as you watch it when you're older. Indeed, having watched it as a child, I loved the show and the fantasy aspect, but rewatching over and over again as I've aged, I've come to appreciate the storyline, the craftsmanship and the life lessons, and I haven't gone a few episodes without crying each time. The series knows exactly how to grab hold of your emotions. It is truly a masterpiece!",

It has action, romance, humor and hidden political intrigue. This show is very promising and I hope it will go on for some time. One things for sure you wont see anything this good on Cartoon Network till like 4:00AM in the morning. Those who hate this show don't know what they are missing out on, the characters and story lines are much better then most shows at the same time it is on. Perhaps it is not as dark as it could be but you cant go too dark in todays TV regulations.the storyline at first is real basic, mainly focusing on Zuko and his quest to find the avatar. however the series had a lot of well placed breaks in the \"Zuko vs Aang\" storyline, and lately we have learned more and more about both Aang and Zuko and how they became the way they are now in the series. Aang, the young kid who just wants to have fun who is given the most important duty in the world and Zuko is a battle scarred soldier who does nothing less then his duty.its the characters who make the series interesting, and so does the storyline even though to some it sounds clich\u00e9. all the characters have back stories, the kind of back stories that are missing in most cartoons these days. Like how Aang was raised by the nomadic monks of the air temple who discovered his heritage much sooner then he was supposed to due to the activity of the fire nation. his past is mostly shrouded in mystery though lately his past was revealed. Katara and Sakka are both practically orphans, as their mother was killed in a fire nation attack. Katara is the kind hearted one, but she is also very commanding of her brother Sakka overall acts like a typical teenage boy who is looking for action, but he is really very clumsy and his humor is perhaps the strangest I have seen. Zuko is a very determined person to get the avatar, his honor was tarnished and his reputation is in question. he is very obsessed but his uncle the retired General Iroh makes sure his nephew wont stumble too far into the pit of hate and vengeance.one things fore sure though, I have become a fan of this Nick surprise",

            "content": "I, like many others, really enjoy this show. The comedy is top notch and the originality is refreshing. It is a show that is appropriate to watch with your kids but entertaining for adults as well. While I enjoy the show as a hole, there are a few inconsistencies that exist that stop me from giving this show a perfect score. First, the bending.For the most part, the creators are very consistent and logical with the bending, i.e. there needs to be water to bend water, there needs to be earth to bend earth and so forth. Where they fall off is fire bending. Throughout most of the entire show, the character Katara has to keep a vial of water with her to bend water (as it would be ridiculous to pull water from the humidity in the air), yet most of the firebenders can bend fire with no fire around. Fire, unlike air, doesn't exist in its natural state everywhere and all around us, it has to be created via ignition, oxygen and a fuel source. But throughout almost the entire show, firebenders will just create fire from thin air. This creates a catch-22 in the logic of the show that ruins some of the credibility of writing.Also, lightning bending should have really nothing to do with fire bending, or at least it should really have more to do with air and water as the creation of lightning comes with the charging of air molecules creating added energy in the molecules, usually in the form of water. While lightning can create a fire, lightning is not caused by fire, thus fire and lightning should have nothing to do with each other.Lastly, and this is a purely personal bias, I think the machinations of Azula are too perfectly executed in most instances. Generally, the only times her plans fail are is if one of her underlings fail, not by any lack of foresight or fallability in Azula's character. Other characters imperfections are what make them so great in this show: Aang's love, Zuko's pride, Sakka's arrogance... These traits are what make the show great and Azula just lacks that and feels too perfect/fake. But again, this is just my humble opinion.",

It was one of the best series I've watched. Even though it was primarily made for kids, I enjoyed it a lot. The animation was great and the plot, I don't have words. Loved all the characters and their developments through out the series. Aang being insecure about his position in the world to defeating the fire lord, Katara being just a girl in the Southern water tribe to becoming one of the greatest water bending masters, Sokka as a boy who was left to protect the Southern water tribe to becoming the bravest soldier who end up planning the whole invasion, Toph being a stubborn overprotected rich girl to a person who puts other peoples feeling ahead of hers and protecting the whole world by her talents and discovering her metal bending abilities and Zuko being an arrogant prince who wants only the approval of his father by taking down the avatar becomes a selfless person who becomes the fire bending master to Aang at the end.And one of the main factors I like about the series is that how they presented the journey of the making of the avatar, all the fun, obstacles, lessons they had to face. It had an organized flow; balancing the main storyline with all the sub stories. Just after finishing ATLAB I watched the legend of the Korra and I'm certainly in need of another Avatar series.

The show is about Aang's (the avatar) journey to learn to bend the elements and end the war, all the while accompanied by his friends Katara and Sokka.The great thing about avatar is that it has interesting story lines, great character development, amazing action sequences and a lot of funny moments throughout the series.The show is supported by wonderful and original music and there is not a single boring episode in all 3 wonderful seasons!

The storytelling, the emotion, the magic... it feels like you sometimes enter another world. I have a small repertoire for animated shows, but I have watched shows such as Bojack Horseman, Gargoyles, Attack on Titan, Arcane, and Gravity Falls name a few. And I still put this show above all. I don't even understand what makes me like it so much. It may be that the writers absolutely nailed a show targeted at kids, but in a way where adults would still enjoy it. It comes from the fact that you inadvertently expect more from mature shows. And so a show targeted at kids done this well, well, it catches you off guard. Like, imagine comparing Bojack Horseman to Avatar. It's nearly impossible because they are targeted at different age groups. Would it be better if Avatar was made for a more mature audience (including substance abuse, mental illness, profanity, and more violence, to say the least)? Maybe. Maybe not. Would it be better if Bojack were created for younger kids, ages seven and up? Maybe. Maybe not. My point is this show did amazing, given the mature topics they couldn't discuss as other shows have. Are these mature topics necessary? For some shows, yes, if done well. Because I cannot imagine shows like BoJack Horseman and Attack on Titan if they were made for younger audiences.Avatar exceeded with a target audience that is easy to succeed in if that's the only audience they were targeting. But there were other audiences they were targeting. They targeted all ages while maintaining the beauty and magic a younger kid could enjoy. And that's what makes this show as great as it is. With all this, I rate this show as one of the best to do it, and although I can hardly say this to other shows I've watched, I would recommend this to anyone of all ages.",

This show never claimed to be a Japanese Anime, nor does it take place in Japan, it may have Japanese elements, but isn't an American show allowed to use some NON-American elements? At least they made them creative because they're not trying to copy tacky Japanese crap, they use all of Asia and then some, AND they did a lot of research to do it!

There are funny episodes, emotional episodes, serious episodes, and think of anything that you would consider good and the show has it all. Great characters and so much emotion are just a couple things that are so good about this program. Keep in mind as this show follows a direct storyline, there are minor spoilers but nothing major, only the revealing of few characters.The show take place long ago, where the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and a waterbender and her brother discovered the new Avatar. And although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But the main character believes this new Avatar can save the world. Well, that is what the main character claims in the opening narration. The Avatar has been frozen for 100 years and the world has lived without him. The opening narration is bone chilling, but it appears every episode and eventually you just want to skip through it as it becomes very irritating after a long time.The show follows Katara, Aang, and Sokka and their travels across the world as they try and get Aang to learn the four elements that can stop the Fire Nation from taking over the world. However, there are villains who are constantly trying to stop or kill the group. There is Zuko, the prince who has been banished from the Fire Nation, and son of Ozai, the firelord. There is Azula, Zuko's sister, and her two other companions named Mai and Ty Lee, who are some of my favourites from the show. There is also Zuko's uncle, Iroh, the very wise man who is patient and tried to teach his beliefs to Zuko, even though he clearly is impatient with his uncle. There are also minor characters who appear every so often that interact with the group. During the second season, a young, blind girl named Toph joins the group and teaches Aang earthbending. She's such a fun character and is so tough, they are the most unlikely person to be a hero. There is Aang's flying Bison named Appa and Momo who is a lemur who has no major and significant role at all. But these two characters make the show so much funnier every time they are on screen.One of my favourite things about this show is that there are so many episodes that range from the emotions that are meant to be felt. There are scenes where the scenarios were intense, making it much more suspenseful. Other times there are just simply hilarious moments. In a scene in Season Three that the main character is hallucinating that he is watching his flying bison and a lemur speaking to him. Then they take it to the next level and then these two animals have a sword fight. I can't help but laugh at this for some reason.The characters are another thing that make the show what it is. There is Aang, the Avatar who is supposed to master the four elements, water, fire, earth, and air, however he must learn these to stop a ruthless firelord and multiple descendants of his that are trying to eliminate Aang who is the only person who can stop Ozai. Mai is my favourite though. She is such a lazy character and is always feeling so depressed and hates everything. Even her way of saying \"I love you\", happens to be \"I don't hate you\". She refuses to do anything she doesn't want to do but is still loyal to Azula. Ty Lee is also a fun character. She's a crazy circus freak who stuns people simply by punching them. Then there is Azula, the insane princess who is one of the best villains ever in television and cinema history. These three girls, who are only teenagers, have to be the perfect trio of villains in any text I have ever seen.Overall, this is one fantastic show. I can't think of anything to say that is negative about it. It's a nice family show but it so well developed it is hard to not like. Avatar: The Last Airbender isn't just a show, it's a masterpiece. The only disappointment is that the movie sucked. The one thing the film failed to establish was the relationships between the characters. The film was just simply so bland and boring. Meanwhile, the show takes as long as it takes to develop properly and become what we see when we watch it.",

I love they way the story us told in chapters and three different books, you can tell the writers really thought if every detail in this avatars story that the plot wasn't thrown together like some amines that don't make sense. Which unfortunately is all to common these days it is an amazing series the film done it no justice at all so don't go by the movie all in all I'm so glad I took the time to enjoy this avatars life ........

What sticks out is of course the great art style, which is inspired by Asian and also American cartoon elements. The plot is well written but in the end it's just a bad-guys-destroy-the-world-plot, and is not great but solid. But the heart of this show are the characters, who are well written and believable at the same time: There's Aang, a boy who likes to play and make fun, but needs to grow up in the process of the story to save the world, but also Katara, who is grown up from the beginning, defined by her past.My favorite was probably Uncle Iroh, because he was the typical old, but when he wanted he could get pretty bad ass.There were only small things I didn't like, like the subplot with Appa, because Aang got like the little tearful kid, he never was introduced as. In the end there's only left to say, that only if you are a little bit interested in cartoon series, you should definitely go watch The Last Airbender, because of it's beautiful child- suitable art style, his great characters and the interesting plot-line about Zuko finding his fate, and realize how the fire-nation lied to him.",

            "content": "I want to start by saying that this show is very great in bringing kind, natural atmosphere. All the characters are top-notch, especially Iroh, which is by my humble opinion the best elderly character ever written. Dialogue writing is EXTREMELY good, music fits very well into the scenes. This show is really something special, but there was also a bit of a disappointment for me.First problem is childish jokes. And jokes themselves are not really a problem since this is meant to be primarily show for children, but punchlines in them could make even old people laugh. The issue here is that there are too much of them, even in very serious moments like war-action they still somehow inserted plenty of puns, which ruined atmosphere sometimes.Second problem is the ending. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!They made the villain really stupid and awkwardly EVIL! He's so evil I almost started to laugh when he was present on the screen. There's almost no character development in Ozai, he's that cliched baddy that wants to destroy everything just because. But that's not all. I hate how they did every scene in the ending sequence, seriously. People standing ontop of a flying airships crushing into each other (I know this is fantasy world, but Sokka is not a magician!), this whole Aang vs Ozai fight was animated very bad, they just banged their powers while flying all around without any good music or thrill. Even Zuko vs Azula fight wasn't bringing any suspense while I was really hoping it would.As a result, I could stand children atmosphere to get magnificently good dialogues and characters, but there's gotta be a limit to it. Would've been 10/10 if they kept it a little bit more serious and ending wasnt such a mess. But even with its flaws I would recommend to watch it to anybody, Avatar: The last Airbender is truly special and sincere title that is worth seeing.",

Watching this video reminded me of how much I adored this show when it first aired, so I decided to re-watch it. Every episode was a joy to behold. Every character felt real, and I felt like I knew them. I was with them through the thick and the thin. This show managed to draw me in like nothing before. The animation was fantastic. The action was exhilarating. The music was beautiful, and the story was compelling. What more can I say? This show is fantastic regardless of the viewer's age.

Some are just downright ugly!But when I accidentally switched the channel to Nick, about to show a program, which happens to be a brand new one, Avatar: The Last Airbender. I was so surprised to see that Nick is making a quasi-anime show (Anime but not quite anime, eg. Teen Titans, Martin Mystery). That episode I watched was freakin' awesome! About a 12-year old airbender named \"Aang\" trapped in ice for 112 something years, and he's the avatar. After that I got hooked to it. The next episodes were just as awesome. Though some were rather predictable (eg. \"Jet\"), it was still good. It is also good for grownups, as my grandpa also got hooked. Avatar is comedy together with action, heart and emotion, something that is rare. The only gripe about this show is the rather choppy and clunky animation. There are some instances that the program seems to have extremely brief pauses that can be seen to anyone with sharp eyes. Overall, it's one of the best quasi-anime shows I've watched. 9.5/10 Watch it, and you'll like it. Only people who don't dig deep enough (eg. look at Joshua Grave and Ginger 87's comments on page 3) WILL hate this show.",

But it had me hooked from the first episode. The animation is great, flowing smoothly from one scene to the next, and there are very few plot holes or continuity errors (wait... are they the same thing???). But what really got me was the detail and personality put into each character. Each main character has a history that comes into play at just the right moments, and is explained fully so I don't have to guess what happened (i.e., Zuko's scar. A very intriguing story behind that). So far, my favorite episode is The Blue Spirit. It had the best animation so far, and it was VERY exciting. The only thing that is a negitive with this series is the music. I find it is kinda repetitive and slightly annoying at times. But Overall, I give this show two thumbs up!",

A great excercise in merging the best of east and west and creating something new and unique ... and finally a hero who is a hero as well as a kid. I think this fabulous new style is going to give Japan a run for their money ... way to go Nick! This has some eastern philosophic overtones ... but in the same vein as George Lucas and Star Wars, if you think the force and Yoda are OK then Aang and co are fine too IMHO. What is frustrating is that after \"The Blue Spirit\" they seem to have put the show on hiatus without any clue as to when new episodes will be aired. Does anyone know when new episodes will air? What's holding them up? Are the ratings low or something? I think this show deserves 9/10",

It wasn't until 2010, where I watched the whole series, that I could fully grasp the whole narrative.As a child, nothing ever made me question culture and moral principles as much as this show. Avatar spends a tremendous amount of time building its universe. Although American in origin, Avatar has many well-researched Japanese, Buddhist, Inuit, and Korean references. The main characters (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) are harmoniously crafted to provide unique perspectives throughout the story, evolving over the course of the entire series. Furthermore, the historical background and division of nations are exceptionally well put together. Each episode usually includes a short subplot with its own conflict that must be overcome by the end. Each episode ultimately ties in together to form an intricate web of realistic narrative. Since the premise is about a long-lasting war, there are several dark, real-world themes woven with philosophical and moral concepts. However, Avatar is also filled with witty and intelligent comic-relief and mesmerizing artistic imagination.In all aspects, Avatar: The Last Airbender, even after over a decade, is still a very enjoyable show to watch. Each time I have watched it, I still find new viewpoints and elements I did not notice previously. I believe this show still has yet to be beaten in both quality and creativity.",

I haven't been a kid for some time now so I don't watch a lot of cartoons much, but what Michael Dante DiMartino did here is pure genius storytelling that sits well with all age groups. Characters actually develop, they have depth, the story is compelling and makes you want to watch more. As they move on, the episodes get way better, more confident and there's this sort of natural progression of things. I'm not sure what else to add, besides go watch it. While the show may be aimed at a younger audience, there is plenty of material older folks can think about if you can get over the occasional 5yo jokes. ;) Its probably the best cartoon series of the last decade and it deserves praise. I am hoping the movies are gonna be equally good, deep and rich and not just some soulless crap Hollywood produces these days.Get it, watch it, open your mind and if you don't love it... well, I can't help you there. :) Orion",

The real savior of the first season is that the visuals are so beautiful!The beauty remains, and the character arcs and plots are top-notch in the second season and well into the third. Prince Zuko is one of the most fascinating, complicated characters in all of television, forget all of Nick TV. The original three characters continue to face seemingly impossible challenges and deal with like -get this- human beings! Toph adds a wonderful dynamic and steals the show on many occasions. The finale (and the episodes leading to it) is devastating and beautiful.The third season has been interrupted by the writer's strike and Nick being a jerk, but it's supposed to start up again soon, and I can't wait!

It's so nice to have an animated show to religiously watch, one reason being its superior directing. I find that this topic is rarely commented upon. After watching some of the battle sequences, or even a dialogue scene, you will know what I mean. Each fight is presented differently, in a different color, angle, view, you name it, highlighting exactly what needs to be emphasized for that particular scene. Avatar's characters, plots, action, humor, what more could you ask for? This show has it all. It's one of the best shows on television today.",

The filler its self isn't that bad, but at times I find myself wondering \"if they need to master all of the elements in order to save the world before such and such a thing happens, then why are they wasting time doing...\" If Nick were to up the frame rate for the more epic fight scenes I would probably give the series a 9, and if the characters could quit dawdling (I know, it's a kids show, but the characters seem intelligent enough to prioritize saving the world over some of the other things they are doing) then I would I've it a 10.",

Each nation (Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, Air Nomads and Water Tribes) is based on a different Asain culture, and have different architecture and fashion. Also, each \"bending\" form is based on a different martial art form.

They have all these twists and turns that will keep you on your toes about what might happen. It just gets you so in to it. Then the character development is also nicely done. Due to the more natural time span of the show, you can really see these characters open up and flourish after certain events. And there's the Comedy. Its not overdone! Its so well placed, and not very stressed, that you just cant help but feel thankful for it. Its not like those shows where something funny comes up every few seconds and you soon get tired of it. A:TLA isn't like that at all.Now, the animation style is what initially got me in to this show. I saw the first commercial and was like \"Wow. That looks awesome. Wonder if the story is any good!\" and I wasn't disappointed. Sometiems I'll watch an episode just so I can admire the style. They put so much work and detail, even into the backgrounds and the setting, that its almost impossible to miss or not enjoy at least a bit.10/10.. for pure awesomeness.",

The animations are fluid, the fight scenes are intense, and the facial animation is expressive. The score, voice acting and ambient sound effects are top-notch. Characters like Katara, Zuko, and Iroh will have you cry tears of joy and sadness. Although named after elements, the four nations seem like living, breathing cultures.Nitpicks:Although some plot details like Zuko and Iroh floating at sea for three weeks can be excused because the show is for kids, the main characters not thinking the Fire Nation would know about the Day of Black Sun stretches credulity.Also, (Disclosure: Proud Zutaran and Taanger) Kataang does not make sense since Katara is more mature than Aang and there was no relationship development besides him having a crush, kissing her when they were trapped in a cave, and stealing an inappropriate kiss before the invasion. Throughout the story, it seemed to be a brother/older sister relationship.Other than that and a few other minor gripes, Avatar is a solid candidate for best cartoon of all time.9.5/10 rounded up.",

The voice acting was great too , any other voice just wouldn't have been right. Also , even though it is intented to be a kids show it is not all fun and games... It is so philosophical. At some parts they are all so serious at the right time too. Other then that everyone has a little comedy with them to , which is good. So to sum it up this show in my opinion is fantastic.

There went so much love into making this show (e.g. Each element is based on a different martial arts style) and deserves to be seen as a stand-alone big show like \"Game of thrones\" or \"Breaking bad\" and not as that kids-show airing on Nickelodeon to entertain children for a solid 20min.Its a show for everyone that teaches important moral values and talks about really unexpected topics while implementing everything into this well-done storyline so it doesnt feel forced at all. If i had to point out one thing about this show that sells it to me its got to be the characters and their relationship. If you are that type of person that needs really strong and memorable characters to be invested in a show well.. here you go. This ones definitely for you.Its a show i recommend to everyone without any doubt. Its timeless. Its funny and sad. Its epic and so down to earth.This is my favourite show of all time.

            "content": "AVATAR- The Last Air Bender (2005)\nby Dave FiloniAn exciting American animated film directed by Dave Filoni with 3 seasons released in February 21, 2005 and was written by Michael Dante Dimartino and Bryan Koneitzko. This animated film was fixated to Aang, dubbed by Zach Tyler Eisen, who was the long lost and the last air bender. Aang was found in an iceberg by Katara and Sokka which was dubbed by Mae Whitman and Jack De Sena. Being an air bender, Aang has a flying bison named Appa and was dubbed by Dee Bradley Baker. Their stories will be intertwined and it is a must watch because you will weave each of them to fully comprehend the whole thing. I considered it as one of the films of modern cinemas because it touches on issues that are disturbing and timely as it should be considered.Just like any other films, Avatar- The Last Air Bender has a lot of twist and turn. Personally, I don't watch animated series, but after watching some of the chapters, I really wasn't expecting that this would be great and the plot was a real chef's kiss. Moreover, the film made use of basic\ncinematography and it used different colors which also helped in the overall aesthetic.Furthermore, the characters, the editing, and the dubbing goes perfectly fine and for me, it was unprecedented. Everything blends well and came out exceptional. This film is a great reminder of the thing I aspire the most as of the moment and that is learning the circumstances from the past for me to be able to continue growing as an individual in the present.Many films of this genre are based on pure fiction. However, it is undeniable that ATLAB \"Avatar- The Last Air Bender\" reflects on realistic concerns, not just for yourself but for the people that surrounds you. One of the evident examples for this perspective was Prince Zuko. From the first few chapters, I saw how he tried to fit himself for the glory that was being forfeited if he will not be able to bring back the avatar. Given that the fire nation has conflicts with the other nations because they thought that they were superior, Prince Zuko faced his horrendous fate full of pressure.Historically, the terrible situation of Prince Zuko has something to do with what the fire nation did against the other three nations: Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, and Air Nomads. Having the knowledge of wars, I know how hard it is leading while feeling defeated even if the war hasn't\nstarted yet. In correlation to the film, Zuko knew that he should not underestimate Aang, the last air bender. In the film, the editing and the cinematography played the greatest role of giving the characters the justice of their roles. With the character of Zuko, this film added realistic ideas which the audience could relate.I love how Zuko's character evolved through the chapters. The editing was exceptional that I didn't notice it was Zuko who helped Aang escaped the fire nation until it was revealed in the succeeding scene.One of the things that captured me in the film was the transition of the characters' growth; how they react on things, how they decide, and how they approach life and its grueling events. The essence of character development and personal growth caught me. That you can be\na better version of you despite your past and that even if there are villains, being called \"villains\" doesn't mean they are evils because some just conformed for survival.There are also few things which I appreciated in the film. Due to the existing conflict of the fire nation against the other nations, I loved it when economic terms where substantiated and included in some scenes. This also helped in the development of the characters. Lastly, in the\npolitical perspective, I find it fascinating when the film kind of reflect what political dynasty is since it involved families leading the tribes and the next generation shall continue what has been started by their ancestors. In the social light, it is also relevant when the film included how it's like to be alone and/orsurrounded by people who will support you through thick and thin, people who envy you for the things that you have, and people who can literally drag you down to hell.This is the first animated series I've watched in my entire life and I want more because of this film.As aforementioned, the production was excellent. Giving hints to the audience was unexpected and the character development was unbelievably amazing.In addition, the color scheme gave the scenes an extraordinary touch of excitement especially when it's a fight scene. Lighting was also good. However, there are scenes which has a shorter screentime and I can't fully understand what really happened until I review it. Overall, it\nwas very impressive for a first-time animated film audience like me.The best aspects of the film for me does not lies on the entirety of wars and tribulations, but the unpredictable scenarios which foster the growth of each character, protagonist or not.Regardless of those little issues I've encountered upon watching and taking notes of each chapter so that I will be reminded with how the story goes, I fell in love with the film not because of the amusement I had for the people behind it, but the storyline which moved me to certain realizations.This is one for the books! As a first-time animated film audience, I highly recommend Avatar- The Last Air Bender to those who wanted to watch action mixed with comedy, adventure, and thrill film. Again, I'm not kidding, THIS IS A MUST WATCH.",

While the first season is admittedly \"weaker\" than the other two, there is not a bad season in the show. Even the filler episodes seem to further characters and plot. And don't get me started on the season finales. Every season builds so flawlessly up to the finale and is resolved in such an amazing way. With the exception of two or three minor characters used for plot development, there is no character who isn't fully fledged out. Most notably, Zuko, who has imo the best arc in fiction (again, barring maybe Walter White) I can't say enough good things about this show. Everything down to the soundtrack is just *chefs kiss*.

Anyway, after finishing it, all I could think about was, \"Why did I wait so long to watch this amazing show!?\" Listen, if you are like I was, and haven't witnessed ATLA, then you are robbing yourself a great experience!The story is absolutely amazing! However, that isn't to say that this show is for everyone. What I mean is, you have to have an imagination, and it's best if you're a kid at heart. You can tell that parts of the script in virtually every episode is driven towards younger audiences. However, it's not like you'll be watching Power Rangers. There are many serious elements and moments in the story.Voice acting is a key element in an animated show, and can really rise it up to glory, or drown it in embarrassment. Not once did I find myself thinking, \"You know, they really could have chosen a better voice actor.\" Each voice actor brought their character to life. The script for each character was very well written, and the voice actors did an amazing and convincing job making you fall in love with the characters!The only complaint I have is the length of the show, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who thinks this. There are only three seasons to this magnificent work of art! This is so disappointing, because once you start watching, let alone finishing the show, you will be itching for more!So take the advice from someone who had virtually no interest in this and give it a shot. If you're ready for a fantastic show, you need to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender!Score: 10/10",

Well i think you really should keep on making more episodes that war's going on harder or something. because everybody in here is very excited about this program.

A hero and plot comparable to a cartoonish layman version of The Matrix's with satiating stories and characters. One of the best animes ever made and it's made right here in USA. My own insignificant pet peeves about the show such as questionable and/or hypocritical actions done by certain characters(like Katara and the Southern Raiders or Toph leaving out the fact that her burns resulted from sneaking up on Zuko or Katara's habitual disrespect for other cultures traditions) prevent me from giving it a solid 9. 8.9/10 But the writers did do a great job a parodying themselves at the end of the series. It's a great series. Watch it!",

I was so sad when I watched the last episode because I knew I would miss it, and I do really really miss it! This show is amazing, I grew to love the characters and the storyline was practically flawless. It was comical, dramatic, action packed, and it had a little romance. I LOVED IT!

Now speaking as a 24 year old I saw this show as both clever and comedic to anyone of age. The simple thought of animation, landscape and script, its no wonder the show was a success. The way each character interacts with one another you get captured by the shear thought of how the real world relates today. It has it all and to an extend broadens over the course of what every child imagined growing up from seedy, dishonorable pirates to esteemed royal patrons of a established family. And with such linear storyline, it does have its way of explaining every little detail. For all you parents out there that read these I highly recommend this cartoon for kids of all ages. It does have abit romance in it but not enough to taint how kids see relationships but with the constant fight scenes and epic comedy this show will leave you in tears, laughter and somewhat sad. Like I say it has it all. For anyone that thinks otherwise this show was well worth the time and with a stellar class of voice actors its no wonder the cartoon show was much more successful than the motion picture.",

But perhaps that is what the makers wanted to be, a world that resembles our world, but with a few differences just to remind you that it isn't really our world. \"The elements thing has been used over and over\" yea it has been used, so it is useless now? i find this argument lacking, the fact that a certain aspect has been used before doesn't mean it cannot be used again, otherwise we wouldn't be seen other things but globby beings which live in a lava world with no sun, and eat rocks.The series is a great show, in which characters are complex and everyone have their own problems and past, of course, it is not complex to a professional level, but for a cartoon, it manages a high variety of aspects which you wouldn't normally see in other shows. It is a great cartoon which is most specifically targeted to kids from 12+ from my point of view because several characters are confused and doubtful, but through the series they mature and become certain of who they are.This is certainly one of the best animated series out there. It is disguised as any other cartoon for small children, but as you watch on, it starts to evolve into a more mature show, but also keeping that childish aura. the storyline is simply perfect in my opinion. and it sacrifices some aspects to make the show more family oriented but it is still an awesome story worth watching.",

The people that hate him are Firelord Ozai, his daughter and Zuko's sister Azula, and almost every other fire-bender you meet in the series.

This is easily the best show that has ever graced Nickelodeon's network. it's unlike anything else you will find on their stations. I grew up in an era where they broadcast the Rugrats and Hey Arnold. suffice it to say i never watched much Nickelodeon. It wasn't until i started college that i actually found this show. This show stands out among it's animated comrades for multiple reasons. Every episode is superbly written. If nothing else you can watch this show for the humor, snappy dialogue. The animation is beautiful and breathtaking at moments The characters are some of the best that you will ever find. not just in for animation, but any television characters. their is depth to their lives and stories that draws you in. And while sometimes the viewer might not always agree with the decisions they make, you can see their point of view and understand their motives. this aspect applies not only to protagonist but to antagonist as well. you can see why some of the \"villains\" do what they do. And maybe even root for them from time to time. The story is really the foundation from which this show is able to put on such a wonderful performance. the concept is truly fascinating, and without getting spoiler detail. lets just say the story takes you into a world you will never forget, and guide you through the adventure of a lifetime.",

The characters are real: unlike disgustingly flat SpongeBob SquarePants and company, Aang, Katara, and all their friends and foes through the series have souls behind the ink and paint. The concept of 'Good' and 'Evil' is taken through hell and back, bringing along characters like psychotic Princess Azula, vengeful Jet, and devious Long Feng. The show blends humor, horror, sadness, and romance together in a joyful hodgepodge of action that you won't want to miss. Give it a try! My one complaint about Avatar: The Last Airbender, though, is it's advertisements (i.e. on the Nicktoons Network, they used to make fart jokes about the program.)

In general, the show is well written and paced.The show does have its faults, however. The first season is easily the worst and it contains some real clunker episodes (\"The Great Divide\"). It takes too long to really pick up, but when it does, it truly is wonderful. Some poor writing decisions also hold the series back. Although Aang not killing Ozai in the series finale does work from a thematic perspective, it's a poorly written deus ex machina involving concepts that were never previously established.Ultimately, Avatar The Last Airbender is a great cartoon series. Its influence on modern animation can still be seen today. Despite its flaws, it was very enjoyable to watch.",

First i wasn't sure if the focus of the show isn't too much on kids, since its produced by nickelodeon. But my doubts faded fast. The bending is a clever way to show action which is not inappropriate for kids but isn't boring neither. It has been a long time since i saw a show with such brilliant characters. They all add value to the group. The development of the characters is well done, too. Especially Zukos change over the show is nicely done. Every character has values you like. Tophs and Sokkas humor, Zukos ambition and anger, etc. Particularly Iroh is a special character. He seems like an old, funny man who wants to spend his last days in peace, but is one of the strongest firebenders whose actions are crucial for the story. The Animation and Soundtrack are awesome. Especially in the last few episodes is the combination of fighting and background sound simply amazing. You see such a high quality very rarely in a cartoon/anime. There is just one small point of critique i have. Some episodes seem like fillers. They add no progression to the story or sometimes even collide with the behavior of characters they normally have. But this is just a small point. I was rarely that sad when a show ended. I really miss new episodes, especially since there is still much to tell. But that way Avatar ensures his very high quality, which other cartoons/Anime with > episodes don't have. Maybe there will be a cartoon about \"the promise\" and \"the search\" which have been published recently or will be published in the future. In the end, there is only one thing to say. Thanks for such an amazing show. Its a unique experience.10/10",

And then there's Zuko. I don't think I've ever known a character in fantasy that could exist so easily in the real world. The mirroring themes between Aang and Zuko's life were an incredible story telling method seldom seen in television shows geared towards a younger audience. And then there's the animation.

            "content": "Avatar: The Last Airbender is a so-called Pseudo-Anime (drawn in the style of anime, but produced outside of Japan). But don't let that put you off: this show is brilliant. It is set in a world ruled by four nations based on the four elements: Water, Earth, Fire and Air. Certain people in this world have the ability to \"bend\" these elements: to control them through willpower. This bending creates some very interesting fight scenes, and it's used for good and evil alike. However, there is one individual, the Avatar, who can master all four elements. The Avatar's task is to bring balance to the world and to keep harmony between the four nations. The show focuses on the current Avatar (An airbender named Aang) and his friends and their quest to bring balance to the world. This show really has it all. Action with well-choreographed battles and superb animation, romance, humor, serious bits, wisdom, incredible visuals (especially the scenery), and a universe that you can really get yourself into. In fact, this is a universe which endless shows could be made in, and it would still be interesting. The characters are lovable and relatable, and by the end you really feel as if you're part of their family and their adventure. Even the villains can be relatable at times, and there's great character development. The show runs over a course of 61 episodes, divided into 3 seasons or \"Books\". The story arcs perfectly, and instead of making the show longer to make fans happy, the show really ended at the right point and on a high note. Though it ran on Nick and is, in principle, a kids show, don't let that fool you; this show can be enjoyed by all ages. If you don't want to watch the show because of this you are deeply mistaken: this show appealed to me just as much at 6 years old, when I first watched it, as it does today at 16. Give it a chance, and you'll love it. But wait, there's more: if you've finished the show and, like me, just can't get enough, there is even more on offer. Three series of comics (a fourth is coming soon) follow the show that continue the plot and provide closure. Perhaps the best part of all is that there's an entire 4 season, 52 episode sequel called \"The Legend Of Korra\", that's just as good, if not better.If I had to sum it up in one word, i'd say : Perfect.",

I lose interest in many shows because there is no clear direction on where the show is going. Aang, must master all four elements and defeat the firelord before the sozens comet comes in a years' time to save the world. This path is set on early in the show and it gives you a clear sense that he and his friends are destined for a great journey. This show gives you a brand new world, relatable characters, memorable music, and a truly epic story.",

It really uses a valid martial arts technique and similar Asian culture. However, I kinda disappointed with the ending of this epic. The troops of fire nation is unexpectedly small sized. It's consist of not more than 10 zeppelins. And when Zuko become a king it's only attended by several people, which are incomparable to Obama's. Small things like that really destroys the excitement of the story and terribly disappointing. On the other hand, all aspects of the story is really cool and I'm hoping to see the makers make a new enhanced one. (when i'm writing this, my brother is watching one of the episode downstairs and inspired me to create this comment).",

I've watched a lot of movies, series, docus, anime etc. But this one is always mentioned when asking my favorite.I'd recommend everyone to watch it, no matter the age or background !There is so much to say about it, because it has a special place in heart- I just want to say for the older folks, don't be turned off because it's animated or was a nickelodeon seriesTruly a masterpiece :)ps. I want to add, if you've watched Avatar TLAB and aren't sure about Korra (like I was for years), give that one a shot too, because especially season 3 & 4 were really good, and in a totally different way which was interesting.",

We have also toph , sokka , suki , iroh .... My problem was with the forced love between Aang and katara , it was completly forced and the building to it was horrible , also i had a small problem with zuko in the end of book 2 , still the characters are pretty good !\n9.5/10\n2- world building : atla had a great world building , four nations , four main bendings , different kingdoms and tribes , but the history of the world is\nkinda missing , and we needed more explainations about the creation of the avatar world , also mostly all the people from the 4 nations look the same which bothers me\n9.5/10\n3- animation & directing : the animation is well done , it was kinda messed up in the 1st half of the 1st book , but then theyfixed it and i really liked the animation style\n9/10\n4-writting : example of a cartoon show with a good writting , 3 different books with different events and story arcs , there are some storylines abondoned tho like the earth king's future and the controlling system of Ba sing se , jet's friends's fate , also the play episode (Book 3Ep 17) was horrible and a big Pilot hole in the series\n9/10\n5- avoiding the plot armor and Coincidence element : and here we go Avatar the last airbender did a horrible job with avoiding those 2 elements , the stupid lion turtle and energy bending plotline that came up out of the blue to help aang in his last battle , Aang being brought too life by some mysterious water , the Angang meeting that bloodbender old woman( please tell me what are the chances of that meeting happening in the real life ?!) , Jet saving the gang in the last moment (Book 1) which is rediculous and a big BRUH , zuko being Exactly in the same place and same moment to see the avatar coming after 100 years of him disapprearing , what the heck is this ??? And there are a lot of examples of these sssstupid coincidences but i am very lazy to mention them\n2/10I actually wanted to give it 1/10 to make thz show's rating lower , but no , i am not that kind of people who just gives low rating for a stupid reason like that . but In the end , avatar the last airbender is a very unique show , it is a great show but not the best , not even close to it\nand the fans talk about it like it is the best human creation ever , still one of the best Fantasy series",

In the past I do recall preferring to watch Avatar, whenever it had aired on Nickelodeon. But it never quite stuck with me. I did also recall Upon viewing it I had become bored with its less that satisfactory elements.\nTo contrast some other cartoons i have revisited were; Codename KDN, Spongebob (seasons 1-3), Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Ed, Edd, N Eddy. and all these were great cartoons when i was a child, and still feel entertaining to me as an adult. all with a charm that makes them what they are. but Avatar feels more bland like a Camp Lazlo. as I reiterate, something that I would tune in to, but never stuck with me.\nParts that didn't work was the pacing of the show. it just felt sluggish, dragged out and not going anywhere fast. this show, unlike the others i have listed was a story about a journey. going from point to point. they had to go somewhere and do something. it relies too much on way too campy childish jokes, and conflict where the threats and stakes didn't feel compelling enough to serve as good sub plot. i know that death doesn't make it a better show, but playing out that the fire nation commits genocide, and no one dies on the good side that makes any of the fights feel like the stakes are high or that Aang \"Will save the world\". I also wanted to note that the fights were nothing to write home about. the build up wasn't good, and the pay off neither better. which once again going from point to point on this journey feels slow.\nThough I will always have fawned memories of watching in the past. there are way too many shows that were more special and set the bar higher in Animation, sound effects, story writing, and those shows deserve the watched, reminisced over, or viewed for the first time. it would be great if your in the age range of 7-12 that want a diet love, fight, good vs evil, story.",

I mean Nickelodeon is kicking A double snakes.Avatar i think is the best anime since case closed ,Dbz( Dragon ball z), and YU-GI-OH. I personally think nick should show avatar more its very original. Avatar is about a boy named aang who is a air bender who lives in a world of four tribe air, earth(rock), water , and fire. The thing/person that keeps all these things together are avatars. but when the world needed the avatar the most he disapeared so its all about this Young boy learning how to be a avatar to stop the war of the fire nation.",
