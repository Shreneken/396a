            "content": "What exactly is the sound of thunder? If this movie is any indication then it's the sound of moviegoers thundering towards the exit, demanding their money back. Yes, the movie is that bad.\"Hey Johnny, how bad is it?\" This movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury wishes he could invent a time machine so that he could go back in time and NOT write the short story, thus preventing this movie from ever being made.\"Whoa, that bad?\" Worse. In fact, this movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury might kill himself just so he can roll over in his grave. I know you think I'm trying to be cute, but I'm being serious. This was one of the strangest movie experiences I've had in quite a while. The problem is that I went into the movie expecting to enjoy it. I thought it had the chance to be pretty good. So at the very start I was trying to make excuses for what was unraveling on screen.The first thing to induce unintentional laughter was the fact that Ben Kingsley (the owner of the time traveling safari who's only interested in how much money he can make) looks like Bob Barker. Nice poofy white wig, Ben. Oh well, no big deal, I can laugh that off. Then we're introduced to the first CGI dinosaur of the movie. \"Hmm, that sure looks really fake,\" I thought. \"Oh, I know! It's supposed to be fake. They're tricking the hunters into thinking the dinosaur is real, but it's mechanical or something.\" Nope. Imagine my sheer horror when I came to the realization that the dinosaur was supposed to be real. Wow. At this point I started to get nervous.Then came the incredibly bad green screens. Folks, these are some of the worst green screens I've ever seen. My words cannot do justice to how fake they looked. Some might even say they looked faker than those things Pamela Anderson tries to pass off as breasts. When you can tell that the actors are walking on a treadmill then you have serious issues that are long past addressing. I was absolutely shocked at what I was witnessing. Honestly, I started to get confused and thought, \"What in the world is going on? This movie cost $80 million to make, there's no way it can look this bad.\" Where there's a will, there's a way, and somebody must've had a strong will to make this as cheesy and as goofy as they could because I cannot come up with any other explanation.I actually like the concept of the movie - the butterfly effect - the theory that something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can produce long-term effects on a dynamical system. However, this movie presents the theory in the most outlandish, most unbelievable way imaginable. Sorry, but I just didn't buy it. One of the scientists in the movie argues that if you kill a bee, then that bee can't pollinate a flower, and an animal will not be able to eat that flower, thus that animal will die and can cause damaging long-term effects. Um, if \"Flower A\" never blossoms then an animal that's hungry will just go find \"Flower B\" and eat that. I don't think the animal will immediately die AND CAUSE HUMANS TO TURN INTO ALIEN-LIKE CREATURES!!! Come on.So the movie decides to take the \"butterfly effect\" to the most extreme depths that it possibly can - fine, whatever. What *really* bothered me is it doesn't care to explain why killing the butterfly resulted in the world being taken over by horribly rendered CGI creatures. It would have at least been nice to have an explanation as to why and how such drastic changes took place because of one simple butterfly.The butterfly would've been killed in a volcano that erupts right before they head back to the time machine anyway, so how do you explain that? Well, if your name is A Sound of Thunder then you don't. You just say, \"Here's the premise, now we're just going to become a monster movie and have the good guys be chased by bat monsters in the dark.\" Well, I'd be interested in hearing what's said when this movie becomes one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) flops of the year.At about the halfway point I realized that there was no need to continue to rationalize why the movie appeared to be so bad. I accepted the fact that in this case appearances were not deceiving and this was just a really horrible movie. If you can accept that from the start then there is plenty of unintentional laughter to be had.Once our heroes started being chased by weird ape/bat/dinosaur hybrids, I just kicked back, laughed, and shook my head at the fact that the CGI is as bad (if not worse) than what you see in Sci-Fi Original movies starring Lorenzo Lamas and Michael Par\u00e9. I wish I were exaggerating.I honestly don't know how this movie was allowed to achieve such mediocrity. You know when one of the characters starts off with an American accent, then begins to fluctuate between American and British accents, and then eventually settles into her native British accent that everybody involved has obviously thrown in the towel and said, \"Screw it, let's just get this over with.\" You would think that in the year 2005 a movie with an $80 million budget wouldn't look more like a movie that was made on an $8 million budget. I'm sorry, but CGI this awkward on this size of a budget is just inexcusable. Way to go Hollywood. We can only hope a few jobs are lost over this disaster.",

            "content": "The possibilities of time travel make for complex science fiction. As one of Sci-Fi's great writers, Ray Bradbury saw the potential for making a point and used it to a frightening end. As a lame-duck director, Peter Hyams saw the opportunity to make one more project and maybe give his career some much-needed resuscitation. The misaligned dichotomy simply results in a mess.In the mid-21st Century, Travis Ryer (Ed Burns) leads prehistoric hunting safaris, from which the Time Safari (groan) company earns its bread and butter. Having seized the time machine built by Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) built up his company to overcharge the indulgent rich who seek to have a new experience. On a trek with a pair of thrill seeking buddies, a couple of things go wrong, and although everyone survives, the mistake causes changes in time and evolution. It is at this point where the noticeable deviation from Bradbury's story occurs. In the original tale, there was no going back to fix the problem, and the time travelers were left to face the horror of a world which had been subtly altered to permit ignorance, bigotry and fascism to be the dominant qualities of mankind. In the hands of these screenwriters, the mistake simply becomes a vehicle to generate a variety of creepy-crawly monsters that stalk the people of the story as they try to literally race against time and fix the mistake.The script drags all the clich\u00e9s out and leaves the actors to cover them. There is the greedy CEO, the disillusioned scientist, the noble hero, loyal sidekick and even a corrupt official. The scientist expresses her outrage at the corporate abuse of her invention to the hero who is a better man than she expected. All the actors do everything they can to rail against the pitfalls they are presented with. Ed Burns conveys an easy hero's swagger and knows that he'll get more mileage out of underplaying than by shouting. Catherine McCormack does a highly competent job of spouting endless reams of technobabble while managing to sound like she actually knows what she is talking about, but she and Burns simply have no romantic chemistry. How Academy Award Winner Ben Kingsley ended up as part of the production is anyone's guess, but the quirks that he piles into the carnival-mouthed \"Charles Hatton\" are the single best bit of entertainment.Hyams fumbles the details to the point of insulting the audience. People make all sorts of irrational decisions just to forward the plot or introduce a set piece. When someone makes a mistake, they usually recheck their work. Here the tech drops a piece of equipment and visibly damages it. He re-stacks it and ignores it. Even the hero, at one point, declares that the party must go down into the dark, abandoned, unstable and partly flooded subway tunnels because \"it's the only way\". Presumably, it's better to have the odds stacked against you where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures instead of staying on stable ground where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures. Although there isn't any sort of racial subtext, the movie goes so far as to sacrifice the only major African-American character as a distraction to hungry monsters so the white people can run for their lives. It doesn't seem to be making any sort of real-world point, and the editor does struggle against this obviously outdated plot moment. However, it ultimately plays out badly and without dignity. There is also no reason (other than it looks cool) to believe that changes in time would occur in visible waves of force that knock people and cars around, but not buildings or animals. One can imagine that this might have been at least fun in the hands of a militantly perfectionist filmmaker like Jim Cameron who beats even clich\u00e9d celluloid moments until they resound with the exact shape and feel he demands. In spite of making several films throughout the 90's and recent years, Hyams peaked with \"2010: The Year We Make Contact\" in 1984 - while standing on Stanley Kubrick's cinematic shoulders. Even taking the troubled production history of \"A Sound of Thunder\" into account, Hyams butchers the possibilities here.The audience is denied the simple delight of watching special effects during a sci-fi adventure because of the shoddy craftsmanship and a lack of money. Several virtual sets were created to make a more complete city of the future, but they often look unrendered and more like a very good artist's drawing. However this is not a substitute for a good set, and it is painfully clear when actors are standing in front of a green screen. This was originally slated for a 2003 release, which would have put it ahead of the virtual productions of \"Sky Captain\" and \"Sin City\". Had things not been derailed by the original production company's bankruptcy (see the \"Thunder\" trivia section on IMDb.com), then maybe this would have been noteworthy in its attempt to push special effects boundaries. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, there were many times when the audience at this screening burst into laughter at some of the sights. The one thing that Hyams' FX team does get right is the gang of computer-generated creatures that should have been the design for the villain in his 1997 movie, \"The Relic\". As cool as the things look, it is 8 years and 3 movies past due.Failures in effects and leaps of logic can be forgiven, but only up to a point. This is not a misfire form an otherwise successful director. This is a poor turn by a weak hand who refuses to respect his characters or the audience who has come to be entertained. Only the actors make the weak production bearable. \"A Sound of Thunder\" got a second chance to pull things together, but look into your own future and avoid watching this mistake.2 out of 10",

I'm not sure if they left because the movie was so bad or because they couldn't hear the dialogue over the laughter of the rest of us.Mediocre special effects don't excite me. Abysmally bad special effects are wonderful. I disagree with the previous commenter -- I don't think the actors were walking on a treadmill in front of the green screen, I think they were just standing in place and shifting their weight from one foot to the other.Sir Ben Kingsley is clearly aware of the \"quality\" of this film and embraces the ridiculousness, having a great time reading his absurd lines.The plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the creatures, the actor's accents -- each piece of this movie is worse than the last. There were at least three scenes that made me laugh so hard I cried.I love dumpster-diving through bad movies in search of treasure. The recent crop of bad movies have been just plain boring.

And I don't think Ray Bradbury would be upset at the treatment his short story received. His story was fantasy, well-written and clever, and putting that on the screen would be a challenge. I think the writers, producers, director and actors have done a pretty-good job of it.From memory, Bradbury's story ends when it is discovered that evolution has changed because of a tiny alteration in a time-travel incident. But that would make the movie 37 minutes long, so the modern writers have to find a remedy, and stretch it out to a reasonable length.Ryer (Burns) knows what has to be done and he has to get the inventor of the TAMI machine, Sonia Rand, (Catherine McCormack) to help, but New York is now a jungle and there are hordes of ape-lizards, and ape-bats and nasty eagles too. They have to get to a university with a working particle accelerator. What a challenge, through the flooded subway and always pursued by monsters.Suspend ones reasoning, just take it for a way-out fantasy. And it looks better when watched for a second or third time.The story is good, the characters are well-defined, the acting is good, (especially that of a support character Eccles (William Armstrong) who is absolutely terrified), and there is some memorable dialogue, so I've given it a 7.For once, Catherine McCormack doesn't even get kissed!",

            "content": "I have lived in the Los Angeles area for about a year now. When I can, I enjoy seeing free screenings of movies. As I understand it, these test screenings are done by marketing-research companies at the behest of the movie studios. You watch a movie for free and then you fill out a form explaining what you liked and didn't like about the movie. The company then selects a smaller group of viewers for a Q & A focus group.So I saw a free screening of A SOUND OF THUNDER about six months ago. We were told that the special effects were just \"mock-ups\" and therefore to not judge those effects too harshly. And we were promised that for the actual release the special effects would look spectacular.I just watched A SOUND OF THUNDER on its opening Friday and the special effects were EXACTLY the same. They used the mock-ups, the \"pretend special effects,\" for the release.Which leaves me to believe that the test screenings got such bad feedback that the studio decided to cut its losses. They didn't advertise this film very much and they didn't spend any REAL money on the special effects.One thing they may have changed was some of the editing. The pace felt a little better than the original free screening. I mean the movie has a lot of problems but it seemed like some small things were cut or at least cut differently.I'm hoping that the DVD will have a commentary track so we can hear the behind-the-scenes story of what really happened. But I doubt the studio will put any bells and whistles on the DVD release.I agree with everyone else. This is a bad movie (with the exception of Ben Kingsley's interesting character work). But it was made worse by the studio's lack of commitment and backing.",

            "content": "While I've found the scathing reviews and remarks about this film (here and on Rotten Tomatoes) to be very amusing, I have to say that I can't quite fathom where all the anger and disgust comes from. It's as if certain films are doomed before their release - critics decide they are going to hate it before they even make it through the opening credits, or often before they even walk into the theater. Sometimes the derision is justified - \"Aeon Flux\" deserved most of the poor reviews it received - but often a film is never given a fair chance. I feel that is the case here.Note that I say this even though I don't care that much for Ed Burns, and never have - I hated him in \"15 Minutes\", hated him in \"Confidential\", and pretty much consider him one of the most overexposed, overrated young actors in the last 5-10 years. I imagine he has his fans and followers, and I admit he's a pro level actor, but I can take or leave his one-note, self-important, cocksure screen persona. And yes, the special effects are less than totally convincing . There were lots of moments where the textures weren't especially good (like they needed to make a couple more passes with the renderers) and lots of minor glitches and badly matched \"green screens\" that jarred my eyes. But if you don't actively look for the glitches, and just accept what you see uncritically, they work fine. Ang Lee's much ballyhoo-ed \"Hulk\" effects were at least this problematic whenever the Hulk figure had to interact with \"live\" actors, and that film was hyped as a masterwork of special effects several years ago. The cast (and the acting in general) is no better than it has to be, for which I blame the director and the script, because a few of the supporting players obviously have some juice and charisma given the right settings and dialog. (McCormick especially seems to be struggling with a thankless role, and even under that burden, she's the most interesting thing in the film.) Most of the time, though, the actors are stuck with unconvincing dialog and set speeches or else they have to mouth derivative clich\u00e9s you've heard too many times before. The script also didn't really play fair with the mechanism or the logic behind the \"time waves\"; rigorous logic doesn't seem to be a strong suit for Hyams in science fiction settings (see \"Outland\" and \"Supernova\" for similar examples of lazy, hole-filled plotting). But even with all these strikes against it, when I finally got around to viewing \"Thunder\" on DVD, I found it was a decent little romp. Nothing to get excited about, but nothing to despise either. I tend to think of it as equivalent to something like The Rock's \"The Scorpion King\" - the standard bases are covered, the standard moves are made, and hard-core sci-fi fans will get their movie fix for a bit, long enough to make to the next bit of sci \"porn\" (like \"Aeon Flux\", \"Underworld:Evolution\", or \"Ultraviolet\"). I spent $5 to buy this used on DVD (the DVD was a very bare-bones package BTW, with only two theatrical trailers and subtitles for extras) and decided I was satisfied and had gotten my money's worth. In fact, I might even watch it again sometime in the future, during a science fiction film marathon with some friends. People who spent $8-$12 (including popcorn) to see this in the theaters...may well have been disappointed. All I can say is, judge for yourself. If you see \"A Sound Of Thunder\" on the racks at your local Blockbuster and you are in the mood for a middling sci-fi adventure film, you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.",

The story had so much potential but a rather poor script and lack of funding (I guess) ruined it. Despite all that, whatever remained was enough to carry me through the 95 minutes this movie ran. Ben Kingsley's talents were rather wasted, in my opinion. Overall, it starts off slow but picks up somewhere in the middle and keeps you interested if you are not the nitpicking type.

This however unfortunately wasn't the case. The premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawed.This movie is potential flushed down the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think. This movie however fails to entertain and I think that that is this movie biggest flaw. Perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm. Instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie, filled with the one unlikely event after the other, that also steals a bit too much from other, more successful movies. Mainely \"Jurassic Park\" obviously.The characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a fairly decent job as the 'heroic' main lead. The rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do. The movie rather relies on its visual, which are extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong. Her character just isn't a likable one. And the rest of the characters...well I already have forgotten their names, I think that that is saying enough about them. It certainly is true though that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. He is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly.Visually the movie is extremely poor. It has some dreadful looking CGI effects and they couldn't even get the more simple 'blue-screen' effects look convincing in the movie. The sets are also awful and cheap looking, like they can fall over and break down every moment.The movie never gets tense, exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible. It's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress. There are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough.So basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one. It's sad to see how low director Peter Hyams has sunk to the last couple of years, after making some good movies in the '70's and '80's.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The adapted Ray Bradbury science fiction story about time travel suffered the great floods of 2002 in Prague and lack of money that delayed its release for 2 years. That Renny Harlin (Cutthroat Island) was originally scheduled to direct should have tipped me off to a lowbrow enterprise.The rear projection is blatantly so; the futuristic city is often modeled; the autos are real toys in chase sequences. The characters who hire Ed Burns to take them back in time to hunt dinosaurs are frequently overacting; the set pieces distinctly function as scene breakers or time wasters, ending up giving nothing to dramatic flow and sequential logic.I can't find anything good to say other than the butterfly effect is a sound premise that won't be heard in this vehicle. The idea that changing even a minute part of history would affect all subsequent history is worth exploring.A Sound of Thunder is a whimper and should be sent back in time to the '50's, where poor production values were valued in B movies. In this film there is no satire of the genre, not anything to indicate the filmmakers were even making fun of themselves",

Some people have slated this movie clearly just because it came out after \"The Day After Tomorrow\". I say give it a chance!OK - this movie didn't have the same special effects-budget as \"The Day After Tomorrow\", but it is still quite good. The cast is great and the acting - although perhaps not the best performances of their lives - is still very good. The movie started out a bit slow after the \"intro\" in my opinion but really picks up as you go, and is a real thriller at the end. The special effects are of uneven quality. A lot of it is really good, while some of it is so obviously computer generated that you can't help but wonder if they ran out of money half-way through the movie. Not that it's THAT bad - it's just that about half of the effects are so very well made that the other half seems a bit \"out of place\"... If it wasn't for the short-comings of the special effects, their failing in going all the way and pulling this movie together, this might have been a classic. As it is - the superb acting pulls this movie through and makes up for any other shortcomings.All things considered - maybe this movie should be rated a 6.

This tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run (did it have one?) and exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week.What looks to be a fancy sci-fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re-run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different 'trips' back in time where a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. One slip of the foot/butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man-eating plants and beasties. Of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually OK.Yes, that is the story...and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted, abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the know-it-all woman creator, and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil one - all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time.

            "content": "I don't understand why people hate this movie so much. I haven't seen such scathing reviews since Gigli. It sure seems like people (both the pros on rottentomatos and the amateurs here) are just trying to outdo each other in how nasty they can be. Let me hit the major objections:The time waves. Oh boy, people hated the time waves. Too complicated and it was different than the previous movies they'd seen, they said. I would point out that the time-wave theory most recently appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who series, and it made sense on its own terms. The movie took care to explain why the time waves could not be passed through, and why the alternate travel at the end eliminated them. What else could you ask for? Would people prefer the lousy, nonsensical \"fade-away\" theory of Back to the Future? Or the Terminator style of just ignoring the paradox altogether? I for one like to see new sci-fi ideas when I watch sci-fi movies. The griping about the central plot innovation reminds of how people hated the original Ring movie for the idea of the enchanted videotape.The SFX. Granted, they weren't at the level of Lord of the Rings, but the movie did not cost as much as Lord of the Rings. For a movie that had so little money left over for post after the Czech floods destroyed the sets during shooting, it's rather unfair to point out that there were only a handful of vehicle models and one of the street textures came from 3D Studio Max. The effects on the whole were far better than most of what we saw in the 1990s, and they were considered adequate then. To say the SFX looked like cardboard cut-outs? Give me a break. That kind of frothing at the mouth is not helpful in a review. Moreover, the SFX always advance the plot, which is something that can't be said for the Star Wars podrace or the Harry Potter Quidditch (also known as the George Lucas et al. Bathroom Break).The acting. One of the previous comments glowingly referred to Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast. Now that movie had the worst camera-work since Blair Witch and the most turgid, obvious plot, and the tardiest pacing of any movie I saw that year. If that person likes movies like Sexy Beast (I believe the polite word for that kind of movie is \"dialogue-driven\"), then it's their own damn fault for going to see a monster sci-fi movie. I believe the acting could be fairly described as \"competent\" -- easily better than the Star Wars movies, for example. Nobody is going to win an Oscar, but on the other hand it doesn't star Russell Crowe.The script. I agree it could have used some editing, but at no point do the characters act like complete idiots. I would have liked to have seen an explanation of why the expeditions never ran into each other until the end, and why the main character just disappears at the end. But most, if not all, of the minor plot holes could have been resolved with better dialogue. For instance, instead of wasting time saying roughly \"It will hurt, when you're pulled twice,\" the female scientist could have said \"when this machine shuts down, this version of you will die.\" When they're going into the subway, the main character could have said \"there are monsters up here and we would die; there may not be monsters down there\" instead of whatever frivolous comment he made. In other movies (much of the Matrix 2 and 3, or the ending of AI), the plots simply made no sense on a first watching. It is better, in my opinion, to have a script that could use a little editing instead of one that completely bamboozles the moviegoer. Also, the repetitiveness of the movie (such as the ape-lizards which seemed to be everywhere) seemed to be because of SFX short-budgeting -- they had a limited creature budget. As I said above I think it's a little unfair to criticize the movie for being low-budget, when on the whole it looks pretty good.I was glad to see a B-style sci-fi movie, since its been months since the 2005 Doctor Who series finished. It had big sets, famous second-tier actors, and lots of SFX. The plot was miles better than the last four or five Star Trek movies, to say nothing of Alien v. Predator, and it's a shame that it will do so much more poorly just because it doesn't have a \"franchise\" attached to it.",

            "content": "Deja vue. As a child in the 60s I read a Sci-Fi comic book (based on Ray Bradbury's short story of the same name) that had the characters traveling back in time and hunting dinosaurs from an elevated path. Since dinosaurs went extinct, killing them could be done without hurting the sequence of events that brought us to where we are today. During one expedition a member of the team stepped off the path and killed a butterfly. Because that species did not go extinct and was a pollinator of other plant species, the sequence of events was broken. This started a chain of events that changed the entire course of the world, and mankind's, history. Plants were not pollinated, generations of evolution were lost, forests that should have been weren't. I've never forgotten that first experience with what was termed chaos theory and the youthful realization of the fragility of our timeline. In fact, that comic book was the last moldy one I threw out some 20 years ago. I remember reading it one last time before it went into the bag. This movie brings that basic story to the screen with some wonderful enhancements. While I could debate the obvious flaws in the story, it is still compelling to those that would choose to understand what we call time. I would say that time and space cannot be separated and that backward time travel includes the space of the entire universe. Undoing the movement of the entire universe is inconceivable. This is why some choose to play with multi-verses and all timelines existing simultaneously. But it is wonderful that man can even conceive of time-space and what could be.",

            "content": "USAToday.com called it: \"A story that is a pale imitation of a Michael Crichton novel.\" The Los Angeles Times said: \"The picture looks as murky as its story line\u0085 and most everything on the screen looks patently fake.\" CNN.com remarked: \"'Sound of Thunder,' smell of garbage.\" But Variety.com summed it up nicely: \"Every bit as bad as advance buzz has indicated...\" And then some.I first heard about this movie prior to its release on TVGuide.com's \"Coming Soon\" section. The single-sentence description suggesting a plot around time traveling safaris for the sole purpose of killing a Tyrannosaurus Rex that was going to die anyhow just seemed, well\u0085 a bit loopy, at least for a major motion picture. So I read the short story by Ray Bradbury, upon which the movie was supposedly based and, even though I had a hard time visualizing such a story expanded to 2 hours of running and screaming on the big screen, hoped for the best. After hearing and reading all of the dramatically poor reviews by movie critics and fans alike, curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to know if it was really that bad.It is. It is every bit as bad. In fact, a half-hour into the film, I was completely alone, free to yawn, stretch, scream at the top of my lungs and move about the theater.The basic premise is relatively simple, as it was a short story to begin with. In the year 2055, time travel has been patented by a greedy businessman played by none other than Sir Ben Kingsley (as he's credited), sporting a white wig that one movie critic likened to a lump of cotton candy, and yet another likened to a massive White Persian cat perched atop his head. I prefer the latter analogy. Time Safari, Inc. offers rich people a chance to travel 65 million years into the past to kill \u2013 not hunt \u2013 dinosaurs already predestined to die at the same place and time. As long as the merry band of time travelers remains on a path resembling transparent liquid metal that hovers above the terrain and do not interfere with the environment in any way, history and evolution as we know it are still preserved. Of course, the rigid controls supposed to be in effect are futile against a cowardly inept rich snob who carelessly stomps on a butterfly.The Butterfly Effect is, of course, the theory that maintains that a butterfly's wings flapping on one side of the earth could eventually cause a hurricane thousands of miles away. In the movie, the effect causes ripples in time, i.e. a tidal wave in the form of a series of 'Time Waves' that exactly resemble and mimic the aquatic version, visibly sweeping over the Windy City at distant intervals and knocking the main characters around in Matrix-like slow motion shots. Immediately following each successive time wave, hideous distortions abound in the form of primordial and deadly vegetation, half-primate, half-reptilian creatures with the need to feed (on humans), giant reptilian bats, and not to be outdone, a brief cameo by the man-eating scarab beetles of 'The Mummy' fame. Seriously.But enough about the pathetically stupid script. I wanted to know if the special effects were really as bad as people claimed. At one point, the camera tracks the two main stars, Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack, as they cross a busy futuristic street in one of the worst on-screen examples of green-screen effects I have ever witnessed in a big budget movie. I can't readily explain it with words \u2013 when you see it, you're simply distracted by how fake it is\u0085 the rendering, even the lighting contrast. In another reckless green-screen scene, Burns and co-star Jemima Rooper, whose native British accent keeps resurfacing throughout the movie, are supposed to be walking along a sidewalk and immersed in conversation, but are instead spitting out stupid dialogue while obviously stationary on a moving walkway. It's as if someone pulled the plug on the computers before CGI rendering was completed.In Sum, 'A Sound of Thunder' is every bit as bad as the bad reviews have claimed. The script is stupid. The effects are deplorable. The acting? Who cares. It may not be nearly as bad as ''Manos' The Hands of Fate,' but I would definitely consider it to be the worst movie of 2005 (thus far), and the worst movie I ever paid to see in a theater.",

There is one scene where two people are walking down the street, and it is in the future, so instead of making futuristic cars, they just computerized the entire scene, beside the actors. If is glaringly obvious that they are walking on a treadmill and everything else is filled in around them. There now that that is out of the way, if you can ignore this flaw, as I have, then watch this, it is a great story. This is based off a short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury, written in the fifties. A company has developed time travel and sends groups of people back to kill an Allosaurus as the ultimate trophy hunt. There are a lot of safeguards in place, because if you inadvertently kill something that was not meant to die in the past, it could have massive ramifications on the future or our character's present. In fact I do believe that it is from the written story that we got the phrase \"butterfly effect\". Well something goes terribly wrong on one of the safaris and this sends shock waves of change to the future and it is up to a small group of people to go back in time and try to prevent the event that lead to the drastic changes happening in their present. This is a great story, as I said previously and it is told quite well. It does do some justice to the story, though there are differences.",

            "content": "I wonder how the scriptwriters failed to miss this blindingly obvious plot hole, but I really do have to point it out. The premise for this movie is the discovery of time travel, and a rather original way to make it lucrative. By sending time tourists back in time to hunt Tyrannosauruses, the company is providing a unique and profitable adventure. However, they constantly remind their patrons not to touch anything, not to stray off the path, and not to influence in any way the past for fear of altering the future.As explained in the movie, killing a single bee 65 million years ago, could deprive a flower from being pollinated, and hence not provide an animal with food, then a prey from a meal, etc. etc. all the way down the 65 million year old road. Of course, any animal will simply eat the flower next to it if one didn't get pollinated, but that is not the plot hole to which I am referring. This concept of causing vast changes via a very small and insignificant event, is called the Butterfly Effect. And this movie bashes you on the head with that analogy.In order to dramatically alter the future, one of the characters actually steps on and kills a butterfly (gee, how obvious a Butterfly Effect is that?), thereby changing the past and violently causing the downfall of mankind. That may be a bit of a stretch (to say the least), but there was also the matter of the volcano. The company picked a moment in time where a Tyrannosaurus Rex gets trapped in a tar pit and dies anyway, therefore shooting it first with ice bullets in no way alters its fate and thus avoids any conundrums for the future. Also, they picked a moment 5 minutes before a volcano blows in order to provide a margin of safety, should anything go wrong or get left behind, the volcano will wipe it out anyway. There is even a dramatic scene with the hero returning to the present day in the nick of time, just as the destruction wrought by the volcano arrives to wipe out everything in the past. Do you see the problem here? How in the world could stepping on a single butterfly one minute before it was to be incinerated by a volcano have any impact at all on the future? Even if some butterfly-eating predator was deprived of a meal, the movie demonstrated in intimate detail that the volcano wiped out everything, including the butterfly and anything within 100 miles that was planning on eating it! So a butterfly living one minute less than fate had provided for it is supposed to turn the Earth into a paradise of monkey-lizards? That makes no sense at all! People who see this movie are expected to be pretty loose with the plot, after all they have to accept time travel and all the conundrums that evokes. But I still find it amazing that the single event on which the entire movie is premised, is so fundamentally flawed.Other reviewers have commented on the fantastically bad special effects, but at least one of them provided an explanation. Apparently, the production company decided to screen test the movie prior to putting the finishing touches on the effects. When the abysmally bad response came back, they threw in the towel rather than throw good money after bad, and the effects were never improved upon. Too bad, the dinosaur wasn't that bad, neither was the actual event which projected them back in time. There was a hilarious green-screen on the sidewalk scene which was so poorly done it was incredibly obvious that the actors were walking on a treadmill. A few finishing touches would certainly have improved the whole, but the plot would still have bite marks large enough to fall through. Ha ha.",

My first comment would have been...\"with a bigger budget they really could have done something.\" But they had an enormous budget and obviously blew it somewhere. With a depthy storyline written by the master of science fiction Ray Bradbury they had a promising event in front of them and although it's watchable, it falls so far short of what it could have been.Mistake number 1...leading man Edward Burns. I'm not dumping on Burns he might be a decent character actor but he just can't pull off leading man. His rather drab and dreary performance has no emotion and is definitely not powerful enough to carry the film. As far as his film career goes he always has someone there to lead the way. He isn't the only problem in casting by any means. Catherine McCormack plays the leading lady and her performance is as drab as Burns' is. No one stands out in the cast and no one is truly watchable with perhaps the exception of Sir Ben Kingsley because I mean come on he's Ben Kingsley although I am beginning to wonder about his decisions. First Bloodrayne, now this. Nonetheless he stands out in his performance as greedy and power hungry billionaire Charles Hatton. His role isn't entirely big but he is in it enough to make a difference.The time traveling aspect is a joke considering they only ever show the same scene of a prehistoric world. Their world which changes with each passing moment due to a single event in the past is interesting and quite cool and even the monsters that different animals become are interesting and terrifying but the special effects are so bad...I don't even know where to begin. They would have done better to hang plastic monsters from string. On a budget of over 50 million dollars there is no excuse to have special effects that look purposely like a joke. The story is done and over with far too quickly and the characters have absolutely no depth. The film isn't disastrous...I've seen worse...it's at least at the level of an average TV film and in fact if it were made for TV I might give it more leeway but as far as science fiction movies go...this one was disappointing at best. 6/10",

I can kind of understand the last point though as the dialogue is absurd, it was difficult to not laugh out loud at how toe-curlingly cheesy a lot of the lines were, so it was no wonder that the actors couldn't do anything with it. As said also the story and concept could have been really interesting in the right hands, sadly however nothing excites and the concept is introduced and told in such an outlandish manner it doesn't even make sense.

Hatton's lead scientist/adventurer guide is the solemn (and blank faced) Travis Ryer (Burns proving to be more plastic in each role with barely a flicker of emotion and his husky whispered voiced barely registers any interest \u0096 which is a bad sign for a viewer who will realize this is an apt metaphor for the proceedings to come) who has grown weary of his job and is intrigued when a fellow scientist, Sonia Rand (McCormack who deserves better than this), a former colleague of Hatton's who is hellbent on exposing his not-so conscious efforts in destroying the affects of his tinkering with mankind's journey etc.Naturally one jaunt leads to the 'uh-oh' moment when a glitch in the armature holds up the hunt and a client literally steps on a butterfly with catastrophic results when they return. What enfolds is a boring, badly designed effort largely to the thankless screenplay by Thomas Dean Donnelly & Jason Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier with the usual dialogue more or less along the lines of \"Run!\" and \"Oh my God!\" etc. and some ludicrous plot points (so Chicago is over-run with monstrous creatures that are a hybrid of lizard and baboon! And huge thickets of unsavory jungles) yet the edifice that houses the technology for the time leap remains more or less in tact are just tips of the iceberg. The CGI is very bad and at times laughable and the fact that director Hyams hasn't had a hit in decades and is becoming a sad hack at that AND the fact this film has been on a shelf for nearly two years only goes to show that any risk of ripping off \"Jurassic Park\" has a fate worse than screwing with Mother Nature: an empty theater.",

What potential there was for a film of this story. Think of the possible outcomes: Columbus never sails, and America is discovered by another nation; Germany wins World War Two and the nations are ruled by Nazis. So many possibilities and these so-called \"film makers\" went for the quick and cheap monster FX and twisted plot lines. Perhaps, like the two \"Incredible Hulk\" films, someone with half a clue will make a \"Sound of Thunder\" picture that actually reflects Bradbury's original writing genius.",

Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct.(Comment) The movie was a little slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future were silly looking. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.

            "content": "The reviews, professional and otherwise, were terrible, expecting the worst (while hoping for a few chuckles) I sat down to watch this movie.The plot concerns a futuristic corporation which send you back in time to hunt dinosaurs. When you go you have to stay on the path they lay out since you have to be certain you're not going to change anything. Of course something goes wrong and the future is changed, not all at once mind you. Time waves begin radiating out from the \"event\" and changing things in stages. The movie then becomes a race to figure out how to change things back.How is the movie? The performances are uneven, with Ed Byrnes being much too bland for an action lead. The dialog is occasional witty (on purpose). The plot is a mess if you think about it. The visual effects, especially in the first half are terrible. Ultimately its a bigger budgeted version of My Science Project which cause great waves of \"I've seen this before\" to ripple through out the entire movie.My feelings for the movie as a whole is rather odd. The first half of this movie is dreadfully dull. Not only is it dull it makes no internally logical sense. I really can't suggest anyone watch the first half of the movie... The second half of the film on the other hand is actually quite good in a low budget cheesy special effect B-Movie sort of way. What can I say I love monsters, and here there be monsters aplenty. What makes the second half work so well is that the movie is essentially a drive to get back to the time machine as time forces evolution to take a different course and spawns all sorts of new monsters. Its great fun, especially if you divorce it from the first part of the movie. No, the visual effects aren't great, but who cares, its just fun to watch the running battle.If you can wait for cable and come in 40 or 45 minutes in you stand a pretty good chance of enjoying yourself, especially if you fill in what went before you tuned in in your own way.5 out of 10 for a B-movie monster filled second half.",

Doom is not much of a story compared to this one. I mean dinosaurs, the future, time travel, and it is interesting.

From his fertile imagination comes this short story he wrote which was eventually entitle \" A Sound of Thunder. \" In order to understand what the title means, all one needs to do is watch this film. Bradbury tells the story set well into the future about a scientist named Travis Ryder (Edward Burns) who has completed a Time Travel machine which allows anyone to travel back into the period of the Dinosaurs, with the sole purpose of killing one of those unique creatures. The dangers of this futuristic machine which could have a profound effect on the history of Mankind, have been exhaustively explained by Sonia Rand, inventor of the time machine, (Catherine McCormack), but have largely been ignored. This oversight was due largely by the rich financier of the project, Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley). The drama of this incredible film is due in part to the special effects crew which give excitement and terrifying believability to this frighting movie. The cast is remarkable and give an exceptional presence to this screen Gem. Hats off to Ben Kingsley for a convincing performance.

            "content": "Ray Bradbury's original story, on which this film was based, was lean and short. It's the future and science has so arranged things that time travel to the past is now possible. Men can pay to go back on a guided hunt, traveling on a cleared and sterile path, and kill a dinosaur that is already slated to die naturally at a given point in time and space. No one must step off the path, however, for fear of altering the environment in ways that might affect the future. In the story, the protagonist is a guide who takes hunters on an expedition. Everything is rosy in this future. A wise and compassionate man has just been elected head of state. During this safari one of the hunters sets foot off the path for a moment, and when they return to their present a dictatorship is in power. A butterfly is found on the hunter's heel.Bradbury's story was the first popular exploration of the butterly effect in the fourth dimension, one might say. It might have made a tidy, short movie. Instead, as is becoming standard in Hollywood, it's bloated, confusing, and not much more than an excuse for special effects involving still more slimy, carnivorous monsters -- flora AND fauna -- probably sparked by the CGIs in \"Jurassic Park.\" It wastes no time before becoming banal.Take the title. \"A Sound of Thunder.\" What does it mean in the context of this movie? Absolutely nothing. The title is generically ominous. It might just as easily have been \"Days of Darkness\" or \"Guns of Tomorrow.\" The very beginning and the very end reprise Bradbury's events but in between there is so much mumbo jumbo about time travel and time ripples and magnetic slingshots (\"Better pray this backup generator works\") that all logic is lost -- not that it ever really mattered to the bricoleurs who threw this piece of conventional junk together. What characterization there is makes no sense either. The first people to be eaten are the sweaty villains and the saintly minority-group members, one of whom actually says, \"Forget about me and save yourselves.\" The special effects move from one set piece to the next without any particular reasons.The special effects are, however, reasonably well done, though pointless. The only engaging thing in the film that doesn't have anything to do with Bradbury's original are some sparklers thrown into the script and presumably overlooked by those in charge of turning this into a thoroughly unimaginative and undemanding amuse-bouche for adolescents. A computer expert tells Burns, \"If I can do this I should be able to slingshot you back to Point X.\" Burns: \"I'm not keen on that 'should'. Can you do it?\" Computer expert: \"I'm not certain.\" Burns: \"Can you say ANYTHING for certain?\" Computer expert: \"Yes. I can say for certain that I can't say anything for certain.\" (Here, the audience is presumably going to tear out its collective hair and shout, \"What's THAT supposed to mean????\") If Hollywood continues on this debasement trajectory, and if we were magnetically slingshotted into the near future, we should expect to find nothing more in the theaters than compilation films consisting of completely independent action episodes full of dinosaurs, transformers, guns that shoot pellets of frozen nitrogen, severed body parts, disasters, and wrecked cities with small deserted libraries where books full of stories like Ray Bradbury's lie crumbling and unread.",

In an attempt to fix the damage done, a seasoned time scout (Edward Burns) teams with the inventor of the technology (Catherine McCormack).The premise is pretty good and engaging. It may have a few flaws in it but it could still make for an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder fails to really hook the audience in. It suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself way too seriously so it's hard to actually have any fun while watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the film's biggest problem. The were more plot holes than expected and the movie was kind of lazy in explaining things. I was hoping for a more in depth look into \"the butterfly effect\" but the film was more escapist fun than anything else. That's okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening. However, all the fun this film offered was unintentional and lame. There were a few scenes that kept me entertained but I was pretty bored.The acting isn't much better since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else. The only person that gave a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the film enjoyable and he seemed to be having the most fun as well. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and bland. I don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. However, he could make for a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was just really annoying and not very believable. I haven't really seen her in anything else but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad performances though most of them are relatively unknown so it shouldn't effect their careers too much.Looking at the message boards, most people are complaining about the special effects. There's no way to sugarcoat them and they are terrible. All the dinosaurs look really bad. The Gibbon-lizards (part monkey, part dino), while a creative idea, become stale after awhile and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. The green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. I was really wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to accomplish here. He fails to deliver the suspense, action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit. For the most part though, the film is pretty harmless and it's far from the worst movie of 2005. Hopefully they will remake this film in the future. There is potential in this project but for now this is the best we got. In the end, unless curiosity gets the better of you, there is no reason to see A Sound of Thunder. Rating 4/10",

I don't expect the filmmakers to posit ground-breaking theorems that would realistically explain HOW time travel works, I just expect them to be logical and careful as they play in the arena. I was shocked I had missed this film - based as it is on the seminal Bradbury short story that explored (and coined) the butterfly effect of alterations in the past having repercussions in the future. But this film is a blandly soggy mess; seemingly the product of some serious over-development as a clever short story was forced into all the \"hit film\" boxes the producers could check off. Part Sci Fi, part Indiana Jones, part Jurassic Park; but what they left out of the equation were logic and intelligence. A little research turned up the production problems that resulted in the horrible digital effects (basically just pre-viz or old video game quality) so I won't trash them further (although in ANY world the actors painfully \"fake-walking\" in place while the green screen image scrolls behind them would be laughable) but the blatantly stupid way the whole butterfly effect is dealt with (\"Time Waves will look cool!\" someone must have said) and having first rate actors spew third rate dialogue does nothing but condemn the film to the heap of Time-Travel failures.

However good Ed Burns is as the lead, you are never convinced by the story as it is full of clich\u00e9s and seemingly tacked-on action sequences. They get chased by monsters for so much of the movie you start to ask yourself it they got confused between the sci-fi and horror genres. The special effects are plentiful, however they are atrocious, fake and gratuitous in the sense that the camera lingers on CG monsters and landscapes for so long that it seems perhaps they wanted to show off how much money they spent. But it adds nothing to the otherwise weak plot, which - now that I think of it - has a simplistic comic-book quality to it. But if the latter were completely true it should be more surreal and not have so much awful superfluous dialogue that actually just sounds like it is set on repeat ('you don't know what you are messing with in time travel..' and the like). If you happen to have nothing else to see, rent Timecop. Yes, this movie is that bad. P.S. Ben Kingsley, why did you do this movie?

I've even written a few short stories using the theme myself. And also because an SF movie with CGI is always a good way to spend a couple of hours. Sorry, I should amend that - is ALMOST always a good way.Therefore I so wanted this film to be good. I pleaded and begged it, but to no avail. I've reread this story several times since I first read it as a teenager, and the Ray Bradbury Theatre version is OK, although filmed in that weird American style of the early eighties, as if the sound's been stuck on later and with an odd colour shift.But it was so bad it was laughable. I couldn't give a rat's arse for the CGI - if a film is good it doesn't matter - but the insane contrivances drove me mad. I overlooked the whole way the team was worked, and only mildly cringed at Ben Kingsley taking yet another nonsense film role like Species. The tripe he came out with was pathetic and actually beyond clich\u00e9d - not a phrase I thought I would ever use, and although admittedly he tried to inject humour into his ridiculous lines, ultimately it was a pained delivery. But then all the characters were cardboard, and I mean no disrespect to the actors in anything except their choice of employer.But in memory of the great Mr B, I was still willing to give it a further go. So I also let pass the blatant contradiction at the very foundation of the film - the bit not written by Ray - they never quite seemed to understand the different scenarios of Time Travel at all - can you change the past (Terminator) or not? (Time Machine)But added to this the time waves (although Zemeckis used a variation of them in Back to the Future - he made it seem convincing in Christopher Lloyd's able hands) were just silly, knocking people flying, having huge trees appear (sometimes simultaneously with the waves, sometimes not), without destroying any buildings or chucking any animals around: what was all that about, except special effects?And the combat was so sad (the big eel-thing. I don't, I think, need to say more). And the way they were continually chased by steroid-ridden mandrills, and stupid giant bats (just shoot it!) And almost all the dialogue. And was there supposed to be some chemistry there? Missed that one. And the turning a university particle accelerator into a time warp device accurate to 1 minute in 150 million years and didn't they appear right there but back in time, so how did trooping across the city put him back at the T Rex?....The more I think about this film, the more I am coming to the conclusion that I have probably seen a worse film, but I can't think what it is at the moment. For these reasons and more, I had to come here and rant about it.Sorry about that.",

Is it just a matter of being able to see passed all the things that make it bad? Is every movie neither good nor bad but just a movie? Is it all a matter of opinion, as in 'one mans passion is another man's poison'? Perhaps. I love b-grade schlock. I'd rearrange heaven and earth just to watch a Godzilla marathon or some other sci-fi junk from the late 50s and early sixties. You give me a lemon movie and I'll make lemon-butter to put on my popcorn. In short, I love this type of unobtanium motion picture. And yet I hated this crappy re-imaging of Bradbury's brilliant short story. I not only hated it, I violently hated it. You see my dilemma? So what makes a film, a bad film, even when you like bad films? Great expectations.Go with me here, In this particular case, A Sound of Thunder, is a very badly put together piece of non-film that a few Hollywood producers vomited up one late night after too much partying. Thinking along the lines of 'Hey, we'll take a beloved story that sci-fi geeks will want to see and turn it into a super-duper high tech time-traveling piece with sexy stars and big action scenes of Chicago under siege\"The idea then was passed on to a couple of hack writers (that's okay, I like hack writers) I don't like hack writers, however, when they think they're smarter than the original source material. In this case Ray Bradbury, a giant in the storytelling industry, a man who knows how to tell a story. The decision to augment the story to make it more exotic was its first great failure. Sure I love schlock but you better not mess with established points or messages that an established story already told -- some thirty years ago. The hack writers (3 - one who wrote porn, no less) simply can't compare to Bradbury's original point, which has been removed completely. This is the second great failure. Bradbury wrote the story to make a point. Without the point, what is left?So the producer has a script, a budget and two actors who I know little about, Ed Burns seems to me the poor man's Matthew McConaughey, and I don't know the chick from Adam. (Incidently the writers, Donnelly and Oppenheimer wrote Sahara (a movie I loved because it was b-grade adventure schlock) but please keep in mind, an additional two other writers came on board after their tenure, and the darn thing was based on yet other brilliant writer Mr. Clive Cussler's work anyway. And Mr. Kingsley who was roped into this production when other, more competent contributors were in charge but subsequently deserted the sinking ship like rats before principal photography began. Kingsley is the only person who doesn't suffer in this movie. Would you like some wine to go with that cheesy performance, Mr. K? But that's okay. He played the character as if he knew he was stuck in the middle of Chesse Country, Wisconsin. Ed Burns isn't an action hero. Newsflash, Ed Burns isn't much of an actor. And to top it off Ed Burns isn't aging well. I digress.What makes a bad movie a good movie to make fun of and laugh at or a bad movie so bad you know you've crossed into a zone frequented by the likes of TV show directors, writers and actors of your local access cable TV late-night shows.Is this all just about what you like? Is there no scale for what is bad, bad-bad or really bad? Can Hollywood spin crap on a stick and assume zombie-walking teenagers will to go to it whether it's good or bad, because that's what teenagers do. And they defend their choices with the vim and vigor of a bad actress/singer who can't do either well. Even if it's called the Night of the Bad cherry alien pom-pom team from Planet X.So that's it -- this niche audience doesn't care, it likes what it likes and that is the end. Even so, This movie made only 1.8 million dollars, in 5 wks. It cost 80 million and probably another 20 million here and there with what little adverts they used. In the final analysis the movie sucks because it lacks a story, real characters, direction, visuals, and has loads of boring acting -- but wait there's more -- giant plot holes, mistakes, bad green screen scenes, no point, a bankruptcy mid-way through a flood in the Baltic country it was filmed in -- But wait there's more -- special effects that were not finished, and even if they were they wouldn't have been that good anyway and two strikes for having Ed Burns in it.So how is this any different than say -- anything Roger Corman did or any sci-fi flick from the 50's and 60's. How you ask? Simple.

If you go back in time, and accidentally squash a butterfly, all of history is going to be ripped apart, of course, for the worst. But it's okay to go back in time and shoot a T-Rex for kicks, which is going to be killed anyway in five minutes by an erupting volcano! But somehow the butterfly is going to escape the same fate because its death-by-human-foot ends up changing the genetic code of all living things! It's tad bit hard to believe that in five minutes a mere BUTTERFLY could fly out of the path of tons and tons of smothering ash! Please spare me! Such stupidity can get very annoying to the adult mind.Had the storyline been in the slightest way plausible this could have been a fun movie. As is, children will enjoy the special affects and its many dreamlike scenes. It's also a real hoot to see what kind of creatures humans end-up turning into! With all the thousands upon thousands of published short stories and novels Hollywood could draw from, why pick something as godforsaken awful as this lame story! By doing so, Hollywood is starting to give Science Fiction a bad name! If you're a filmmaker or screenwriter looking for some good sci-fi material all you need to start with is one outstanding book: \"Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,\" edited by Neil Barron.

            "content": "This film was rooted deep in production problems, and at long last it has finally made it to screen. I got to admit I watched it because of the tacky theatrical poster of the dinosaur, less sophisticated than its US version of a fossilized butterfly. While I thought this would be another Jurassic Park, and kept my expectations low, it turned out to be a jolly entertaining movie, though a bit formulaic.Based on a short story by Ray Bradbury, A Sound of Thunder is set in 2055 Chicago, where scientists have harnessed the power of time travel, and corporations capitalizing on the technology for the rich to embark on a Time Safari, going 65 million years back in time to hunt dinosaurs, in a controlled environment.Wait, won't this disrupt the space-time continuum? Sure, and the movie tries to make up for its intelligence by explaining that only dinosaurs which are about to die anyway are hunted, and at the location of their death. Hence, the same scenario is being replayed each time for different groups of tourists. There are also strict rules involved to manage the risks involved, like not to touch anything, not to step out of their predetermined pathways, not to bring anything back, and even their weapons won't fire until it is safe to do so.But as all things go, nothing is perfect in this world, and something does go wrong, which led to special effects laden \"Time Waves\" which sweep across the world, each wave bringing the next change in evolution. Futuristic Chicago gets swamped with powerful and massive trees, and new breeds of animals (I like the dinosaur-gorilla-lizard hybrid) are born, and they start to wreak havoc (nothing new here) on all of mankind.So it is up to our motley bunch of scientists, led by Edward Burns, to sort things out and bring Earth back to normal, providing us lots of the same usual chases on foot and vehicles, sacrifices, shootouts and deaths to those who are unethical. More sophisticated themes are attempted, like corporate greed, corruption and chaos theory, but these are quickly glossed over in favour of getting on with the action.Surprisingly, given the budget, the special effects for 2055 Chicago looked kinda fake, especially the cars, which are packed bumper to bumper and moving at constant speed for some reason. I suppose most of the SFX budget went into the rendering of the new hybrid of animals. The most notable A-list name is Sir Ben Kingsley, though I'm not sure why he would associate himself with his movie. Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack are the only other \"stars\" of the show, and it's a good guess that the unknowns get dispatched one after another.As clich\u00e9 as this may sound, leave your brains at the door if you want to enjoy this popcorn flick. Entertaining enough in that sense.",

Adding to that is you don't remember what happened if no one corrects the error making it intriguing as time travel can be. Enjoy also so fierce creatures that we simply do not have too much defense against and their will to live at all costs.

In one scene, they couldn't sync up the speed of two characters walking with the speed of the sidewalk going by. There were scenes in which you could clearly see where the set ended and the green screen picked up. If this was a big budget film, then I pity the fool that funded it. The directing was also awful.

            "content": "I am a HUGE fan of time-travel movies. I love the Back to the Future Trilogy, Butterfly Effect, The Time Machine (the book, the old movie, and even the new version.) Thus, I have come to insist on certain logical and semi-scientific rules in any time travel movie.1. When you change the past, and come back to the present, the people in the new present have ***NO IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAS CHANGED*** Only you, and anyone else you were traveling with, will have any idea that things are different/better/worse. This is shown CONSISTENTLY throughout Back to the Future I and II and Butterfly Effect. When the main character changes his past and comes back to the new present, no one else has ANY memory of the present that he/she lived in. (Marty in BTTF, or Evan in BE.) Yet, A Sound of Thunder fails completely on this very important concept. The basic plot of this illogical escapade has a rich man who has discovered a (stolen the) way to go back to the past and gives rich people a way to feel a real thrill of death by giving them guns and having them shoot down dinosaurs. Of course, this is really all planned and seemingly safe. The dinosaur is always the exact same Allosaurus, who would end up being killed by a volcano just minutes after the tourists shoot him down. As long as it dies the same way every time, and no one steps off the path, everything should be fine.Of course, one time, something happens. Here's the big spoiler. The fake-macho client ends up stepping on A BUTTERFLY. How creative and insightful.What ends up happening, is somehow, a clumsy person goes back in time, and steps on one butterfly which would have been killed by an exploding volcano anyway. Yet this somehow changes the cycle of evolution drastically.So, you would expect, based on the logic of time travel movies, that these people would come back and if there were humans, no one would remember anything about the past.Yet instead, everything seems normal right away. But that night, a \"time wave\" washes over the world. The next day, it's 70 degrees in Chicago and fish are beaching themselves on Lake Michigan. Plants are growing through 3 foot walls. More waves come, the next makes vines grow all over Chicago, the next sends a bunch of bugs to our heroes. and by the next wave, humans have definitely lost control over Chicago... they are being poisoned and turned crazy by some sort of semi- intelligent vine and roving bands of \"gorilla dinosaurs\" hunt humans.This makes no sense. Time doesn't change in \"waves.\" It changes suddenly. There's no delayed reaction. That is illogical and inconsistent with every other time travel movie.The special effects for the time waves are decent, the waves themselves also provide a bit of excitement, the feeling of what changes will appear next. However, the futuristic cars look quite ugly and fake. Half the time the setting feels like it is intentionally B-movie, going for a comedic effect, and yet this has a big budget...The acting is decent and the characters aren't annoying one-dimensional like some films, but it is really a pretty bad movie.Yes, I know this is an adaptation of a Ray Bradbury novel. I can't compare it to the novel because I have never read the book but I can say that as a movie standing on its own, it is poor.If you want a good time travel movie, rent one of the Back to the Future films.If you're looking for \"How do little things change the world\" movie, rent Butterfly Effect.Or rent all four of the above-mentioned movies. It'll be cheaper than taking everyone out to the movies. You can even buy a big bag of grocery store candy for the kids and make your own popcorn.I WORK at a movie theater, so when I say don't see something at the theaters, DON'T SEE IT AT THE THEATERS.",

Even though the company has taken precautions to not alter even the smallest things in the past in order to not affect their present time in unexpected ways, something goes wrong and strange \"time waves\" start destroying the society. A small group of time travel experts (notably played by Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack) begins a mission to set things straight again by making even more time jumps. Subsequently they must fight many monstrous creatures on their dangerous journey.The interesting premise is based on a short story by the famous science fiction writer Ray Bradbury but something went horribly wrong with the film version: the movie fails on so many levels that it's not even funny. Most notably, for such a wannabe-spectacle film, the SFX are terrible. The CGI creatures and urban landscapes in the background couldn't possibly look any phonier. I feel like it's almost an insult to the audience to ask them to take such a pixel-fest seriously \u2013 if they didn't have the money or skills to make the effects look convincing, they could have just used the CGI more sparingly to enhance atmospheres and such; but no, they went for the in-your-face action direction.Besides the effects, the writing is also poor. Since the movie never bothers to make the characters feel like real people and we get to learn very little about their pasts or personalities, how could we care about what happens to them? To me, they all were nothing but disposable monster food. The bland actors can't bring any life to the empty shells of people they're supposed to play either. The only exception could be the silly wig-wearing Ben Kingsley who gets to deliver a semi-funny rant to some disgruntled customers of his company.Even if the characters and effects are lousy, there could still be a little sense of adventure and suspense in the mix, but no luck on that front either. There's no feel of tensions rising, time running out or danger lurking around the corner. The pseudo-scientific babbling about the Heisenberg principle and zero-tolerance provide no food for thought for any fan of hard sci-fi, so I'm really struggling to think of any group of people who I could recommend this film to. Only the most undemanding action-adventure fans might like it for light entertainment; for anyone else it's just depressingly disappointing.",

Any 7 years old could have handled the time paradox better than these inept paperback writers.So listen up, you stupids:1) how do you expect the audience to care about characters when we are told very explicitly and barely 10 minutes after the sh*t started to hit the fan that they will all be resurrected as if by magic in the end? 2) how dare you expect us to forget everything that has been written in even the lamest stories about time travel, like a bunch of people traveling over and over at the exact same time & space coordinates without ever meeting copies of themselves - *except* when the scenarist needs the trick to finish the story? 3) where in hell did the inhabitants of the mega-city go? Time waves leave only registered actors in place or something? 4) The flick is supposed to be all about suspense, and yet the incredibly stupid scenario shuffles the cards at random every 10 minutes or so. In order for the suspense to build up, we need to imagine what could happen next. Sending one \"time wave\" after the other just flushes the result of the previous 10 minutes down the drain, you see?5) time travel limited to a safari business on a planet wide scale? Please, pull two neurons together. What was acceptable in Bradbury's very short story becomes an insult to the most obliging viewer's intelligence when stretched into a one hour and a half story.All this crap could have been watchable, would the actors have treated it with the contempt it deserved. Instead of that we are served one first grade helping of plain, uninspired acting if I ever saw one. No trace of humor (intentional or not) whatsoever. Only the usual black guy doing his 9 to 5 comic relief job (and getting killed first, what a coincidence).With all the CGI and material there was potential for a more than acceptable movie. I mean, there are quite a few little gems out there that were put together with a couple of computers and a few tons of plywood, fabric and ketchup. Many people complain about CGI and effects. I think they have cost a packet compared to a lot of other movies, only they were, as the rest, horribly over-used and utterly wasted.

I got what I was looking for.-- Warning: Mild Spoilers Ahead -- One of the most laughable aspects of the movie was the excessive and quite possibly the worst green-screen use I've ever seen. Even for a movie that was supposed to be released in 2003, the special effects are ludicrous. Every scene that takes place outdoors in 2055 is green-screened in such a bad way that there's absolutely no way to cover it up. The cars look like they were designed by a 2 year old with a Lego set. The Allosaurus looks like it was pulled straight from a PlayStation 1 cut-scene movie, and the way it acts when things get screwy is hilarious. There is also no explanation of the solid water-like walkway, how in the hell the government would have ever passed a time travel device that could be so dangerous, how Dr. Lucas manages to avoid the plant that grabs his gun, how the buildings were destroyed, etc. Pop-corn flick all the way.The only reason I have given this film a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the apelizards, and IMDb has a picture of one on the Photos page. Other than that, the creators of the movie give you one beastie for each area of earth: air, land, water, and plants. People die, of course, in a way that is pure Hollywood, and you'll understand what I mean if you see this piece of trash.Overall, the movie was made to entertain, not to make you think. Yes, there is some easily forgettable dialog involving apparently deep scientific theories, but they only scratch the surface of interest, and they are quickly wrapped up and brushed away for \"action\" to keep the audience from thinking too much about the fact that time travel as we now know it is basically impossible.

Not in this movie.The funny thing is that the story couldn't be worse, but it is almost over-shadowed by the terrible effects, the brutal acting and retarded dialog.If I see any of the stars, producers or the director of this film walking down the street I will punch them in the mouth...and that includes the chicks.",

I read through many of the reviews of this movie. I have found that a host of individuals have chosen to put the effort of this movie down so that there is not an ounce of redemption for this movie.This is a testament to the intrinsic truth of the first words in this review. I was one of those among the first who rejected this story upon the premise that it was not as beautiful as Bradbury had conceived it. So I did not even bother to give it a chance.Today, after 8 years, I decided to watch it against my own best judgment.What I discovered was a compelling expansion of the original premise of that grand old story which stands as a jewel in Bradbury's crown.Friends, it was not as bad as they say. It was not even a disingenuous copy...it was fine, very fine. Nothing seemed to scream out that the story was not worthy of my time like so many other movies which make me squirm or groan.I enjoyed it, it was well done and might I say, that it turned out rather well considering that the makers of this film were shortchanged along the way, by the powers that grant funding for films to be made.Congratulations to all who worked on this effort.

One of the greatest inventions known to mankind, and a man uses it to make money, lots of money. The corruption of mankind is there, in the film, right from the start, told in an albeit poetic way, but tangible. We follow the increasingly worse corruption of nature, of its delicate balance throughout the story, until it becomes unavoidable.How much should humanity change nature? How much is too much? This is one of those rare films that succeed in being political, philosophical and interesting beyond belief without being preachy. And it deals with themes way too rare in today's films.A Sound of Thunder is the end of the world.",

A true adaption would only be only 20 minutes long, and has actually been attempted at least once before (on the new series _The Outer Limits_, I believe) that I've come across. To fill out a full feature film the plot would need to be expanded considerably, as is done here.The most unfortunate part of this movie is that it violates the key feature of the time-travel genre, which is a semi-confusing but internally consistent logic once characters start moving about in time. Unfortunately, this movie's bout with time travel is not confusing at all, and lacks internal consistency for reasons that will become clear once you see the film. This is a problem with the extension of the plot from the original short story, not with the short story itself (though the effects of time travel in that story are trite by modern standards).The special effects were barely of TV-quality, worse than one would see on those various dinosaur specials on The Discovery Channel or its ilk. The computer-generated backgrounds, which were done fairly well in _Sky Captain_, were lacking here in both imagination and quality.The film itself is also poorly filmed; it was very grainy and seems that it was filmed by a college student on their super-8 home camera.The actors, however, were reasonable, and I have no fault with them. I applaud the person doing the casting in not selecting from the usual bevy of \"beautiful people\".Overall, this movie is something that I'd expect to find on The SciFi Channel on Saturday afternoon, not something released as a feature film.On the other hand, I did give it a 5 out of 10 because despite all of its flaws, it's not a painful movie, but something that I wouldn't have minded watching if I were to have caught it on TV some afternoon on The SciFi Channel...",

Ray Bradbury's idea in this story is already famous, and many other movies and books have been made and written based on time loops, on going back and influencing your own and humanity's future by actions in the past ('Back to the Future' is one famous example).

Charles Hutton is head of the big corporation and will do anything to make his clients pay money. Travis Ryer works for him with the vision of collecting DNA samples form the past in order to bring the animals back to the future. The entire Time Safari deal is to go back in time to hunt a dinosaur. This, in itself, is dangerous. Only one person, Dr. Sonia Rand (palyed by Catherine McCormack) sees the possibility of changing the past and, thus changing the future.They story uses the simplest excuse for something to go wrong: neglect mixed with clumsiness. When an employee hurriedly tries to do his job, he does it wrong, which leads to a terrible mishap in their next \"time jump\". The group brings something from the past back to the future and everything goes from there.First off, when we originally travel 65 million years into the past, the special effects look worse than on a Playstation 2 game. What with all this wonderful technology, these effects are completely laughable.Next, the story is not very good. You would think that people would be a bit more careful about time travel than these people, or, at least, explain what they were doing. Rand (the jaunty doctor who believes she is the only one to have ever been cheated by the a big corporation) keeps saying that what Time Safari does is wrong and should be stopped. She continues to rant, not fully explaining what is going on, leaving you wondering whether you missed something or if the director cut out some crucial dialog.Throughout the movie, whenever more explanation is needed, they simply restate what they had previously said, in an even more complex way. And, in the reverse, when we get the point and we just want them to get on with it, such as in a chase scene, the characters go on and on.All in all, not very good. It's quite sad that the movie isn't very humorous, either. That is the angle the cast and crew should have gone for. Such as in Eight Legged Freaks the special effects weren't brilliant and the story was overdone, but it was a worthwhile movie because it was funny.",

Even though he has never made a great movie, Hyams has a creative mind and very photographic eye, his movies are always well shot. The stories he adapts are always interesting, and A Sound of Thunder is no exception but next to films like '2010', 'Outlander', and 'The Relic', it is a bit of a disappointment.The story plays with the classic sci-fi concept of time travel, and how changing one thing in the past can alter the future in ways unknown. Charles Hatton runs a time travel vacation program, which is making him a lot of money and he is happy, until one day, a trip to the Jurassic goes haywire, and shortly after the clients return, strange things begin to occur on Earth, a whole array of creatures start to roam the face of the planet as a result of a rupture in time which has thrown evolution into overdrive. Now It is up to Travis Ryer and Dr. Sonya Reed to save the planet.This is without doubt the largest most elaborate premise that Hyams has ever taken on, and unfortunately he does not have the resources to make it work. Bad special effects, lack of tension or excitement and overly rapid pacing, make the movie feel short, artificial and not very engaging. It is like watching another person play a video game. It keeps your attention but it never gets you involved. Edward Burns is the most superficial protagonist in a Hyams film to date (although he is better than Justin Chambers in 'The Musketeer') but only because he is an American playing an American, not a Frenchman. The weird and wonderful beasts he fights (despite looking utterly fake) have a more commanding screen presence.As a whole, A Sound of Thunder is mildly entertaining, but it doesn't amount to very much.",

            "content": "ASoT is a pretty entertaining adventure movie that is hopelessly ruined (at least for anyone that has an IQ) by the hideous lack of thought that went into the plot.Time-travel is not a new concept. Everyone has been doing movies and TV shows with that concept for countless years. All of them (well, maybe not all) have found ways to avoid or ignore the inherent paradox incumbent in the concept. ASoT not only fails to do this, but it's own (lack of) logic is violated during the course of the movie purely for the sake of \"making the story more exciting\", or some such idiotic notion. As a result, nobody could sit through this and not go \"Hang on a moment....\" Here's the problem....Time travelers go back to the Cretaceous period to kill a dinosaur - a sort of big game hunt for the rich. We learn that the dinosaur is fated to die at the exact spot that they kill it anyway, trapped in a tar pit, so they aren't changing history at all. The entire incident is carefully orchestrated so as to avoid any \"mishaps\" that might cause a paradox. Fair enough so far. The team return safely having dispatched the said dino.However, the next batch of rich, big game hunter-wannabees that go back in time, go back to the exact same time and place and kill the exact same prehistoric beastie. There is nary a sign of the previous expedition. Nada. Zilch. We even learn that they have done this particular \"hunt\" many times before.But, having ignored this glaring time (and script) paradox, the writers then decide that, as it later becomes necessary in the story to correct the time-line, they must send someone back to stop this second group of hunters from mucking things up. Which they then do.As I said, there is a good story here struggling to escape the ineptitude of the script-writers, but it struggles in vain since the above plot-crater is not the only ugly nonsense to rear its head.Apparently, in order to prevent contamination of the past, a kind of force-field road is created for the hunters to walk on which floats a few inches above the real ground. However, this road continues off into the distance, way past where the \"hunt\" takes place. I'm sure it would have made more sense to terminate the road at that spot, thus preventing any exploring on the part of the tourists (or any chance of them being out of range of the recording device). But then that would have been counter-productive to the plot, so its a no-no. Of course, the thought also occurs that, if they could create this \"force-road\" why didn't they make a force-tunnel and simply have a window in it at the appropriate spot. Again, of course, counter-plot-ductive.We are also treated to the (interesting) concept of the \"time-wave\", whereby altering the past causes \"waves\" of disruption to sweep forward through time (at convenient, but entirely arbitrary, intervals) affecting everything in their path. Oops! Sorry, I fixed a script problem there in my description. I should have ended with \"affecting things in their path in order of importance to the story\".Yes, sadly, the time-waves affect the climate first, then plant-life, then animal and, finally, human life (which is laughably referred to as \"the last, most evolved life-form\". This is entirely a plot device to prolong the time changes and \"add excitement\". But instead no consistent explanation of this \"phenomenon\" is put forward to account for it. So it makes no sense whatsoever to anyone with even half a brain.The effects are somewhat cheap - certainly no ILM or Weta quality graphics on display here. But the irritating plot problems are so glaring that they far outweigh any troubles the CGI might have. Likewise the acting is competent enough for the most part - or maybe I wasn't paying that much attention, being as I was, so involved in trying to rationalise the plot.In short, the basic story has potential, but is screwed-over royally by the inability of the writers to come up with a way of using time-travel that doesn't insult the viewer. I tried to think of it as some kind of \"multi-dimensional\" thing, but they kept calling it time-travel and ruining my rose-tinted view of it, so to Hell with them.Nice story, shame about the realisation.",

Written by Ray Bradbury and Thomas Dean Donnely Directed by Peter Hyams Rated PG-13 for partial nudity, violence and language Evolve or Die. The tag line reads on the poster I'm not sure I agree with it or the release of this film in theaters. But here it is nonetheless. Directed by End of Days and Relic Helmer Peter Hyams Sound of Thunder is quite an exciting movie minus the special effects. It's no doubt that the film had a Rather large budget and they completely used it in the wrong way. So before I get into the pros and obvious cons of the film let me just describe to you what it's about. Deleciously sexy Edward Burns stars as Travis Ryer a big shot scientist in 2055 that leads expedition/safaris in the prehistoric era to hunt dinosaurs. Catherine Mcormack is wonderfully smart and sarcastic as Sonia Rand the woman who invented the super computer and the technology that makes the jumps possible. she is however completely against her technology being used in such a money making way. While on a relatively routine trip an accident occurs and someone has an accident and ends up altering the past. Because of the action it begins to change time as we know it through through edition of freakish matrix inspired time waves that allows time to catch up eventually. The results are horrid as at first the climate changes, and than vegetation and plant life and finally the more complex organisms that are created because of the miss step. Interesting is'nt it. Now for the pros. The film is competently directed. The story is interesting, creative and original. The acting is decent-to good with the exception of a horridly over the top turn from once great actor Ben Kingsley. The score is exciting and the film is suspenseful, action-packed and feverishly paced. Now for the cons. The story is of course delivered in a somewhat unbelievable fashion. But yet it's still acceptable. The big problem here is the awful special effects. And they are awful. God awful. Some of the worst I've seen this side of Anacondas and Boa Vs. Python. It's obvious that the budget was a hefty sum because of the set design. But I guess they just went into overkill with their ideas because In the end the audience ends up with a rough cut of a good movie with spectacular potential. Now it's hard to pass over the effects because the movie is somewhat effects driven but me and my friend managed to separate ourselves from the paste on picturesque backgrounds and CGI monsters to endure some good storytelling, competent film making and elaborate action and suspense sequences. I must say that I throughly enjoyed this film, I really did. Edward Burns is magnificently sexy, drool worthy and they manage some nice close ups of him in his boxers shirtless. Catherine Mccormack is beautifully believable and entertaining as his female co-star and check out the subway sequence and the weird crazy monkey reptiles, exciting, scary stuff people. The important thing with watching this film is to leave your brain and your judge mental eyes at the door. It should fare better ron video and because of the final fx belongs there. But too sad for Warner Bros. They could've had a huge summer hit on their hands had they invested a bit more money. Oh well their loss. Still my gain.

            "content": "As a teenager I remember reading the short story A Sound Of Thunder by Ray Bradbury . It's a science fiction revolving around chaos theory and the butterfly effect where time travel is possible and an industry of hunting dinosaurs tens of millions in the past is a once in a lifetime thrill for the exclusively mega-rich . This leads to time being changed subtly but ultimately disasterously for humanity where a war mongering fascist leader is elected and with him the probability of thermo nuclear war It's one of these short stories that exists due to the twist ending . Try and think of THE TWILIGHT ZONE with a downbeat ending . One problem I had with the internal logic with the story is that even if time travel was possible - and the scientific community are certain that time travel is forever impossible - then would anyone allow it to happen preciselyfor the reasons pointed out in the story ? You know you step on a butterfly and next thing you know humanity ends in a big puff of smoke The film version of A SOUND OF THUNDER pads out the premise of the original short story to feature length and the more it adds the more problematic everything becomes on a logical level . Expeditions to a point in time where a dinosaur is about to die in an exact point in timewill immediately lead you to ask is there actually a market in this . You turn up with the Jurrasic period and shoot a giant reptile which only has seconds to live anyway . Is this worth the astronomical fee you'll be expected to pay ? So apart from the illogical nature of the original short story the film version heaps on more and more implausible aspects of its own But it's not the narrative that has come in on for major criticism on this website , it's the production values . Some quotes state that this movie cost $80 million to make . One wonders if someone either stuck a zero on the end , or if Ben Kingsley is the highest paid movie star in history or if someone simply deposited most of the budget in to a Swiss bank account because the money is nowhere to be seen on screen . People may point out that the dino-baboon hybrids ( Yeah I know these hybrids don't make sense ) or the dino-sharks are totally unconvincing but they're adequate compared to the laughable scenes midway through the film where people walk around a city of the future . Let me elaborate: two characters are supposedly walking along a city but it's obvious that the sequence is achieved by the actors being in front of back projection . It's not even blue-screen it's back projection as you see in films from the first half of the 20th Century and the perspective isn't even in a convincing aspect ratio . What makes all of this even more laughable in that it's obvious that the actors are walking on the spot ! Is this a sophisticated post modernist joke ? If you see any hint of sophistication let me know what scene it appeared in One could perhaps be more forgiving since A SOUND OF THUNDER was supposedly beset by production problems from the outset but even so a film like HEAVENS GATE still contains some memorable imagery and sequences . Watching A SOUND OF THUNDER you're continually scratching your head wondering where the budget went to . If this was a $1 million production by The Asylum or The SyFy Channel then it'd be merely average . Looking on the bright side it's a film seldom seen which will be of great consolation to everyone who worked on this turkey",

            "content": "A Sound of Thunder is an exceedingly stupid movie and one of the biggest box office flops in history. Personally, I rather liked it. A Sound of Thunder is by no means a great movie. There is no denying the film's poor special effects, the far fetched storyline and unintentionally hilarious script. However, the film does offer some fine actors, a couple of exciting action scenes and a certain B-grade charm. I'd take this entertaining mess over \"Jurassic Park\" any day.The film is an adaptation of a Ray Bradbury short story. I'm not sure how true the film stays to its source material, but I'm guessing that some of the finer details were lost somewhere in the leap from book to movie screen. A Sound of Thunder is set in 2055, when time travel has become commercially available. Basically, people can pay a lot of money to go back in time and shoot a dinosaur, which sounds like a good time to me. However, Dr Rand (Catherine McCormack) warns expedition leader, Travis (Edward Burns), that the trips could impact evolution and she is proved right when dinosaurs start roaming the streets. Any science fiction film involves a certain amount of suspended disbelief but A Sound of Thunder takes the cake. Among other nonsense, time ripples threaten to undo evolution, killer vines sprout from the streets, monkey-faced raptor creatures rule the streets and Dr Rand creates a new time machine by swapping a computer hard-drive. Yeah, right.The generally inane storyline is not assisted by the majority of the special effects. It is hard to believe that this film cost $50 million. I originally thought that it might have been a telemovie. The dinosaur effects in \"Pterodactyl\" were more accomplished than anything this film has to offer. The over use of bad CGI effects is simply annoying. The time ripples and mutant insects look like they come from a video game. However, these are high class in comparison to the plastic eel head that surfaces behind Dr Rand in the subway swamp. Strangely, a small minority of the special effects are excellent. The initial monkey attack on Payne is great and the futuristic street scenes are imaginative. I actually think the film would have been more enjoyable if the effects were worse. As it is they are too accomplished to be funny, yet too ineffective and inconsistent to be credible.A Sound of Thunder does benefit from the presence of some fine actors. Catherine McCormack is too good for this, and she knows it. Her performance as Dr Rand is the acting high watermark of this film. Edward Burns looks rather bored as Travis but I have to admit to finding him far more appealing in this sort of trash than the dreary romantic comedies that made his career. Ben Kingsley wears a funny white wig in this movie. That is about the most exciting thing about his performance. Fans of German star Heike Makatsch might want to keep an eye out for her embarrassing cameo as a slut.Peter Hyams has made several fun action/adventure films, including \"End Of Days\", \"The Relic\" and \"Timecop\". He obviously knows how to deal with a big budget and special effects, not that you would really know it from A Sound of Thunder. Hopefully this does not end his career because it's really not that bad. Just relentlessly stupid.",

Ray Bradbury's writings have depth and are meaningful with impactful themes. You could very easily tell that this movie was not done by Ray Bradbury. This movie was put together with cheezy effects and some poor dialogue choices. The movie was based more on the adventure than the themes of the short story. But I would be lying if I didn't say that there was a part of me that enjoyed this film. This film found ways to entertain the audience and keep you captivated enough to enjoy but was so obviously poorly put together you could enjoy the laughs brought from the scenes and script. This would very well be a movie I would watch at home for fun or even with friends but most likely not have paid to go see in theaters.\nApart from my own opinion and enjoyment of the cheezy features of this film, It was not well done. The film itself struggled with being complete whether it was recasting, rescripting, or taking years longer than expected to be produced. It felt as though this movie was finished just to have checked it off the list and get it complete. The special effects were overall bad whether it was a tacky green screen backdrop or the unrealisticness of both the design and animation of the creature. The writing in the movie was also strange and felt some lines were included specifically for the laughs or in an attempt to give some characters more depth without actually showing their backstories or development. The movie also took a risk being based on a short story that dealt with time. There were many loopholes throughout the movie and things that overall just didn't make sense. But some of these items were chosen so that the characters had time to fix the external conflicts in the first place to allow the movie to even have a storyline which can be understandable in a film such as this.\nThe plot of the story is much different from Ray Bradbury's short story for it focuses more on the main catastrophes of going back in time rather than the importance and significance of all the little things in the past. The story revolves around Travis Ryer, an intelligent scientist and Time safari hunt leader played by Edward Burns. Travis has to work for a company that allows the wealthy to go back in time and hunt Dinosaurs. The company is run by a rich businessman, played by Ben Kingsley, who cares more about money than the safety of his employers. On a Time jump, something is changed in the past and negatively affects the future. Travis with the help of Dr. Sonia Rand, played by Catherine McCormack, and other scientists of the Time Safari attempt to resolve the issue and save the future.\nA key theme of the movie was showing how money and power can corrupt people and lead them to be selfish and do irresponsible things. I found this interesting cause I had felt from Ray Bradbury's story that it was more about the significance of everything in time and how equal people and other creatures are in the timeline. I thought that the short story showed the value of everything but also the demise the humans can cause. It had a very solemn theme. But with A Sound of Thunder(2005), I felt the movie was more positive in its attempt to resolve the issue and was more about how even if humans make mistakes they still do what they can to set them right. I enjoyed seeing how even after problems were caused and made by humans they still managed to work hard for the good of everyone and humanity to set the timeline right.\nOverall the movie was poorly made and had many plot and writing issues along with bad effects. But even so, there was a part of me that enjoyed this movie and almost the effort put in to make it good and interesting. It is an acquired taste that you would have to see to believe. If you walk in with lower expectations for the film you may find it enjoyable, but if you watch the movie with regular expectations of the quality of movies it may not be your type. Even so, I wouldn't pay to see this in theaters but yet I didn't regret watching it.",

The distributor, whether or not the one originally intended, had to make a decision....dump this turkey, or patch it up for DVD or theatrical release. Unfortunately they chose the latter. As one poster described, this flick went through several screenings with its \"first generation\" (or perhaps \"second\") special effects in place. Most likely, the results were deadly, so the studio decided not to pony-up another $20 million for first-rate CGI. They chose to release it, two-thirds completed. Now, why they chose theatrical release, I cannot fathom. However, they spent zero bucks on marketing, and figured they could reap some bucks from innocent theatergoers, before hoisting it on the DVD shelves. The special effects are obviously in early stages - that is easily recognized from various \"Making of...\" features for the average sci-fi flick.That being said, Ed Burns is seriously miscast, and the plot is full of sinkholes. Supporting actors chew the scenery like nobody's business. Even if it had been given the full, top-of- the-line attention and completion, I still think this film would have been considered a bomb.The few suspenseful sequences are momentarily effective, until the \"Come on, give me a break!\" quotient kicks in, almost laughably.The film is worth a watch, only if you want to witness how a studio mishandles its options.

We are subjected to a series of \"timewaves\" which progressively retrograde planetary evolution. While this is a convenient plot device, as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem, it makes no sense whatsoever. Surely, if you change a variable, and that variable has significantly, or even completely, altered planetary evolution, then by the time you come \"back to the future\", the evolutionary process has already been established and there would be no need for waves? After all, why would a change that happened 65 million years ago need to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth was projected forward in time may give it some credibility, but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered, ergo, any change to evolutionary history would have begun then, and not be dependent upon a return to our current time.To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening. By doing this successfully, we see that the changes to evolution never happened, and that no-one even remembers the events! Surely, what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a good rollicking sci fi adventure, but unless it is set \"in a galaxy far far away\" it needs to have at least some grounding in theoretical possibility to make it truly entertaining.Good premise, bad plot, reasonable acting and, in all fairness, just a twist on Jurassic Park.Not on my \"watch again\" list.",

In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder,' I remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again, so I'll just go on memory. In fact, I haven't thought of how badly made this movie was until I read someone else's review and remembered the experience I had back in 2005, when I actually saw this in the theater. My movie buddy forced me to see it, though I wasn't interested, and wow. (Later on, I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him he made me see this crap. So, I guess that made us even.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the movie's expense, of course,) which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it. The time-travel/butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics, the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it \u0096 it was hilarious!) or just simply, Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be: going from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' from time to time, so they're forgiven.) For months, I pulled an MST3k with my buddy, consistently referencing this movie to any low-rent sci-fi film or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise inebriated): horrible over-the-top acting, \"special\" FX that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists.

But if you watch this movie without being too concerned about good special effects and amazing acting or even maybe watching it with the intent of laughing at it, there's a big chance you will enjoy watching A Sound of Thunder.\nA Sound of Thunder is a sci-fi thriller about the dangers of going back in time and accidentally changing the future based on the short story by Ray bradburry Directed by Peter hyams made in 2005 starring Edward Burns, Catherine mcCormack, Ben Kingsley, Heike makatsch, and David oyelowo. The ratings on this movie are very much all over the place. some people absolutely hate this movie, some agree it's bad but still enjoyed it and some people absolutely love it even with its cheesy dialogue and bad effects.\nIn A Sound of Thunder one of the main characters, Travis (edward burns) works at a time travel safari company for Charles Hatton (Ben kingsley) where they take people back in time to hunt a dinosaur for 10,000 dollars. but one day something goes wrong and changes the future.Then throughout a few days multiple \"time waves\" come and change the earth more and more every time. with the last \"time wave\" resulting in humans never existing. so the main characters are on a mission to stop it and save the human race.\nI am really interested in the whole idea behind the movie which is \"the butterfly effect\". \"the butterfly effect\" is the idea that if time travel was possible someone could go back in time and anything they do could change a lot about the present and future. There have been many movies using this theory but i dont think a lot of them make complete sense. There are a lot of loopholes with time travel and it's hard to make sense of a lot of them but I guess this is just an idea created by the human mind so who's to say what's \"right\" and \"wrong\" about time travel movies.\nTherefore, A sound of thunder is an interesting movie that can be enjoyed by anyone with the right mindset while watching it. I recommend reading the short story first, the short story by ray bradbury will give you some more understanding before watching the movie. and many people may argue the short story is better than the movie.i think the biggest difference between the short story and the movie is the ending. i think the ending in the short story is way more interesting.

            "content": "A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story.But what a vomitous movie! In Bradbury's science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path, a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect.A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science fiction story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself.While in the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes, like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale, except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury's story - baboon-faced reptiles, plants overrunning Chicago's concrete, time waves rippling through the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers.Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts.I can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog, but here is just one, spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of \"scientist\": he refers to the Pleiades star cluster, \"The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, don't they? But each of them is a whole galaxy.\" Uh, no, idiot scientist, they're actually, uh, stars.Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury's story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing.Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",

This movie is very light-hearted if you just want an entertaining one, but definitely do not expect too much if you read the short story first.\nA Sound of Thunder was really put through the wringer. The movie lost money and had multiple directors, was picked up by one then left for a year, picked up by another directory, and so on. Peter Hyams remains the full director of the movie but Ray Bradbury wrote the short story. Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, and Gregory Poirier got their hands on the movie as well but were only listed as screen story and screenplay directors. In the short story, we are following Mr. Eckles throughout the story, but in the movie, we are following Travis Ryer (Edward Burns). Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) the wealthy businessman whose face of the company, is the only well-known actor winning multiple awards and nominations which definitely weren't from this film. Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack) makes a very dramatic entrance and we later find out she is behind the creation of the time machine which is a surprise tool that will help us later.\nIn A Sound of Thunder, we are in the year 2055, where a greedy businessman Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) makes a fortune with his company, Time Safari Inc., this is for only millionaires to travel back to the prehistoric era to hunt a big game or dinosaurs. There are very strict rules that must be followed so the present is not changed. But during one safari, a hunter causes a drastic change in the future. Now Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) and the other scientist must travel back in time to prevent this from happening. Pretty soon you realize the movie has taken a totally different direction from the short story.\nWhat did it for me is when the scientists come back from their hunt and we experience the first time wave. This was not in the short story at all and those horrible graphics really started coming into play. That's when you really take in that this film is better if you just stop trying to understand what's going on and focus more on the occasional funny dialogue, bad acting, and literally terrible graphics that mix just right for a movie that is so bad it's funny. Also, an honorable mention is their slight hint of a romance between Travis (Edward Burns) and Dr. Rand (Catherine McComack). Definitely think they were hesitant in whether to do it or not so it's just kinda there, with no purpose and it doesn't add to the plot at all.\nNow for the part you have all been waiting for, my rating. Personally, I'm giving this film 8/10 stars. There are a lot of things to hate about this movie and that's why I love it. I think it's a great family film as long as you don't have any people in your family that are obsessed with science fiction. Although this is listed as a science fiction film it very much is not. There are so many mistakes and plot holes that would make them quite mad. But, for someone like me who didn't even realize the plot holes until pointed out, I loved it. Definitely a film to just watch and be entertained by, than one where you are really trying to understand what's going on.",

We all know what that is, so I shan't bring it up here. Because Bradbury's masterpiece is only a few pages, it was up to a handful of scripters to come up with enough plot for a 90-minute movie. Their solution: To have the time travel \"mistake\" set off a series of destructive time waves that keep altering the planet for the worse. It is up to the time travelers to go back in time and fix the mistake. Sounds good. Right? You would be wrong if you think so. The script is preposterous, the special effects and visuals are incredibly poor and the acting and dialog is for the birds. Why, what a surprise: hack director Peter Hyams was in charge! You will see scenes that are right out of his so-so adaptation of THE RELIC and you will hear dialog and witness situations that may remind you of Frank Marshall's incredibly bad adaptation of Michael Crichton's CONGO. For the best laugh, watch the two principals \"walking\" down a city sidewalk. They are green-screened against a miniature set and pretend to walk forward toward the camera. All they are actually doing is shuffling their weight from side to side. I hate to think what this movie may have cost, miniature sets notwithstanding. Ed Burns as the lead time traveler plays a role almost identical to that of Vince Vaughn in JURASSIC PARK 3. Ben Kingsley is a howl as his rug-wearing, line-chewing boss, obviously intended to evoke memories of the bombastic boss in JURASSIC PARK. Most everyone else is wasted. It becomes painfully apparent early on this was shot overseas with a largely foreign crew and foreign financing. It is not an American movie as such and suffers greatly for it.",

Boy, was I wrong. I was almost completely aghast at the painfully obvious green screen scenes, most especially early on when Edward Burns and that one girl are facing the camera and walking towards it on a frickin' treadmill! I did like the futuristic city look and some of the car designs and wasn't too surprised to see so many cabs of the same design, either. After all, how many cabs of the model featured in \"Taxi Driver\" have there ever been in big cities? However, the subway trains were also painfully obvious miniatures. And if this is supposed to be 50 years in the future then why do they still use keyboards on their computers instead of flat panel screens like those we first saw on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"? Anyway, it's very hard to do a decent time travel story (all of the Star Trek spin-offs all too often fell back on that tired plot device, more often to ridiculous resolutions than not), and it was unbelievable that the company would only take people back to the exact same point of time when the party kills the Allosaurus (I never knew they had twin red crests on their heads; I guess it was to differentiate them from the even more popular T-Rexes) because in reality they'd just keep running into themselves back then, which would then create multiple time lines! Of course, they conveniently ignored that little tidbit till later on when it was more important to the storyline.The Allosaurus, looking huge and mean and so obviously fake (the Jurassic Parks dinos were far superior!) most likely probably would've just started eating everyone instead of waiting around for them to kill it moments before it would've otherwise died anyway, so there was no tension there for me. Well, tension of waiting for the stupid thing to start eating those idiots. The evolved baboon hybrid characters were interesting in concept but just looked and moved too unrealistically.This film fails so badly on so many levels that I'm not sure I'd even recommend anyone rent it on DVD, no matter how much extra content may be included, like deleted or restored footage. After all, why waste anymore time watching this drivel than you could help? Bradbury should've had more of a hand during production of this film to make sure that it was more accurate to his short story, like the episode of some sci-fi series (Showtime's The Outer Limits, perhaps?) that I seem to recall doing a much better version of it.",

Not only was the acting total rubbish, but the effects were something me and a few friends could pull off with a super 8 and some plastic dinosaur figures. They were just horrendous. The film also was grainy, and the colors were all washed out...well when it wasn't pitch black. It looked like crappy old stock of 16mm... hmmm, maybe my idea of shooting it when i was a kid isn't so far off.So, the story is useless, leaving every corner in another direction, and leaving everything entirely unexplained, and in most cases, launching into new subjects altogether. It's actually hard to think of this film again, even to write this review.Honestly, once you see the obvious stages, the stock footage, and the CGI that is the worst thing to ever be seen in theaters, you'll be so far OUT of this film that nothing could save it. And... it didn't. Now, I like Ed Burns, for what he is. his rom/coms are fun, and I like what he does in them, but the only person with less range is Keanu, and in acting horribly he wasn't alone in this film. The cast was just horrible - Kingsley and all.The green screens were something that would make a crappy film school production look Oscar worthy. The fact that 90% of the cues were off (ie: an actor looking right, when their attacker is on the left, yeah it happened, and more then once). Then there were HORRIBLE continuity scenes, jumping back and forth so many times out of cue you almost wanted to stand up and bit@h slap the film itself.OK, I gotta end this. DO NOT see this movie. It is the worst thing to EVER EVER EVER be released on film, and I'll hold that up against anything.",

Meanwhile, the time traveller will arrive instantly back in his or her own time to find everything instantly changed.Not in this movie. Here, all the changes take place gradually, in \"time waves,\" which are basically just astonishingly bad CGI tidal waves, as though Father Time is only gradually beginning to realize that someone has tricked him. You see, each wave changes different things, animals, plants, weather, etc. and of course, the humans will be changed by the last wave, so that they can watch all of the other changes taking place while they wonder what will happen to them. Good thing the movie has an expert who somehow knows how all of this stuff works. What I really like is that, after the first wave, the two main characters are standing near an overturned vehicle, where a crowd of people have gathered and are all crowded around the vehicle, evidently more interested in the fact that it's on its side than that their entire city has instantly reached an advanced state of decay.Things start to get complicated when Travis Ryer, Edward Burns, tries to go back and stop the first crew from making the first change, but this time, instead of the computer missing the landing site by five minutes, she misses by tens of millions of years, sending Ryer into the old west, right in front of another time wave. And by the way, one person on the IMDb suggests a plot hole in the fact that we aren't told how they always go to the same spot in time. They go back to the same point in time because the computer, Tammie, I think they called her,is programmed to send them there. The physics and calculations involved in doing that are not explained, but obviously to attempt such a thing would be confusing and meaningless anyway. It was about 35 minutes into the film that I knew it was going to be pretty disastrously bad, there was going to be no redeeming turnaround where it would get better in the second half. Of course, movies like this almost never do that. The reason to keep watching is to see what kind of things they come up with, even if they are badly animated. I wanted to see what changes would happen to the humans.We never do, of course. That would be too complicated for cartoonish special effects like this. All we see are some bizarre gorilla dinosaurs, and luckily Ryers happens to know their \"only weakness.\" Time travel is endlessly fascinating to me, but sadly, this one goes down as a boring failure.",

And guess what? They lost their funding three-quarters of the way through. Great. So, what do you do when the bottom drops out of your movie? Shove it into release anyway!! What the hell!! And what does the audience get? Special effects that look half-done. Literally. The futuristic Chicago that provides the backdrop for the film looks HORRIBLE. It looks friggin plastic! So bad that it takes you out of the film! Most of the special effects look half-done. Some, like the initial time \"pathway\" look pretty good. But it really just looks like they lost funding and gave up.I like Peter Hyams as a director, mostly because he directed \"Outland\", one of the better serious sci-fi films of the late 70s, early 80s.I usually dislike sci-fi in general but this film aroused my interest. The premise is interesting. I have not read the Bradbury story, but I'm familiar with it (I had thought it was more politically oriented, however. I could be wrong). What REALLY interested me was not the time travel element or the action element but the nascent horror theme. The idea of society suddenly being plunged into a world where we are, essentially, nothing more than prey. I find this fascinating.Stephen King wrote a brilliant short story entitled \"The Mist\" that is somewhat similar in theme. It is also about the world being plunged into a totally primeval landscape because of a scientific blunder. King's story is terrifying and also leaves open precisely what caused the accident, however (there isn't a direct time travel element).",

The ape creatures remind me of something from the old arcade game, Primal Rage, only the graphics in that were better than what's on this film. When there are multiple apes on the screen at once it looks like the CGI animator was using cut & paste a bit too often. As for the characters, they're about as cardboard cut-out as it gets.

I felt like I was watching a patchwork of what remained on the cutting room floor!! I can't believe Ben Kingsley and Catherine McCormack (a stage actress of much laud and acclaim) would have anything to do with this. Whereas the root of the story is an interesting concept, the tree which sprung forth is most twisted and incomprehensible.Every so called theoretical result of their violation of causality was perfectly understood by the constantly ranting scientist, Sonia Rand, who knew exactly what to expect and exactly how to resolve these events that presumably nobody had ever dealt with before. As they were navigating through this world which was being altered from simple plant life on up with each pass of a \"time wave\", racing against the inevitable change of themselves (because humans were apparently the \"last species to evolve\" in our time), they were constantly being harried by beasts reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen films. There was also this pathetic scene where Edward Burns, easily talked into leaving an injured man behind, watches on as the man (regressing to what seemed to be a conversation he had with someone when he was a little boy) quickly proceeds to get devoured by mutant reptilian baboons. However, all the while Dr Rand faced every challenge with the savvy of a seasoned pro, understanding the physics of it all with a clarity that the audience unfortunately were left to envy. (One quick question: how are there dinosaur-like sea creatures and reptilian baboons, which sleep suspended like bats, in this causality-altered world? Did their violation of the past extend even so far as to obliterate the asteroid in space that ended the Age of the Reptiles 65 million years ago???) The film resolves and ends with all the grace of a walk off a plank! Oh yeah, and Edward Burns seems to have an incredible knowledge of (completely alien) animal behavior, structural engineering, and fluid dynamics which I can tell you, got them out of more than a few jams.I would only suggest you see this film if you are fanatically faithful to Ben Kingsley or Catherine McCormack, or if you are a MSTie who needs the satisfying fix of a perfect film atrocity!

There's the scientist who tells them all they'll ruin the world, and she ends up helping to save it. There's the lone black guy that sacrifices himself so everyone else can live.And to top it all off, who knew in 50 years we'd still be wearing the same exact type of clothes when just 15 years ago we had completely different styles, and 15 years before that they were noticeably different as well.At the end he saves the world by going back in time and fixing what was wrong (real surprise there) but the problem is it's so boring to watch. And it's not possible. He goes back to before the guy stepped on the butterfly...but that's the same time they go to every time they 'jump' into the past.

Construct a plot that makes sense, and use concepts that have been meticulously thought out, as well as not relying on improbable escapes. Give us at least a *small* chance of suspending our disbelief. Lesson two: CGI should be used sparingly and strictly in service to the story. More is not better, especially when it's not all that good in the first place.Lesson three: don't veer wildly from the source material. \"A Sound of Thunder\" claims to be \"based on\" the classic short story by Ray Bradbury. Far better it had claimed to be \"inspired by...\" or \"extrapolated from...\" Bradbury's tale was short for a reason, being little more than a brief set-up for the twist ending, i.e. step on a butterfly (or in this film's case, a moth) 65,000,000 years ago and you will radically alter the future from whence you came. \"A Sound of Thunder\" takes this simple concept and then proceeds to ruin it with a lot of laughable nonsense about \"time waves\" and the like.

Surely.Director/cinematographer Peter \"2010\" Hyams is thoroughly hamstrung by a clunker of a screenplay courtesy of Thomas Dean \"Sahara\" Donnelly, Joshua \"me, too\" Oppenheimer, and Gregory \"Rosewood\" Poirier.

Right? C'mon now, be honest.I'll prove it: Take the Pilot Movie to \"Night Gallery\" (1969) Television, right? VERY little in the way of special effects, right? But, it's a great little film! Granted it is much better quality, still, than \"A Sound of Thunder\", but my point is, see how spoiled we are due to the 'standard' that we set for ourselves? Now, if say, 'ASoT' had been shown on television not that terribly long ago with ONLY those expectations of tele special effects, wouldn't we just have sat back and enjoyed it and thought it was a pretty darn good film? (Let me tell you, I STARTED to watch the VERY fancy and expensive television production of 'Merlin' which they probably spent about the same amount of money on back then that they did on 'ASoT', and let me tell you, the WRITING and ACTING was SOOOOOOO abysmal, although I like the source story and even some of the actors, I just COULDN'T stomach it!!! And most people thought that was a wonderful show! This film blows that out of the water!!!) Another thing, YES comparing the brilliant and wonderful short story by the EXTREMELY talented Mr. Bradbury with this film shoots it way down; that's completely understandable. To me, it's just like David Lynch's film \"Dune\"; sure, compared to the rarefied brilliance of the book(s) it's gonna suck. But the key is: VIEWED SEPARATELY as a STAND ALONE story, they're not that bad, really.I just NOW got back from seeing it; and yes, after reading all these VERY predictable 'reviews' I was steeled and determined NOT to expect ANYTHING... And I mean ANYTHING! So I sat there and kept expecting it to start to COMPLETELY suck, and it never really did. Now, keep in mind I absolutely LOATHE Peter Hyams direction!!!! As soon as I found out that this beloved short story was directed by him, I was totally depressed for days!!! : ) I HATE his absolute love and fascination with 'Hey, lets put the people in a completely DARK PLACE (\"Relics\", etc.) and 'Hey, lets do LOTS of fast editing and flashes of light!!!' wow... HATE IT!!! But, still the story, acting and basic suspense level and such, considering that they had to alter the story line RADICALLY, I think it could have been done a LOT worse.Take a moment and think now of ALL the FRIGGIN' films that just INSULT the absolute daylights out of us!!! NOW THAT is what I am tired of! POOR writing, POOR acting, just plain insulting the audience. But, I honestly did NOT get that impression at all from this film. Sure, I still didn't care too much for the LONG sequences while they were traveling at night and in the 'subway' and such. Personally, without giving too much away, I would like to have seen the story element included that was in the book as to what they saw immediately when they came back where everything had been COMPLETELY changed, say perhaps after that last 'WAVE' took effect, and THEN have them work within THAT completely changed history toward the END of the film to try to fix everything.*************** MINOR SPOILERS ************************ I do think that it was VERY clever to come up with the changes coming in 'WAVES'; I was wondering how they were gonna do the short story in full running time format according to the original story. Smart way to do it and not NEARLY as insulting and eye-rolling as the mind numbingly stupid pseudo-techno-sh*t that Rick Berman tries to get us poor Star Trek fans to swallow in his more recent 'efforts'. And, I thought that taking the story along the lines of the actual evolutionary lines being changed was clever; again, I would have rather seen them work in, perhaps in that last 'WAVE' where there was the totalitarian regime in power and where that fringe political leader actually did get elected, and THEN have them try to sneak around and try to fix stuff.******************** END OF MINOR SPOILERS ********************* Anyway, I think that Hollywood has (like bloody Everything ELSE in this 'culture' spoiled us to where we can't just simply enjoy a neat little story without saying, 'This is TOTAL crap!!!' I feel very strongly about this, especially concerning this particular film; I mean, if the acting or writing or even the direction (overtly)had TRULY been lousy, then I'd be the first one to say, 'Hey, you're all right, it SUX!!!' but I quite honestly do not think that was the case.",

I decided I just had to comment on how logic totally fails in this movie but going over the other user reviews I see that other people had similar thoughts. I'll write my piece anyway. How can a butterfly which is destined to die in an exploding volcano (which presumably will wipe out everything for miles around as we witness the actors running against time away from the ash) cause such drastic changes in the timeline? It cant pollinate a flower that some animal would snack on. Neither the butterfly nor the plantlife would survive!! How can changing the past influence the future in waves? What determines the time interval of these \"waves\"? Why would you remember what reality used to be like if it no longer exists? Besides, wouldn't this cause an ambiguity in the time loop? If the present is different, how can one go back to the past & alter it? One more thing, if there were no builders (since homo-sapiens apparently don't evolve in the new reality), why are the buildings still standing?The special effects were not that great, beginning with the first scene from the past (looks like something from Jumanji). The acting was really not that great either. I would expect to be more panicked (and yes, cursing, sweating profusely and perhaps angry, to boot) if I'm being chased by carnivores! The mouth-to-mouth in the water filled subway tunnel was laughable. And even though Ed Burns looked great with his permanent stubble, he lacked the raw sensuality or intensity of say Richard Gere (who he resembles remarkably). The only saving grace of this movie as far as I'm concerned is that it is set in the future Chicago. Always nice to see renditions of that (as in \"I Robot\"). There was even a shot of the Corn-cobs with high up passages leading to another building (yet to be built). Altogether it was quite disappointing.",

            "content": "I tried very hard to watch this disc with an open mind. I liked the idea of adapting a classic Ray Bradbury short story of 1952 that had already been adapted in a 1954 issue of EC Comics \"Weird Science-Fantasy\" magazine. I can't say I like what they've done with it though. The premise of Bradbury's cautionary fable on capitalistic irresponsibility, come to think of it - using a time machine to allow sleazy millionaires to shoot at dinosaurs in the distant past - could only have been possible under the macho, greasy, ecologically-insensitive, politically-incorrect, paranoid, brutish, gung-ho, unidimensional and violent world of McCarthyite America, unless you admit that George W. Bush has lived on to be president until the year 2055, when this story is set. Ray Bradbury's story wasn't so much about the past or the future as it was about 1952 America.And time waves don't work... If you change something in the past, the present you return to is already changed, assuming you can return to the present. Why? Because, by definition, time has had all the time in the world to go on as usual and evolve along its merry way. So, in theory, you wouldn't even encounter the city, the boss or the lab you left behind before your trip - if you had goofed in a major way - and that would be the end of the story. In Bradbury's original scenario, only the rules of English spelling had been dumbed-down on the explorers' return and a different, more war-like, right-wing president had been elected (which makes you wonder who might conceivably have stepped on what monumental insect back in the Cretaceous period to explain the last two U.S. presidential elections). The democratic election of a fascist dictator was considered disaster enough in those simpler times...This story, as well as the memorable spoof of it on one of \"The Simpsons\" better Halloween specials showed more common sense, all in all, than this film does. But if you accept those two goofy premises, you can have a few minutes of goofy fun also accepting that gorillas have somehow mated with reptiles since the last time you left the office to go hunting in the past.I sort of liked the primitive aspect of the CGI, which allows us to appreciate really fine work, by way of comparison. I thought the characters' motivation was always trite but crystal-clear, as opposed to, say, a recent hit like \"King Kong\" where none of the characters' actions make much sense - except the gorilla's and except as an elaboration on the original 1933 film. I really liked Edward Burns as the even-tempered studmuffin for all seasons in relation with Catherine McCormack's terminal case of PMS. I also liked every second of Ben Kingsley's time on screen as oily manipulator Hatton.What I didn't like was the use for the nth time of a token Black character (\"Payne\") whom you have no reason to care about, to fulfill the obligatory \"the Black guy must die\" quota of B-movies, even if he is given a great death scene (considering we don't know who he is). I also had serious problems with the facial features of Jemima Rooper as the brattish assistant: aren't there physical or legal limits to the amount of collagen human lips can withstand without doing permanent damage to the jaw? I also didn't care for the choppy editing style which cuts away from CGI scenes in order to save money but also from essential plot-establishing scenes - like a character talking - for no reason at all, all in the middle of a rather slow-moving sequence. I also didn't care for the military jungle drums music which made James Horner sound like Jules Massenet.But, other than that, it was a fine piece of entertainment.By the way, you can read the original Bradbury story online here : http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/WWI/thunder.htm .",

            "content": "\"Time Cop\" director Peter Hyams does a good job adapting novelist Ray Bradbury's 1951 short story \"A Sound of Thunder\" and expanding it into a 110-minute feature film. Virtually everything in the short story has been retained or the spirit of the work has been observed. The scenarists have opened up the storyline considerably to accommodate additional characters. Bradbury's short story didn't contain a female computer that has an answer to everything as well as a hero that worked for Time Safari so that he could recreate extinct animals. Presumably, \"Sahara\" scenarists Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer along with \"Tomcats\" Gregory Poirier made these contributions.The flaws are the not-quite-top of the line digital special effects. The cars on the streets of Chicago in 2035 look too good to be realistic and the lack of complications in the traffic patterns betrays its ersatz quality. Mind you, I saw this on DVD and not on the big-screen where it might have made a better impression because it was bigger. Nevertheless, little things like this undermine what should have been a tour-de-force picture. The battle with the fake sea beast in the subway is embarrassingly awful. Better CGI could have saved this scene.As in the book, a millionaire operates a safari agency that blasts its clients back to the past to dinosaur days where they can hunt T-Rexs like those in \"Jurassic Park.\" However, certain stipulations apply. The hunters\u0097dressed in space suits\u0097must stay on the path generated by the computer and they cannot stop until the safari team leader Travis Ryer (Edward Burns of \"Confidence\") pulls his own trigger. Actually, the T-Rex is doomed by nature to die and the hunters are piggy-backing on mother nature to exploit the situation. The T-Rex looks menacing enough, but he looks so menacing that you know he is computer generated, almost too perfect.The second safari in the movie one of the clients accidentally tromps off the path and crushes a butterfly on the sole of his boot. His mistake creates a deadly ripple through time that alters everything. Interestingly, nobody realizes what has happened until long afterward when our heroes try to piece together what they did to change time. \"A Sound of Thunder\" turns into \"The Time Machine\" meets \"Jurassic Park.\" Although most of the special effects appear largely substandard, the baboon creatures are superb, almost worth watching the movie for. Obsequious Ben Kingsley plays Charles Hatton who runs Time Safari and he is all about business, cutting corners, and saving costs to the detriment of civilization. Meanwhile, his antagonist is Catherine McCormack who knows more about the flaws in Time Safari than even Ryer. Since our heroes are not allowed to disturb the fabric of time without dire consequences\u0097Chicago turns into a jungle ruled by mutant beasts\u0097they must go back to the past and change what happens. The problem is that find power to operate the computers and the time machine is getting tough.Director Peter Hyams has done a good job with challenging material and a threadbare budget. \"A Sound of Thunder\" has some amusing scenes, suspenseful scenes, eerie scenes, and the heroes find that life is no picnic. Again, the baboons are terrific!",

If we could time travel, i would go back in time and stop myself from enterning the cinema that day.",

And I really did enjoy it.If you like Time Travel movies, this is a good one. Plus, it is an extra wide screen movie with awesome bass (much more bass than most movies in the same screen of the same theater that I go to), and good surround sound effects, so don't miss seeing it on a big screen if you like Time Travel movies (or if you want to see major hunk, Edward Burns on the big screen with his shirt off).Ironically, the only bad visual effects in this movie are the cars driving by on a normal day in the futuristic city. And one elevated train looks like a toy. But most of the other effects are very good, and very scary. The dinosaur may not be quite as good as Jurassic Park. But the other creatures in Sound of Thunder have evolved millions of years past the computer generated stuff in Jumanji.I can understand the bad reviews. It's certainly no Oscar contender. The way that some of the changes happen in the future, because of the change in the past, don't make much logical sense. But very few people have traveled back through time, so who knows if it's right or wrong? And the theories are interesting. Plus it was a great way to make a really scary movie out of Ray Bradbury's original short story. This movie is 20 times more scary than Dark Water! And I enjoyed this movie more than:Primer (4 College Students build a Time Machine in a depressing mess of a story), Time Line (another mess with acting and directing that makes this movie look like an Oscar winner), The Island (fell apart in 2nd half), Mystic River (bad guys get to do anything they please and get away with it), Adaptation (horrible ending), Sideways (boring first half, depressing end), Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy (they totally screwed up the story, the BBC miniseries was infinitely better).Ironic tidbits: The relatively unknown star, Edward Burns (3 episodes of Will & Grace this year), does a better job of acting than Ben Kingsley in this movie! I agree that Ben should not do camp.Last year's Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher (one of the all time best Time Travel movies) has the same Title as the Ray Bradbury short story that this movie was based on, but the two do not have similar story lines at all.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",

Overall, I thought the story made sense enough you could follow it and it was entertaining. It's not looking to win some awards, just to have some fun. I mean, some of the creatures were down right funny. I laughed quite a lot once the sea monster showed up.One thing I always hate about these futuristic films is when they show the outside world. All buildings look the same, but they always have some tricked out cars. The cars on the streets in this looked so silly. I don't think futuristic cars are going to digress, which is what these cars looked like. They didn't look as neat as current cars. Although this movie did leave out all the computer hologram stuff you usually see in these futuristic films.FINAL VERDICT: Not the worst film ever. It was OK.

In fact, this is a pretty good sci-fi effort considering the normal grade of sci-fi movies that abound.The story is really great and unusual. It involves a company that takes wealthy customers back to witness an Allosaurus attack. The customers always go back to the same place and point in time so the company can maintain good control over unintentional changes to the timeline. This works great for a while until the careful protocol fails and the timeline is altered. This is where the real story begins.Stories about time travel are often good and this is a good case in point. This tale goes in directions that I usually don't see in sci-fi. The budget, though not high, is significant enough to have worthwhile effects.I was surprised to see Ben Kingsley in a prominent role - he does a great job as the corrupt head of the company. Edward Burns does a fine job in the lead role. The other characters are OK.All in all - if you're a sci-fi fan looking for something refreshing, check this movie out. You'll like it a whole lot more than most of the standard sci-fi fare available.Stories based on time travel can be fun and this is no exception.

But, like the butterfly that got inadvertently squished and changed history, this story loses its way, perhaps in some alternate reality dimension somewhere.Thrill seekers are introduced to a brand new high-end-priced technology, a \"sportsman's\" fantasy, to travel back in time, and actually croak a dinosaur. Strict rules apply to the practice, since the faintest trace of altered events could have devastating consequences. Why it would be allowed to risk obliterating the present just for this is anybody's guess, but it provides for an intriguing time-travel premise. No surprise: some dimwitted merrymakers do something wrong in their Jurassic hunt, and after they return to the present, weird stuff starts happening.With the completion of this set up sequence, the film disintegrates, as it has already revealed all of its secrets, thus having nowhere interesting left to go. The creativity and imagination are pretty much extinguished, and the film is regulated to a stock battle for survival plot. There's a few moments of exotic creatures that exist in a \"revised\" universe, but nothing brilliant. Also, the \"waves\" leaving the \"old\" and \"new\" universes overlapping is just silly and cheap looking. Tropical palm trees growing (out of nowhere) in a still functioning time machine laboratory? No amount of artistic license can excuse such a shoddy set.The film wastes the rich material it was adapted from, and is aimless, ugly, and sloppy. Good for a couple of laughs only.",

Well needless to say I forgot about it, until last week when it came out on DVD.Well today I rented it regardless of the bad reviews I read. There has been so many people complaining about the special effects, acting, plot holes, and countless other things. While the special effects and the acting are not the best and the plot holes do exist, it is still a really good movie.If you want to see animals you never seen before this is one for you. You get to see monkysours (monkeys mixed with dinos), catfishcondas (catfish/Anacondas)and a batdactyl (bat/pterodactyl). You also get a glimpse at something the humans evolve into which looks like Abe off of Hell Boy.Also they have 'time waves' which I love. They were really cool. They sort of look like the ''bullet time' on The Matrix but these leave a destruction behind. Overall it's a good movie. Yes it has flaws, but every one does. The worst parts in the movie is not the t-Rex (or whatever kind of dinosaur it is) but when they are acting in front of the green screen.

Given the fact that my parents made the switch to BluRay a decade ago and haven't bought a film(let alone a DVD) in person since ~2006 (thanks to Amazon Prime and BestBuy Online), I could only figure that my mom purchased this some 14 or 15 years ago, and most likely only bought it because of Ben Kingsley's name being attached to the product.I saw the SCI-FI plastered all across the DVD case and read the Journey to the Center of the Earth/Butterfly Effect-fusion of a plot in the story outline of the back of the case and decided that i definitely had to give this a spin in my computer's dvd-rom optical drive (something that hasn't gotten much use since the era of Crysis over a decade ago). I never saw the 4.2 IMDb score, because I was afraid that if I looked up this movie on here then I wouldn't watch it because I was sure it was going to be panned. I was right.The film itself is a steaming pile. But it's got all the makings of a cult classic steaming pile. The premise and then set designs are actually excellent, married only by the GOD AWFUL cgi that litters half of the movie's screen space, since it looks like At least 50% of the film is shot in front of a green screen. The dialogue is third rate and the character logic is abysmal (why would you only use cryo weapons that fire ice bullets, when you could take a simple Zippo lighter and just set the poisonous-thorned brambles and vines on fire? And why wouldn't you shoot the baboon-lizard hybrids in their gigantic, 180-degree open maws when they are roaring straight at you instead of waiting and praying for a clean shot at their unarmored necks?), and the plot is a hackneyed and cliched mess. Despite its glaring flaws, however, the movie was still an easy watch that felt like it moved along quicker than its stated runtime. Despite its schlockiness, I actually enjoyed myself and watching the wooden lead character battle against the ripple effects of chaos theory.I gave it 7/10 because this is low rent b-movie excellence. If you don't have a stick lodged up in you like the professional critics who slammed this film with a 24%metacritic (because they obviously were expecting a Nolan-esque Interstellar twin), you'll enjoy this low rent experience, too.

This is the kind of thing I always see on Sci-Fi channel, watch for about 20 minutes, then realize there are better things I could be doing with my life.Yeah, there is a skeleton of a decent movie here. It feels as if all the dialog and scene-work were finished, but then, realizing the budget had been depleted, the production team had some close friends throw together the special effects on next to nothing. The backdrops and creatures are clearly fake, and they simply aren't digestible. This would be alright if it was a schlocky picture, but this is the kind of movie that floats by on special effects that are too ridiculous to be taken seriously.

            "content": "If you are reading this review, you probably read the first 4 pages of reviews, and they are some of the Brightest, Funniest, and Cogent remarks ever written , which is really the Greatest triumph of the film, \"A Sound of Thunder.\" A Ray Bradbury short story, has even a shorter life expectancy at the theaters, first and only run.. Mavbe it will make it as a \"Midnite Movie?\", possible ? All they have to do is add a couple of musical numbers, it could be done.Basically ,in 2055 a.d. time travel is made possible and entertaining as \"Time SafarI\" offers its clients the possibility of going back 65 million years to shoot a dinosaur. sound like fun, until the \"Butterfly Effect \" kicks in. Scientist turned time travel agent Ryer(Edward Burns) , is the lucky person who takes the people back in time to repeat the safari.Then, something goes wrong on one of the trips and time waves start to appear after their return. With each passing of the wave, evolution changes the reality, and weird things happen, and none of them are good.They really needed to re-edit the film and shorten some of the needless scenes, like when the Monkey Men attack the black guy. Way to long, and why didn't the hero just mercy shoot him, instead of letting the Monkey Men eat him alive, ?As for the CGI, the Dinosaur in Toy Story 2 looks MORE realistic... Like I stated, a lot of logic flaws, say, if you go back in time, and you open up a Time Hole, would the hole change history ?And , wouldn't you have a safety rail on the path ...? I appreciate a good Sci-Fi film, and Ray Bradbury was making a good point with his book, but the movie fails badly as drama, but succeeds on a hilarity level seldom seem...Also, it becomes ,ironically, TEDIOUS on a time level...Doesn't it ever end ?There were only 3 or 4 people in the audience when I went, which was a bad sign, since I had never seen ANY advertisement , and the film had set on the shelf for a couple of years, and they went BANKRUPT...BIG SURPRISE...That would have made a GREAT story....Even the March of the Penguins had a bigger audience !!!As the story goes , clich\u00e9s' abound, scientist can't die, hero HAS to fix things...on and on....not like the book....Where did the BUGS come from..? I wish I HAD gone to a free screening....Ben Kingsley was GREAT, as he plays the scenes over the top as he HAS TO ... it has to be exaggerated to some extent..it is Sci-Fi...if you underplay it, it won't work... Actually, the most significant point Bradbury makes intentionally or unintentionally is that YOU can make a difference positively or negatively as to how things shape the Future !! Now that's POWER!!!Anyway, wait for the SCI-FI channel to pick up this entry, and play it between Anaconda 1 and Anaconda 2.....I wouldn't hold my breath for the DVD...It gets a 5 only because it WAS based on Bradbury story, and everyone still gets PAID... I hate to slam any movie , but this one should be placed in limbo....",

Sure the power to the entire city is out- let's go to the university and use their \"particle accelerator\" that's now powered by a back-up generator.

I know the film is nearly ten years old, but there is absolutely no excuse for a film, pretty major at the time of being green lit, to have such poor special effects.They are so bad, they detract you away from what is going on in the actual narrative. It's as if the studio have released the test screening, because response was so bad, they decided to cut their losses.The script is terrible, McCormack and Burns have a hard time with the script, and Ben Kingsley is credited as Sir in this, so that tells you a lot.It's a shame though, because this film should be more notorious.

That is certainly demonstrated here! Pity this film is so illogical, both within conventional time-travel theory, but even within itself. How can they keep going back to the same point in time, and not encounter themselves, since the dinosaur kill is a fixed point in time? Yet, the whole premise of the film has them frantically trying to do just that, in order to put things back to normal, and restore their time line! It makes no sense.

Here, the changes in the evolution of nature don't come immediately but instead through a series of time waves. The acting and special effects were good too.This is certainly better than the effect in Ray Bradbury's original story \"A Sound of Thunder\", where stepping on a butterfly 65 million years ago only caused a change in the outcome of a Presidential election. Now that's too much of a stretch.My main problem with the movie, as a scientist, is that the movie completely overlooks the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Any interference with the evolutionary time line the travelers made during the age of the dinosaurs would have been greatly impacted by their mass extinction around 65 million years ago. However, no mention is made in the movie of the effect the mass extinction could have had on ripple effect caused by the killing of the butterfly.",

Anyway as time travel is not possible at present (as far as I know) no one can really know what would happen or what would constitute a significant enough change to affect the present, or for that matter if any change you make has already happened in the past so is required to maintain the present we have. Although I doubt that killing a butterfly would produce the extent of change depicted in the film (or if butterfly's even existed in the caroticus era), this is fantasy and anything is possible, if you accept that; this is not a bad movie.

            "content": "Coming from the director that supervised a classic like Outland in addition to at least plausible releases such as The Presidio and 2010, you can't help but wonder whether A Sound of Thunder is a firm heralding of Peter Hyams' professional twilight. How an accomplished filmmaker such as him signed on to a disaster like this remains a mystery, just as perplexing as the destruction of Ray Bradbury's venerable source short story.To pre-empt, what was a great read those many years ago now comes across as a poor imitation of vastly less intriguing concepts like Jurassic Park. Marred beyond recognition by shoddy production values and subpar performances, the original text barely makes a cameo amid the desolation.Thunder features Edward Burns and Ben Kingsley, two respected performers in roles they'd certainly live to regret. Burns plays one Dr. Ryer, chief scientist in a Total Recall-esquire firm specializing in time travel safaris, whisking ultra-rich clients 65 million years back to hunt for vicious dinosaurs. As greedy company owner Hatton, Kingley's hardly evident except for a whacky hairdo, whatever else he contributes (or tries to) makes absolutely no impression. There's some friction between his money-grabbing mantra and Burns' masculine idealism, however, you would need to be seriously bored to care either way.Naturally, like any story dealing in time travel and other meddling in the universal order of things, there's a cautionary note. Staff and clients must take care to avoid changing anything while in the past, lest repercussions chase them back to the present. We don't need to tell you this flimsy proviso lasts about as long as a short lived insect, but that's not where the surprise lies.What's surprising is how they went and utterly thrashed this project from start to finish. For starters, although set in 2055 Chicago, the cast is conspicuously British in mannerisms and accent. Save for re-colonization, what else could have brought about such a seachange remains obscured in horrible casting choices. Additionally, the CGI and other effects throughout simply suck, starting with the poorly textured dino and culminating in a flat, fake looking Chicago. They did try to include subtle touches like authentic bus colors and what not (those'll be familiar to windy city locals, nobody else), but in terms of appearance A Sound of Thunder makes straight-to-video look deep and invested.When things go awry, it's not limited to the story. Sure, inevitably some freaked-out client steps on a bug, sending devastating \"timewaves\" (those are visible and even make a roaring noise, by the way) towards an unsuspecting Chicago, where vines and other creepy crawlies emerge to take over the metropolis as reality devolves into a prehistoric jungle for some unknown reason.Only Burns and his posse can save the day, with not a peep from the National Guard. They battle several reasonably-conceived but poorly executed creatures while figuring out where and when the incident occurred so as to nudge things back on their proper track.That's the extent of it and clear indication you should give this one a miss. What was a very refined and startling Outer Limits-type story full of elegant suspense and menace became a garish, cheapened thrill ride minus the thrills. Embarrassing indeed for those behind this fiasco, the talent involved, and anyone gullible enough to pay for watching it.If there's any reason to rewind time, it's to prevent this from ever being made. Even if that takes stepping on a butterfly.Rating: * 1/2",

But, as a match made in hell, he must also re-create a prehistoric \"hunting ground\" for the rich, run by Charles. Folks pay big bucks to get a chance to bring down a T-Rex at their feet. Woowee! One day, a fellow scientist, Sonia (Catherine McCormack) invades the compound and gives everyone a severe tongue-lashing, especially Travis. According to Sonia, if anyone takes a creature away from the enclosed prehistoric world, even a butterfly, or makes any changes whatsoever in the habitat, it could have catastrophic consequences on the present world. Well, naturally, on the next trip, something goes awry and the world starts to change. Bugs get more plentiful, apes gain dinosaur-like features and the bats get much, much larger. Uh oh. Sonia and Travis, now allies, try to reverse the situation but, will they succeed? This is a complicated tale of the future, which never quite makes sense, but, which is interesting to the end. Who wouldn't like viewing humans do battle with an ape-a-saurus? The acting is fine, with Burns and McCormack doing respectable work, never over the top, and others like Jemima Rooper supporting them nicely. Kingsley, however, looks ridiculous, in wiry gray wig that gives him the look of an oldish Jamie Farr, and which makes his performance hard to appreciate. On the other hand, the art direction and action sequences, most made likely under budgetary restraints, are pretty darn enthralling. While the direction is quite lively, the story, based on a tale of Ray Bradbury, suffers from its complex translation to film and doesn't always seem plausible or coherent.

The slightest change in the past environment, or the slightest souvenir, willful or not, brought back from the past to the present will change the whole genetic perspective and the present will be transformed because the past will have been. One simple insect missing in the past may have drastic consequence son the evolution of life on the planet.Maybe one insect is a little bit too little, and yet that absent insect will mean that some other being on the chain will not find its food and some flowers will not get pollinated, and a whole drastic transformation may be introduced in the run of millions of years. Keep in mind each creature, each vegetal organism in this life is the prey of some predator, the food of some living organism. That basic Darwinian rules can cause miracles and catastrophes if it is tampered with.The film is just that kind of idea implemented in 2055. It is creative as for some of the beasts, though it is rather simple as for the general idea. Man becoming the prey of some new species was already worked on by H.G. Wells in his \"Time Machine\", and setting the future right by correcting the change in the past your inattention caused was the main argument of \"Back to the Futur\"e. So you should enjoy the simple plot and the beautiful adventure.The monsters are yet far from the creatures of \"Avatar\" or \"Aliens\" and the change seems to have blocked the evolution line so that no intelligent species of the human type was produced by the mistake. I doubt that one very much. If evolution there is and animal life there is Darwin's evolution of species can be stated as a general rule and an intelligent species should appear. That's why we can say that in the whole cosmos there must be several planets with intelligent life.

Yes, THE Ben Kingsley! The same man who played in such classics as GANDHI and SCHINDLER'S LIST. Like most of the crappy films they show on Syfy, this movie features quite a bit of fake-looking CGI effects. In this case, mainly dinosaur effects.Now here's the incomprehensible story: In the not-too-distant future, a team of scientists/ explorers have discovered a way of teleporting wealthy hunters back in time to the Jurassic period. They're led by Edward Burns as their guide, whose know-it-all smartass attitude quickly rubs you raw. Back in the Jurassic, they are given a five minute window of opportunity. Before a nearby volcano erupts, a terrifying Allosaur is about to become bogged down in a swamp. And the hunters have the chance of killing that dinosaur before the five minutes are up. They are given specific rules too: Don't leave the trail. Don't touch anything. Don't leave anything behind. However, as you might imagine, all does not go well. What follows is, literally, the butterfly effect. As now, back in the future, waves upon waves of evolutionary change occur. And yes, Edward Burns and an equally-excruciating female scientist must go back in time to set things right.Please gentle viewer avoid this film at all costs, even if you're a die-hard Ben Kingsley fan. This is clearly his worst role ever!",

How could someone make a movie so bad, based on a very good story?What's the huge flaw(s) for this film? Yes, there are some good special effects for this film but mostly, it's really bad, if you get what I mean. They don't mix and match well with the actors on screen. Fortunately, here and there, you get some great production values.Another flaw is the stupid logic and inaccuracies not made from the book. I'm not saying movies that don't follow the books is a bad thing but there is one thing in here that is so annoying, that they probably used it to make the movie more \"entertaining\" and \"suspensful.\"However, I do admire this film's potential to be entertaining. There are some parts in the film that certainly makes you feel like you're watching a popcorn film. I was thinking, why not make this film have a bigger budget and a bigger cast to make it a Hollywood blockbuster?This film certainly had a big potential, but there were just a lot of problems. It could've been an entertaining monster movie (with its situations set in a way where characters die one by one). In the end, it was a huge disappointment.

In fact, it's **SO** bad that the only reason I'm wasting words on this is to warn off other reasonable viewers who want to be intelligently entertained. You'll lose I.Q. points watching this. Come to think of it, it's not even suitable for mindless viewing because of the irritation factor. There's no guilty pleasure in watching something this incompetent.Reasons to avoid it:1) Horribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where this isn't sci-fi anymore, it's just mindnumbingly sloppy, lazy fantasy.2) It sports FX that are cheesy beyond belief. Not even cheesy-kitsch that's a wink and a nod, like vintage Doctor Who, but just cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting. The FX are so bad they're not even laughable. They spent about a dollar-fifty on this, not more.3) The direction is so weak and mindless that the only way the actors could make it through to the end of shooting without becoming terminally depressed was to sleepwalk through their roles, although Catherine McCormack made some effort anyway, probably on principle and despite the director. Moreover, this isn't Peter Hyams's only bad film: his flubs vastly outnumber any barely salvageable ones, of which Timecop was the last such, and that was 15 years before this writing. he's had nothing halfway decent since (End Of Days was just as slapdash, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed much firmer direction than Hyams provided). Hyams just keeps making it more and more pointless for anyone to consider giving him more work.And finally,4) Ray Bradbury's stories deserve far better treatment than this. Refusing to watch this film sends that message, not that Hollywood is particularly listening.Watch at your own risk. If you do and it turns you off movies altogether, you've only yourself (and Hyams) to blame because you've been more than adequately warned.",

Make no mistake, \"A Sound Of Thunder\" is really, really bad. It's got quite possibly the worst CGI I've ever seen in a movie that relies on special effects. Of course, you can blame it on bad luck because the studio had to fight with financial difficulties at the time of production, but with a script as full of plot holes and dodgy lines as this one I doubt that even under the best circumstances would this have become much better than say \"Paycheck\" - definitely not as long as Hollywood-botcher Peter Hyams was going to direct.Still, it's hard to mess up a premise as intriguing and promising as the one of Ray Bradbury's classic short story, although the makers of this movie really try their best by moving as far away from it as possible. There were a thousand ways they could have gone from Bradbury's outline, yet they chose to turn this into \"Evolution II\".Hell, the movie is still somewhat entertaining. Maybe I'm just a sucker for evolution-gone-wrong-movies, but I didn't really get bored watching this (although watching Edward Burns' wooden acting is about as exciting as watching paint dry).No, \"A Sound Of Thunder\" isn't a masterpiece and it's damn frustrating that it isn't.

Bradbury noticed and initially protested to EC, but the company and the author came to an arrangement whereby EC would adapt many of Bradbury's short stories to the comics medium, thus providing us comic readers with many wonderful comics stories.

Chances are the alteration of events could be very minor with one less butterfly from the Crustacean Era, but suppose that one-in-a-million occurs and the chain-reaction due to an altered event causes a disturbance, such as the one depicted in the movie. In general, a plot such as this may be undergo criticism as one with a far-reaching or far-fetched concept, stretching our minds too far over another type of time dilemma in the prehistoric past. But for the scientific and ethically-minded, the story supports a moral with a credibility factor yet unproven (i.e., there is no way to disprove the credibility of such a plot - time has already passed). Additionally, it is expressing a scheme of balance at an early point in time, where the felling of a clumsy dinosaur isn't necessarily a critical event (dinosaurs killed one another off and eventually became distinct from the ice age); but on the other hand - the other end of the spectrum - the delicate existence of a butterfly does matter. For skeptics, remember that the events we are focusing on are at a very beginning point in time-life history of our planet, where such an altered event could matter. In other words, the will of God's hand was to exact the very beginning of life with a thundering herd of dinosaurs balanced by the paradox of another side of life, one that is harmless although delicate The moral, of course, is the consequences of tampering with nature, even the mere act of killing a butterfly out-of-sequence with evolution.For entertainment, the film provides enough action to keep you riveted to the screen, but follows in a sense, the way other action-adventure films are made. This doesn't disqualify its uniqueness, however, for an adventure-type movie utilizing its own repertoire of villainous monsters (apparently mis-created due to the time-event accident).The acting may be a bit over-rounded in some places but with some spunk as well, the dialogue not intending to be the highlight of a time-puzzling sci-fi plot.",

I mean, well to me that one mistake made the whole movie great, the city was becoming a 65 million year old jungle. The futuristic setting was not that amazing but the jungle, now that is apiece of work. My most favorite creature was the huge prehistoric gorillas. There designs were great. Oh! yeah! not to mention the gun.That was outstanding. This is one of my favorite sci-fi movie. Some people could pay attention to this movie and not think about, \"Hey this movie sucks\". They should be think, \"Ok this movie may be great or not but it is OK\". So once again this movie is great.",

I rented the movie, very worried about 90-120 minutes of a movie based on a story that take up all of 14 pages. I was pleasantly surprised. As they did follow the general premise of time travel and its inherent dangers, they dropped the whole good government/bad government in the book version for just life in general. This is an entertaining movie, and other than some low quality special effects, is done well. Is it exact to the book? No. Does it do the book credit, yes.",

The question \"what if you change only something tiny 65 Million years ago\" is answered in a very cool and entertaining way.For SciFi fans this movie is the perfect Sunday evening movie. One and a half hour full of technic gadgeds, talking computers, time travel, bizarr man eating creatures and action. It is entertaining not more and not less.But if you are a CGI effect pixel counter and think that four year old CGI effects are so old school and ugly that it makes a movie un watchabel.

Interesting is that picture was very dark, so I need to go in some extra settings to make it lighter (was it maybe to cover 'not to developed' CGI? ). I looked for Ray Bradbury's short story with same title as movie. It is quite good, and well balanced - considering it's length.So, first problem with movie is title itself - it is shame to change book so much, and keep the title, especially because part of story where 'thundering' occurs is not present in movie.They put unnecessary textual intro where explained about time-travel in 2055, but all it can be guessed in first 15 minutes of movie. Then it starts right with 'dino-hunt'. Very lame made. I doubt that someone would pay lot of money for so limited hunting. In book limit was to not step out from path, and to shoot only marked animals. In movie was only one target, and whole 'hunting' looked pretty poor, not to mention bad CGI and even worse sound effects (nothing from 'thundering' allosaurus voice). However, as usual, script is worse part - it makes not sense. Limiting kills in area which will be destroyed after 5 minutes by big volcano eruption? And of course, whole 'butterfly effect' looses sense. I don't know origin of phrase - was it by Ray Bradbury? Of course, whole time-paradox issue is actually problematic, but at least Bradbury kept it on some reasonable level of logic.Then came some corrupted businessman whit glowing white hair. I needed couple minutes to recognise Ben Kingsley. Again ask myself: how such crap scenarios can attract good actors as Kingsley or Catherine McCormack? Or it was budget of (supposedly) 80 million dollars? Is CGI so bad, because they ran out of money?In second half of movie starts the 'monster chase' - is it obsession of Peter Hyams in last years? Cheap entertainment, instead of great possibilities with books 'alternative political reality'. Idea of 'time-waves' lacks any physical sense, and I really wonder why Hollywood likes to film scripts with such 'makes no sense, but sounds-good' rubbish.Too bad - I believe that with some decent script it could be much better. It would motivate more director, actors, set makers etc. But, as I saw there is lot of producers, and then usually nothing goes right. To say something positive: Catherine McCormack was pretty good in all this mess. Only because of her: 4/10 .",

            "content": "\"A Sound of Thunder\" was great. By that, I mean the short story. The movie on the other hand? Well, the premise is that they changed the past and now, it is changing the future. It happens in these time waves that look like tsunamis, and each time the wave changes one thing, until it eventually changes everything with a scientist and an anti-time travel software engineer trying to stop it. It's a cool premise, but it didn't work so well in the movie.\nA Sound of Thunder directed by Peter Hyams and written by Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, and Gregory Poirier. The main actors are Edward Burns, Ben Kingsley, and Catherine McCormack. It was released in 2005. A rich guy (Ben Kingsley), starts a time safari, where one of the tourists accidentally messes up time by killing a butterfly. Then, it is up to time traveling scientist Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) and the software engineer who designed the computer that controls the time travel, Dr. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) to go back in time and fix everything.\nA Sound of Thunder opens with the main characters on a safari, hunting an Allosaurus. After they kill it and return to the present, Travis (Edward Burns) meets Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack), who explains why they shouldn't be messing with the past. Travis explains why he is doing it and they form a mutual respect for each other. After the next safari goes awry, Travis goes to Dr. Rand's apartment, where they find that a time wave has hit and the world has started changing, which starts their journey to repair time and try to save the world.\nThe main character, Travis (Edward Burns), was a very interesting character. He is a scientist, safari guide, and he is the lead hunter on the safari. He is an antihero who is part of the Time Safari that messes with time for money. He claims he only does it to research extinct animals, but Rand doesn't believe him. He is also a static character, he does not change, or become better through the movie. He just fluctuates between smart scientist and Navy SEAL throughout the movie. It doesn't make him a super likable character, you just have to take the producer's word that he is a good guy and that he isn't just saving humanity to save himself.\nOverall, I'd recommend it to anyone who is willing to overlook plot holes and have a silly bad movie to convince yourself that even you could become a CGI artist in Hollywood. The CGI is pretty bad, the acting isn't near Oscar-worthy, and the dialogue can be juvenile at times. While I can recognize that this movie changed a lot, from actors to directors, was even shelved for a time, and ran out of money, I firmly believe it should have stayed on the shelf. It is a three out of ten in my book, only because it is just bad enough to make it enjoyable if you want that kind of entertainment.",

I have to say that this has to be one of the most unique takes on sci-fi that I have seen in a very long time.I agree that with a huge budget, this movie should have rocked. But if you don't go into it with any expectations it really is an entertaining movie. Don't pay any attention to the horrible special effects. When Travis and Jenny are walking down the street, I swear the same white bus passes her like 12 times! And don't pay attention to the logical flaws. The last species to evolve (humans) should have been the first species affected in a time wave. And whatever you do, don't pay attention to the dialogue. They actors have a way of overstating the obvious. \"Look over there\" \"What is that\"? It gets very tedious.If you can get past all of that and treat it as a low-budget sci-fi flick, then you just might like it.

With this risk comes others... changing something so small can turn into something much bigger. The operation is carefully planned out, but there is always room for error....\nThe film A Sound of Thunder is based off of the well known short-story written by Ray Bradbury. Directed by Peter Hyams, the film stars Edward Burns, Catherine McCormack, Ben Kingsley, and Jemima Rooper. A Sound of Thunder was released in the year 2005, after some financial difficulties that delayed the film's release. The film is of the science fiction genre- a company called Time Safari Inc. uses a time machine to bring its wealthy clients back in time to hunt a tyrannosaurus rex.\nA Sound of Thunder is about a series of trials faced by Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) and the rest of the staff at Time Safari Inc. Dr. Ryer is in charge of running the \"time safaris\", and he works closely with the rest of the time travel team to ensure that not even the most minute change is made to the past. Despite their efforts, one of the clients accidentally changes one tiny thing- and this leads to many other changes in evolution that are much larger. It is up to Dr. Ryer and his team to determine what is causing all of the changes in the modern world- and how to reverse the damage that has been done. It will be difficult though, and there are no guarantees that the change is reversible.\nThe concept of A Sound of Thunder is one that is actually quite intriguing. You wouldn't think that manipulating the small, insignificant life of a creature from tens of thousands of years ago could change the entire course of evolution. In general, the idea of time-travelling back to prehistoric times is mind-boggling, as it makes one wonder if that concept will someday be a reality in our world, which becomes more technologically advanced every day. What if someday, this movie doesn't seem so crazy and unrealistic? Anything can happen, and if you choose to look at the movie in a more serious light, it may lead you to ask the bigger question... is time travel really possible?\nOverall, I did enjoy the film when I didn't think about the cheesy special effects and mediocre script. I would recommend the movie to anyone who just wants a casual way to pass the time and doesn't have very high standards. For the most part, A Sound of Thunder is family friendly, but younger viewers may not fully understand the concept. There is also some foul language in certain scenes, as well as a couple of suggestive ones. This movie also has a roller coaster of a plot that can be slightly hard to follow, but anyone can get a kick out of it. This film will keep your attention, and it is one of those films that you \"love to hate\".",

            "content": "A Sound of Thunder is such a bad movie that it was actually extremely enjoyable. You can tell a lot of work went into it but it just didn't come out all that perfectly. It is amazing the time and effort that went into this and how little credit it gets for the writers and actors who had worked through the loopholes of time travel and acted through not having real backgrounds and antagonists in front of them. It made me embarrassed for the cast and crew, so much so that it made me want to be eaten by those baboon-lizards.A Sound of Thunder is based on the short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury. Being made in 2005, this movie most notably stars Edward Burns, Ben Kingsley, and Catherine McCormack. It also features Jemima Rooper, David Oyelowo, Wilfried Hochholdinger, August Zirner, William Armstrong, and Corey Johnson. This Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie was directed by Peter Hyams with the companies Dante Entertainment, Warner Brothers, Crusader Entertainment LLC, Franchise Pictures, and Forge. Primarily taking place in 2055, A Sound of Thunder tells the story of a corrupt time travel company that eventually causes mass destruction.2055, Chicago, there sits a place known as Time Safari Inc., a supposedly safe company, who takes the wealthy to hunt in prehistoric times. Run by money oriented Charles Hatton(Ben Kingsley), Time Safari has an array of employees who work hard to take clients safely on safaris. This crew is led by Travis Ryer(Edward Burns), and consists of the video keeper of the \"time jumps,\" Jenny Krase(Jemima Rooper); the engineer of the safaris, Marcus Payne(David Oyelowo); and Dr. Lucas(Wilfried Hochholdinger), who keeps track of the clients' vitals. However, this supposedly safe company is proven not so when one \"time jump\" goes awry. This causes a series of events and creates so-called \"time waves\" that hit their present world with washes of evolution. They then have to work side-by-side with the time machine creator, Sonia Rand(Catherine McCormack), in order to set everything back how it was. To do this, they have to work against the clock before one of the last \"time waves\" hits which would, in turn, cause humans to evolve.The beginning of this movie starts off with a group of travelers in a poor green screen, prehistoric, jungle. This moment set a low bar for the rest of the movie. It would have been so easy to step over and grow from that moment on. Then a CGI dinosaur walks out and somehow manages to knock that bar even lower. This first scene really set up the whole movie where it could've gotten better, but it didn't.The very movie itself is confused; it can't decide whether it wants to be good or bad. I felt like this was the result of someone's small idea that they wanted to create so badly, when it started to go down hill they refused to let it go or try to fix it. Every time you think the movie is going to get better, it hits you with poor dialogue, wonky CGI, or really awkward green screen skills. For example, near the end of the movie marks a suspenseful spot where they are in a subway. This suspense and realism is quickly killed by the computer generated visual of water crushing the train. Something with the physics of the CGI wasn't convincing; it definitely could've been refined to get that scientific, realistic touch. Or the strangeness and impossibilities of the baboon-lizards. This supports my stress of not taking this movie too seriously. A Sound of Thunder probably isn't what you want to watch if you're looking for a well thought out plot of a Sci-Fi or the thrill of a Horror film. This is more of a movie that is fun to watch, you just have to sit down with the intent of something fun and interesting, not serious. It really is an enjoyable movie if you're willing to see it as funny. The plot and dialogue is so strange and weird at spots, it is hard not to be captivated.",

Then, something goes wrong, and the entire course of history and time is changed, which throws the future into a unbalanced mix of mutant dinosaurs, forests and urban buildings in which our heroes must solve the mess they created.I thought this sounded like a perfect popcorn film, and has endless possibilities to be a great film. This is not a great film though.So I sat down, and watched. The first 10 or so minutes pretty much sum up what the rest of the film is going to be like. When the T-Rex came staggering onto screen, I was amazed, I was in awe, I was shocked at how bad the special effects were! It truly did look like a big gelatin blob, or a rubber toy. It wouldn't have been too bad if you were without the knowledge that Jurassic Park is about 12 years old and has far superior graphics to this film. I'm afraid it doesn't get better, all the creatures in this film looks unbelievably fake that its hard to enjoy the film. There's a sequence in which two characters are walking down a street, behind them are futuristic cars and buildings. It's so obvious that it was done on a blue screen and overall it just makes you want to cry.The story itself is full of huge plot holes that in effect ruin the film and its progressive story. However, it is not the worst film I have ever seen, and even though I was disappointed, I still think the premise was a good one. Next time though, the filmmakers should know they have enough money before setting out to do a film like this, as audiences demand decent SFX.

This was their final film with Warner Bros who obviously couldn't wait to terminate their contract, as this film is in unreleasable condition. It's a generic dumb as nails big budget film with no money shots because the visual effects are all pre- viz, which makes this look like Z grade Mystery Science Theater quality. Even if the effects were polished, it would still be weak with a boring lead performance from the always boring Edward Burns. But as it stands the effects are so hilariously awful they never let this movie rise above the bottom of the trash bin. Despite Franchise's money woes, neither them or Warner's felt this was a film worth finishing and you can't blame them.",

As a result of this, the poorly animated CGI city of the future is now infested with equally poorly animated CGI monsters who all look the same and share the same hunger for heroic dying black people. Time to run around screaming for a bit! Eeeyaugh! As we reach a deeply moving conclusion in which the life of an innocent butterfly is saved, we come to the shocking realization that maybe stupid idiots sending even stupider idiots with cool guns back in time to lay waste to history isn't such a good idea as it originally seemed.Well a few good life lessons can be learned from this movie: 1. Don't use a time machine as a thrill ride.2. Don't be black. If you are black, you will find a way to die heroically and horribly, and usually very expediently as well. This holds true for almost all major motion pictures.3. Don't change the timeline. If you do, the future you return from will be infested with poorly animated CGI monsters and bad actors reciting clich\u00e9 scripts! 4. Don't buy this movie. Renting it will suffice since you will never watch it again anyway.Not a horrible movie, but definitely not the brightest I've ever seen.",

Do not blame Ray Bradbury, who I sincerely hope has not seen it, as his short story is one of his many moments of brilliance and could make an excellent short.There are chances to marvel. How did Ben Kingsley ever get involved, and where did he get that toupee? Is Edward Burns truly that dull an actor? And why is every character so extremely unlikable? The conversations between Burns (as Ryer) and Catherine McCormack (as Dr Rand) would almost have some substance if not for Burns using the high impact emotion of wet cardboard and McCormack delivering almost every line with a machine gun staccato.Ryer's logic for travelling in time is an almost reasonable wish to recreate lost animals, killed by a mysterious virus by 2055. Rand though is seriously flawed. The character who built the time machine because she is, \"a scientist\", expecting that if it remained in the hands of the scientists, rather than the company who paid her to create it, it would not be abused. It's a time machine. How can it not potentially affect time?These time affects make little sense too. Although the changes sometimes come in \"time waves\", which don't logically centre on the origin of the change, the time safari building itself, sometimes they don't. The centre also seems to still be operational even when overgrown due to these changes and who realistically builds park benches and hot dog stands in places with dangerous creatures. Some of this criticism can be waived due to the collapse of the original production company but Peter Hyams has directed far better pictures and should be ashamed of helming this mess.There is simply little to recommend throughout. If you are a fan of the short story this will simply leave a very bad taste and each actor has appeared in far better works. The one main concern is that writer Thomas Dean Donnelly is also involved with the upcoming Uncharted and Dr Strange franchises. Hope for a change of form.",

I'm a big fan of classical science fiction - not bug eyed monsters or fantasy sorcerers and dragons, but of imaginative stories that are based on hard scientific data of today, with allowance for some poetic license, and I think this movie fits that description. It's based on a Ray Bradbury story, beefed up and modified for the screen, and I for one think they did a good job. Yes, the special effects were a little weak in some spots, but overall this was a good scifi movie with an engaging story, lots of action, and some edge of your seat thrills.

This movie is a bigger disaster than what is happening in the movie. You start hoping that it does come true and mankind is whipped out before it can make something like this. I truly admire Ray Bradbury, I read much of his work. He did the right thing, when the hunting party returned they found out something had changed, of course the people who stayed in the present didn't notice, only the time travelers). Then Ryan shoots Eckels for leaving the path (that is the sound of thunder). Now in Hollywood this story is too short so they had to make it a bit longer. They invented the time waves that gradually change everything and of course it does result in evil monsters.Now I can also start about the special effects, which are in most cases a joke but never mind.

Based on the 1952 short story by Ray Bradbury, I couldn't help but continuously think of \"The Simpsons\" Treehouse of Horrors parody, \"Time and Punishment\" (see below) while watching Peter Hyams's film.\"If you ever go back in time, don't touch anything. Even the slightest change can alter things in ways you can't possibly imagine.\" Truer words were never spoken. While Travis Ryer (Ed Burns, the poor man's Ben Affleck) and his crew of Temporalnauts respect this prime directive, the clients of Time Safari's boss man Charles Hatton (Sir Ben Kingsley) do not. The inadvertent death of a butterfly proves out Grandma Simpson's admonition, causing literal ripples in time that really ruin Ryer's day. His present day timeline changes with \"time waves\" that bring about a surge in plant life, bugs, and some odd hybrid creatures like the vicious baboonosaurus. It's up to Ryer, his team, and the grouchy Dr. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) to put things right again. Will they make it? Of course they will. The real questions are \"What order do they die in?\" and \"What is Sir Ben Kingsley doing in this film?\" Another puzzling aspect to the film is the budget. Was everything spent on catering? Certainly, very little was donated to special effect work. Street scenes feature actors walking against backgrounds of looping \"futuristic\" cars that look like they were accomplished with chroma-key effects done at the local Public Access Cable studio. A SOUND OF THUNDER was doomed not only by its horrible effects but by the cinematic saturation of the Novikov self-consistency principle. The film was the fourth of four films. While two others, John Woo's PAYBACK (2003) and Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber's THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT (2004), shared the same core idea they boasted far better marketing. A SOUND OF THUNDER was all fury and no thunder when it came to marketing, coming out with a whimper only equal to Richard Donner's forgettable TIMELINE (2003).It would be a few years until another such timeline film would get that amount of funding; Tony Scott's DEJA VU.

I having read the book thought it strayed way too much from the book and is a horrible way of interperting Mr.Bradbury's masterpiece.I liked the book very much but this movie was bad. First they used cgi in every scene they had in the city which looked very fake. The cars... They only had 2 real cars built all the others were fake. I am not saying don't use CGI but if you saw minority report or I Robot, those CGI were done much better.Acting, The only person who was even believable was the main character Edward Burns. All the other characters needs some work...Moving on the script was poorly written, tho in the movie there were some comic relief which is good but not enough to save the movie The ending is different from what Mr.Bradbury intended and seems just too unrealistic even for a Sci-Fi. The time travel theory they used seems improbable mainly because I know of other theory that is more widely accepted (of course the average viewers don't know as much as I do so they should be OK)",

Obviously this person is not too bright and didn't pay attention to what he/she was watching. The butterfly would have been killed by natural causes if the volcano erupted and killed it. The butterfly's life was ended by someone stepping on it who should not have even been there and ended it's life unnaturally, altering the butterfly's natural evolution and it was brought back on the bottom of the killers boot, changing things three fold...don't touch, don't change, don't bring back...HELLO? Thats why the time travelers would always go into the past with the safari party a few minutes before the t-rex would attack and make everyone wait before shooting & killing it because right before the travelers would kill the t-rex, the t-rex would meet its death at that point in time in the tar-pit, so they were not altering the death of the t-rex..he would die anyway and they knew this fact.Anyway...it's definitely the sleeper of the summer and a definite DVD \"I can't wait for\" release...hopefully with lots & lots of extras!",

I'm going to guess that if they had not run out of money while filming and producing this monstrosity, it would have turned out better than the sad excuse for a Sci-Fi movie that \"A Sound of Thunder\" is.In the short story version of \"A Sound of Thunder\" (the enjoyable version), from Ray Bradbury, the characters actually have some depth to them and they are fairly intriguing. Travis, played by Edward Burns, was putting me to sleep with his so- called \"acting\". There was not a single actor in this movie that entertained me, I'm almost positive that the cast aren't even actual people, they seem like robots. The actors had zero sincere emotion in anything they said, it was almost like Siri and Alexa were the main characters of the film.Let's break down this already decomposing and rotten plot some more, shall we? The film depicts a bunch of fat rich people paying for top-of-the-line entertainment, a prehistoric safari, sound familiar? In these safaris, the clients/customers pay to go in and hunt down dangerous, predatory dinosaurs with liquid nitrogen bullets? But when they are returning from the expedition something isn't right, Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) suspects that something is wrong, so he goes to consult Dr. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) for some explanation. The two figure out that something had to have been brought back from the safari, thus altering the present. The real action happens when these \"time waves\" start to hit, these horrendously CGI rendered \"time waves\" cause changes to occur in the present day, turning the present back to the past. The goal of the Geek Squad was to go back into the past and prevent the change to set things right and return the present back to normal.This movie is just bad, it doesn't deserve the attention that I am giving it by writing this review, which turned out to be quite lengthy...

Produced in 2005 by Franchise Pictures, this movie cost around 80 million to make, yet grossing only about 11 million.

Look all you need to know is go back in time, kill dinosaurs, make an oopsie and BAM! Now there is super predators in the modern era. Crazy, unexpected, mind blowing stuff really. On a more serious note this movie meant to explore the butterfly effect and how the small and benign things that happen every day can blow out of proportion give enough time. Basically don't step on that bug or you may be ripped to shreds by the flying monkeys from The WIzard Of Oz.I think if I had to pick an important scene that I feel exemplifies this movie I would say the scene where they enter the time travel room with the creatures sleeping is it.

Unfortunately it was completely destroyed.In this tragic rewrite of a classic tail the story opens well and consistently with what Bradbury wrote but after that it goes horribly wrong. Upon returning from the second trip to the past the present begins to change. Events called \"Time Waves\" pass through changing nearly everything as they pass. We're warned that with each wave evolution will change from the lower order to the higher with humans changing last.As the characters move through an increasingly dangerous Jurassic Park like environment they seek to understand the change they made in the past that cause such a change in the future. Eventually they discover that one of their clients killed a butterfly in the past and that caused all the changes in the present.While this was the premise of Bradbury's story, it quickly falls apart when we discover that seconds after killing the dinosaur a volcano erupts which would have killed the dinosaur if it hadn't been killed by the clients. Somehow we're supposed to believe that the pyroclastic flow that killed the dinosaur and laid waste to the forest spared the butterfly. Can you say \"Oh Please\"? Even if we can forget a plot gap so large you can fly a 747 through it, the special effects were terrible. There were several street scenes where it was more than obvious that the actors were filmed on blue screen and the rest of the action digitally added. It had that same unreal quality we saw in films of the 40's - 70's, people moving out of sync with the background.Somehow this got 4 stars, as far as I'm concerned that's 2 stars too many.",

Both for acting and script I found it to be the rare caliber I didn't feel the need to get into character backgrounds but still cared for who \"died\"--Well except Ben Kingsley's character. There's nothing redeeming about greedy Mr. Hatten.This is a film that is good on the eye--the guys are so-so. What got my attention the set designs, the metropolis and the gradual descent from civilization to the primeval chaos. Where can I get the taxis? The CGI images blended in realistically. The dinosaurs were standard. Although seen repeatedly the \"time wave\" fx didin't bore. If there's anything about the movie's props I found irksome--the prehistoric baboons--good God, hanging from the ceiling???? Just that and only that pulls my rating this a 9 to 8.",

It is the eighties no more.Was there even a credit for FX in this film, do those guys have an 'Alan Smithie' they can use if required. Seeing as this dross was shown on the Big Screen, you can see how Primeval gets the green light for TV. Hey.. maybe that's where the FX guys went next.The biggest crime is that they managed to get some real acting talent in for this film.

But as i watched it i knew the director and the cast had more in mind when they shot it... it has a want and a need for scope and scale... their version of the city of the future has some great ideas but it's executed sooooo poorly... i currently play video games that have better graphics which saddens me... how could this movie come out today and come into theaters with CGI FX like these... the dinosaur they kill looks awful and they blur it at times to cut down on the fact that it hasn't been finished... all the special effects look like tests or half finished ideas... like they literally ran out of money and threw this all onto film and slapped it in theaters... what bothers me is that all this movie needs is a better director, a little bit more money and a decent CG house to do the effects and you'd have a killer film... a b-movie to be sure... but one you could enjoy with friends on a Saturday at the cinema...This screenplay is good... this movie is bad... if we're going to be doing anymore remakes in Hollywood this next year i hope Spielberg will take a look at this and say \"hey yeah... i've got nothing better to do\"...",

This could have been a really great scene. There is a seed of a good idea in the mix. I've never read the Ray Bradbury story this was based upon but I have a feeling that the core of the concept, that is, what could have made this movie a real thought provoker, is buried by the semi-good acting and distracting half-conceived special effects. Ben Kingsley actually shines in the movie - but no one else does. The computer, TAMI, was more memorable than any of the other cast. As for the effects? Nothing disappoints me more than seeing what could have been a really good effect wasted because it was half-finished. The baboon-lizard creatures are actually a good idea and quite frightening but are frequently stiff and cartoonish. Too bad. All other creatures are disappointing in the 'could have been great but falls annoyingly short' category. Perhaps a wasted moment came after the 'final time wave' and the viewer gets a glimpse of what humans would become. I know I was curious. And then there it was - and there it goes. The depth of this movie can be summed up with that brief encapsulation - nearly no thought went into the conception of the neo-human. There it is....it blinks...the end. It might have been more interesting to get a bit of reaction from this new creature - but no. Why start making a movie with substance now when it is nearly over? Bottomline: I didn't hate the movie really. It only came close to being unwatchable. I was mostly irritated by what it could have been. Thus, it ends up being a waste of the space-time continuum.",

They when they come back, they find numerous *subtle* changes to the world they left, and eventually realize that a small mistake they made in the past caused them.In this movie, they go back in time to kill a dinosaur, and... that's pretty much where the similarity ends. Time travel stories are usually problematic, but this one throws all logic and reason out the window, not to mention the fact that there are plot holes you can drive a bus through.Even with a bunch of extra stuff thrown in, they still have to pad the movie with superfluous and annoying action sequences to stretch it to the requisite run time.And let's talk about the quality. When I started watching this, I assumed it was a low budget made for SyFy movie, but this came out in *theaters*. I guess the budget was slashed and they couldn't afford the post production processing they had planned to do. The result is that the dinosaur looks like a theme park animatronic, and large parts of the movie are really obviously shot on green screen. It's hard to believe this came out 12 years *after* Jurassic Park.The only bright spot is Ben Kingsley, who can even bring some class to this train wreck. Besides that, it's not fun enough even to hate watch.The original short story was made into an episode of The Ray Bradbury Theater. You can find it on YouTube.

            "content": "Supposedly based on a classic Ray Bradbury short story, \"A Sound of Thunder\" does a great disservice to the science fiction master. A potentially great plot becomes a two-dimensional rip-off of such superior films as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Time After Time.\" First of all, I know that you generally have to suspend belief for science fiction. At the same time, however, you do have to have your basic facts straight. The plot involves Time Safari, a company run by Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley in a wasted role as the stereotypical greedy businessman), that takes rich clients 65 million years into the past to hunt the dreaded Allosaurus. During one such hunt, a glitch with the weaponry causes someone to leave the guide path and interact with the environment. This causes time ripples that change the present. The company's main guide, Travis Ryer (Edward Burns of \"Saving Private Ryan\" & \"American History X\") must team up with renegade scientist Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack of \"Braveheart\" & \"Spy Game\" in the stereotypical role of the beautiful lady scientist) to correct the mistake.As each time ripple washes over the world, things get worse. Plant life runs amok. Carnivorous insects appear. The descendants of dinosaurs make fast food of the human race.From the get-go, the film gets the facts wrong. The Allosaurus hunt is set for 65 million years in the past, yet this particular dinosaur had already been extinct for 80 million years at that point.A company doctor warns two clients not to interact with the ancient environment, explaining that they might kill a butterfly that would then not pollinate a flower that might not germinate to bear seeds to feed an animal and so on and so on until someone is not born who should be or someone stays alive who should die. Yet, when the time ripples emanating from 65 million years ago wash over the city, nothing really changes. All the buildings stay around. All the people stay around. All the fake-looking CGI cars stay around. Nobody suddenly ceases to exist. None of the technology that makes the time jumps possible is affected. It's as if the city were suddenly picked up and tossed into another dimension.Burns is the only watchable thing in the film. Ben Kingsley appears to be embarrassed to be in the movie. McCormack is rather blas\u00e9. Jemima Rooper (TV's \"Sinchonicity\" & \"Hex\") is annoying as the snot-nosed rookie Jenny and David Oyelowo (\"Last King of Scotland\") does his bit as the required token black guy.The worst thing is the special effects. The CGI looks bad. The allosaurus seems to be made out of gelatin. The futuristic cars are CGI and appear rough and distorted around the edges. The actors obviously look to be walking next to screens and, in one scene with Rooper and Burns, appear to be walking in place. CGI animals in the future (or present) don't interact well with the scenery (for instance, an eel glides through water without making a ripple).Apparently, this movie was in and out of theaters over the 2005 Labor Day weekend. I'd originally contemplated taking it in, but wisely decided not to when I saw that it didn't even crack the Top 20 in sales in its debut weekend. I got it at one of Blockbuster's 4-for-$20 events. Even $5 seems like a waste, though.Do yourself a favor. Pass this up. If you bought it like I did, go back in time and put it back.",

Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan.Let's get down to the big issue here.The visuals were so incredibly bad, I thought I was watching an old \"Dinosaurs In 3D\" CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean, I've seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean, heck... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one.The lizard-monkeys were laughable. I thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from \"Killer Instinct\" I've seen better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it.You know, there's a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channels \"The Shining\" get such a small audience, but this load of \"CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz\" gets put out in the open? I don't care if it's a Ray Bradbury story.

And I mean every department.Ed Burns is the only decent actor in the whole thing. Even Ben Kingsley looks embarrassed to be here and rushes through a mediocre by the numbers (and thats being kind) performance so he can get on with some real movies. Everyone else in the movie is utterly forgettable. The special FX are bloody awful and half of them don't look like they are even finished. There are one or two that look OK but- actually no I'm not going to stand up for this movie. Sound of Thunder really has no business whatsoever being on the DVD shelf at your local rental store (was it even released in theaters?) and Franchise pictures (who the hell are they, never heard of them and if this is any indication of their products then I don't ever want to hear from them again) should be shot for allowing an obvious work in progress, and not a very good one at that, out into the market in this state.And what the hell does Peter Hyams think he's pulling here. I mean he has some decent flicks under his belt (Capricorn One, 2010 and The Relic, even the mediocre TimeCop was OK on a base level) but this movie feels like it's been directed by a two year old. A two year old, I might add, whose slightly older brother was dragged in to do the editing as well. Most, if not all, of the outside shots that had actors in them were shot using a CGI backdrop which looks so obvious it's laughable. Like they couldn't take a couple of cameras downtown and shoot something more convincing (and probably less expensive).The sound also was uneven with the sound levels going up and down during scenes for no reason whatsoever.I'd rather gouge both my eyes out than sit through this again it was that painful. No actually I'd rather watch Alone in the Dark than watch this movie.Although, if you've got some mates round with some tins and a pizza then you might want to give this a rental so you have endless fun ripping it to bits.

I recall that there were many layers to the story line including the butterfly. Ray Bradbury was a master of small stories, and this one is right up there with Martian Chronicles. The movie does not even touch any of Bradbury's meanings, but the movie does lay out the story visually. So the CGI effects are kind of cheesy.

I rented it and watched the movie where it belonged in the first place, on the television.Maybe you all read Bradbury's short story on which this movie is based, and you were all expecting some kind of Spielberg/Peter Jackosn epic. C'mon, director Peter Hyams does not have that kind of talent, although his resume is not completely awful. I think by comparison, The Butterfly Effect was a much better movie and executed the same plot much better, too. I thought the movie was entertaining-Ben Kingley's hokey acting proves that(most) actors won't turn any role down for a quick paycheck. His presence in the film, white hair and matching thin soul patch, are all nauseating. Yeah, the blue screen stuff was terrible in a very funny sort of way, like the phony walking-down-the-street scenes with Edward Burns-hilarious stuff!

In the subway scene, there were three left, and I knew that the younger girl was going to be eaten or killed in one way of the other: Wait, 3 seconds later it happened. Then right when they were going to save the world, the baboon-lizard things break in and then a time-wave strikes. Come on, can't get more predictable then that. BUT; the plot is mostly imaginative. There were dinosaurs only during part of the movie and not in the future when it get screwed up. I liked how they made the baboon-lizard things and the eel (which scared the crap out of me). The idea of the future being messed up over a period of a few days because one of the rich guys stepped on a butterfly; was interesting.

It's no secret how it will end, so I'm not giving anything away by revealing a little of the plot.

THe acting in this movie is really lousy. THe actors deliver the lines as though they are reading them from a teleprompter which makes it very very monotonous throughout the movie. Next, the backgrounds. As fake as fake could be. They go back to the backgrounds of the 30's. I don't think you are supposed to laugh at this movie but I found myself laughing out loud 3 times. One in particular Id like to mention is when Ed Burns and McCormack are walking together through the city. THis particular scene is so ridiculous that I almost guarantee you will laugh. THey are walking. THe screen behind them is moving and you can see how they are simply picking up their legs and putting them back down rather than actually walking (Unless people actually do just walk from side to side lol). Another humorous scene is when Burns asks McCormack what will happen as far as the screw up in time goes and McCormack asks how long its been since the jump, when they jumped into the past. Burns says \"24 hours, almost exactly\" and she says \"Well Look\" and opens the window shade JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE TIME WAVE COME THROUGH!!\". Then she explains that its going to happen every 24 hours and exactly what will happen each time it comes through. Never in the movie do they explain how she knows all this, she just does. One of the other laughable scenes if when you see monsters that the Dinosaurs and Apes have evolved into. First of all they look extremely fake, as do all of the monsters in the movie. I would compare the monster CGI to an average video game. Take my word for it, this is NO Jurassic Park. In fact the Tyranosaur is so cheesy you would think it came from a cartoon, its that bad. THink \"Land of the Lost\" only worse. Anyway, since they screwed up time and changed everything the Dinosaurs apparently didn't disappear. They \"evolved\". Dinosaurs and apes must have somehow figured out a way to mate in the past because what we have is Dinoapes or you might call them apeosaurs. Whatever you call them, RIDICULOUS is a word that fits. Simply put, they look like man size lizards with baboon faces. And they walk both on all fours and upright. At one point in the movie Burns makes the comment \"They have really evolved\". THey have? Into Apeosaurs! Crimeny what crap this movie is. Now, don't get me wrong. For some serious laughs and to be astounded by some serious lousy acting and cheesy CGI this movie is worth the viewing.

But neither does the classic giant monster movie, \"The Beast From Twenty Thousand Fathoms\", compare to \"The Fog Horn\". The Harryhausen-driven SFX movie didn't have any of the melancholy poetry of the original short story.And this movie doesn't either. Not when you compare it to the master's original. But the story, with some corny, stereotypical moments, is a decent SF thriller. The effects are awesome and the overall pacing of the story is good.If you're looking for a good way to waste a couple of hours, and not expecting something like Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" or Scott's \"Blade Runner\", this might be worth a look.And do yourself a favor afterwords, read the original story (and \"The Fog Horn\"). Beautifully crafted short stories.As to Ben Kingsley? Maybe, like Max Von Sydow in \"Flash Gordon\" or \"Strange Brew\" or Maximilian Schell in \"The Black Hole\", he just wanted to have some fun making a movie.",

The movie is basically about time travel to the past back in the dinosaur days and the purpose of going back to the past is to bring these billionaire to past is a part of this big cooperation to make money off of a scientist machine Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) who built the machine but its Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) and a team of his bring these multi-billionaires to the past to encounter a t-Rex if you will and shoot it down. You maybe asking but if they shoot the t-Rex wont that cut a glitch in the time-line well no because Mr. Ryer and friends set a 5-minute timing on t-Rex just before a volcano explodes and eventually kills the t-Rex. So they jump to the past a few times more until they have 2 odd couple billionaires wanting to jump to the past but one of which is starting to get second thoughts about going but his buddy convinces his to live on the wild side. So they all make the jump to the past once again and they wait out until the t-Rex comes then well something goes wrong with the guns and they aren't firing so Mr. Ryer try's to distract the t-Rex while the 2 billionaire run away like any billionaires would in this situation. Eventually Travis Ryer got his gun to work and shoot the t-Rex. Once they go back they notice their changes to time-line and their time-waves that are affecting everyone. Ryer and friends have the unfriendly task of finding out what altered the time-line, they track down the 2 billionaires one of which stepped on a butterfly not lying here, now they have the dangerous task of going back to the past where the original jumped took place there's only one problem they'll only have 15 seconds to warn themselves in the past. Confusing I know it was at that part of the movie I decided I'll go see the transporter 2, this I not a movie even worth buying I don't know how it made it to the big screen I'll never know. ALL IN ALL this was a badly done movie none of the actors had no to little facial expressions I mean when they had one of the team members ends up getting attack by some dis-informed app-monkeys nobody screamed or showed any worry to the situation, when the movie first started I noticed how badly done CGI computer generated images the cars don't even look real and neither does the city very unbelievable, my first thought of this movie was this must have been a low budget movie I find out on IMDb they spent 80 million dollars on this that movie, the money definitely didn't go to the actors. Am giving this movie a 2/10 just for the concept of the movie.",

One night I was sitting at home debating about what to rent on demand, and I previewed this movie. In the preview the only CGI effect shown was the dinosaur, that was a pretty sucky image, but I figured that was just one flaw and the rest of the movie would be great especially with Ed Burns and Ben Kingsley on the screen--I was wrong. Not only did this movie not in anyway follow the story, but the effects were quite possibly the worse ones I had ever seen (no exaggeration). I don't even think I saw one scene that wasn't computerized in some place. Just about the only effect I did like was when each \"wave\" hit and everything went in slow-motion and the audio got choppy.The adventure would have been great if it didn't look so damn fake. It got boring because of the lack of quality. A lot of pointless parts were included as well, when the first scientist died he was getting delirious and telling some story about how is family members got him a telescope or something, that made me feel embarrassed to be watching this film. Several parts were stupid and very (for lack of a better word) corny.The idea of the movie was actually entertaining and could have been excellent, but the graphics and acting killed it for me. Ed Burns also happens to be an excellent actor. Even though his acting wasn't as up-to-snuff as usual in this picture, his role plus a storyline with potential just locked in a 4 out of 10 star vote from me.",

The story is set 50 odd years in the future where rich eccentrics pay a team to take them back in time to the cretaceous period to hunt dinosaurs. The main rule of time travel is don't change anything, no matter how small. However, on one of the trips something is changed that has disastrous effects on the evolution chain. The team have to work out what was changed and rectify it before history catches up with them and the results of an altered history become permanent.

I had this feeling that this movie would be slightly better because Sir Ben Kingsly was in it. He was Ghandi for crying out loud and won an academy award. No dice.

But I did not bother that much, since a good SciFi story can also be interesting to watch, when the CGI is cheap or not so prominent (also I can enjoy rather old SciFi films, when it is interesting -- like \"Millennium\" with laughable special effects for todays standard, but rather viewable and not so predictable story).BUT this film tries to hard to be a blockbuster with \"big action\" that it absolutely must disappoint. I hoped to get at least an interesting story. But as much as it fails to deliver \"big action\" it also fails to deliver a really interesting story. And further more, it does to much stealing of story elements from other films. I even was remembered of the \"Triffids\" ... and that is a bad signal. From that point on, the film got worse and worse.The film starts rather good (aside from the bad CGI, that really can put you of). Ben Kingsley was really good as the clever and reckless business man. The story unfolds rather interesting and the writing is not that bad (in the beginning). It contained some rather good humor, writing and acting. But after a while it gets lost in all that monster fights, that seam to say: Hey, we can't have a solution now -- the film must be at least 90 minutes ... and we have fired off all our good ideas in the first 25 minutes -- we now don't have an other idea than throwing yet another bunch of CGI on the actors.So, we come to the situation, that the SciFi film converts to a slasher video. We start out with seven or so actors ... and after 80 or so minutes one or two of them are left. This is so predictable.You see nothing, that was not done before (SciFi-wise, CGI-wise and Action-Wise) in better quality. Many ideas are plain copied. Also the base story was filmed at least once before.Also there are some really bad logical errors contained. The biggest one: The change in the past is coming in waves, but in the moment, the change is changed back, this change is coming immediately -- why?? But there are also worse logical errors and gaps contained which are not explained at all. I would also rather have a more elaborate ending and cut off one or two of those CGI fights which did not add to the story at all. So, the ending was the biggest disappointment ... also because of the big list of gaps and \"illogicalities\" it contains alone.To round it up: I had hoped to find a little more substance -- and even with rather good performances from some actors (Kingsley, Makatsch) all in all, the film can not satisfy, since so many older films provided more substance with similar stories (e.g. Millennium, Jurrasic Park, .....) The start of the film could have been an 6/10 -- but with the middle part and the weak ending, it is 4/10. The really interesting part are the first 25 minutes or so, after that it gets more and more predictable and the finish is to much clustered with story-gaps. Instead of an interesting twist (which I hoped for) they just \"gap\" the resolution out. The extremely weak ending alone costs the film at least one point in my voting.",

The time travel issue is merely a pretense for silly chases and bad acting. Apart from few minutes in the beginning, the entire movie displays the lack of money and the un-inspiredness of playwrights and director. I didn't even watch the movie to the end. Summary: Waste of time.",

The effects of futuristic Chicago are pretty bad, but the creatures they encounter are pretty realistic. Watched it with the family and it scared them. The acting was pretty straightforward B movie, but it had more thrills than the Grudge or the Ring. The concept is the same basic one as the Butterfly Effect or even 13 going on 30....if you change something in the past, it has big implications on the future.

            "content": "Given the conciseness (about 10 pages) of the Bradbury short story on which \"A Sound Of Thunder\" is based, it was inevitable that any movie version would have to take some liberties with the source. That would be putting it mildly for this film, which strays far and wide from its base. And yet, in its own Hollywood way, the movie stays true to the central concept of the story - how the smallest alteration of a long-past event could have ramifications cascading far into the future.That the dialog and acting have flaws is not unique to \"Thunder's\" literary-to-screen transition, and those flaws did not take so much away from my enjoyment of the file that I was truly dissatisfied. I did not see this movie in a theater, but on HBO, with someone who'd not read the story. Although HBO's own synopsis declared the film a \"shoddy\" adaptation, both of us felt that might be just a bit strong.Many of the FX in \"Thunder\" seem derived from other modern sci-fi films - Aliens to Star Wars and much else. Occasionally it displays some originality. If it were a little more well done, I'd give it another star or two. In fact, I'll give it an extra half-star for not having any tedious, contrived romantic sub-plots (at least I don''t remember any). When I saw this movie, I hadn't even known it'd made the transition from printed page to film, so I had no expectations. It's obviously not a major work and may not stand up to repeated viewings, but I was happy enough with what I saw.",

However when you saw the people close up walking down the street you could tell it was the green screen scenery going by. I have also seen this effect when they shoot in cars but not always. In fact once in Seattle I saw a movie being shot with a car scene. What they did was put the car on a trailer and shoot from the truck that was pulling the trailer with the car. That way everything looked natural such as the reflections going by.A lot of the scenes of 2055 Chicago looked OK. Then this same Chicago got invaded by more and more plants and then animals. I guess you would have to make a set for that and then add more plants and animals as each time wave comes by.Those pre-historic scenes looked much better with all those plants but you could tell those animals as well as the animals that came in time waves to Chicago looked like they were made of rubber.When the movie started you saw WB and then Franchise Pictures presents. No mention was make of the Franchise going under then or during the closing credits.When the movie was over I watched all the credits role by to see if there were any improvements make by WB when they took over the movie but none were mentioned. Most of it was shot in the Czech Republic and many of the people had names from that region you could tell. No mention of the floods was given in 2002. The movie said copyright 2004 and Franchise was in the closing credits but not WB.Spoiler ending ahead.In the end as the time wave that changes humans they are able to finally make that trip back in the nick of time to meet the expedition just before the shoot and stop them from stepping on the butterfly. They did finally find the butterfly on the shoe before that final trip back. However they didn't have to actually replace the dead butterfly because when they warned them they were able to save the butterfly which you saw flying off. The crushed butterfly problem was caused by the gun not working correctly. It is the leader that is to say when the guns are ready to fire and he is the one who activates the guns for the other members. He couldn't get the guns to activate properly and as the Rex tries to attack the hunters one person fall off the special tract. You can see a mud footprint on the tract as they return so that is where the guy fell. When they come back from the trip to correct things they do succeed and everything is back to normal. There is no altered spelling or a different person winning the election like the short story. 2055 is not an election year but 2052 in the short story is.",

            "content": "H! there,The fact that many people may not be liking this movie (rather most), is that there can be very little, small detail missing, that can act as an ant in the trunk of an elephant, preventing fresh air to the elephant. And when people are unable to point what's wrong, they go mad on why they did not get satisfaction after spending money. Once I thought that the movie Spiderman was a hit because there was a shine in the costume of the Spiderman. For when I myself watched the poster, I thought wow, what a costume, must go and watch the movie. Here, I am able to point out what attracted me to a movie. If that costume was not good enough, I can say it would have been very difficult for me to go to a Spiderman movie, because somehow the concept of Spiderman does not interest me at all. After all, the weirdness of his powers is itself the limitation of the Spiderman; at least it seems so. Now Superman is something. And for the movie \"Spiderman\" too, I thought I would not go, until I saw that costume.Secondly, most people of today's era, and all over the world, don't like too much of a hi-fi stuff and space and time gibberish, or the movie \"Star Wars\" and all its sequels would be the biggest hits ever, for which people have camped outside the theatres prior to the release dates, in the US, to watch sequels. Can you name any movie for which this has been done ever? But this is for the \"curiosity-conscious\". People here in India went to see Terminator sequels because they have heard about Shwarzenneger. Otherwise films like these are garbage to Indian audience. Here in India, you make a real, REAL crap of a love story drama with a few senseless songs in it, and the movie is still okay if not very good, with the audience, even if the story hardly meets its own parameters.What's wrong in this movie is that it has a problem with the contrast; the brightness is less. So the effect of flashing sunlight in daytime is kind of eaten away, that robs of a certain reality in the movie. I understand the movie had run into many problems for a couple of years. But this effect is also not that bad; it can be associated with the tone for this particular movie; there are various tones out these days, for different movies.And as far as the special effects are concerned, people tend to dislike everything of something they did not enjoy. The special effects were much advanced than any of the Jurassic Park movies; after all, the technology is now more advanced. The effects were, in fact, quite good. If someone says the effect of 'time wave' in this movie wasn't good, then he needs to describe how a time wave looks like. But even the visualization of the 'time wave' was also good enough. In fact, the brain wave of the time wave coming and affecting everything one after another was a good one! As far as acting is concerned, this movie wasn't the movie \"Scent of a Woman\". It was the message of the movie all the way, with less scope for showcasing acting skills.A Sci-fi movie is like the making of a musical composition. You can start it real bad, but now the rest of the matter has to be IN ACCORDANCE of what has been started. And if this happens, the creation becomes at least inevitable, if not a masterpiece. And this movie meets these parameters perfectly.We highly enjoyed it.",

Edward Burns gives a good turn as a technical expert brought in to usher \"clients\" into the prehistoric past for the thrill of hunting dinosaurs. Although the special effects are good, they don't overwhelm the movie. The characters are actually believable and you wind up caring about a few of them. I do not remember reading any reviews on this and I consider it a nice find in this genre. The primary female lead, Catherine McCormack, plays the scientist who created the software/technology that opens the porthole to time travel. She is well-cast and develops her character with more subtlety than time should allow. When Burns' character meets her, she has had a falling-out with the man (Ben Kingsly very good as an over-the-top greedy millionaire)who funded, and now owns the technology and the venture it spawned. Both characters mesh well with the story. Jemima Rooper is the young pretty assistant who Burns looks after. There are rich clients, a corrupt government overseer and other members of the crew sprinkled in for effect. The plot takes you in a different direction than expected. All in all a fun tale with a capable cast. Enjoy.",

During one of the trips, a client gets scared, ends up killing a butterly and causes a \"butterfly effect\" which affects events which come after.In the original story, the main effect was on human culture and politics. And I would have preferred if the movie had been more faithful to the original story and had explored how the characters dealt with a different political system. (Maybe looking at what a totalitarian or fascist regime might do with the power to go back in time and how the heroes might respond to the new timeline.)

This is a serious flaw, and I can't imagine how directors are allowed to get away with it. Mc.Cormack is a real sexy woman, but her change in accents between the start and end is incredible. Oh, and killing a butterfly just before it is vaporised in the dust of the volcano wouldn't change that much.Still I have to admit that I am a sucker for these movies, and my 8 year old daughter was deliciously terrifies by the bits of tension in it. So I bumped my vote to 4 instead of 2. Good job I only rented it before buying! Otherwise, this is a clanger!",

I was expecting a movie that (especially after the line \"It's bulletproof\" when talking about their time traveling and how well they have things figured out) shows a humanity which has perfected time travel. I didn't know what to expect concerning the dinosaur hunting, so when they presented the idea that they kill the dinosaurs they knew were going to die in a matter of minutes anyway, I thought this movie was on to something.Oh yes, the green screen. To imitate Chandler \"Could it BE anymore obvious?!\" There was that one scene that was just so ridiculous, I couldn't believe this movie was made in 2005! How hard can it be to get two people to take a walk on a set? How hard was it to build a set? Was there enough funding for this movie? They actually had Edward Burns and uh... the woman. Was it the lady who invented the AI? Anyway, they're just walking along and it is incredibly obvious that they just have green screen behind them and they're on a treadmill or whatever they may be using.And then when they do go and hunt the dinosaurs, there's so much green screen, I don't think there were many sets involved, and even the ones that were involved were probably basic and the rest was green screen. I feel ripped off by this movie because with all we can do with technology these days, this movie really didn't do the best it could have done.You might be saying \"Well a lot of movie are CGI, what are you complaining about?\" Yes they are, but they're also smoothed over so that (for the most part) you can't tell there's a green screen behind, in front of, or beside the actors. If this was all because the movie was under funded... then I could understand. I don't know if that's the case or not. Sigh.",

The adaptation, dialogue, acting, directing, visual look, CGI, everything is bad.The acting is horrible. I don't know what Ben Kingsley was thinking. He's normally does an excellent job, but he is constantly chewing scenery. If Kingsley, the best actor in this movie, is that bad, imagine how terrible everyone else is.The adaptation could not stray more from the short story and retain the writing credit for Ray Bradbury. I'm willing to bet Bradbury would be glad to have his name removed if it was used with his permission. The similarities to the short story are only the most essential. Even the logical plot points are altered or removed completely. None of the changes are for the better.There is no point in the film that I felt what I was supposed to feel. Major characters die and I did not feel loss. Jokes were made that I did not find humorous. Things that should have made me feel tense did not.There were green screen affects that were unbelievably bad. Conan O'Brien driving his desk uses a green screen on a less believable level, and that's about it.The CGI was some of the worst I have ever seen. A small child may be convinced by them, but no adult of normal intelligence could be. They stick out even worse than the terrible green screen affects. The dinosaur obviously had to be visible, but there had to be a way that makes it convincing. If Jurassic Park could do it 10 years ago, surely A Sound of Thunder could.The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the Foley artist did a decent job for the ambient noise cretaceous era scenes.I could go on about how bad this movie is, but my words would never be angry enough to describe this movie.

An interesting thing about the story which was written by Ray Bradbury is that he wrote this story ten years before the phrase \"butterfly effect\" was coined and long before the scientific community understood the principle.",

It was like nothing i had ever seen before, but it looked really realistic. The CGI on it was great. All of the creatures had good CGI but especially the serpentine snake. I thought it had a pretty good storyline. I can't believe so many people thought it was a screwed up mess. I mean,it could have had more dinosaurs but you can't let that rip you off your feet! the only thing I did not get was the name. It should have been called something like 'Past Creatures of the present'. The only reason I can think of why they would have called it that would be when the time waves kept coming or the few times the dinosaur roared. Anyway, back to the setting. One thing I liked was most of the movie was at night and I thought that made it more suspenseful. The only thing I wish they would not have made at night was the bats attacking the car scene because you really could not see the bats. The last thing I really did not care for was the reptilian monkeys. They were not the best creatures of the movie. Anyway, over all I give this Two thumbs up!",

Then things go wrong, and in the end a simple butterfly is killed. Back in their correct time everything seems to be good, in the movie. The short story is different in that a new governmental regime takes effect.

Another reviewer on IMDb said the special effects and acting were so bad that it made the movie good.

Sure the special effects are bad, the acting at times can be way off and the script has some noticeable holes, but i couldn't help but think how much i would have loved this movie when i was a kid. Watching some of the movies i loved when i was a kid, its obvious that bad acting, bad writing and special effects glitches go unnoticed to kids, what matters is a fun action packed story that doesn't get too weighed down with details, character development and plot. Kids will love this movie because it moves along quickly and has some great action sequences with simple dialogue.Time travel, guns, dinosaurs, huge bats, sea monsters and big monkey lizard things are all things kids love and when its all set in a futuristic world overrun with killer thorn shooting plants, how could it fail? I don't recall any swearing, nudity, extreme violence or gore, but there may be some scares in there a bit too intense for really young kids.

            "content": "Time travel is probably the most abused trope in science fiction, especially sci-fi cinema. Since no one has ever time traveled, stories must fall back on logic. Both this movie and the short story it is based on left it out completely. The short story emphasized what has come to be known as \"the butterfly effect\" where tiny changes have a major impact the longer they are given to propagate, as though causality were simple ballistics. However, the author then turns around and permits a floating metal path through this incredibly sensitive jungle with hunters firing steel bullets into a dinosaur (or other animals on other safaris). One character is \"punished\" by giving him the job of retrieving the bullets from the dino carcass, but what about stray shots? How about the mere presence of the path disturbing the intended route of some other animal? (Perhaps an animal escaping from the target dinosaur, or even another predator.) How about the blood from the dino splashed on the hunters -- won't those few molecules be missed by the bacteria of the Cretaceous and have dire effects on the future that was? The story also explains paradoxes, and then invokes several.The movie is even sillier. NOT OF THIS EARTH was so bad it was funny. This movie was just plain bad. We have the same scenario as the short story, only multiple safari groups are taken back to shoot the exact same dinosaur! This is the \"time happens again\" notion in bad writing. So after something goes wrong, and our heroes return to their own time fully cognizant of how their world should be, \"time waves\" ripple through the world changing reality. Wait for it now -- As our heroes set out on their quest to fix what went wrong, someone points out that no one will remember after time is corrected! That's called having your paradox and eating it, too.Another reviewer was defending the time wave concept, but I see it as another symptom of the \"time happens again\" school of thought. That is, a time traveler alters history. The changes than take some measurable amount of time to catch up. Conceptually this \"nests\" one dimension of time within another. I'll leave the problems with this concept as an exercise for the student. The movie BACK TO THE FUTURE used time waves (and paradoxes), but I was willing to excuse it since the story had many other redeeming qualities. Logically, the only way to change history and live to tell about it is by using the quantum \"many worlds\" concept. If history can go one of two (or more) ways, it goes both ways, splitting off a new universe that is different only in that one alteration. The BACK TO THE FUTURE series invoked that one, too, and also messed it up.Assuming a single time line, paradoxes simply cannot happen; a writer cannot posit causality and also ignore it. Time travelers should remember that their very existence is causal, no matter how hard they try not to (or try to) alter history. THE TERMINATOR (without the sequels in tow) is a perfect example of reflexive causality. Time does not \"happen again.\"With the above influence of time travelers in mind, the \"touching the environment without touching it\" isolation suits and floating path strikes me as a metaphor for Mankind and his environment. We're here and anything we do will have _some_ effect on the environment (meaning we're natural, too). Pretending otherwise is self-delusion. We can, however, choose to be a good or bad influence.",

Another thing of the movie, the CGI done in this masterpiece is exactly that, a masterpiece. What man has longed for since the invention of fire, the longing of greatness, for man to be as a God. That has been done with this film's CGI work. The backgrounds are intense, you get sucked into it as if you're there, inside the vast world of this film. Computers are brought to life through detailed computer animation, which rivals even the practical effects of Stanley Kubrick.I have seen films with good plot, but this one takes the case. Oh boy!

            "content": "Most of the comments talk about the visual effects: that they're poor, bad, or just worth laughing about. I recently bought \"A Sound of Thunder\" & wanted to see what this is all about. Surely I (usually watching movies with an eye on vfx) wasn't very enjoyed when I saw the visual effects in this movie, sometimes I even wonder how they actually made it into the final cut, but: As a visual effects geek, I did some investigations (mostly based on the information found here) and I have made several discoveries: - \"A Sound of Thunder\" seems to contain about 350 - 500 visual effects throughout the movie. - The movie was shot in Prague (as read in Trivia) and the visual effects were done by several companies spread out in Germany, except Furious FX, which only did about a dozen shots with monitor replacements and fix-its.Does that mean that the visual effects in \"A Sound of Thunder\" are so bad because they were done in Germany? No. Watch \"Dreamship Surprise\" or the television miniseries \"Die Sturmflut\", whose visual effects won several awards.I think the problem aren't the visual effects themselves but the approach of the production. Hoping to keep the costs low, they shot the film in Prague, and gave 95 % of the visual effects business to European fx facilities. Most of the European fx facilities, unlike the 100-200 large facilities in the USA, have only about 10-40/50 fx artists at work. Giving each of these facilities 80-100 shots (including some very complex shots which you'd normally assign ILM or Sony Imageworks for, the dinosaur for example), doesn't mean that you'll get sophisticating results. It's like if Lucas tried to produce \"Revenge of the Sith\" in the 1990, with a low amount of people and without all these developed sophisticating tools.Referring to another commenter on this movie, in which he tells that he saw no difference between the vfx at a preview, and those he saw when the film was released. Why? Remember the walking scenes in the city? Some might notice that the backgrounds are very sharp and contain no motion blur. Actually the company posted their work on its homepage (it's Black Mountain): The colors are accurate, and there IS motion blur. What is the difference? The shots in the movie are only HALF FINISHED.According to the trivia, the production company, when it's true, went bankrupt during the post-production. Therefore there AREN'T any new versions of these shots left over. The shots in the movie were either ACTUALLY FINISHED (the EASY vfx shots) or WEREN'T FINISHED AT THE TIME OF BANKRUPTCY... I finally come to the conclusion that the vfx shots' quality AIN'T THE FAULT OF THE ARTISTS; they're just VICTIMS in a series of unfortunate events... My voting is therefore a neutral 5 because after these investigations, I cannot judge the visual effects properly and concentrate more on people, story, and rest, which I would describe as mid-class work.I hope some of you, after this review, see this movie with a different view.",

            "content": "I have just finished watching the DVD of this film and have just a few comments. You are led to believe that all of time has been changed by a hunting trip 65 million years into the past. Evolution has been disrupted and the human race has not evolved. I understand that the changes in reality are occurring in waves, but when the last wave hits just as the main character is sent back to the past and you see what humans would have become,how come that the buildings are still there. If the human race never existed, then the buildings could never have existed either. The main hole in the story line though, (the \"Have you cake and eat it\" reference), is the fact that they keep going back to the exact same point in time with different clients to kill the same dinosaur, but never meet themselves there. Then at the climax of the film the main character goes back to the same point in time and interacts with the group who changed the time line. If he could go back and do this, why don't the hunting teams keep running into previous hunting teams? This seems to be the biggest hole in the story line,and in my personal opinion ruins the credibility of the story. I am sure that this story is based on a short story that I read years ago, but I can't remember how that one ended. I know that the only way for the story line to evolve was for the equipment that sent them back in time to continue to exist, but it's just a shame that they could not have thought up some reason to explain why things that should have not existed in the new time line did still exist. Sorry to rant on but these are my feelings!Gary",

The beginning turns out to be very catching but with fake looking effects, then there starts to be more action catching your attention from there, and on to the end it is a roller coaster. It's a large group of events that you need to watch and see what happens!\nThe director of the film \"A Sound of Thunder\" by Peter Hyams, in 2005. A fascinating story line of time traveling with the characters Travis (played by Edward Burns), Dr.Rand (Catherine McCormack), and Charles Haton ( Ben Kingsley). When having a good business of time traveling going, one group of two men with their nerves to the sky, one mistake of bringing the past to the future, then the world slowly crumbling. At first this movie got my attention by how fake it actually looked. After getting past the semi middle. That's when all the action started happening which pulled me in to keep watching. I would say the beginning is lame then heading to the end it starts to get way better when they are trying to save the world.\nTravis a very smart intelligent guy who runs a time traveling experience. But some people don't like the idea. Dr.Rand the creator of Tammy busted into an after party spraying blood to protest time safaris time travel. After that, another jump was happening and chemicals leaked onto Travis gun before causing Eckles and Middleton to almost die. The two angry hunters go back... all of a sudden change starts to occur in the weather and plant life. Making the time shift by 5 minutes. Travis then goes to see Dr.Rand- learns \"time waves\" are occurring- another hits- more changes occur- chaos begins. Travis, Rand, and team begin planning to \"jump\" back and try to fix whatever created changes.\nThe characters Travis and Dr.Rand disagree on a lot of things in the beginning of the movie. But their disagreements come to the idea that if we are not careful where we use technology it can come back and hurt us. Even though this movie is poorly made and chintzy it still shows you examples of a life lesson.I do recommend this movie. I like it because it was far from perfect but had a great storyline that I just wanted to keep you watching. Also, the characters made the humor of the movie, I thought the actors were picked very wisley. I recommend this movie to kids because it is more a cartoon. Even though I rated it 3 out of 5 stars, it's a good 3 stars.",

            "content": "A Sound of Thunder is a fun, not too serious, and entertaining film. The movie itself is not great but it can be fun to watch and possibly be enjoyed as long as you don't go into it taking it too seriously. I say it shouldn't be taken seriously just because it's difficult to drag a short little story made many years ago into a full movie. So the fact that it can be kind of dragged out at times, combined with the god awful early 2000's graphics make it fun to maybe watch every once in a while, but nothing that will be considered in the movie hall of fame.This movie is called A Sound of Thunder based on the short story by Ray Bradbury and directed by Peter Hyams. The Warner Bros movie consisted of a cast including, Edward Burns, Jemima Rooper, Armin Rhode, Ben Kingsley, Catherin Mccormick, and many others. The movie was made in 2005 and received a pg-13 rating. You can currently watch the movie on Amazon Prime Video and Cinemax with your paid subscription. The basis of the movie is a greedy rich man who found a way to use technology in order to take rich people back in time and hunt prehistoric animals without changing anything or altering the future. This movie starts to explore what would happen if something went wrong and they did change the past.The movie is placed in 2055 where a man has used a time machine and founded a company that can make a lot of money off rich clients that are willing to spend a lot and go back in time. They go back in a time in a way that makes sure nothing is changed, they plan ahead right where a dinosaur is going to die, and they kill it then and there. There are many precautions in place but when something goes wrong they need to figure out a way to fix their mistake and make sure they can save humanity before the time waves cause humans to be extinct forever.\nThe concept for the movie based off the short story is a really fascinating idea in theory, but it can be difficult to drag out what was once a short story into a full feature length movie. Many things in A Sound of Thunder aren't great, but they aren't bad enough to make you want to just shut off the movie and never watch it. They tell the story well enough to keep you halfway intrigued and wanting to watch until the end, after all, it's only an hour and a half. Some of the movie's weaknesses are the acting, and the just terrible 2005 cgi. The best part of the movie is easily the concept, because nobody truly knows what would happen if we were to go back in time and change something, and this is an interesting way to showcase what could happen if humans were to obtain the technology to go back in time, and the biggest question of all being whether or not we should.Though the movie is by no means great, as long as you go into it with a positive attitude and not pick out the many plot holes you will be able to enjoy it. I would recommend this to just about anyone over the age of 10, because it could be fun to watch and a nice movie to be able to just sit back and enjoy for a bit while you relax. I enjoyed it just because of how the idea of time travel and changing the past is one that could be on your mind for a while. One question I constantly found myself asking was \"If the past was changed and that also changed the future, how would the people in the present day realize that the past was changed because this is what they have alway known?\" If you are ever bored and feel like seeing a stupid fun movie, this is a great choice.",

It is a very strange B movie that sat on the shelf for 3 years. This movie has it all from bad CGI, bad dialogue and a cheap budget causes it to be a train wreck for all who watch it, but even with a cheap budget is it as bad as people say?\nThe Sound of Thunder is a movie directed by Peter Hyams. In 2005 The unrealistic film came out making only 11.7 million in the Box office. The main Actors, Actresses are Edward Burns(Travis Ryer), Catherine McCormack(Dr. Rand), Jemima Rooper(Jenny Krase), and Ben Kingsley (Charles Hatton). This movie is about a wealthy businessman who owns a time travelling safari. They take wealthy clients to hunt dinosaurs until one client gets a little too careless and his/her actions might come back and haunt the near future.\nIn the movie The Sound of Thunder takes place in the city of Chicago in 2055. A greedy businessman named Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) makes millions with his company, Time Safari Inc., this allows millionaire clients to travel back to the prehistoric era using a time machine computer and hunt dinosaurs. Regulations are put in place and monitored by a Government Agent (August Zirner) to make sure nothing goes wrong on any of their trips and so that the present time is not altered. On one of their trips one shaky client steps off of the path and steps on a butterfly. After this event happens it creates time waves which will change the present evolution starting from least evolved to most evolved organisms. They attempt to fix the past, but each attempt is harder on their already altered present day time.\nAfter everything happens the team rushes to Eckle's (William Armstrong) apartment to search through his things to look for anything the group might have brought back. They know someone has taken something from the past back with them because one of the scientists noticed their weight coming back was heavier than their weight when they visited. This is a key part in the movie to trace back who might've caused the future to change after they strictly told clients to stay on the path.\nThis movie would be good for unsophisticated children, I bet they wouldn't complain about it as much as teenagers and adults. Like I described earlier this movie had a cheap budget and good CGI graphics cost money which is mainly why their graphics were bad. I did not hate the movie in fact I found some parts to be enjoyable, sure it definitely isn't the best movie of the 2000's, sure it's just a B movie that was poorly made and sat on the shelf for a while, but what's the problem in liking a weird old B movie it's not as bad as some people would say?.",

As much as the movie did have many shortcomings in production despite all of it the movie was still very good in my opinion. After all they ran out of money twice and had to resort to less than satisfactory green screen moments; they still had a very interesting concept.\nFirst off I need to establish some ground rules one: I like this movie\u00b4s concept, two: I don't care if you disagree with me this is my opinion, and three: I don't like everything about this movie but I feel in the end the good parts more than make up for the movies shortcomings. Now that's not to say that it didn't have some really bad moments because some moments were really rough for example the cars they have time travel but they don't have accident prevention software in cars like we do today even though they are set 35 years in the future.\nIn A Sound of Thunder there are a number of characters for example main characters like Dr Travis or Dr Rand while there are also significant side characters like Mr Middleton and Mr Eckles. And throughout the film the plot is fairly straightforward but still interesting at the same time. You know the typical go back in time change something you change the world but normally in other movies they don\u00b4t go back to the cretaceous period so normally we don't see massive changes like evolutionary changes so that is what makes this movie so much more focused on fixing what they did.\nAt moments like when they are hunting down Mr Eckles to find out what he did any normal person who also read the short story before would think that it was Mr Eckles who stepped on the butterfly but finding out it was his buddy Mr Middleton adds in a whole different view to his schple beforehand at the office. For me that moment was what made this movie so good. The original story was good, and they took the idea of time travel and ran with it almost completely diverting from the original story and normally you see great books turned into horrible movies because of copyright laws and whatnot but for me that was the reason it was good. Just the fact that they made a semi successful movie alone is impressive.\nSo in the end I don't quite know why so many people hate this movie, It's almost like they believe they need to hate this movie for some reason. I mean sure they had some rough green screens but those were few and far between. And for me those moments didn't discredit the movie as a whole.",

The movie simply staged events for a story to unfold. Debating the realistic possibilities of a sci-fi film is kinda silly. Without some extreme events it would be pretty dull. It would also be a really long movie to get certain points across without the exaggeration of certain elements. I do wonder if the poor green screen stuff was intentional, since the animals were done fairly well I thought the look and motion of some was pretty good. I suppose a lot of the budget could have gone to CGI-Critters.

            "content": "If you've ever wondered what power hungry billionaires do in their spare time in the year 2055, the answer is go back in time to kill dinosaurs. How could that go wrong?\nA Sound of Thunder (2005), directed by Peter Hyams, was written based off of the book \"A Sound Of Thunder\", written by Ray Bradbury. The movie follows a scientist working for a time traveling company, Travis Ryer, who studies extinct animals. This role was casted to Edward burns. His co-star Catherine McCormack plays Sonia Rand, who invented time travel and openly opposes using it. Together, the pair forms a team with Jenny Krase, Payne, and Dr. Lucas, respectively played by Jemima Rooper, David Oyelowo, and Wilfried Hochholdinger, to correct a fatal mistake that occured when Time Safari Inc. took a group of hunters back in time. Travis Ryers' (Edward Burns') group either works for or formerly worked for Time Safari Inc. under Charles Hatton, played by Ben Kingsly. Ryer's party has to battle evolution changes in the modern world while trying to figure out and correct the mistakes they made on their time traveling journey.\nThe opening scene shows Travis Ryer with Dr. Lucas and Jenny in the past with a group of hunters fighting a Tyrannosaurus Rex. After a successful hunting trip the team hosts an after party where Dr. Rand is introduced protesting the unnecessary time travel. This leads to a conversation between Dr. Ryer and Dr. Rand where the dangers of time travel are explained and the purpose of studying extinct animals behind it. Before Dr. Ryer is able to take his next team of hunters into the past, chemicals leak on the gun needed to kill the dinosaur. During the hunt, the guns fail to fire causing a panic, in which the hunters stray off the path, breaking the number one rule. This rule break is discovered in the next hunt, where the hunting party is sent into the past 5 minutes later than the scheduled time. Travis goes to tell Dr. Rand of the change in history, where he is exposed to the first changes of evolution and hit with the first time wave. Dr. Rand explains that since the past has been changed, different time waves will come altering the evolutions of different species, ending with humans. Dr. Rand and Ryer's team work together to try to find what the hunters changed on the trip, and how to fix it. While doing this, they have to fight off newly evolved creatures and plants and dodge around the time waves. Their mission is very time sensitive, as they have to find a solution not only before humans are evolved for good, but also doesn't create a never ending time loop.\nThe mechanics behind the effects of changing time is a unique idea and portrayal of creative superiority. This movie supports the theory of the butterfly effect, meaning that a tiny change in the past, i.e. the flap of a butterfly wing, could have a large impact on the future. After a small change is made in the movie universe past, separate time waves arrive changing evolutions of the species of the Earth. The first change is weather and plants, and gradually more organisms evolve into gory and deadly beings. The idea is that the last time wave will change the last evolved species - which is humans. After humans are evolved, there is nothing that Travis Ryer and his group can do to fix the future. How certain creatures are evolved is unique and creative to this movie. Having a mix between a gorilla and a velociraptor that sleeps upside down is definitely not like any other, and shows how creative the movie actually is. The concept of different time waves also gives a chance to see gradual change without it happening all at once. This can spark creativity in a reader's mind by wondering how other species of animals would evolve or how humans and human interactions would be different.\nI would recommend this movie to people of all ages. If not over-analyzed and taken too seriously, it is actually pretty fun and enjoyable to watch. With the right mindset adults and kids alike can see the good aspects and humorous values. A golden property the movie holds is it's graphics. Attempting to make a dinosaur appear scary with the graphics of a poorly made mobile ad turn the scenes so ridiculous it is hard to not find the movie comical. Watching a group of heavily armed and outfitted adults whimper at the sight of an obvious and poorly CGI'd tyrannosaurus rex is an amusing scene. The film puts the dinosaur front and center on the screen, and pays no mind to acknowledge or cover up the poor graphics. A second humorous aspect to not be overlooked is the dialogue. In the scene where Payne dies, some toxic thorn he was struck with makes him go crazy, so as gorilla raptors are circling in on him he's laughing about the stars. His crazy banter has no relation to the movie and takes away the little emotional connection that might have been there. This, in a way, makes his death scene laughable. Also let it be noted that while the gorilla raptors were closing in on Payne, every angle switch of the camera set the gorillas back and dragged out the entire scene to a noticeable amount, making the death scene even more humorous. Just another showcase of the movie's superior graphics.",

            "content": "The movie A Sound of Thunder is different from most movies you will see. It brings us back in time to the future and has some interesting made up animals. It shows a different look on what could happen to technology that most people don't really think about. Although the writers had a lot of good thoughts for the movie, they were not very well executed. If you read the short story you will probably recognize quite a few differences right from the start of the movie. If you didn't read the short story, I definitely recommend reading it after this review.\nA Sound of Thunder came to the theatres in 2005. The movie is based on the short story written by Ray Bradbury. Other writers include Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenhimer, and Gregory Poirier and was directed by Peter Hyams. Some main actors were Edward Burns, Ben Kingsley, August Zirner, Catherine McCormack, Jemima Rooper, David Oyelowo, Wilfried Hochholdinger, William Armstrong, and Corey Johnson. The rating for this movie is not very high and most people didn't give it over 5 out of 10 stars. The movie is about what could happen to people and technology.\nIn the movie a company got rich people to pay them a lot of money and in return they let people travel back in time to hunt dinosaurs right before they were about to die. The company made it very clear that when you go back in time to kill the dinosaurs you SHOULD NOT step off the path. If you brought something back or changed something from the past it could alter the whole future and life as we know it. But as most of us expected someone ended up stepping off the path and changed the present. Everything quickly started to change with time waves. Every time a wave passed them it would alter the present a little more until everything changed to how it would be if that change occurred in the past. The scientists have to work hard to try to fix what happened before the time wave hits that altered humans. They also had to find a way without having to be in a constant loop where they fix the problem but it just keeps happening so they have to keep fixing it.\nI definitely think that the writers had a lot of good ideas for this movie but they didn't have enough time to fit all of their ideas fully into the movie. I think the writers shouldn't have used all the ideas and only use few good ideas to get the full effect of the ideas making the movie more enjoyable to watch. I also don't think that they should have mentioned that you couldn't go through time waves with the time machine. It made it very confusing to understand and just wasted time trying to explain it. They also added filling conversations that didn't have anything to do with what was happening. For example when Dr. Ryer and Jenny were walking on the sidewalk and Dr. Ryer asked Jenny who her boyfriend was. She was talking about him and then just said you don't know him. I think if they had a more intentional conversation or just cut that whole part out it could have moved the plot along and made room for better things.\nI would not recommend A Sound of Thunder. I think it is just much better to read the short story. Overall the movie was kind of confusing and I think that the short story gave a much better message. Even if you're more of a movie person I don't think most people actually really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of topics and conversation that didn't match anything that was happening. The movie also lost a lot of concepts and ideas leaving an unfinished feeling and just kept me wondering. The movie had a lot of holes and things didn't quite make sense. Most of the special effects were not good either. The animals all looked super fake and they couldn't even make the actors walking on the road look realistic. If you just want a movie to have a good laugh and you're not trying to take this movie seriously this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand if you want to learn a good lesson and watch an educating movie I would not watch this one.",

            "content": "If you're looking to laugh, A Sound of Thunder is the right movie for you. No, you won't be laughing at a creative joke made by one of the characters, but at the awful special effects and the poor way the movie was put together. I feel bad for Ray Bradbury because his short story, \"A Sound of Thunder\", which was very insightful, was butchered by this film. The movie A Sound of Thunder which is supposably based off of Ray Bradbury's short story, was directed by Peter Hyams and the screen story was written by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. The stars in this movie are Edward Burns (Travis Ryer) , Catherine McCormack (Sonia (Dr.) Rand), Ben Kingsly (Hatton), and Jemima Rooper (Jenny Krase). It was released in 2005 by Warner Bros. and is rated 4.2/10 stars on IMDb. The story follows Time Safari Inc., a company that uses a time machine to go back into the past and allows wealthy people to hunt dinosaurs. As something goes wrong during a jump in the past, the present, as a result, is altered and Travis Ryder (Edward Burns) and Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack) have to figure out how to set it right. In the beginning of the movie Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack), who created the time travel technology, warns Time Safari about the dangers of accidentally altering the past. Travis (Edward Burns) has succeeded in traveling to the past with many different groups of wealthy people, planning his trips down to the second. Everything had gone smoothly up until a particular group that included characters Eckels (William Armstrong) , Middleton (Corey Johnson) , and a faulty gun. All of the characters make it out alive, but they soon find out their trip had not gone as smoothly as Ryder's (Edward Burns) past excursions. The rest of the movie follows Ryder (Edward Burns) and Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack), accompanied by some pretty horrible special effects, in their adventure to fix the past and set the present right again. Even though the movie was pretty bad I did like the concept that something so small could have an effect so large. It's crazy to think about that when the past is altered just a little bit it throws the whole course of the future off in such an immense proportion. I recommend that this movie be watched with a few people because it would be fun to laugh at and point out the flaws with someone else. The movie can be a bit hard to follow at times, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids, but almost anyone could watch and get a laugh out of it.",

            "content": "A Sound of Thunder was a short story written in the 1950 by Ray Bradbury and I think he would be ashamed of the movie A Sound of Thunder. This movie was definitely an awkward movie that turns into a hot mess but if you're into that then it is your type of movie to keep on watching. If you go into the movie with an open mind, not looking for something serious, and just looking for a good laugh with some cheesy greenscreen and bad one liners then this is the right choice for you. But if your intent is to watch this movie with all seriousness keep moving because this movie is not for you and will make you wanna scream with frustration on how bad it is. Well the thought Peter Hymes the director had going into this movie was good it just didn't turn out the way anyone was thinking it was, with the absolut awful green screens and in some parts awful acting it turned the movie from being a good movie to being so-so in a quick second.Its 2055 when we are brought into the movie at Time Safari, Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) the big shot that owns Time Safari that allows rich people to get away from hunting the same old things that they are used to and go back into time and pick a pre- historic animal that they would like to hunt and kill. For this trip Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) takes the customers to shoot a dinosaur but Dr. Sonia Rand ( Catherine McCormack) The designer of the time machine wants Times Safari to get shut down because she keeps telling everyone at the company that if they keep going back into time they will mess something up in history and alter the world of today. But When they go onto this trip one of the hunters messes up and does something that alters the world forever, But if something is done fast they can go back in time and fix what was done to save the world. But they need to hurry soon because the time waves will start to come and everything after each wave will start to change and change drastically.\u00a8The Sound of Thunder\u00a8 By Ray Bradbury and the movie to this short story have some similarities but not a lot. The movie and the story both start off in 2055 in Times Safari and both go on a hunting trip but once they get back they take off on different paths. In the story we realize right away that something was brought back and that had changed everything. But in the movie it takes us about 5 minutes to realize they messed up and the world around them is changing. After they realize that they have a short amount of time before they can go back into time and fix the world before it is changed forever and there will be no way to fix it. Once they head out to find what caused all this change they run into a few big monstrous problems that set them back a lot.This movie was extremely good at one point making me laugh and the next point has me asking why I am watching this because it is extremely cringy. Travis (Edward Burns) And Dr. Rand( Catherine McCormack) kinda has this awkward love tension throughout the whole movie that makes you wonder if they will have a relationship after you know saving the world as we know it or if they were just being flirty to add some jazz to the cringy but yet funny movie. One part that stuck out to me in this pitiful excuse of a movie that I think is ironic is that once they get back to the time machine it's broken so right down the street there is another one at the college, Like how cliche is that. I think this movie could have had so much more potential but the absolute horrendous green screens made this movie drop to negative 10 out of 5 stars. I mean come on we can tell that they didn't know they have as good technology that we have today but in the city scene we watched the same 5 cars drive by on a repeat while Travis( Edward Burns) and Jenny(Jemima Rooper) walk and they look like they are just walking in place. And don't even get me started on the 1950s style in 2055.Now I know I completely dragged this movie through the mud and drove over it with a car, But honestly I really enjoyed the movie. I mean it got put on the shelf for 3 years and didn't get produced until of september of 2005. But if you can put behind some of the off putting scenes I think you will enjoy this movie too and it may even give you a good laugh like it did for me.",

            "content": "Future. For the rest of the film they have to try and stop what he did.Ray Bradbury's, A Sound of Thunder, is a very strange film based off of what you would expect from reading the short story. A very interesting storyline mixed with a low budget film and some pretty shaky visuals makes for a pretty unique movie.A Sound of Thunder was directed by Peter Hyams. The film's release date was September 2, 2005. Some of the most important characters include Travis Ryer (Edward Burns), Dr. Rand (Catherane McCormack), and Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsly). I would give this movie a 5 out of 10 star rating. The reason I took off two stars was because of the bad visuals/graphics. That was because the film had a low budget. Other than that the film had a very good storyline and used suspense to keep you interested. The film is all around the idea of the butterfly effect. Basically a small change in the past could ripple make a big difference in the future. That is what they tried to avoid doing but ultimately failed.\"A Sound of Thunder\" was originally a short story written by Ray Bradbury. He made the storyline and did a very good job of keeping you interested. The story takes place at Time Safaris Inc. and they found a way to jump back in time, so they decided to start experimenting. They would keep repeating one jump where they killed a dinosaur. They were trying to avoid doing something that would change the outcome of the future (the butterfly effect). Like I was getting at earlier, the film definitely had some pretty sorry graphics. You shouldn't go into this movie with high expectations because you would be very disappointed. There were scenes where the background didn't match with the people at all and at some points it was actually laughable. Enough of me hating on the visuals let's get back to the storyline. They were told not to step off of the path but one of the hunters did. He ends up doing something that drastically affects the The problem was that the crew had no clue what he did wrong so they also had to find that. I think where they went wrong was spending too long trying to figure out his mistake. It got almost annoying with them trying to make the movie more interesting with the low budget and bad graphics they had. Some of the creatures they made up looked more funny than scary. Overall the short story written by Ray Bradbury did a better job of making you want more.I thought the butterfly effect being the main idea around this short story and film was very interesting. Although I wasn't by any means impressed with the CGI, the effort put into this movie was definitely there. I liked how they tried to build the movie around someone messing up the past and causing a huge ripple that affects the future. I loved the idea behind all of the time waves and the changes that came with all of them. I also enjoyed the random creatures that they made up. I don't know if enjoy was the right word there, maybe more along the lines of I had a laugh at them. Once again the effort was totally there but the CGI was just hard to take seriously. Lastly I thought that it was cool that they took the butterfly effect literally. The reason the future was changed is because one of the hunters stepped on a butterfly when they walked off of the path. I just found that kind of funny and I thought it was a nice touch.I would definitely recommend watching this movie. I already touched on this earlier but dont go into this movie with high expectations, because you might get disappointed. I would recommend this movie more towards adults because I could see this being a little confusing to kids. Some of the stuff in this movie even confused me. In the end, I would give this movie 5 out of 10 stars. Ray Bradbury did a great job of writing his short story but i believe they could have made a better movie out of it.",

            "content": "Everyone loves to make fun of things that are just downright awful; it's human nature or something. Nothing about that changes with the movie A Sound of Thunder (2005) directed by Peter Hyans. If you're looking for a movie that doesn't require much brainpower to follow and would be great to laugh at with friends, this is the perfect movie for you. If you can't stand cheap, poorly made movies, I'd run the other way as fast as you can.\nAs a reader, when books or stories are made into movies, the thing that annoys me the most is when the creators think that they need to change a lot of things to make it a successful movie. This is one of those movies.\n\"A Sound of Thunder\" by Ray Bradbury is a short story about time travel, technology, and the power of one's actions. A Sound of Thunder is a mishmash of horrible dialogue, cheesy CGI, and a myriad of plot holes. It's 2055, and a big-shot millionaire (Ben Kingsly) owns a company called Time Safari, where people can pay huge amounts of money to travel back in time to kill dinosaurs. Everything he does is primarily for getting more and more money. Meanwhile, a seemingly eccentric woman (Catherine McCormack) blatantly slanders Time Safari's little \"time jumps\", claiming they will destroy the world as they know it. Along for the ride is Travis Ryer (Edward Burns), a scientist (who is curiously brawny for his profession ) that leads these safaris.\nSo the group of hunters is on their way back in time to kill a dinosaur that would have been killed anyway. And one of them accidentally brings something back, which is very much against the \"rules\" of time travel. This incident causes a series of problems; ones that Dr. Rand and Dr. Ryer need to fix, of course. Thus, an exciting adventure is born, complete with strangely mutated dinosaurs, near-death experiences, and absolutely random, horrible dialogue.\nSounds great right? Honestly, if you can forget that this movie was made in 2005 and imagine it as a much older one, it's pretty enjoyable. Nostalgic even. That's one of the things I really enjoyed; it reminded me of memories of watching old movies with my family and laughing together. Another thing I liked was some of the creativity that went into this film. While there isn't much to go off of, the concept of the nitrogen bullets was really cool in my opinion. The guns the hunters would use had nitrogen bullets in them, which still kill as effectively as a normal bullet. But, they dissolve and are completely gone within two minutes after being shot.\nIn a different review that I had read, the reviewer said that you must be in a \"generous mood\" to watch this movie, and I wholeheartedly agree. This isn't a movie meant to impress, but it's a great one to make memories while watching. So if you're looking for a movie to laugh at, I recommend watching A Sound of Thunder.",

            "content": "Have you ever thought about how the smallest actions can alter our future, or wonder what it would be like to live as dinosaurs roamed the earth? The film A Sound of Thunder, based on the short story by Ray Bradbury delivers us a half decent film packed with action, time travel, not so special effects, and plenty of dinosaurs.\nA Sound of Thunder is directed by Peter Hyrams, and you may recognise his name from several other science fiction movies. This 4.2/10 star reviewed movie was released September 5th 2005 and made over 11,000,000 dollars worldwide in theatres. Actor Ben Kingsly plays Charles Hatton, the owner of Time safari with Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack as Travis and Dr. Sonia Rand, the scientists that are trying to save the day. To put it simply, the movie is set in 2055 where a time travelling company offers to take the rich back to prehistoric times to hunt and kill a dinosaur, for the price of 10,000 dollars. On one of their missions something goes wrong, and changes the future on a huge scale.\nThe movie starts out with a group of hunters being led on a path through the jungle, but the green screen walking is just a little too obvious. Once they get back from the hunt they are warned by Dr. Rand (the inventor of the time machine) that what they are doing is greedy and could mess up the timeline of the human race. She was right of course, and the evolution of plants and animals since the prehistoric times started changing through a series of time waves. The time waves in my opinion were very cheesy and just didn't make much sense. Travis and the other scientist that work for Time safari, team up with Dr. Rand to try and go back to the past, to fix the present before the last time wave hits. As the team travels across Chicago and fights killer plants and primates, you can't help but notice the poor cgi animation of the half baboon/half lizard primates.\nI think whoever wrote this movie tried to make it exciting and filled with special effects and action, but ultimately didn't meet the bar in the end. At every checkpoint the team reached, another poorly animated primate appeared, with essentially the same outcome every time. This I found extremely repetitive and by the end of the movie I was bored. It's almost as though halfway through the writing process, they ran out of plot elements and just decided to throw in another dinosaur or killer plant. But, I do have to give the movie some credit for bringing the story, A Sound of Thunder to life. This film provided somewhat good entertainment if you didn't focus too much on the negatives like the special effects, or think too much about what was happening in the movie. For example, why don't the hunters run into each other if they go back to the same moment in time, to kill the same dinosaur, and why don't the sound of the hunters' bullets scare off other animals, altering the timeline.\nI wouldn't recommend for someone to go out and pay to see this movie. The positive of this movie is that you could watch it with younger kids. It's not too difficult to understand that the objective of Travis and Dr. Rand is to save the day, and they definitely won't be scared by any gore or special effects. I didn't enjoy this movie because it was repetitive, the plot drags on, and the special effects and cgi just weren't up to par for a Science Fiction film.",

            "content": "A Sound Of Thunder By: Peter Hyams is a science-fiction movie based off of the short story \"A Sound Of Thunder\" By: Ray Bradbury. The short story for \"A Sound Of Thunder\" was written is 1952, but the move A Sound Of Thunder Was filmed in 2005. This story was about the dangers of going back in time and how if you change one thing from the past it can change the future drastically.I watched the move A Sound Of Thunder and I would recommend it, personally I would give the move a 5.5 out of 10 star rating. The movie did not go with the short story fully but I believe it still got the point across that the written short story was trying to. The point was that anything you do in the past will affect the future, this I will explain more in the next paragraph. I think that the move A Sound Of Thunder added a few more details to try and intrigue the people watching the movie instead of having a vague and boring movie which I thought at certain parts was a good idea but at others were executed poorly. The main characters in the move A Sound Of Thunder where Travise (Edward Burns), Dr. Rand (Catherin McCormack), Jenny (Jemima Rooper), Payne (David Oyelowo), and Alicia (Heike Makatsch).The main characters had to try and stop the changes that were happening after something was brought back from the past. Things are changing because of something called the butterfly affect. The butterfly effect is that once one small thing changes it can make a large difference later on in the future. When the group when back into the past someone brought something back that changed evolution and the future. This caused the time waves and the main characters tried to go back in time again to fix what they messed up so it would be like nothing happened and they could go back to normal.In the movie there was animation with the time waves, creatures, cars, etc. With the budget they had they started to run out, and you could tell. Some parts of the animation weren't as well done or put together as other parts where. I understand that they started to run out of money but that was one of the parts that I didn't like about the movie. I feel like if they figured out how to spend there money more efficiently they could have made the move a little better. But I did like how they added a backstory to the characters unlike in the short story. I think that the backstorries made it more interesting and made you more connected to the characters. Connection to the characters is a good thing for a movie it makes you more intrigued to the movie and makes you want to continue watching.Like I said earlier, I did liked the movie. I liked how they explored the human relationship to ecology and the natural environment throughout the move. I also liked how the movie showed the impact of human interference in the environment and how easily something can be changed. Lastly I liked how there was a message being brought throughout the movie. And how they showed that tampering with time can lead a mistake changing everything even if there hasn't been any yet. But I think that the movie is more for adult or kids probably no younger than 10 or 11. Some parts of the move could be scary for they younger kids and I think that older kids or adults would connect, understand, and take interest the move more than the younger viewers would.",

The story had an amazing plot, very good dialogue, and I understood what was happening as the story went on. So, thinking that the story is amazing, the movie has got to be just as good, right? Well...to be honest, the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The movie \"Titanic\" had better quality than \"A Sound of Thunder\" and \"Titanic\" was made in 1997. What I do understand though, is during the filming of this movie, the production team had serious financial problems, resulting in the poor quality and dialogue.\nA group of hunters go back 65 million years in the past in order to kill a dinosaur that has no future and no meaning 65 million years from that day. The movie \"A Sound of Thunder\" was published for the world to see in 2005, directed by Peter Hyams at Franchise Pictures. The main actors of the movie are Travis (Edward Burns), Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormak), Jenny Krase (Jemima Rooper), and Ted Eckles (William Armstrong). In \"A Sound of Thunder\", a team of time travelers travel 65 million years into the past to kill a dinosaur that doesn't have a future, and someone changes something in the past, that then changes the whole entire future when they return. I gave this movie a 3 out of 5 star rating because I understand that they had a lot of financial problems while filming the movie, resulting in the poor quality and dialogue.\nAt the beginning of the movie, Travis Ryer and his team are on a hunt for a dinosaur with a wealthy man and his daughter. After the hunt, Dr. Rand came in and sprayed blood out of a wine bottle in order to protest against Time Safaris use for time traveling and hunting. Travis has an interest in what she has to say, so he talks to her and finds out she's the one that created time travel and explains it to him while he confesses that he uses it for research on extinct animals. The next thing you see is some sort of chemical that leaks on Travis' gun he uses for the safaris. Travis and his team then go on their next hunt with Eckles and MIddleton, while on the hunt, Travis' gun gets jammed and they almost die, until the gun is fixed. After the hunt, Travis and others start noticing small changes like the weather and plant life, time has shifted by 5 minutes. When Travis goes to see Dr. Rand, he learns that time waves are occurring, and after another one hits, things start to get worse around the world. After learning what is occurring, Travis and his team plan on jumping back to change back what has occurred but he can't jump back far enough back in time. Another wave hits and makes things worse. There is no power to jump through the time waves and he needs to \"slingshot\" back. The team learns they brought back extra weight and there was \"no bio-filter\" in order to see if they ever brought something back. They go see Eckles, figuring he was the one that brought something back, and learns he wasn't the one who did. With everything being worse, they have to fight off creatures and monsters. They find out Middleton was the one who brought something back, he stepped on a butterfly. The team takes off to the time machine, and a flying creature takes off with Dr. Lucas. As another time wave hits, Time Safari is flooded and monsters take over, Dr. Rand takes them to her university to use another time machine with a portable hard drive. They then travel through a flooded subway and Jenny is taken by a serpent. Travis and Rand successfully get to the university, and Travis has only 20 seconds to slingshot and after the jump, another wave hits and Dr. Rand is turned into another creature. Travis warns Jenny on the safari with Eckles and Middleton and then he gives her the disc, and he stops Middleton from stepping on the butterfly. Travis then returns time to the way it is supposed to be, he then decides to stop time traveling, so this doesn't happen again. Travis returns to Time Safari before the jump. Jenny gives him the disc and he then gives it to Dr. Rand.\nThe part of this movie that caught my attention was the whole plot. The time traveling 65 million years into the past, the technology used to time travel. I liked that the movie was very visually descriptive. During the whole movie, I wasn't confused. I understood completely what was going on.\nI would recommend this movie to someone who was extremely bored on a Monday afternoon and it was rainy. I believe a teenager around 13 to 17 would maybe be interested in this movie and then any adults would like this. I would recommend those age groups because I feel as if this movie would not be appropriate for a child to watch. I liked this movie because the plot and backstory of it kept me interested during the movie. I never felt as if I was going to be disappointed while watching.",

I pay attention to science stuff in movies and just frown when its wrong or stupid. This movie had fairly good science fiction in it. The look of the city was REASONABLE for 50 years into the future. The cars were electric and they should have been auto driven. You did notice that a car quickly decelerated and stopped when a pedestrian walked into the street. Thats normal for 2020. It didn't stop suddenly but quickly decelerated so the pedestrian and the occupant of the vehicle were both unharmed. That was carefully thought out. There were a few flying vehicles using heated air to levitate and were completely under computer control and stable. Very normal for that era. No folks, we wont all be flying around in hover vehicles. No frigging way to control the traffic and a collision would be fatal more that 2/3 of the time. But having a few hover vehicles would be reasonable. The buildings were not all too tall. I would estimate the tall U shaped one at around 2000 feet or so with very nice curved inner walls to reduce wind tunnel effects. Not a single building seemed stupidly designed. Thats a nice touch. The people who did this movie THOUGHT A lot about how the world of the near future should look like and this one rocks in that respect. I Don't buy cars going up walls in MINORITY REPORT. But i do buy the electric type vehicles here, along with the electric commuter trains and buses. The only complaint is a human driving the vehicles, ala the taxi cabs. Cars of any sort in 2055 will all be computer driven. Even cabs could have that JOHNNY CAB driver from TOTAL RECALL. Perfectly reasonable and DOABLE in 2020. Maybe even 2015. The laser mounted gauss rifles are perfectly reasonable. Now the short story this is based upon was a little CHEESY. This is way better. The thought of time correcting itself in waves is not all that unreasonable. As a matter of fact, TIME TRAVEL has been done today, although by todays' theorems, you cannot go back further than before your machine was built. (Things have gone back in time like microseconds in a laboratory, so far). Acting was fun and reasonable. I WAS NOT DISTRACTED BY ANY OF THE ACTORS. I got fully into the story. Now there were gaps here and there that you can overlook, but many many scifi movies ARE CHEESIER THAN ALL GETOUT. This one isn't. The temporal walkway was not unreasonable, the idea of killing a Dino just before he dies was not unreasonable. I'm sure they could see what was supposed to happen by watching it. It was unreasonable to kill the same Dino over and over tho. That was a goof, the teams cannot overlap, they would see one another. BTW, that huge hard drive they carried probably had eta-bytes of date on it. Haha. The idea of time displacement coming in waves was exciting and well done. I don't necessarily buy into it but it made the movie move along in a nice way. Guys, read the short story by Ray Bradbury. Its WAY CHEESIER that this movie. This movie takes it and fleshes the story out big time.Its a shame none of you folks liked it. It was a very enjoyable movie with science that was thought provoking and interesting to see. No, its wasn't perfect, but the questionable science was not distracting.",

The story is interesting and brought out well, but never is truly spoken for. The problems just seem to add up with little discussion of what to do and what is happening. so if u like science fiction then see this movie but if u rarely like it then don't. The plot also has men problems so just look at my message post. its a reply to PLOTHOLE!!! at 1/27/06 or 1/28/06 you'll see it. Its actually really interesting. But the point is that its a stupid fictional movie about time-traveling to hunt prehistoric creatures without ruining the present. What could possible go wrong. And Chicago looks really crappy.",

The plot's OK if you're willing to believe it, and some of the acting is awful too. If they had been able to spend more on FX then it would have been 10x better.The Fact that a single butterfly would cause so much change is ridiculous. It doesn't even make sense if the dinosaur they killed was originally killed in the volcanic explosion why wasn't the butterfly? Its completely Illogical. And whats with the changes coming in waves? when they mess up the first time, but after they fix it it changes all at once. Its completely illogical, but its one of those movies you just have to see b/c you wanna know just how ridiculous it gets. If your a fan of bad movies go ahead watch it. but otherwise...don't botherIn summary.....don't waste 2hrs of your life watching it.",

(Most movies created from short stories seem to fall flat). I was very pleased to see that they maintained a strong connection to the plot of the original story, with plausible updates to make the futuristic world believable. I think the effects were decent; I'm more interested in the story than the eye candy effects. I thought that the acting, story, and action were okay. I especially like the ending of the movie much more than the ending of the original short story. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and even watched it twice (on HBO), but was surprised that I had not heard that this movie was in production. Thanks to the IMDb web site info to learn of the financial woes that severely limited advertising and finishing of the film: That explains a good bit!",

This movie was released on september 2, 2005 and was filmed in the Czech Republic. A Sound of Thunder received a 4.2/10 rating and has a run time of 1hr and 50min. This film is basically about a company called time safari that brings people back in time to hunt extinct animals.The movie starts out when they're on a hunt. Led by Travis Ryer(Edward Burns) who is the leader of the hunts and a scientist.we are introduced to Dr. Rand(Catherine McCormack) who created Tammy(the time machine) and protests its use due to the fact that it could alter time if something were to happen. This story deviates from the short story by Ray Bradbury as in, the story continues even after the material from the short story is exhausted. Something goes wrong on one of the hunts and they spend the rest of the movie trying to fix what went wrong.I feel there is only one thing about the movie that is somewhat okay and that's the fact that it seemed like the actors knew this was a bad movie and just basically tried to play it off. None of this dialogue is even remotely serious, when they talk it almost always sounds comedic. Especially Travis, who almost sounded sarcastic with every word he said. He didn't sound like he believed anything he was saying at all and I feel that's partially the actors fault but at least it's better than hearing him overly enthusiastic for such a bad script.I do not recommend this movie, it is really bad. Between the almost forced humor in the dialogue and the really cheesy lines it really is just bad. This is 1hr and 50min that i'm never getting back, and i advise you to save your time.

In my opinion it was an excellent movie, if you're doing nothing for the next hour.For being based on an amazing short story of the same name, it lacks amazement. The scifi element stays, but what should have been called The Time Waves or The Ripple Effect instead spits on the original story. As many good actors are in the film: Payne (David Oyelowo), Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley), and Dr. Travis (Edward Burns). For the script and scenario that were given, their acting was great. It wasn't the actors fault that the writer didn't want the watchers to have a connection with the characters. All that was needed was for the watchers to build a connection with the characters.As a nerd and a lover of random facts I found myself jumping up yelling stuff like \"that's no butterfly, that's a moth!\" I feel like most of humanity looks at something and takes it literally, but if people would just sit back and watch something with the mentality of \"Three different people took the time to search all of this knowledge and try and implement it into one film.\" As long as you see this film with a surrealistic point of view and not a literal one, you will enjoy this film. Don't take any of it for fact and instead, think of the film as a false scientific theory.One of the most important and contradicting moments is when Dr. Rand (Catherine McCormack) is explaining the \"slingshot jump\" and breaks the only rule of time travel.All in all the movie was good; just not researched well. I do believe deep down in my heart that the film, actors, special effects, and attempt of a scientific theory were good, but the script and storyboard was not.",

In critical analysis of any literary work, technically that what a movie is, a person should try to identify the good the bad and then formulate a thoughtful opinion. This movie was sooooo bad that any good points to be made are far out weighed by the sheer lunacy of the story. After watching the movie five questions presented themselves: 1.) Why was everyone in the movie an a-hole, each of the main characters, at some point, has some obnoxious or snarky comment for someone else. 2.) How was it possible for the team to jump back to the same point in time without running into teams from previous trips? 3.) How did the Baboon/reptile survive and evolve without any knowledge of them by the people who live on earth, I mean the characters seem totally taken aback by these creatures, if it took them millions of years to evolve should someone have noticed? 4.) If the \"time waves\" were causing the history of the world to change or regress how did the buildings or other man made structures survive into a future that never happened? 5.) Why was this movie named \"A Sound of Thunder\"? It was based on a Ray Bradbury short story, maybe the title had meaning in the short, but in the movie it makes no sense. This was a terrifically bad movie, I wish I could sue to get compensated for the time I wasted watching it, I am going to want that time back on my death bed just so I can lay in silence or just look out of the window, which would probably be better than this movie.",

More exactly, its volume 6, where the two heroes are stuck in a New York hit by time shock waves which de-evolve everything because of an object they left in the past. Human retrograde to apes, and later on to amoebas. The movie only slightly modifies this concept (the object is taken from the past, like in Bradbury's short; de-evolution is affecting humans last). In fact, the last scene before the time jump, with the heroin now a big fish, is taken directly from Vortex.Overall I did enjoy the SF contents, and the general effort. But, let's face it, it's not a good movie. It's let down by the special effects (it looks like a 1999 computer game) and the acting (the main character has a weakling's voice).And, above all, it does not credit Stan and Vince for their story.",

Here, the changes in the evolution of nature don't come immediately but instead through a series of time waves. The acting and special effects were good too.\n\nThis is certainly better than the effect in Ray Bradbury's original story \"A Sound of Thunder\", where stepping on a butterfly 65 million years ago only caused a change in the outcome of a Presidential election. Now that's too much of a stretch.\n\nMy main problem with the movie, as a scientist, is that the movie completely overlooks the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Any interference with the evolutionary time line the travelers made during the age of the dinosaurs would have been greatly impacted by their mass extinction around 65 million years ago. However, no mention is made in the movie of the effect the mass extinction could have had on ripple effect caused by the killing of the butterfly.",

The fact that the movie almost never even made it to the big screen should throw up a few red flags to anyone actually looking for good coherent movie to watch.But if you can stomach two dimensional characters and almost every cliche inside of a dinosaur adventure movie you can think of be my guest.\n\t\"A Sound of Thunder\" the movie directed by Peter Hyams. With a budget of 80 million dollars beautifully shown by the horrendous special effects. Released in 2005. Main actors including Edward Burns,Catherine McCormack,and Ben kingsley who must have lost a bet and this was the consequence. \n\tMany people think this is a \"bad movie thats fun to watch\" and i agree its a bad movie but \"fun to watch' is extremely debatable. My brain was going 100 miles per hour trying to figure out what was actually happening. Almost nothing is explained properly and i honestly don't even think the writers really knew what they were doing as when you ask Dr.Rand what shes talking about she just uses big words to rush past the topic and everything goes over your head. Another thing is multiple weak story lines. I think in an attempt to make the movie more interesting they really just made it worse. Its like they tried to shove to many big ideas into one movie. They have so many cliches in this movie to like the whole corrupt business, stolen idea,and don't forget your classic genius ex-marine whos really just in it for the research. If they were trying to make it less like the book they did exactly that in the most terrible way. If i was Bradburry i would've taken back the rights and not even let them associate this movie with the book none the less let them name it after the book. \n\tLets start with our main character Travis Ryer.The classic adventure movie main character. Hes the head of the crew and is always there to shoot something or call out a random fact. Hes also just in it so he can research the dinosaurs.Then we have Dr.Rand who really thought of the whole \"jenny\" thing who is like Siri but better? Were introduced to this lovely character when shes screaming like a mad man in one of the first scenes because Hattons going to ruin the world and stole her idea blah blah blah etc. Shes the one who really is like the mastermind behind everything. Hatton is the corrupt business owner who runs the whole time safari thing. In the rest of the crew we have a doctor, a mechanic person and a camera woman.Id take the time to go over them but you wont have to worry about them. Without focusing on the after thought storylines the story comes down to this. Two men take a safari with the crew back to the dinosaur ages and step on a butterfly therefore changing the future. The rest of the movie is the crew trying to fix that immeasurable mistake with time traveling. \n\tI think one of the only things that this movie got right was the idea that wildlife and nature would be thriving without the current evolution of humans. With every time wave we see nature getting more unpredictable and vicious but whos to argue thats wrong? I mean were some of the animals and weird plant killers vines a little out there yeah of course but the idea behind it isn't really that hard to fathom. I also appreciate how the writers tried coming up with an evolution for humans but i think it was a total hit and miss. I mean when you think of evolution you think of that one weird photo with the chimpanzees slowly turning into a human but then we magically turn into fish people? Im no scientist but that doesn't add up. I honestly think the outcome would have been better if Travis had failed to time travel correctly and save the current evolution of humanity. I mean without all of the people going insane and everyone trying to shoot anything that moved that world would have been doing magnificently without the pesky little humans. \n\tWether your reading this review after you watch the movie to understand that your eyes were not lying to you and the movie truly was that bad or to see if you should watch the movie ill leave you with a little piece of advice.

The short story holds suspense through the entire thing. It even ends in suspense. There is no real relief. In the film, they stretched out the story and added in some hilariously unreasonable and unneeded details.\n\n              This film is hilarious..ly bad. But, if not taken too seriously, this film is amazing. To take a short story and stretch it into a 2 hour film, it was very well done especially with a limited budget. The green screen and graphics were pretty bad, but what do you expect? This film sat on the shelf for far too long. It was very enjoyable and had a very cool story line.

In this review you will find out why it is a terrible movie.\n\tThe movie is, A Sound of Thunder is directed by Peter Hyams and came out in 2005. The studio, Franchise Pictures Crusader Entertainment Baldwin Entertainment Group Etic Films Forge QI Quality International. The main characters Travis Ryer (Edward Burns), Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), Jenny Krase (Jemima Rooper), Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley), and Dr Lucas (Wilfried Hochholdinger). The movie is about a time travel machine being used for a hunting safari, and how it can affect the future drastically.\n\tThe basic plot of the movie is that Charles Hatton is a money greedy man and tricked Travis Ryer into a contract so that he must bring people on these time travel hunting parties. Sonia Rand tells them that if they continue they will cause discourse in time. Well eventually they do end up messing up and they have to try to go back in time to intercept the hunting party. \n\tA big moment in this movie that really threw me off and kind of ruined the movie for me is the bad logic behind the movie. They always go back in time to the same spot to hunt the same dino, but never meet the other hunting parties. But at the end of the movie he can stumble into their hunting party and save the day. It makes zero sense and it was kind of frustrating to watch. If the movie was consistent it would have been a lot better, just tying up those loose ends with a little dialogue would improve the movie quality drastically. If they would have taken out that excruciatingly terrible scene of the sewer monster (Which I think was a Pok\u00e9mon?) and that horrible CPR attempt, they could have had a 10 minute segment near the beginning of the movie where they are explaining the time travel to the buyers and tie up all the loose ends. The movie was terrible and it had a lot of wasted potential. \n\tI do not recommend this movie to anyone unless they want to see a fine example of a waste of $80,000,000. I may sound harsh here but I think a 14 year old with 80 million dollars and Power Director could make a better movie than this studio did. All of the monsters looked like copy pasted models with bad editing. A lot of great movies came out in 2005 and this was just not one of them. Even if they didn't have the funding for good CGI the dialogue and logic was atrocious. Here is an example, Sonia says that humans would be the last affected by the time waves because we are the last to evolve, which is not true at all. I learned in 9th grade that everything is constantly evolving and the script writers must have missed that day in school. If you decide to watch this movie after this review don't expect anything special. I wonder what Ray Bradbury thought of this horrendous movie.

            "content": "\"A Sound of Thunder\": smart premise, dumb movie. It's 2055 and humanity has perfected and commercialized time travel. For a significant fee, the wealthy get to hunt dinosaurs courtesy of Time Safari Inc. The trips are set under very specific rules to avoid altering history. The hunters are brought along with a team to the past, where they find an Allosaurus (a large, meat-eating dinosaur similar to the Tyrannosaurus). As it wanders in a tar pit, moments away from certain death at the hands of a volcanic eruption the team emerges from a portal. Using frozen nitrogen bullets, they kill the animal, tape the whole thing as a souvenir and return to the present. They travel on an invisible floating path (Sort of like a force field) to ensure that they do not disturb anything else because even the smallest change in the past could have titanic consequences in the future! On one such excursion, something goes wrong. The weapon held by the lead member, Travis (Edward Burns) malfunctions and in a panic, the two businessmen being escorted by the employees of Time Safari are left unattended for a few moments. Travis manages to get the weapon working again, kills the dinosaur and everyone makes it back to the present. Travis notices a day later that the present as we know it is changing. When he asks the inventor of the time machine software, Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) about it, she tells him that the only explanation for the changes and the malfunctioning computer at Time Safari is that someone has made a change in the past. The alterations are small at first but within a couple of days we've got a new species of deadly plants engulfing skyscrapers, cities being torn apart, swarms of killer insects, packs of carnivorous dinosaur descendants attacking humanity and it's only a matter of time before the human race as we know it ceases to exist completely. The team at Time Safari, along with Sonia must find a way to return to that fateful trip that went wrong and prevent whatever changed everything from happening.\nWhen you hear about the premise of the movie, it actually sounds pretty awesome. We've got a dinosaur safari, time travel, killer bugs, killer plants and some pretty high stakes. What could go wrong? The biggest flaw with the film is that it's nowhere near as intelligent as it should be and is riddled with scientific errors. There are many theories on how time travel should work but from the premise, you can tell which one this story is going with. Time travel is possible and furthermore, you can alter the past and the present without blowing up the universe or accidentally erasing yourself from history. Unfortunately, this movie plays so fast and loose with its own rules that it becomes an incomprehensible mess. Towards the middle of the movie, we learn that Time Safari actually escorts its customers to the same Allosaurus every time. Makes sense, because how many dinosaurs about to die by volcanic eruption are there really? But wait, that doesn't make any sense. Think about it. If customer A shoots down the dinosaur, then customer B would have to arrive earlier to ensure he/she can arrive before the dinosaur dies. But that would change the present because customer A would find itself in the presence of a very dead dinosaur when it arrived in the first place. If it's possible to kill the same animal over and over without affecting history, how is it possible that this one trip actually changed anything? On a side note, how lame is it that when you go back in time and shoot down a dinosaur, you're shooting down the exact same one as everybody else, under the exact same circumstances as everybody else?\nLet's move on from that moment of nonsense. Let's just say \"ok, they made a mistake, just ignore that one\". But the movie is filled with events and plot elements that make no sense. Let's say you find yourself in this situation where time is being altered.  Maybe what you would do is... travel back in time a couple of days before the trip that went wrong and prevent the whole incident from happening by making sure those guns work ok, or maybe leave yourself a note? That would be the smart thing to do, but it's not what they do in this movie! This is nonscience-fiction! Our team of geniuses decide that to change the past, they need to go back to the exact moment where things went wrong, observe it and then fix it. Seems to me that it would be way easier to just not go on the initial problematic trip than to go back in time, way back to the time of dinosaurs and risk accidentally erasing something important from history. To further demonstrate how stupid this movie is, look at the way that the changes appear in the present. When the changes happen, it's described as a \"time wave\", it's a wave of changes, ripples in history that affect each other. These changes increase in severity as more and more of these small modifications pile up and affect the flora and fauna of Earth. Humanity is suddenly stuck in a world it doesn't understand because of something that was altered in the past. We're told that humans are the last species to be affected because \"We're the last species to evolve\". Did the writer even understand how evolution works? Living things do not have a predetermined \"final evolution\" like in Pok\u00e9mon. Each generation is constantly adapting to its environment as climates and food supplies change. Successful species procreate while natural selection eliminates mutations that create undesirable or inefficient designs. You can never know how something is going to evolve, it just sort of happens. Maybe if the reason we are not immediately, physically affected was that we were the cause of the change that would make sense, but this explanation just makes anyone who knows anything about biology want to dash their head against the wall. Towards the end of the film, we actually do see humanity change into something completely different from what we're used to, but it just goes on to create further problems with the plot. If humanity evolved into a race of fish-like creatures, wouldn't our civilization be... underwater instead of on land with the same cars and buildings we have now? I guess the ripples in time only affected history in a way that we still got every single development in human the past (otherwise, you know we probably wouldn't have invented the time machine in the first place).\nAside from the mistakes in science, it just isn't very cleverly set up as a story. It's the kind of film where when the whole world is coming to an end, this team of experts never think of contacting the police or the army for some help. Despite the fact that our heroes are being attacked by a flock of bat monsters and may hold the entire future of the human race in their hands, they just decide to take this mission on by themselves. This team of experts who are in no way qualified to handle the kind of action they find themselves in just decide to go gung-ho and explore the city on their own to save the universe. They're not even clever enough to carry weapons with them at all times. It's a movie where things often happen not because they make logical sense, but because the plot demands it. We get a scene were we see a woman get eaten alive by these carnivorous bugs (which never appear in the movie again). Seeing this, Travis and Sonia jump out of her apartment window, landing in a tree. This tree is as tall as a skyscraper though and the two of them must have been at least on the 10th floor. How did Travis, who initiated the jump know that the time wave that just passed was going to conveniently place a tree branch there and that they weren't going to fall to their deaths? How did later in the film, that sea monster know to break through the glass just at the right moment so it could snap up a secondary character in a dramatic fashion? How convenient is it that the hard drive powering the time machine also happens to be compatible with the particle accelerator used at the university nearby and that they can turn this particle accelerator into a time portal?\nOn top of all these problems, the special effects for this movie are terrible. You can give a lot of slack to a movie with a low budget if it's really smart or if it's older, but this train wreck was made in 2005 and the special effects look like they're from a cheap documentary about dinosaurs that aired on TV during the 90's. Right from the beginning of the movie you see the Allosaurus emerge through a forest of trees, which fall over like dry, wooden sticks without a single leaf on them. Even worse, this clip of the Allosaurus is repeated again whenever the team travel back in time so if you thought it looked bad once, here it is again, and again! In the present, the cars look needlessly futuristic. More like shoes or tissue boxes with wheels than vehicles and as our characters talk on the sidewalk, not a single one of them slows down, stops or drops off a passenger. Not only does it look cheap, but the movie is unimaginative. The \"Time Wave\" mentioned earlier is literally a wave that encircles the glove and makes changes to the environment. The way we are introduced to this time wave is completely nonsensical by the way. Sonia tells him to look out the widow and he sees it pass through the city. Apparently she has psychic powers that allowed her to know this was coming and no one noticed this enormous time-distortion passing by during the previous 24 hours. Why do the changes happen every 24 hours by the way? Do chronological anomalies work 9-5 jobs like humans do?\nThe story is filled with clich\u00e9d characters. Ben Kingsley (one again in a terrible film) plays an amoral businessman, who delights his clients with talks that would make snake-oil salesmen blush. While he is able to charge pretty much anything he wants for these trips, he is still looking to cut costs and corners... at the expense of all of humanity! Meanwhile, Sonia is the scientist that mourns her invention being used for commercial uses. Don't they see that tampering with time will eventually result in death to us all?! Maybe people would take her more seriously if she hadn't wasted countless hours programming the time machine's computer with a sassy attitude. Our main character Travis is incredibly bland. We get a few scenes early on when he tells the audience and Sonia what he's all about but quickly degenerates into a typical action hero. Everyone else, forget about them, they're about as animated as the dead Allosaurus.\nIt's a movie where humanity is unable to fight off a race of carnivorous baboon-like dinosaur descendants. These animals are not any more intelligent than you standard lion or other large carnivore but when the stuff hits the fan here, it hits it so hard the whole world forgets everything it knows and devolves (not literally) into cavemen. It's a movie that looks bad from the beginning but gets worse and worse as it goes along. In a way, it's a perfect analogy for itself. A small mistake in the beginning of the production, a single person who didn't understand the intent and ideas behind the original short story stepped in the wrong spot and created these waves of problems, which only increase as the story goes by. It would be a terrific bad movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's extremely boring to watch. You just want it to go full throttle into idiocy and become a bad action movie with killer baboon-dinosaurs but it insists on trying to have some brains. If the concept interests you, just read the short story or even watch that old Simpsons Halloween special where Homer has a time-travelling toaster. \"A Sound of Thunder\" wants to be an action-packed adventure science-fiction movie with a brain, but it's simply a bad movie.

Yes, it does have some obvious green-screen and rear-projection work, and yes, the Tyrannosaurus Rex that figures in the opening action sorta looks like he needs to be returned to Macy's in time for the Thanksgiving Day parade, but who says every movie involving dinosaurs has to be visually on a par with or beyond Jurassic Park? One person's \"shoddy and unconvincing\" can be another person's \"charmingly old-fashioned\", and A Sound of Thunder is still eons closer to vintage Ray Harryhausen than to Bert I. Gordon. And some of the visuals really DO work: the various creatures that attack our heroes, heroines and bystanders in the altered future are far more imaginative and variegated than the CGI-wallpaper that enveloped Stephen Sommers' godawful Mummy movies; the filmmakers' version of downtown Chicago (which I recently visited) 50 years hence is surprisingly witty and well-observed; and I loved the solid/transparent/flowing \"pathway to the past\" that visitors took in order to hunt and kill a prehistoric beast. Director Peter Hyams has been doing mostly sci-fi and action flicks for over 30 years now; like fellow warhorses Richard Fleischer and the late J. Lee Thompson, his stuff can be remarkably pretentious, badly conceived and dull (remember 2010, possibly a leading contender for the most uncalled-for movie sequel ever made?)...but like those other two craftsmen, he's also perfectly capable at turning out a nifty, enjoyably fast-paced entertainment. Nobody's going to rank this with Gandhi or House of Sand and Fog as containing one of the all-time great Ben Kingsley performances, but he's very amusingly hammy as the greedy, duplicitous proprietor of the potentially dangerous time-travel device--his amusement park capitalist is actually much closer to the conception of same in Michael Crichton's original novel Jurassic Park than Richard Attenborough's teddy-bear interpretation in that film; Ed Burns isn't exactly in my Top 100 as viable action movie heroes go, but since every moment he spent filming this was one he WASN'T spending writing or directing one of his allegedly true-to-life, annoyingly twee romances like The Brothers McMullen or She's The One, who's to complain? Again, I don't see much point in griping about ANY of A Sound of Thunder if you view it in the right perspective: a 12-year-old watching it in 1957 would think it was the coolest movie in the world. And even though part of this has to do with Warner Bros. treating the film like something it found on its shoe and waiting THREE YEARS to release it, the fact that it's a movie version/expansion of a piece of literature (a beloved Ray Bradbury short story) in a summer even more filled than usual with sequels, remakes and equally unnecessary TV show adaptations, in itself makes A Sound of Thunder kinda cool, too.",
