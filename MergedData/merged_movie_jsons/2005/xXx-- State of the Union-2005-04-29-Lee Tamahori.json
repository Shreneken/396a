            "content": "\"xXx2: The Next Level\" (Revolution Studios and Columbia Pictures changed the subtitle from \"State of the Union\" for international territories, for obvious reasons) comes from the director of \"Die Another Day,\" which was terrible; producer Neal H. Moritz, whose last credited project was the dire (and thankfully now-cancelled) \"Point Pleasant\"; is a sequel to the dreadful \"xXx\"; and comes equipped with Samuel L. Jackson's stated dislike of making movies with rappers. On this showing, you can't blame him.Trading in Vin Diesel (his character is written out by someone saying that he got killed in Bora Bora) for Ice Cube is no improvement; not only is he not the most expressive actor, but he's not that convincing in action (when he's being chased by Scott Speedman you just KNOW that Speedman would catch him like that (snaps fingers) in real life). In fairness to Mr. Cube, he's far from the only thing wrong with this; Simon Kinberg's screenplay seems not only to have been aimed at emotionally and intellectually stunted 13-year-olds but written by them as well, with the plot starting idiotically and continuing from there - the villainous Secretary of Defence played by Willem Dafoe is so pantomime villainous that when he makes a speech to Jackson you're surprised he doesn't laugh maniacally.Suspending disbelief is one thing, but when you have a movie that expects people to believe that tanks can be handled like motorbikes... and which works in such daft plot turns as characters having their deaths faked just so they can be around for the climax (why not just kill them there?)... and that has a finale which depends on a car and a Presidential bullet train being able to fit on the same track despite the car being a compact if speedy sports car... in this case it's just impossible. Admittedly it doesn't help that said scenes are incompetently executed thanks to shockingly bad special effects and shoddy direction; some of the miniatures are glaringly obvious, and I particularly hope that lead effects house Industrial Light and Magic didn't do the CGI bullet train shots. And as for the way some of the shots go from film to what looks like video and back again...The cast isn't much good either, although it's fun to see Peter Strauss as the President (in spite or because of his not sounding like he believes a word of this); Xzibit not only helps parts of this seem like \"Pimp My Ride: The Movie\" but he can't act, Dafoe is Special Guest Villain level, and Jackson phones it in. As for the female characters, Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey are pretty much defined by their cleavage and by the fact that one's good and the other (the one who looks like a cross between Nicolette Sheridan and Rachel Bilson) isn't. (The movie can't even be laddish properly; for some reason the sexiest woman in the movie (Masuimi Max, who plays Xzibit's girlfriend and who helps out with the robbery of the artillery-carrying cheese truck) isn't listed in the credits.) And the tiresome, crowbarred-in rap numbers don't help, certainly not compared to Marco Beltrami's score. (Ironically, at one point on hearing the female string quartet Bond our hero complains about the music; they are not to blame for the aural wrongs.)\"xXx2: Whatever\" is so unexciting and so absurd that despite its stabs at relevance (our hero claims Dafoe is hatching \"World War IV\"), the only way to get through it is as a laugher; the sight of Ice Cube in a suit and tie (with umbrella!) is funnier than his intentional attempt at comedy later in the same scene. To make it worse, the last scene leaves the door wide open for a third movie... if it does happen, why not cast Scarlett Johansson or Charlotte Church as the new Triple X? It's not like realism is a key factor here.",

            "content": "I wasn't the world's biggest fan of the original xXx, mainly because I can't stand Vin Diesel, the biggest plank of wood to grace a modern cinema screen. When I heard he wouldn't be returning for this sequel, I was overjoyed; however, this film is much the same as the last one, and not in a good way. It's cheesy, preposterous and frequently unbelievable; if you don't mind these things you'll probably enjoy it. I know I did.Ice Cube is the miscast anti-hero of the film, and to be honest he's not a very interesting character; then again, his scripted lines are all cheesy. His only real outstanding scene is the bit where he breaks out of prison, where you get the feeling he's a real powerhouse. He kind of fades away after that. The rest of the film follows a pseudo James Bond-style plot, with lots of chases and stormings of buildings; there's a neat speedboat bit, some cool car chases and more. The flimsy plot involves a corrupt Secretary of Defence attempting to take over the White House with his own private army, and Willem Dafoe pops up, typecast once again as the sneering villain \u2013 but then he is good at it.This film's action pushes the boundaries of the low certificate, and there are some really brutal fight sequences with cracking sound effects \u2013 the kind you hear in a violent Jet Li flick. Samuel L. Jackson has always been good value for money, and he's given a slightly bigger role in this sequel, although he's still not in it much; still, he makes his character imposing and cool, as always. The ending, with the kidnapped president on the bullet train, is even cheesier than the ending of UNDER SIEGE 2! The CGI effects of the train and car make this look like a computer game, similar to weak moments in I, ROBOT. It's still fun, though; just disengage your brain, as, like TRANSPORTER 2, this is a modern Hollywood blockbuster that swaps integrity for excitement.",

The film is plenty of macho man incarnated by Ice Cube who makes an embarrassing acting.The picture contains fights,gun-play,chases,firepower and frenetic pursuits with bounds and leaps as when a water-motorcycle runs afoul.It's tense and exciting at time though also a routine unstopped action film less than memorable.Colorful cinematography by David Tattersall and appropriate music adjusted to the action by Marco Beltrani.The film is lavishly produced by the great producer of action genre Neal Moritz(Prison break,Torque,Swat,Stealth,Skulls,Fast and furious I,II).The motion picture is regularly directed by Lee Tamahori(Along came a spider,Once were warriors) who made much better in James Bond series(Die another day) .Rating : Below average",

            "content": "A film that should be retitled xXx2: Don't Say We Didn't Warn You.Opening with an impressive first 7-8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences.Ice Cube will never be thanking the academy (he at times look like he would struggle to play himself), but the Razzie committee should be on the lookout for this up and comer, this type of dribble is the cinematic equivalent of being run over repeatedly by a truck with the stereo cranked up to 11.The first xXx was at least assure of itself, popcorn action with the acknowledgment that it was bang for buck and nothing more. State of The Union takes itself far too seriously with a plot so absurd you swear it was written by a focus group of 13 year old boys after a binge at McDonalds. Action sequences are spaced every ten minutes or so as bookends to move Cube onto the next dilemma, each new sequence becoming further and further detached from reality (the final twenty minutes is utter insanity that makes films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle seem like documentaries). A sequence involving a train should be parody material, not a serious plot device.Samuel L Jackson cashes in his paycheck and plods through the movie looking as though he just read the script and realized what he has got himself involved in. Scott Speedman's looks too immature to play a senior NSA agent and is largely in the film so the white folks don't feel left out. Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and X-Zibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3: Turkey Season.Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against (sometimes at the same time) all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.My only positive comment on this whole debacle are the cars used in the film, not being a car enthusiast even I had to be quietly impressed by the rides in this film. Also this film is under the 2 hour mark a sign of a film that does know when its wearing out its welcome.Hopefully with the resoundingly negative response xXx2 has currently received another sequel looks unlikely, as films like this are about as satisfying as a having your nose broken.",

            "content": "Action without brains is actually a genre i have nothing against. As long as the action sequences are well made that is. \"xXx: State of the Union\" is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.The plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSA-agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone (Ice Cube) in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.Seriously, no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that \"xXx: State of the Union\" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late. You know the method: \"move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the camera-man was a spastic\". I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360km/h on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.Otherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great, the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one-liners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.So in the end i think this \"James Bond on steroids\" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year, but it desperately needs some better action-directing for that. I rate it 3/10.",

            "content": "Someone is targeting the old unit that Agent Augustus Gibbons used to belong to under the command of George Deckert, now Secretary for Defence. Half the unit are dead, Triple X agent Cage is dead and Gibbons' underground base has been infiltrated by a highly trained team from which he barely escaped. With his gadgets expert in tow, Gibbons turns to a new Triple X agent to help him fight this threat \u0096 former comrade and now life prisoner, Darius Stone. Busting Stone out of prison, Gibbons arms him and helps him start his new mission by uncovering hidden information; as the danger increases, so does the pace and all clues lead to something very sinister indeed.The production company credits right at the start of the film proclaim this as an \"Original Films Production\", a claim that I thought highly ironic since it then plunges into a pre-credit sequence that is as genre-specific as they come, a title sequence that is a clear Bond rip off and a film that delivers nothing more than the genre basics. Taking the lead from the first film, the script kills off Xander Cage with barely a mention and moves on to the new agent. Discussion of the plot is pointless cause the whole affair is nonsense with logic holes so large that you could drive a souped up car through it. Those looking to this for a story that they can get into will be sorely disappointed as the film throws its energy into noise, explosions and typically OTT action scenes. To me and many viewers this will be just annoying hollow spectacle but to the target audience this is all they require and xXx2 does do it noisily enough to satisfy them.The action is as stupid and illogical as the plot itself but it is noisy, stupid, big and bold and is enjoyable on that level; it is a shame that it lacks any actual tension or excitement but the noise will be enough for the target audience. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. The attempts at character and story are the worst \u0096 the moments with the girls really slows things down without adding even titillation value, while the potentially brave political stance made by the drawing of the president is just lost and wasted. Ice Cube picks up the mantle and delivers a one-note performance where he basically sneers his way across the screen; he lacks any sort of charisma here and could have been any old actor (something I think those hoping to make a franchise hope will be the case). Jackson is just collecting the cash so his bad performance can be ignored but Dafoe is a terrible bad guy considering he has done it well in other films. Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his \"Pimp my Ride\" personae being called on. Mabrey and Gayle are basically just eye candy, with breasts squeezed and lifted in every scene \u0096 they can't act and don't have any chemistry with the basic Cube. The support cast do lots of running around with guns or diving away form bangs but nobody gets close to a performance.Overall this is a noisy genre flick, nothing more and nothing less. Those claiming how awful it is forget that there are people who don't want art films, emotional films or engaging dramas, they just want to whoop and holler as things get blowing up in fancy-looking ways. For them, and them alone, this film will do the job as it provides effects, stunts and noise. However those looking for even the most basic characters, plot, tension, excitement or development will find themselves yawning through this noisy cross between a hip-hop video and a video game.",

            "content": "Released in the Philippines as \"xXx: The Next Level\", this sequel is definitely more expensive, has more action, has similar number of stunts and has new action lead played by an unlikely actor. But despite the production values, this sequel is definitely not worth your time and money.Vin Diesel, who made people think that xXx stands for \"Xander Cage is eXtremely eXplosive\" being the hero of the original, is nowhere to be found which is both a good and bad thing. Diesel can deliver the action and stunts solidly but he's so annoying when it comes to dialog and comedy moments. I always hated the \"Think PlayStation!\" line.In the sequel, Samuel L. Jackson's agency gets desperate and decides to hire a new action agent with \"more attitude\". It turned out to be Ice Cube, a prisoner in the film.Ice Cube never fits in well with his action-packed role. Compared to Diesel, Cube is never convincing in doing action and stunts. Worse, Cube is very lousy with his dialog and certain moments that demanded comedy. I think Cube is better off with a pure-comedy or pure-hip hop role (be it lead or supporting) but as an action star? NO WAY! I'd rather watch Ice Cube in his old role in Anaconda than this movie! You will end up wishing the producers got back Diesel in the sequel.Samuel L. Jackson this time gets more screen time although I would prefer they lessened his action scenes and added talking scenes instead. Early in the film, you'll see Jackson dual wield guns ala John Woo (to live up to his position in his agency and survive) but I find his role in the first movie better. Still it's nice to see him get more screen time this time.Willem Dafoe, who played a Vietnam soldier and a special forces coordinator before, plays the defense secretary who plans to overthrow the government. His presence is very well felt and he delivers a good performance. You will hate him even more in this film than in Spider-Man.Sunny Mabrey? She is very pretty and very sexy. In short a hot girl but she's nothing more than just eye candy here and she cannot be taken seriously. She should be given some roles that demand performance, not looks.Lee Tamahori, whose most successful flick was Die Another Day, is the director this time but most noticeable is his increased use of computer graphics. Thanks to him, the film's pace is fast and something always happen on-screen to keep you awake.xXx story this time is shallower. Conspiracies are supposed to be deep and detailed but this sequel simply skipped all the requirements just to deliver action, explosions, crappy dialog and special effects. The sequel is best viewed as a non-thinking, MTV-styled edited action flick.Action scenes and special effects are plenty but certain scenes are just too unbelievable to see and accept. I did notice however that the action in the sequel are more military in nature when compared to that of the first film wherein its action is more related to extreme sports.I don't recommend watching this sequel at all. You are better of skipping it. But if you really want to watch it, better wait for the DVD release instead.",

I have a very high tolerance for \"bad\" films(I really dug the first xXx) and have only walked out three time before (Dungeons and Dragons, Bad Company, and The Musketeer). This ego driven piece of garbage was just intolerable. Every time Ice Cube (a man I quite like) mugged for the camera I cringed. And Willem Dafoe is SHAMELESS. After 40mins of excruciating dialogue and NO PLOT I had to leave. I'm sure this movie is about something and there's some cool stunts, I just wasn't about to waste the rest of my evening in hopes that the film got better. So to be fair I can't really give this a review but I can say that life is short and sometimes we just gotta put our foot down and not take the crap the studios are feeding us.

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: xXx2",
            "content": "Watching this film is like being with your current beau and yet constantly reminded of your ex. We all know that Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is not the xXx in this show, and he's being replaced by Darius Stone (Ice Cube). Heck, I think the producers make the mistake of killing Xander Cage - mentioned in the movie as being killed in action in Bora Bora, Afghanistan, because in my opinion his character makes an excellent action hero.That's reminiscence number one - being reminded of what could have been if the charismatic Vin Diesel continued for this film. Throughout the film, we see some similarities with Xanda or scenes from the original xXx. Like a scene in a diner with Gibbons (good IL mo-fo Samuel L Jackson, who's given more screen time this time around), a sea-craft ride down a river, wisecracks on the moniker xXx (\"I sound like a porn star\"), the reluctance of being drawn into the game of cloak and daggers, and (mis)quoting one of my favourite lines in the original - \"The things I would do for my country\"! But while Xander Cage's an extreme sports person, Darius Stone is more \"in your face\", given his military background in covert ops, with a penchant for some fries and a shake. The original film's delivery is more subtle, more elegant, while this one's more direct and in a way, nothing different from another action flick.The action is standard Hollywood-blow-em-up fest, right from the beginning and never lets up throughout the film. Everything's bigger (M1 Abrams Tank, Aircraft Carrier, Choppers), noisier (guns and explosions everywhere) and faster (modified cars and humongous wheels). No doubt the movie looks good given that the action pieces looks expensive, and effects well done by Industrial Light and Magic.Did I mention the girls? We get 2 in this one, but their roles are merely decorative, unlike Asia Argento's meatier and eye-\"candier\" chick role in xXx1. And the villains are your good old one-dimensional foes who tend to lapse into monologues, and I feel that Willem Dafoe is a bit underutilized.My only gripe with this film is that xXx has to rely on his boyz n the hood - it's actually quite hilarious to see street gangs take on military might, \"carjacking\" a tank and actually winning. Not too credible, but hey, it's only a movie.Did you know this film is called \"xXx: State of the Union\" in the US (referring to the President's State of the Union Address, which forms the finale), but I guess for those outside who don't care less about US politics, we're pretty OK with the dumbed-down title of \"xXx2: The Next Level\" - makes it sound like some arcade game.So buckle up and enjoy the ride, and if this is proved as popular as the original, we might see xXx3 (given the setting up of a sequel at the end), and the possibility of seeing a new face as the new xXx. Now if the producers just stop killing them, I'd think it's pretty cool to see a couple of xXxs teaming up. Ooh... the potential for more mayhem!\"Wars come and go, but my soldiers are eternal\" - 2Pac",

I guess the budget wasn't high enough for cool, exciting action sequences so they substituted old-school 80s style scenes for most of it, and suffice to say, there's a reason why most action movies don't do that stuff anymore -- it's boring. And since the action sequences are the only reason to watch something like this, and they suck, there's no real reason to give this movie even a moment's consideration.The plot involves Darius Stone (Ice Cube) replacing Vin Diesel's character as the new, improved xXx and trying to foil a plot against the President of the United States. Darius proceeds to throw people around, impress the ladies, blow stuff up etc etc etc. The basic concept is a hip-hop James Bond, and while it sounds like a cool concept that you couldn't possibly mess up, no, these guys messed it up... its not Ice Cube's fault, he's no actor but I've seen him do better than this if the movie has a script and some direction.",

I am so tired of USA and conspiracy about their presidents I am so sick of this movies! Why couldn't this movie be original and had a better plot and better story? Seriously I don't like this movie. I bought the trilogy on Blu-ray I have it in my collection but this movie is a big step down. No one from the first film come back except Samuel L. Jackson! I have nothing but a respect towards the actor I like him I like his performance as Agent Augustus Eugene Gibbons he is really good in this movie. The movie is a peace of s*** but he is good he is really awesome.I don't like Ice Cube in this movie I don't like his jokes or he's acting he can't even speak properly. He acts like some gangster in her. He is a terrible actor and awful rapper, I don't like him.The action in my opinion is just poor, the plot is stupid and poor and used already.This film has none action sequences it is not a spy movie like the first one had. I hated this film because they killed of Xander Cage in this one that makes me so much angry now I hate it even more. The new xXx is terrible Jesus the CGI is terrible in here.The director for this film was Lee Tamahori the guy from James Bond 007 Die Another Day that was so awful this movie is awful action film. I don't see this movie as action film and Die Another Day was the worst James Bond film.I don't like black joke movies I don't like it Ice Cube can't properly speak. Willem Dafoe is really terrible he always plays the bad guys but in this movie he is the weakest bad guy I ever saw. This movie has so horrendous CGI and Jesus this movie f***** sucks it is un real and is so bad.Scott Speedman is in this one from Underworld films first he is the bad guy and then he is the good guy this movie is so rushed really and it makes no sense. The first xXx was a grounded reality action junkie movie it was fantastic and it is my favorite Vin Diesel film this one really sinks lower from the first one.Pretty much this movie sucks I don't have much to say anymore but score get's F 1/10 the only good in this was Samuel L. Jackson the rest was sh***. Everyone in this movie was not likable. I did not even cheer for these characters I just didn't care.Please stop making conspiracy movie about US presidents I am so sick o it. US president is always the target in USA and everyone want's to be the president why Hollywood makes such a bad movies this days? Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down I am so tired of these movies and this conspiracy theories used in the movies.This movie is awful avoid like a plague at any cost.",

He is like a stiff crash test dummy on the screen provided with the fact that he can blurt out some lines. And oh yes, the one-liners. Horrible, I mean the one-liners were probably the worst that I have ever heard, almost ripped my ears off. I don't know how good a rapper Ice cube is but I think it would suit him better than acting. What I can't but wonder is that why Samuel L. Jackson ever agreed to do this film.And then the aluminium rims. Almost every scene begins with the filming of shiny and bright rims.

Some would say implausible but what action movie is realistic? I also kind of got the vibe that the producers of this movie were a bit mad at Vin Diesel but all that could be just part of the storyline, which I like. I guess the XXX will always be someone new, even more the opposite of James Bond.Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seems to be the main recurring character. We learn a little bit about his past, his scarred face in particular. He chooses an old military acquaintance named Darius Stone (Ice Cube) as the new, badder and meaner XXX. This time, they have to stop an evil Secretary of Defense, Gen. George Octavius Deckert (Willem Dafoe) from having all those in the chain of command above him assassinated. As Stone says, \"the cleanest revolution in history\". I kept expecting The Green Goblin to emerge somewhere. I guess there is a similarity between his two characters.XXX boasts some of the greatest action scenes I have had the pleasure of seeing. The tank fight on the aircraft carrier was simply awesome. Sure, I understand this probably could not and will not ever come close to happening, but it is still fun to watch. No one in their right mind could argue that.I knew well ahead of time that many, many people would put this movie down, much of them without even seeing it. While I do think that it does not have the same rebellious feel as the first XXX, it was a great movie in it's own right. Highly recommended if you liked the first one.

Its so mindless and entertaining and doesn't try to be anything beyond that. Its great.I don't know if its because the movie just hits me right or because earlier in the day I suffered through the wildly uneven new Star Wars, but there is something about this film thats wonderful.I have no idea why so many people dislike this film, certainly its no worse than the first XXX film, which was a guilty pleasure itself. Perhaps people can't buy Ice Cube as an action hero.

I was reassured, however, that he was not in it. Sitting through the first few minutes I saw names that I liked--Ice Cube and Samuel L. Jackson--and decided to give this one a shot. I didn't see the first XXX. I wish I hadn't seen the sequel. But I did. At the end I was wishing that Vin Diesel would come and save the day by shooting the characters of Willem Dafoe, Samuel L. Jackson, Ice Cube, the College Boy and the entire biker crew. To say this movie doesn't have a plot would be insulting movies which don't have a plot but at least attempt to have one. A tyrannical Secretary of Defense who wants to kill everyone, starting with the President, in order of succession so he can lead the country? A crew of DC thugs who come to the rescue of the country so they can live in a country where they are \"free to jack cars\"? This movie has the same effect on a viewers intellect as does junk food on his body. It kills it slowly. And with enough Whoppers and curly fries like this one one could become brain dead.

There is no other way to explain this release of what is surely one of the worst films of all time.Watching Ice Cube trying to behave like Vin Diesel was just so embarrassingly pathetic, it has probably dealt a fatal blow to whatever acting career he might have otherwise had. Even if he could act, his pudgy physique is just ludicrously inappropriate for an action hero.On the other hand, even without Ice Cube this would still have been a terrible film. So perhaps casting Ice Cube is really a good move, because at least they've got the fan base, who will love it no matter how bad it is. It would be hardly surprising for Vin Diesel to turn it down after 10 seconds perusing the script. I don't know if he was offered the part or not, but he'd be crazy to have anything to do with it.What I can't understand is why Samuel Jackson allowed himself to be associated with this career-torpedoing piece of trash. It would seem he was aware it was a stinker, because he was obviously just going through the motions.So, the poor viewer doesn't even have the 'so bad it's good' option, as with some of Van Damme's offerings; this is just 'so bad it's woeful'. Van Damme has a presence that lets you enjoy the performance even knowing the film is awful. Mr. Cube has no presence whatever and all you can do is wonder what the hell he's doing there.Somehow we, the movie-going public, have to inform Hollywood that we are not willing to have our intelligence thus insulted. Poor casting, direction and screenplay cannot be compensated by a big explosion every 3 minutes.So, I think I can fairly put this as one of the all-time worst films I've ever seen. Maybe nearly as bad as 'The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra'. One star is about 10 too many.",

True to the reputation of that aforementioned James Bond movie there never was a dull moment in the movie. The pace and the tension of this movie just keeps the story flowing with slight stops to help you catch your breath and ingest the movie if aren't trashing it already.I admit that upon seeing Ice Cube as the one to play the role of the new Triple X I was skeptical about his capabilities. Having the typical role of a bad-ass, the attitude and situations really suit him. I wasn't totally disappointed. However, it was sort of a plot hole for them to consider Xander Cage as being less of a character than Darius Stone. I actually didn't like that idea. I'm still confused whether their mention of the previous Triple X being killed as a cover up or a fact. Hey, this is a gov't agency! One can never assume.As usual for most action movies this is another marketing scheme for brand products from Ice Cube's backpack to his gadgets and, of course, the hot cars, which I admit are the top of the line.If you're just another movie fanatic after a good rush this movie is for you - bang for your buck.

You could write a short story, you could do a drawing, you could father some children or you could remove your own intestines with a rusty spoon. All of these activities would be a lot more worthwhile than seeing xXx 2: State of the union (or :The Next Level if you live in Blighty like me). I went to see this with high hopes that it would be another xXx... A mindless American James Bond Movie just without the class (sorry if i offend anyone by that, but thats is essentially what xXx was). But I was so wrong.The film opened promisingly, showing something that wasn't what it seemed, but despite this being a film about setups and double crosses that was possibly the best plot twist in the whole film. The film rapidly descends into clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 (the script seems to have been created by entering lots of clich\u00e9d lines into a computer and programming it to spit them out randomly). The plot is riddled with holes which leave you wondering what just happened and was it significant, then later on you find out that it wasn't. In terms of acting Ice Cube is brilliant....at saying every line in exactly the same way. The great Samuel L gives an average performance but he could have just telephoned his lines in and it wouldn't really have made much difference. Willem Dafoe give us a generic bad guy performance. Scott Speedman does quite a good job as the investigative NSA agent despite being dangled from a helicopter, but this role is unlikely to get him very far in terms of his career. Lets get down to the important part now. If its an action movie, it needs good and original action sequences right...not if you're working on xXx2. Basically, things go boom and guns go bang, but we're not given anything really new here and there aren't really enough credible action sequences to keep the audience hooked. The train sequence towards the end of the film looks terrible, like something out of a Playstation game. The CGI falls flat on its face making the films action sequences loose credibility. one thing that confused me was who this was aimed at. by having a Black main character and featuring lots of black characters I thought maybe it could be trying to get a larger black audience. But nearly every black character is a stereotype of black 'Gangsta' culture. There is a line where xXx says \"I was born looking guilty\" but this is lost when the rest of the black characters are portrayed as crooks and thugs... in positive light! what kind of thing is this movie trying to say? I just gave up trying to read into it as I realised, there is nothing to read into, it is a very shallow, badly written, badly acted, badly produced action yarn. So bad in fact that I was actually laughing most of the way through... Best comedy of the year.",

As for Ice Cube: I think he was cool. I don't know why everybody complains about he not being able to act. What's there to act? He's a Navy Seal. He likes to act tough and cool. It looks ridiculous? Sure, but it's at least entertaining. I don't mind the women being bombshells, cars being beautiful, explosions over that top, I mean what's wrong with these in a James Bond style movie?

And it was both an update and yet somehow retro, as the original Bond movies were.\"State of the Union\" is somewhat retro, too, but not in a good way. This is really a Blaxploitation update, and shares all the questionable premises with the old Blaxploitation films. Just for instance, why do we have to have this hero first seen behind prison bars? Why couldn't he be just a cool spy dude or mercenary or something? Does it have anything to do with his skin color? Well, it better not! Yet, of course it does. And while we need more heroes of color in Hollywood action films, we don't need any that so openly patronizes Black audiences by raiding Black culture - a team of gangstas save the country?! Oh, come on! Blaxploitation issues aside, I admit that the movie moves along at a fair pace, the action scenes are well done, the acting is all around pretty good. I just wish white limeys wouldn't try to pretend they know what America is all about, or the situation African Americans face here.At any rate, now that the NSA has been revealed to be a bunch of cowardly wiretappers, spying on American citizens, I suspect it'll be some years before anyone gets the gumption to make another 'xXx' film - and they would be wise to think twice before they do.Overall a poor sequel to the very fun first 'xXx' film.",

In the first ten minutes of \"XXX 2,\" we're informed, based on a small hunk of plastic, that the villainous commando team that has laid waste to NSA agent Augustus Gibbons' (Samuel L. Jackson) underground base is \"ten years ahead of anything at NSA,\" that a new XXX agent is needed, one with \"even more attitude,\" and that our heroes will need to go off the grid to find him. Which naturally leads them to a maximum security military prison in order to bust out Darius Stone (Ice Cube), the only other surviving member of Gibbons'former SEAL team. How much further off the grid can you get? While the above may feel a bit rushed and convoluted, it's merely the setup for what proves to be an extraordinary experiment in incoherent nonsense. Most action movies don't make sense; we know this going in, and hopefully try to appreciate them with that in mind. Yet \"XXX 2\" is incomprehensible more in the sense of Dada than of, say, the first \"XXX.\" The ostensible connecting thread through the jumble is a plot by the US Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe) to take over the government by assassinating all his superiors during the State of the Union address. It's easy, see, since he's in charge of PROTECTING everyone, he'll naturally have access to tanks and floor plans and assault teams. Donald Rumsfeld is surely slapping his forehead, wondering why he never thought of this.Action flicks traditionally use their plots, however brainless, to get their heroes from one big kablooey to another. \"XXX 2,\" though, instead presents a series of sort-of connected sequences, finally realizing that they should, in theory, culminate in something, in this case a firefight in the Capitol rotunda. Along the way, we're treated to pearls like \"growing up in Washington politics is like being raised in a snake pit. Everyone's fighting for territory.\" Do snakes do that? Amidst jumping boats onto bridges, dumping tanks off of piers, and assaulting the Capitol with his unstereotypical hip hop street crew, Ice Cube even manages to worm a line of Tupac into a presidential speech. Cube's Stone is clearly acquainted with gangsta rap's icons; why not just quote himself? Another movie could have some sly fun with such a conceit, though trying to force Charlie Kaufman on this enterprise would be harder than convincing Jerry Falwell to dress in drag. the absurdity leads to the Presidential Bullet Train - is there really a bullet train beneath the White House? - where speeds of 200mph plus do nothing to deter the expected vehicle jumps and fisticuffs, to say nothing of the teeny helicopter that's somehow able to keep up with it all. The formlessness of \"XXX 2\" signals a new level of contempt for the movie-going public, though anyone going into this movie under any contrary illusions will get exactly what he deserves; a cinematic cock punch.",

Vin Diesel is a little bit more believable and acceptable as an action hero simply because he is more fit and muscle bound, and because I never heard Vin Diesel rap about being a hood banger from South Central L.A.Still, xXx: State of the Union was rife with extreme type stunts of which I wasn't impressed with. But, as an extra bonus we were treated with pimp my combat vehicle. That was the final stamp on this movie to say: Noooo, the evil doers don't want any part of the hood.",

He hires an inmate who is a former US Navy SEAL named Darius Stone to travel to Washington D.C. and track down military men who try to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate the President, led by a corrupt Secretary of Defense named George Deckert. Deckert plans on assassinating the President while he is making the State of the Union Address. While the new xXx and his team be able to stop him? I highly recommend XXX: STATE OF THE UNION!!!",

It was a \"B\" no i would say \"C\" grade movie with an \"A\" grade budget. The hero was a fat African American who thought he was Lord Of The Earth and did not even fit the stereotypical action star genre that i had expected. I swear this guy has no self esteem problems, he is so much up himself i laughed my way through the entire movie. I cannot believe the extreme stupidity of this film.

I thought the first 'XXX' was OK, but the plot of 'XXX2' is so unoriginal and narrow-minded it makes the first one seem like an epic. The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?' that it almost seems like him and Vin Diesel (The Pacifier) have teamed up secretly to harm America with such bad movies. Overall, I think that Ice Cube's character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment. The other characters in this movie including the main badguy (Willem Dafoe) are cardboard thin leading you to wonder as the movie goes along if the plot development will be just as bad.Overall Entertainment Value: 4/10,..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts, which made the first one much more easy to watch",

By the way, what exactly is 'attitude'? Because it looks suspiciously like 'obnoxiousness' to me.Since coming to international attention with his excellent contemporary Maori drama Once Were Warriors, director Lee Tamahori appears to have lost the ability to construct a coherent film. He derailed the Bond franchise with 'Dire Nother Day' and now ditches his last shred of movie-making self-respect with this brain-liquefying drivel.Nobody expects an acting masterclass from an action movie, but this proves that actors are only as good as their dialogue. Samuel L Jackson and Willem Dafoe (who evidently didn't embarrass himself enough with Speed 2) give shamefully mercenary performances, while Cube is about as convincing an action hero as Harry Knowles.Who'll be XXX3?

With Ice Cube using his full range of acting skills he manages to evoke emotions not felt since the opening sequence of Star Wars - A New Hope.

With a script written by Simon Kinberg (who has gone on to write scripts for smaller films such as Jumper and Mr & Mrs Smith) we have a complex yet enjoyable plot to follow.All in all i can not recommend this movie enough, no words that i write can describe what a masterpiece this film is.

With the exception of Ice's prison breakout the action sequences are so blatantly choreographed it's not even realistic. Worse, the acting from everyone bar Jackson (who could have done this asleep) and Sunny Mabrey (who tucks in another good result for a not-too-technical-part-to-play in her fledging career) is unacceptable.

A secret agent devoting his life to loyalty and honor with more skills than a Navy SEAL, Spetsnaz soldier, and KSK soldier rolled into one. No, our super spy like that, had died. Oh, I know! Let's get a gangster we found of the streets with no loyalty, no self control and no acting ability! Our enemies are screwed now! So, what is the best thing about the movie? It's xXx. As bad as it is, it's still xXx. That means I can handle watching it...for about 20 min. (The movie is 1:40). As for the bad, there is a lot of it. Ice Cube makes Shaquille O'Neill look like a good actor. It wouldn't be the first attempt of Ice Cube to desperately be a Vin Diesel's sucessor, because he starred a year before in the movie \"Torque\", a \"Fast & Furious\" knock-off with souped-up motorcycles instead of muscle cars. He has pretty much no personality and he can't talk properly, apart from the occasional explosion. But they couldn't just take one crappy actor/rapper! No they had to take another one, in the form of Xzibit, a bad actor AND a bad rapper like IC! 2 for the price of 1! The whole premise of the movie is down right uncreative and ridiculous. The sidekick agent is now a dude (Kyle Steele, protrayed by the bland British actor Scott Speedman) instead of a girl like in the first one (Yelena, portrayed by the Italian bombshell Asia Argento) and trough in tier movie he doesn't do anything. The villain has murdered more people than our last war, but he NEVER get's caught for it? And why didn't George Decker just kill Augustus Gibbons?! Then nothing would have stood in his way! And why is Ice Cube put under so little security? Do they REALIZE this is xXx? But the worst part about it? They KILLED of the first xXx! You're telling me Ice Cube is a better than Vin Diesel because he has a better chance of surviving a maniacal dictator than Vin? No! Just no. Ice Cube needs to learn to leave acting to actors. Not rappers, not athletes, only actors.The soundtrack was awful. In this sequel replaced the hard rock OST by Rammstein to a crappy rap/hip-hop music. Also the filmmaking was terrible, mainly the director (Lee Tamahori) who commissioned what is a terrible sequel to an already poor original film. Mr. Tamahori has shown a poor eye for directing action films, just remember that special effects debacle of an opening for \"Along Came a Spider\" or the surfing scene in \"Die Another Day\". This film fails in poor storyline and supporting cast who are just relentless and one dimensional. I'm gearing up to see the next film but I'm struggling after this one-two punch knockout franchise, how talents like Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson (sadly, the only actor who returned from the first, and I recognize that he is a good actor) joined this film is probably the central question after Diesel hated the scripts. This abysmal film deserved to flop and I'm annoyed that a film of this size has horrible special effects.P.S. To the reviewers who said that the redeeming thing of this train wreck was their music (since I see that some look interested at the girls of string quartet Bond, compensating how blasted this tripe was), let me tell you, guys, that you're like the Mexicans, because without music you can't live. I warn you, guys, if in xXx3 Vin Diesel reappeared, don't wait a xXx4 where Xander Cage be killed once more, and the next agent will be George Lopez (since this movie has the same FX staff and premiered the same year of the also abysmal children's flick \"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl\") to see if you like it. Bon appetit.Even the fight scene at the Mexican restaurant in the film \"The Toxic Avenger\" (1984) is much more entertaining than this entire movie.",

The always watchable Ice Cube fills Van Diesel's shoes nicely and gives us a much more fun Triple X to watch. The plot involving a bloody coup by the Defense Secretary against the President is by the numbers and the stunts are often over the top.(State of the Union is however certified snowboard and bungee jumping free by the committee of all of us who are not 15 year old pimple faced boys) However the movie does move at a decent enough pace and doesn't take itself seriously for a minute so all the plot holes and impossible physics in the world don't take away from the fun ride. Like any true blaxploitation film there is the over the top racism and all sorts of evil white dudes. Yet State of the Union being a more progressive blaxploitation film does allow for some sympathetic honkies. There are three performances that stick out as pretty awful. Nona Gaye as Ice Cube's love interest has virtually no chemistry with our lead and looks like a basketball player in drag. Speaking of Dennis Rodman Q substitute Scott Speedman spends the entire film like he is trying out for his own Bravo special. And President's Peter Strauss' title speech is so awful (and wrongheaded) one begins to root for the coup to succeed. Those performances aside every else does pretty well and seem to be having a fun time.

Samuel Jackson (cashing a fat paycheck) returns as Gibbons and he arms his new man to raise hell on an unseen enemy and that is pretty much what happens. Willem Dafoe (also cashing a fat paycheck) plays a US Military general with shady intentions and he might be behind it all. The plot unfold rather quickly to make room for all the relentless action. Why Hollywood hasn't learned that action at the expense of story doesn't work, I don't know, but it STILL doesn't work. Hyper-choreographed fight scenes and some pretty unconvincing CGI do not make this film appealing even to fans of cheesy action movies. That's a shame since with director Lee Tamahori (the film's third fat paycheck), who directed the enjoyable 'Die Another Day', at the helm things didn't seem to bad for this movie. Tamahori has a good resume with the powerful drama 'Once Were Warriors', two good thrillers, 'The Edge' and 'Along Came a Spider, and an entry in has finally bitten of more than he can chew. A previous Bond director, Roger Spottiswoode (Tomorrow Never Dies), did the same in his next move after making a Bond film and directed the laughably bad 'The Sixth Day' with Schwarzenegger.So, in the end, this is just big-budget, star-laden, overdone, useless gloss with none of the enjoyability of Bond, nor the grittiness and much more convincing characters of the Jason Bourne film adaptations. 2/10Rated PG-13: excessive action and violence, and some profanity",

I don't know if that is true, but I guarantee you one monkey, with one typewriter and let's say, oh about 15 minutes could bang this one out from script to cutting room. Ice Cube is obnoxious, unnecessarily arrogant while his portly figure prevents any rational human being from believing he is the deadliest man in the world. Xzhibit (poorly) plays a supporting role of a gangster, who works in a chop-shop something you think wouldn't be a stretch given his days on pimp my ride. Don't worry, his role is small but his few moments on screen will have you wanting to rip your beating heart out of your chest. The rest of the cast is better, as in not offensively bad actors. I particularly enjoyed the token goofy and smart white guy.One trend that has been developing and increasing in recent times is the tendency for movies to a facet of American culture that is popular at the time. This movie, for example, does so with the auto-restoration craze. Why? I don't know. Does it work? Absolutely not. The movie is also very aggressive with some Ja Rule or DMX style hip hop as you would expect.This movie was doomed from the start. Casting Ice Cube as the lead was the biggest mistake in the entire production. He does not have what it takes to pull off a lead role, let alone in a big-budget action movie with a poor script. This movie might have had potential, unfortunately Ice Cube's poor performance is blinding and it's difficult to understand what the potential might have been.Does God exist? After seeing this movie it's more difficult for me to believe he does.",

After all, it's meant to be a fast-paced action film with lots of epic fight sequences - and it lives up to this title with gusto. The action sequences are frequent, beautifully choreographed and directed, the gadgets and cars are top-hole, and unlike most people believe, the plot actually works. Though it won't be the best film you'll ever see in your life, it will keep you entertained for its entire running time, and its stunning looks will not make you want to turn away. I know full well that there isn't much character, but the whole movie goes smoothly, with no irritating sub-plots or rubbish celebrity cameos. There is lots of rap music in this film, but that doesn't matter too much. And another good thing about this film - none of the acting is too cheesy. On the whole - xXx 2 is no masterpiece, but by gum, it is hugely enjoyable - you'll want to watch the action sequences again and again. A spiffing film! 8/10",

Not a man for car chases to be honest, but this one had some good moments. However thats about as good as it got for me. Lacked a decent story and many scenes...although it was XXX and an action movie...were quite fantastical .However if you take it for what its trying to be, a good action movie with great effects, then you wont be disappointed Don't go expecting intricate plots and romance Highly enjoyable all the same",

It does not work on some many levels, the story is awful and so far fetched, the action sequences rely heavily on CGI, so much so by the end that it loses the appeal.If you like unbelievable stunts, story and ex cons from the hood that can shoot better the military then you might be able to find something to enjoy.I hear that xXx3 is in the making, when will these people learn, they take good actors (Samuel L Jackson, Willem Dafoe) and make them perform such a cheesy story.Maybe watch it once to see how bad it is but you will not be impressed and will want a refund for your time and money spent",

DON'T DO IT! This is such infantile, charmless and intelligence- insulting pap that its only effect on me was to instill a deep depression. Something to do with the waste of time (mine and theirs), resources and talent (here I am only talking about Jackson). Every action sequence in this movie is fatally undermined because the suspension of disbelief you are required to work up is just Everest-sized. Contrast the fine Chunnel sequence in Mission Impossible with the ludicrous train chase in this moronic movie which asks you to believe that (a) you can drive a car onto railroad lines at 100mph and it will slot nicely on and (b) you can drive said car with no rubber on its tyres fast enough to ram it up the backside of a train travelling at 150mph.

XXX - The Next Level has it all: Fast cars, gorgeous babes, blazing buildings, runaway trains, seductive vamps and a radical Defence Secretary who wants to overthrow the US Government.The bad news? It also has clich\u00e9d dialogues, unbelievable fight sequences and a sloppy storyline that threatens to nullify all the positive aspects of the movie.Samuel L Jackson plays Augustus Gibbons, the survivor of an attack on the National Security Agency's top-secret headquarters, and a top propagandist of truth, justice and the American way (yeesh!).And Ice Cube is Darius Stone, Gibbons' only chance at stopping Secretary of Defence George Decket (Willem Dafoe) from overthrowing the US government and taking over the country.The other two characters on the scene are FBI agent Kyle Steele (Scott Speedman), who considers Stone a dangerous criminal, and Lola (Nona Gaye), a former flame (Ice Cube's) who owns a high-end car dealership.The movie's ending is a predictable no-brainer; and sadly, so is the entire movie. A pity, considering that it features quite a few top-notch actors. Peter Strauss plays the hip American President, complete with a vocabulary pulsing with f-words and 2pac lines. And he does a good job, considering he does not have much of a job to do, anyway.Ice Cube plays Spidey - jumping from tall buildings, thumping characterless baddies and romancing the gals, all the while yapping in a heavy ghetto accent. His stunts are hardly anything to crow about, unless your idea of entertainment is watching tubby rappers jump from skyscraper to skyscraper. Makes you wish he had stuck to fighting with big rubber anacondas instead...The fight sequences are, simply put, indigestible. And you would have to take them with more than just a pinch of salt to get that bad taste off your mouth. But then comes the silver lining - Willem Dafoe. He excels in his role of the cold, calculating foreign secretary, just waiting for his chance to grab the juicy morsel. However, you wonder how someone who had acted in good movies like Platoon and The English Patient could stoop to performing in a mediocre silver screen hide n' seek game.But make no mistake ...

This film intends to be nothing more than a fun dumb action movie,with most of the required elements ramped up to insane level. No,it's not art. It's completely silly and unrealistic. But,it you switch your brain off,it's kind of fun. It's certainly better than the first XXX,which although entertaining in parts was seriously weakened by some horrible dialogue {\"think Playstation\"}, an obsession with trying to better James Bond,and Vin Diesel,surely one of the most uncharismatic and simply bad stars around.The film does actually have a plot,yes it's unbelievable,and it may be hard to take the US President in the film trying to promote peace and greater understanding between the US and other nations {mmmmm},but the story does progress and is not just a chain to link the action together.Of course,if you want action,here it is in spades. Director Lee Tamahori tries to conceal Ice Cube's inability to fight using hyper fast editing and does not quite succeed,but other sequences such as a tank battle on a ship are excellently staged and edited for maximum impact. Yes,it could not probably happen,but does it really matter? When the lengthy final set piece comes along involving an out of control train,a car driving on the train track chasing it,and a guy hanging from a helicopter on ropes trying to pick up the President,well it's obvious we have completely left reality behind and are in the world of fantasy. No,some of the CGI here is poor and justifies the quick editing,but the filmmakers are not trying to be believable. They're trying to give you something more primal,a kind of equivalent of a roller-coaster ride. Despite my above comment saying this film is not art,maybe there is sort of crazy art to this.What may be harder to stomach in this is the shameless pandering to white folk who love black gangsta culture and the transference of some of the sexist,destructive attitude of some of that to the film. I would have liked to have heard less rap and more of Marco Beltrami's just as cool sounding and slightly tongue in cheek score during the action,and could have done without every female looking like a 12 year old boy's fantasy figure with big breasts and tight outfits,although the filmmakers themselves seem more turned on by the fast cars in the film. As with the first one Samuel L.Jackson does not do enough. However,Ice Cube is really quite OK here,he possesses both a light touch and a hard edge. As for comments about him being too fat to be an action hero,well think about that for a minute and you might realise how offensive that sounds.There are places for all kinds of films,and XXX2 deserves as much right to exist,and shows as much creativity, as whichever worthy,award winning literary adaptation is being praised to the skies by the critics right now.

Mr Ice Cube. As soon as you see his name on a movie you know it is gonna be cheaper then the coming and rising star original and it is. You can also be fairly certain it is a crap film.. which actually isn't so.Of course you have play station graphics, and of course you have Mr Cube.. or Mr Ice leaning heavy on his Rap past.. and even has a NWA photo in his on screen personal file. and of course Sam Jackson looks bored and yes the plot is , well not really there.And still it is a nice watch, the makers of this film knew that this would be a nobrainer and thank god everyone is in on the joke that is playing in this film. What speaks most for this film is the immense speed it has, never a dull moment because after 3 minutes max of dialogue there will be another shooting, an exploding car or a chase.. mostly combined. The nicest ( PS2 graphics) stunt is the one where Mr Cube hangs a little tank to the hook that launches planes off an aircraft carrier to kick another big tank off the deck.Or the legendary scene where Mr Ice sneaks around inside the fore-mentioned aircraft carrier and finds Mr Jackson alive and well.. and the rest of his team too.. the lack of surprise is very funny .Budget restrains are visible here and there, the plot involves an internal coupe to overthrow the us government.. and there is about 1 tank outside in the dark from the bad guys and around 6 baddies inside.If you have the right mindset it is really an entertaining flick, it is made to entertain you and nothing more, if you have this mindset you will have a very enjoyable time with this movie",

I don't know if that's the directors, or any other of the film- crews way of getting even with Vin Diesel for canceling his starring on this movie. But it sure leveled the movies credentials from say 10 smack down to 2 on a scale.Set aside from the 'small' deviations (The hyped up, black style-ish way with rap-ish music, talk & walk) from the first movie, style and actors performances (Note, Cube & Vin are totally different so I'm not talking about the actual acting- skills, but their way of, hell, I guess it would be after all, classed as acting. Their acting- style to say the least). The utmost first thing i reacted on was the opening scene where they blow several holes in the ground. Using some sort of self- drilling explosives, just something that belongs in a real Sci- Fi flick. That just threw me off a bit.One other thing, when xXx2 (Cube) takes a little jump with the (swamp?)boat..? Come the *beep* on..!!? Who the hell could do a jump with that precision, without calculating the jump for at least a month..? Just plain stupid. Then there are the final scene, two things; First when he jams the car up on the rail, wobbling from one side to the other..? Even his ancestors would have turn into scrap metal just being family with this guy. Secondly, blasting the crap out of the rear section, tail, call it what you will, smacking the front of the car inside what's left of the rear end of the train, climbing onto, and inside the train, the millisecond after he jumps of the car, it starts playing stray ping- pong ball, doing more back-flips then a dolphin on drugs.He also fights like a sissy (many openings for a-smack-down-to-the-bones- kinda punch. Sadly, this happens in a lot of movies)Don't get me wrong, this comment is quite harsh, to many it probably seems like I don't know what I'm talking about, some do. Hey, that's lifeLastly, I want to point out that this movie is quite entertaining although I just pinned it down far down 'critic's lane' I gave it 3 out of 10. There are far more worthless movies, to name one: The Mangler 2.0 (Yeah, I know, different genre, but still, that's a BAD movie!)See this movie, see what I'm talking about. Well worth the price in the theaters (Not that I paid any, but but..)Oh, another thing, I don't know if it was a money- issue, but this one's a bit shorter, it's only 101 minutes long, whilst the first movie was 124 minutes (132 for Directors Cut).If they'd extended the whole plot to about the same length, it probably would have given a better impression. Doing the aftermath, this movie was a bit too intense.But but, anyway, this is my a bit of my perspective of this movie. Make up your own...A little, I don't intend to rack down on colored ppl. If you must know, I'm 50/50 myself.Peace out.",

We couldn't stand it any longer and stopped the movie (thank GOD I didn't see it in a theater). All I could think of how embarrassing it must have been for the actors to sit through the premier of that movie knowing their peers where silently laughing to themselves after it was over. What was Ice Cube thinking when he read the script. I like the guy as an actor or so I thought and was anticipating the standard over-use-of-gasoline explosions that only Hollywood thinks is credible, but I just couldn't take it any longer and cheerfully put the DVD back into it's plastic coffin.",

XXX: State of the Union is a lot fast action with minimal dialog to explain the thin plot. It is a lot of fun to watch even if it grows more ridiculous. The plot has to do with Willem Dafoe,playing the Secretary of Defense, trying to take over the country. If you were President of the United Staes, would you trust Willem Dafoe to do anything? I wouldn't trust him with my dog, to say nothing about the security of this country. Ice Cube plays the new XXX since the old one was disposed of off camera. It contains every clich\u00e9 in the book, such as which woman will betray him, the black woman or the white blonde woman? If you don't know the answer to that, welcome to the movies. Like 2 Fast 2 Furious, people will probably enjoy this sequel even though Vin Diesel is not in it. It is a good to waste time with this movie while buying Star Wars tickets, but that's it. 6/10",

Jackson) escapes, and must find out who broke security and why. Gibbons must recruit a new XXX agent to do his dirty work. Gibbons has just the man, a former Navy Seal and member of his old military unit. However, Darius Stone (Ice Cube) was put in a military prison for 20 years, because he disobeyed a direct order from General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe), and he also broke the general's jaw. Just the man Gibbons needs to do the job. Gibbons gets Stone out of prison, and puts him to work. Stone discovers that Deckert, who is now the secretary of defense, is the mastermind of a conspiracy to stage a coup, and become President of the United States. Deckert has been training and placing his old military unit in the right places to stage his coup. Deckert wants the President killed and anybody above him in the line of secession. Darius Stone has other plans and is out to stop Deckert.This movie is an all around good action film. It has some good fight scenes and the special effects were good. The movie starts off with a good action scene, and continues through the end. Ice Cube adds a new dimension to the XXX character, and he actually does a good job as the new XXX. The storyline is a little hard to believe, but this is only an action movie and not real. I would recommend seeing it just for the action. You can just sit back and enjoy the action.

            "content": "Loud. Obnoxious. Annoying. Lacking originality. All words to describe Chris Tucker. Or Paula Abdul. But they also do a nice job of summarizing the celluloid floater known as xXx: State of the Union. But what do you expect when you replace the muscular Vin Diesel with Chubby McFlabbyButt (aka Ice Cube)? Vin Diesel is a deep-voiced, chiseled action star who I can actually believe kicking massive amounts of buttock. Ice Cube, on the other hand, merely has massive amounts of buttock. They're not interchangeable. Cube is the pudgy guy in high school who would walk around curling his lip and talking in such a way that he never pronounced consonants at the end of words, all in a failed attempt to appear tough. Everybody would just laugh at him and recommend that he purchase \"Hooked on Phonics.\" As such, Cube is one of the least charismatic, least effective, and least convincing action heroes that I've seen in a long, long time.And you just have to love the generic action star name they give him - Darius Stone. Why not just call him Rock Gibraltar? I heard a rumor that they were considering Buff McLargeHuge, but they were worried MST3K would accuse them of copyright infringement.Plus, Buff wouldn't really be an accurate description of this rotund rapper. There's a reason we don't get a shirtless Ice Cube scene. Early in the movie, when Samuel L. visits Cube in prison and asks, \"Do you get any exercise in here?\" You can't help but think it's a rhetorical question. If the answer isn't obvious to you at first, then it's more than hammered home later in the movie when we see Cube in a skintight wetsuit. Who on earth thought it was a good idea to get a close-up of Cube's amorphous butt? Speaking of Samuel L. Jackson, he's given some of the worst lines of the movie, the faux patriotic kind that might've been written by Lee Greenwood, and he delivers almost every single one with the finesse of someone coldly reading cue cards who has a contractual obligation to fulfill. His heart clearly isn't in it, and therein lies his redemption. I'd have phoned it in as well.You might as well go ahead and prepare to walk out of the theater dumber than you went in. Every time Ice Cube spit out something like \"truf\" or \"kick you in the teef\" or \"aidin' and abeddin'\" I could actually hear and feel gray matter dissolving. It kind of tickles, but in a scary way. I'd immediately try to think of something intelligent in an effort to minimize long-term damage. So naturally, I'd reflect on some of my past reviews. I recommend you take a similar route.Still not clear on how bad this movie is? Well, maybe you should also take into account that one scene involves Ice Cube setting a guy on fire and saying, \"Hillbilly, you need to lighten up.\" Plus, he and his friends (including non-actor Xzibit) jack a tank. That's right - a tank jacking.This is just one of those movies that piles one layer of unbelievability on top on another. I have no problem suspending disbelief, especially in regard to action movies, but there's no crane strong enough for this one. Just when you think things can't get any more stupid you are proved incredibly wrong. It all crescendos to the climax where Ice Cube is driving a car at about 220 mph, he jumps on a train track, gets tossed around, maintains balance, the tires come off, he manages to keep the rims on the track (still going about 220), chases a train, and then stands up and starts shooting the train without the car losing control. It is possibly the most ridiculous scene in an action movie that I have ever seen on the big screen. I was laughing so hard that I almost choked on a peanut butter M&M that I smuggled into the theater.You'd think that'd be it, but nope, we're THEN forced to watch a romantic scene with Cube. Wow, that really didn't work out, did it? When his generic black female friend asks him how fast the car went, he tells her, and I paraphrase, \"Two twenty. Two twenty fie (that's \"five\" for you normal, English-speaking folks). But it's only the second best ride of my life.\" Cue sappy music, the two lock lips, and I reach for my trusty yellow bucket before my dry heaving turns into something a little messier.Then, just as you're waiting for God to shine His mercy upon you and allow the credits to roll, the President tops off this cheese sundae by quoting Tupac Shakur. No joke. Ice Cube (who used the quote earlier in the movie) exclaims, \"He stole my line!\" and then shakes his head. Don't worry, Cube, you aren't the only one shaking your head. For the only time in the movie, the audience can actually relate to you.If this performs well at the box office, then we might as well all prepare ourselves for a third installment once again starring Ice Cube: XXX^3: X Cubed - Bringin' Da Chub.Rating: 2 (out of 5)",

Stationed in Kosovo during the US army's occupation, Stone was sent down after disobeying a direct order given by Gen Deckert (Willem Dafoe) and for knocking some of his teeth out after punching him in the face. But it looks like he'll get the chance to exact a long overdue revenge when Deckert becomes implicated in a bigger and wider plot to over-throw President Sanford (Peter Strauss) by foul means. With the aid of one noble Agent Kyle Steele (Scott Speedman) this is what he sets out to do.For some obscure reason (given I didn't find the original film much fun to begin with) something tempted me to want to give xXx 2 a go. Maybe it's because I'd come to accept it for what it is a bit more and wanted to switch my brain off and enjoy some care-free fun. And, I got it, though strangely not in as copious amounts as I'd have expected.The film's style is obviously striving for some kind of James Bond quality, with an opening credits sequence that appears to cheekily be playing homage to them. But it's very see-through and it should really stick to what it's about.Also, for some obscure reason, despite the fact that film's like this aren't known in general for their realism, here all the scenes where there are many highly trained men with very sophisticated weaponry firing at Cube and yet he still comes out without a scratch on him seem even more unrealistic and implausible than usual. It might have something to do with the fact that it's hard to swallow that someone as not in the best of shape as Cube could run around doing all that running and expert fighting anyway. In parts (one scene in particular towards the end) it's also very violent for a 12A film (especially if you consider under 12s can watch the film if an adult accompanies them!!!) It defeats us both me telling you this, but the acting, dialogue and script are all of a quality so poor it crushes the soul. In the leading role, Cube does his usual stiff, straining act, the over-worked Jackson just adds another worthless notch on his CV (as well as another four-figure cheque in the bank no doubt!) Dafoe delivers the same wooden appearance he gave in the Spider-Man movie and Strauss seems to be striving for the Citizen Kane award with his noble, forceful delivery as the president (don't he know presidents aren't like Abe Lincoln these days?!?) Speedman has some presence in a supporting role, but his surname is Steele, and I kept laughing because it kept reminding me of that Leslie Nielsen movie Spy Hard and I thought he was his son and that WD40 would show up any minute...Ultimately,xXx 2 shoots itself in the foot most of all by not delivering enough of what it's target audience really wanted from it. But, when the action scenes do come, some are really incredible and you've come to the right place if you want the loud, hollering hip-hop soundtrack blasting over everything.**",

I can understand it, although Fridays weren't that bad. At least he didn't pretend to be a super adrenaline-fueled action blasting devastating sexy war machine like no other. This is a tendency between rappers that is seriously damaging pop American cinema (which is damaged by many other things by the way). You've seen part one and are expecting anything better? The presence of Jackson and Dafoe might be a rescue team, right? I got a bad news for you, they don't make it even a tiny little bit less crappy. It's just way too doomed. Let's face a few facts about the reality, as is seen by this movie. You can watch it and really make some constructive conclusions. They are of course 100% your everyday reality compatible. It's very easy to avoid missiles with a tank. Tanks are very mobile, you know? Guards in prison, police and all kinds of special forces are very compassionate and polite. They wouldn't dare to shoot if they got a gun. Rather they'd just let it hang on them and try to make physical contact with you (not by hitting you of course, that's plain rude!). Just a hand on the arm to let you know they're here to support you by being beaten quickly and effectively with one or two elbow strikes. But when they shoot, they take all of the best snipers to shoot as close to you as they can without hurting you. For example Darius is on an important mission and they respect it! If you're hiding from the police, it's best to pick up the most stylish car. Police man seeing you would then for sure say to his comrade: \"hey, he looks like the guy police in all states is looking for, but in that car? they'd be dumb to do something like this, naaaaah, they sure are not the guys we're looking for\". The president of the United States is always a very righteous man, who would do anything that is necessary for citizens of this beautiful country to be satisfied with wonderful opportunities he's giving them. All men of action do everything for the flag, because dying for someone else's personal (mainly financial) interest is what God made us for. Also, if you want to become new president of USA without a vote, there's a shortcut for that: just kill the current one, that's all! There is a lot more! Do you want to see it in XXX2: State of the Union? You better don't!",

The hero is always a poker-faced cop/fed who's reluctant to fight, but always does, rarely taking a scratch in the process. There's always a villain who chews the scenery and often an underlying political subtext.xXx: State of the Union has all of these things, except for one difference: Ice Cube has charisma and can maneuver surprisingly well for a big guy. Okay, that's two things but if you've seen Ol' Squinty's recent output, you'll note the importance of the second.The movie is of course trash, but it's fun trash. The action and explosions never let up, Dafoe makes for another good action villain (shades of Spider-Man), and as with Vin Deisel in xXx, Cube's streetwise sensibility elevates it above the average blow-em-up. I somewhat object to the treatment of Sunny Mabrey's character, not that she gets hers in the end (she did deserve it) but the misogynistic way it comes off. Then again, I'm not the target gender for these movies.Overall, a trashy good time for those of us who just like to watch stuff get blown sky high.

On the strength of one good movie he's managed to convince Hollywood to part with good money after bad to make even more stupid movies, reaching a nadir in the wretched 'Die Another Day'. While he's yet to manage Uwe Boll's neat trick of making every single movie both stupid and offensive he's coming along nicely. Typically each Tamahori movie starts off strong and falters some ten minutes after curtains-up. The prospect of him teaming up Revolution studios will be welcomed by anybody who believes Paul Walker is an action star but surprisingly he's managed to make to make something very rare in Hollywood: an honest film.True, it's predictable to a maddening degree: not only can you work out that Dafoe will be sitting in the chair waiting for Jackson to turn up but to an extent you can mouth some of the dialogue along with him.None of this should stop you from watching xXx: State of the Union however as it's incredibly entertaining. It promises mindless stunts and unlike it's peers (Torque, xXx et al) it's well filmed, full of surprisingly good moments and with more muscular, visceral energy than it's predecessor. In a way it's very much in the vein of Golan & Globus in the mid 80's along the lines of the equally stupid but entertaining American Ninja, although it has a genuinely likable star in the lead role: Ice Cube. Cube is a marvellous actor I have plenty of time for; capable of knowing when to take thing seriously and when to keep his tongue firmly in his cheek and in here he's on top form. Unlike Diesel in the original xXx, Cube looks very much capable of physical harm, has some marvellous facial expressions and above all the sense of mischievous humour needed to carry such a lightweight movie.You'll enjoy xXx: State of the Union. It's clumsy, stupid and poorly written but in it's three leading roles and honesty it has a certain charm. Revolution Studios doesn't want to make an epic of complex intrigue, politics or dialogue.

The only thing I could have seen better is a little more of a beginning to explain what is going on it got into the action a little to fast for me.

All others did very well in making this movie into what it was and they all seemed to be on the same page as to what they wanted the final project to look like.I give this movie a mark of about 80-84% (sorry the stars shown is a little misleading mistake and it wouldn't fix it for me) and encourage anyone who enjoys the 007 movies and the original XXX to give it a try it deserves more credit then it has been getting.",

I suppose Vin Diesel either wasn't available, or too expensive, so Ice Cube plays the new agent XXX. ICE Cube is pretty good, not a Vin Diesel by any means, but the movie suffers not from him but from a very marginal script and a heavy emphasis on explosions and the special effects that go along with them. The current IMDb rating is \"4\" and that is about right.Ice Cube is Darius Stone, former INS agent now in prison. He needs incentive to cooperate with the request for his assistance, and it comes in the news that someone is out to wipe out him and all former members of a group. So, either sit in jail and wait to be killed, or get out there and help hunt them down first. SPOILERS: Peter Strauss plays the US President, who has an agenda of peace and cooperation. His right hand military man (Willen Dafoe) feels the US would be threatened by such a stance and, in a misguided mission thinks he must neutralize the president. So most of the movie is fighting and shooting between the good agents and the bad agents, and the need to foil the attempt to get to the president. Samuel L. Jackson is Agent Augustus Gibbons.

Ice Cube overall is good and I think, with help, could become a very good actor. Needs to take some lessons from James Bond (Brosman) on how to act cool without looking like an idiot (The part where he first comes in contact with Charlie). Jackson is also good too and I didn't really see that much bad acting on the whole apart from Xzbitz, who was probably casted because hes a Big music name, no need as he really ain't good on screen and his character was pretty boring.Overall, the OTT action is unavoidable with the XXX Movies.

Jackson) & gadget man Agent Toby Shavers (Michael Roof) manage to escape. Gibbons reasons that the hit was an inside job & has to go it alone, Gibbons has to recruit a new xXx agent & goes for ex-military Navy Seal soldier Darius Stone (Ice Cube) who is currently serving a twenty year stretch in prison. Gibbons offers Stone a deal, help him & the NSA & get a pardon, Stone agrees & breaks out of prison in order to help Gibbons find out who was behind the NSA headquarters hit. All the clues point to Secretary of Defense General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) & his men who don't agree with the President's peace loving stance on foreign affairs, after Gibbons is killed by Deckert it's up to Stone to go it alone & stop the assassination of the President...Known as xXx 2: The Next Level in Europe & Asia which are all based on the slightly altered UK version (a brief close-up of a knife exiting through someone's stomach has been replaced with a long shot of the same incident so while not cut the same scene is slightly different in either version) this was directed by Lee Tamahori & maybe he got the directing job because of his work on his previous film Die Another Day (2002) which is considered one of the worst James Bond films & since xXx: State of the Union is a James Bond rip-off the omens were not good. Unfortunately xXx: State of the Union is as lacklustre, as silly, as predictable (did anyone really think that Samuel L. Jackson's character was actually dead?), as dull & as generic as I feared. For a start the plot is ridiculous, there are so many instances of just bad logic or things that make no sense it's impossible to take it seriously. The script also has really awful character's, Ice Cube as xXx is given a bad gangsters attitude where he just seems moody all the time & just can't help referring to his black gangster past, Willem Dafoe as the villain looks bored & his rather pointless plot to kill the President is born out of nothing more than to keep hostilities between countries going so the US military can wage war & the annoying comedy sidekick gadget man Sahvers is a complete Q rip-off from the Bond films & that's not the only thing that is ripped-off from a Bond film. There's two Bond girls, one good & one bad & the who spy thing here is just ridiculous. The various speeches & dialogue is awful, xXx convinces a fellow black gangster to help him save the President so he can still live in a free US & be free to steal & kill like he always has, yeah right. The whole black gangsters with an attitude against white people angle runs through he entire film & it gets really annoying. At just over 90 odd minutes long at least it's short & it does move along at a decent pace but the ridiculous plot (where are all the secret service agents at the end? Would it be really that easy to kidnap the President?), awful dialogue & horrible patriotic speeches & the fact you never really know whether to laugh or not at any given point means xXx: The State of the Union is a pretty poor effort all round.Both Vin Diesel the original star of xXx (2002) & Rob Cohen the director agreed to make a sequel before the original even opened but both left xXx: State of the Union which is no surprise if they actually read the script. While the original xXx had some spectacular action that looked quite stylish xXx: State of the Union is routine by comparison, sure there's plenty of explosions, fights & shoot-outs but it's very silly, some bad CGI computer effects & a lack of any real visual style means it's a little forgettable. Scenes of Ice Cube driving a tank like a motorbike is just plain ridiculous, I mean he manages to dodge guided missiles in the thing! The end sequence has a cool premise but driving along train tacks on the bare rims of a Porsche is just funny, a scene in which Ice Cube jumps off a roof only to grab the landing bars of a helicopter that appeared from literally nowhere is also hard to watch without laughing. The explosions are big, the weapons are cool & are cars sleek, fast & sexy but every action scene is just ridiculous & you need to suspend your disbelief for just about the entire running time. Gibbons cool car at the start is actually painted with 'interference pigment' which appears to change colour depending on the angle you look at it from & it's not a CGI effect which I initially thought it was.With a supposed budget of about $87,000,000 I can't believe Ice Cube was cast, he is just awful & impossible to like or warm to. While the production values are slick & expensive xXx: State of the Union is very soulless & bland. The cast know their in a bad film here, Ice Cube is just awful, Samuel L. Jackson & Willem Dafoe look bored while Scott Speedman & Peter Strauss are given nothing to do.xXx: State of the Union is a bad big budget action spy film, it rips-off James Bond & various other Hollywood blockbusters but it's all so generic & forgettable with some of the most ridiculous action set-pieces in recent memory which offer plenty of explosions & bangs but little in the way of tension or excitement. A further sequel xXx: The Return of Xander Cage (2011) is listed as being in production.",

Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Daylight and The Fast And The Furious among his repertoire... I don't think so. Didn't matter they weren't coming back for the sequel.Bringing Lee Tamahori (007's Die Another Day) was an odd move. It feels like a setback, actually. From the real deal to this franchise imitation? Oops. Ice Cube repeats himself with just movie attitude, no acting really, which is an honest gimmick when bringing a new agent to the latest assignment. Having Samuel L. Jackson back is always a bonus and Willem Dafoe as the baddie adds a certain, albeit familiar, flavor. But what was the outcome, boys and girls? No Hollywood executive remembered this lesson: Don't make an action sequel with Dafoe as a baddie (Speed 2, anyone?). Never green-light a follow-up without its original hero (Speed 2, anyone?). The Pacifier proved to be a slick hit at the box-office. See Vin. See Vin run.Besides the first 5 minutes or so (better than the entire xXx of 2002), there isn't anything nice to comment about State Of The Union. This movie is a total flop, it fails miserably in storytelling, casting and production values. It is a shame that a fairly-looking ride like this gets wasted pretty bad. Too much of the same (although \"the same\" is not a problem for me in the action genre), and overloaded with CGI on every testosterone-implanted sequences. Ice Cube was OK until delivering on-liners nonstop all the way to the end credits. And shamelessly, I must add. Scott Speedman is a total miscast here, beauty Sunny Mabrey was a bore and Peter Strauss gave us the worst movie President in recent memory. It hurts that heavies like Jackson and Dafoe are involved in this crap.Oh, and Diesel's Xander Cage dies because the agency was ambushed worldwide. Characters only comment about it, like no big deal. No pictures or anything. He survived all the explosions and stunts in the original and gets poor treatment in this next level. Way low! Finally, the blame goes to Joe Roth and his Revolution Studios. The sub-plot that was dealt here (of a fictitious American president who plans a detour on diplomatic relations with rouge governments, in order to become potential allies of the nation) was plain stupid. Is this a Hollywood company of the politically idiotic? Produce something decent for a change!",

Cohen made Stealth, which was probably not the right move. Ice Cube then came in to be the new xXx, which wasn't a great move either. Diesel made A Man Apart, which was a minor success.The producers brought in Lee Tamahori, who had just had a success with the Bond film Die Another Day.The movie starts with blowing everything up from the first one. Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) is nearly killed and Xander Cage is murdered in Bora Bora. This means that a new xXx must come on board: former Navy SEAL Lieutenant Darius Stone. There's only one issue; he's in the brig at Leavenworth for disobeying orders and attacking General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe), who is now the Secretary of Defense.Scott Speedman shows up as a fellow agent, Xzibit is in this and Michael Roof comes back from the first movie. Sunny Mabrey from Snakes on a Plane and Species III plays one of the villains and Nona Gaye plays a love interest.A scene was filmed showing Xander Cage being killed in an explosion off-screen, with his severed body parts flying in the air. The scene was deleted, just in case Vin Diesel ever decided to reprise his role. Of course he came back.",

Did everyone forget that this is the sequel to xXx, which itself wasn't the best movie ever. Also correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't Hero the last action movie with a good plot, and that was made in 2002.When i walked in to see this movie, i was expecting one thing, some big action sequences, and I got what i want. There are some good action scenes in this movie, most notably, the tank scene, the escape from the prison scene, and the last shootout. Unfortunately the horrible CGI destroyed some scenes like the jet sequence, and the car scene.So, I recommend watching xXx: State Of The Union, but only if you want to have some fun watching some big action.

Sure it was probably fake but there are some good actors like Samuel Jackson and Willem dafoe. Ice Cubes debut as XXX was quite believable since he is supposed to be some gangster rapper or something. Deffintly this is not a James bond film and it copies some aspects from the series. The cgi was pretty fake and had no realism. TOO MUCH IS GREEN SCREEN!!! comparing cube to Vin diesil I would say Vin diesil but I preferred this film. Not the worst film I've seen but definitely not in imdbs top 250. I wander if i should rate this lower but I'm being generous. Overall this film is quite enjoyable and entertaining to watch. This is more of a kids film than a intelligent adult thriller. So if you don't care about a story line and prefer non stop action you can go and give this film a go.",

The plot is predictable and this is nothing more than a movie where someone could say the special effects are OK. This movie is a BOMB so don't waste your time. Cube is OK at comedy but awful at action movies.Cube should return to comedy as he is no star here. He has little personality. The other actors seem like all they want to do is get this movie, Dafoe's skills were wasted in this flop. Hopefully it won't cause a part 2. This movie is NOT recommended.",

Even though the plot wasn't that great in the first xXx, it was much better than its sequel. xXx: State of the union's plot was pretty silly and pointless. Also the dialogue was more cheesy and lame. State of the Union, plays less like a sequel to xXx than a parody of it and the whole action genre, and that only gets it so far.The new xXx is Darius Stone (Ice Cube), an ex-military ex-con recruited by program leader Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson). His mission is to stop a covert coup by the corrupt Secretary of Defense (William Dafoe), while driving a bunch of tricked-out cars, delivering cheesy one-liners, and blowing up everything in sight.The mocking tone encompasses both the original xXx (who gets derided for his extreme sports skills) as well as the new version, and there's a certain knowing camp quality that keeps the film marginally entertaining. Once you get past the wink-and-nudge jokes, though, it's all standard action-movie fare, with explosions every few minutes and a mostly incoherent plot. There are a number of set pieces with obvious, poorly rendered CGI, and while the extreme-sports angle of the original is the target of jokes, it did give that film a unique angle that State of the Union lacks. Looking for the the third installment. xXx: Return of Xander Cage.",

There was overload of black humour which mars the pace of the movie. On that note, the digs at the black was not in good taste (racist, perhaps?).

He was convincing as an adrenaline junkie not quite comfortable with his new role as a secret agent but doing his best. His dialogue was spot-on entertaining (\"Dude, you have a bazooka. Stop thinking Prague Police and start thinking Playstation.\").But there's hardly anything to like about Ice Cube's XXX. First of all, it's hard to imagine him as a lieutenant in an elite fighting unit (he was, as my brother pointed out, \"more West Side than West Point\"). And as others have pointed out, he has just about one facial expression, which gets tiring to watch for the length of the entire movie. To Ice Cube's credit, he handles the physical aspects of the action sequences well.

The conflict was hot, the lines were sharp, and the action was totally ambitious. But the final result didn't live up to that!(Ice Cube) is the worst action hero of all time. I think standing his charisma could grant remission to your sins. So how about his performance too?! That could bring you heaven! He's awful, obnoxious, atrocious.. to the end of dictionary. I don't see anything persuasive in him to take the role of xXx. His body isn't astonishing or something, he shows more like the dumpy type. Let alone his too dumb face, his eternal grin that summarizes all the human silliness, and his occasional smile which's incredibly provocative. I believe he must not make action movies, or rather \"movies\", again!The budget wasn't up to the fantastic action scenes that this script provides. The CGI was obvious and inadequate. Hence, with the crazy cuts at the climactic sequence, the whole thing seemed like annoying poor cartoon. I couldn't believe myself when I knew that this was directed by (Lee Tamahori) the same man who made (Die Another Day) 3 years earlier. It's without a doubt the most straight-to-video material he ever did.The original movie's brilliant sense of spoofing Bond, or exposing the game while achieving it, wasn't here at all. The sense of humor is killed. The speech (Ice) gives, while convincing (Xzibit) to join to the action, was too goofy. The female lead was extremely inanimate, with a spirit of a statue! The presence of (Cube) instead of (Van Desial) apart was a thunderbolt of a surprise, not to mention the impudent reference that the first xXx is dead!! Even the live, some kind of sane, presence of (Samuel L. Jackson) and (Willem Dafoe) didn't save the day. All of these reasons collaborated to smash this movie's reputation as a good one.I just liked 2 things: The idea of one secretary of defense who's hating peace, wanting to destroy everything for the sake of world control, refusing the principle of transforming the enemies into allies; all as a smart shadow for the actual president back then George .W . Bush (even the character's name was George!). And the idea of (Rambo) meeting (Pimp My Ride), where the boyz from the hood go 2 blow up the Congress 4 America; it is clever however with - at least - another lead.(xXx 2) is a disappointment if you compare it to the first, or to its own desire to be stunning action. It dreams beyond its well to fulfill. Clearly that budget betrayed what was intended, and the casting ruined the rest!Lastly, \"Wars come and go, but my soldier stay eternal\" Tupac. \"Everytime you go away, It actually kinda makes my day\" Avril Lavigne!",

            "content": "Review 'xXx: State of the Union' (might contain spoilers!!! Not that it will matter to anyone but OK:)First of all, I don't often write movie reviews. I think if you like an actor or director, and they have a new movie out, just go see it, regardless of what some lonely reviewer might write about it. But some movies are just begging to be written about...We were so bored out of our minds, that we ended up in the centre of the city and went to see a movie (something I indeed hardly do, due to the fact that there are other people inside such places, with all the noises, eating and yelling with it....I noticed that there was this new movie with the following actors in it: Ice Cube, Samual L. Jackson and Willem Dafoe. I though \"If you have these three guys playing in one movie... it has to be instant cult.\" And I was so right I was even ashamed about being SO right.The movie itself is a MUST SEE. Just to make it a valuable contribution to anyone's top-5 worst movies ever. You will not believe the amount of total crappy acting, badly written conversations, bad timing, sleazy one-liners (\"You got to lighten up, Hillbilly!\") and idiotic special effects in the movie. It will make \"Mission Impossible 2\" look like a very realistic documentary if you know what I mean (And I'm not even talking about flying a helicopter into the Euro-Channel-tunnel?).There is no beginning to tell how much amused myself with this movie, I really cried from laughing with the bad acting. Face it, Ice Cube isn't known for his Oscar-award winning speeches, neither for his fast moves, his ability to entertain just by standing on the stage, or by his top-actor karma that will enlighten you with wisdom and soul. In fact, I suspect the makers of this movie to first have called in \"Ice-T\", but when realizing he was \"too expensive\" they called this Ice Cube guy instead. First of all they must have let him do some exercising to loose weight for playing this 'running' scenes. It didn't totally succeed, because they needed to fast-forward some of the action to make it look like he's fast (you can actually see his belly-fat roll around while he's running away from half an army of heavily armed Navy SEALS. Anyway, low budget or not, belly-fat or not - he's the main character in the movie.You would expect this bad-boy attitude, fast running, shooting hero-like person, instead you get some B.A-Baraccus-like acting and posing, the gun-attitude of a ten year old,... the one liners which were not even funny. I love one-liners in fact. Some movies are just build on the witty one-liners they let the main characters spew out. And sometimes it's funny indeed. Here you get the most ridiculous one-liner-yelling, fat-ass pimp-car driving B-actor, who makes everything look like a walk in the park, even when he catapults a Abraham's-tank onto ANTOTHER Abraham's tank ON AN AIRCRAFT Carrier, while yelling \"Was that your best shot, take this one!\". He just stands there, all the time with the same face. While some girl says to the main character: \"If you want anything,... anything, just ask me.\" - \"What about some french fries and a shake?\". where the guys behind me in the theater said to each other \"He's good,... he's really good\". Which made me even laugh harder.The second character in the movie is Samuel \"He's in everything\" L. Jackson he's the X's boss. which makes him in fact totally pointless int eh so-called plot. There is no point having a boss of a character with as mission: being on himself and totally uncontrollable. Which means: no boss. He's a sort of shadow-like figure that yells things like \"You should have killed that bitch!\" or \"I told you, you should have killed that bitch\". It's the kind of movie where Beavis & Butthead would say \"Hehe, cool, explosions, ...huhuhuhu, look at that chick's ass\" \"Yeah... hehehe kill her Ice Cube!\"Then there is the 'bad guy' - Under the acting talents of Willem Dafoe,... looking his old bad self again, like everyone in this movie, he also yells one liners, although they're more in the style of \"Checkmate in three steps man... let it look like an accident\". The best part of his character is that he actually wants to kill the president of the USA, stands next to him with a loaded gun and then succeeds in a whole bunch of things, except killing him. All because of the main character and his former \"gang from da hood\" buddies fire an artillery shell with a high-jacked military tank onto the white house yelling 'god bless America' (It's a very realistic movie as you can see).You have every single clich\u00e9 of an action movie crammed into this one hour lasting video-clip styled thing... which makes it instant cult for me... Speedboat races, fast food eating, racing, train wrecking, bazooka shooting, hijacking, rope climbing, aircraft carrier destroying, tank fights, insults, babes in short skirts, gangster-rappers, boom-cars, Ferrari's, Presidents who get rescued Airforce-one style, explosions, explosive gas-leaks, knife wounds that heal them self after 20 seconds, people who die but live on, people that live but keep dying, more tanks, night vision-wearing navy seals, more explosions, crappy acting, crappy Playstation-like special effects, stupid plot (if any is detectable), and above all: the most ridiculous computer-hacking scene in a movie ever!!!! (I was close to peeing myself)In any case... it was so bad that it was good... go see this movie if you can put your brain to a halt for a full hour and just want to enjoy all the crappies they can throw at you. Or if you're stoned, drunk or otherwise mentally incapacitated.points: 1/10 just for the one-liners only, instant cult! a must see!",

            "content": "What worked: My review is pretty short and the time I started typing this is around 2:26 am Sunday, so please bear with me. This film is essentially the first film on steroids and without Diesel(the star of the first film). What worked: First off, Ice Cube makes this film(He's more bad ass than Diesel is)and he carries the action sequences really well, Samuel L. Jackson is good as Gibbons he's smart ass, bad ass, and funny as hell. The action in this film tops anything done in the previous XXX(the train sequence blows away any thing seen in XXX) film and the story even though it is preposterous,delivers(It's basically way to drive the action scenes). And the special effects for the most part was terrific. The women in this film (especially Nona Gaye)look way better than Asia Argento(unless you like pale small skinny women). And I loved how they made little references to the first XXX. What didn't work: The dialogue in this film is very HORRIBLE and some of the jokes were hit and miss and some of the special effects looked very obvious and fake. And it is really necessary for Willem Dafoe to keep on playing villains(He's a great actor but he always plays a villain)I would like for him to be cast as an regular person or a hero for a change. Overall: This movie was a fun action flick with cool special effects and decent acting. 6/10",

            "content": "Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is xXx: State of the Union (2005), the sequel to the xXx series but this time we don't have Vin Diesel's Xander Cage...nope, instead we have Straight Outta Compton's Ice Cubeeee...and boy did this film hype me up. What happened? Total disaster. So, the story is pretty much a group of terrorists has infiltrated government ranks and have destroyed a xXx headquarters and plan to do a coup d'\u00e9tat over the president of America. NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons returns and frees out Ice Cube's character Darius Stone, a Navy Seals ace under Gibbons however there is still beef between the pair due to a failed operation and a throw down with the current Secretary of Defence played by Willem Dafoe led to Stone's court martial and landed him in prison.Once again, the franchise is a clear Bond rip off with typical OTT action scenes but where this film fails is the noise it makes may be big and bold however it lacks actual tension or excitement. So, what happened to this film? Well for starters, Ice Cube is the miscast anti-hero of the film and it's not his fault, the story and script do not make the Darius Stone character an interesting one as majority of his lines are cheesy. The best part of Stone is him springing out of prison where you can understand why he is the new xXx but this erodes away due to the pseudo-James Bond-style plot. Now this may have worked in the first flick but this time around they should have made it unique with Cube's role. Two factors which led to the movie not progressing well includes the plot and CGI - both make this film look like a PlayStation video game. Plus, what did they do with Gibbons' techie, Toby who seems to be playing a clueless white bloke? They made this flick too racial stereotypical mixed with the Bond stereotypical genre which isn't a good mix. Willem Dafoe plays the main baddie (Dafoe was miscast as villains in the 90's and 2000s) and once again the script fails him and ultimately the movie. Rapper Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his \"Pimp my Ride\" personae being called on. Overall, there was too much hype in this flick which didn't end up meeting expectations while turning it into a mixture of hip hop video and a PlayStation game 5/10.",

Ice Cube as XXX is about as vulnerable as Superman. He is never in any real danger and is also god's gift to women. Also included are some racial stereotypes, from all of XXX's urban pals with rims on the cars, listen to hip-hop, all calm and cool, and know how to use weapons. Another thing is XXX doges three rockets in an armored military tank. That's pushing the limit to stupid. Also I noticed that almost every white person in this movie is either evil, corrupt, a turncoat, or all of the above. Men AND women! While ever black person here is a hero, nice, and bad ass, with the one dimensional chicks. Not one black villain here. Not even one of the enemy's troops has one black guy in their ranks! I even noticed a few Asian enemy troops! Jeez.... One scene, XXX attacks a white woman and Samuel Jackson says: You should have killed that bitch! What message am I being sent here? Don't trust whitey? Martin Luther King would be spinning in his grave.The Last Word: Inane. This also has a bad message. Avoid this crap.",

But, for xXx 2, they eliminated right off the bat what made xXx unique and fun: the extreme sports bit. now, they force a ex-navy SEAL into xXx-dom (while the agency itself is wiped out). It sucks sucks sucks. This movie is full of crap, right from the beginning and has so many no-nos the list is too long to describe. I like some of Tamahori's work (The Edge was amazing) so I had a pretty good expectation, but it's worse than the worst Bond movie ever. Avoid... I didn't even finish it, which is something I never do. Believe me if you love the original xXx stay away from this one, not worth your money or even the 2 hours it takes to watch it; in this case, ignorance truly is bliss.",

The Capitol Building looks like the real thing inside and out. I really liked this one. I am a 76 year old guy who is not a fan of Rap music but it was done well here.

So its out with the sports action hero and enter the wrongly framed spy.In this film the USA President has an agenda for peace. This upsets the Secretary of Defence (Willem Dafoe) who rather likes conflict and who has had past issues with Darius Stone and is planning a coup against the President with his supporters and rogue agents in place. Its up to Stone and a assorted rag tag of helpers to stop this.Once again Dafoe enters a sequel as the villain to a blockbusting original as he did in Speed 2. Once again with diminishing results.

            "content": "Making one wish they were watching a bonafide triple X rated adventure instead, one of Hollywood's greatest insults to intelligence as we know it marks almost no progress since the heady days of Under Siege and other brain-dead action numbers. At least those had some zest to them, though.In an age when movies strive to get a leg up on the competition, such blatant abuse of viewer time and IQ can never be forgiven. Put simply, XXX2's the worst flick this reviewer has encountered in a while. It's built around two actors in the declination stage of their careers. But although Sam Jackson appears eager to take whatever's given him recently, he at least can stand proud and lay claim to having style and talent. Conversely, Ice Cube's gruff exterior hasn't changed one iota since Ghosts of Mars, and for this outing offers even less range than usual. Both add nothing to proceedings, and any off-chance of them salvaging director Lee Tamahori from churning out another rancid mass-product (he previously gave us tepid Bond entry Die Another Day) evaporates quickly.On the talent front, hardly any cast members get the job done, save for beauty Sunny Mabrey (Species 3). She at least has some wares to flaunt, and a mean streak any thriller fan will quickly lap up. On the additional infamy front, other disgraces include stalwart character actor Willem Defoe as Defense Secretary Deckert, who's bent on national security no matter what the cost. But since all protagonists and antagonists in XXX2 are about as in-depth as Petri dishes, no meaningful agenda emerges to engage our interest, and sooner rather than later the film reveals its true, vacuous nature. Meanwhile, Jackson reprises his original XXX role as Augustus Gibbons, chief agent at XXX, the super-covert organization responsible for saving the world from villainy, but not from horrible movie-making, we presume.When the secret agency comes under assault from unknown enemies, Gibbons springs into action. However, his main man from the last episode, the titular XXX, was taken out by whoever's behind all these problems, so now finding a new hero becomes the main priority. Enter Ice Cube as Darius Stone, a former Navy SEAL incarcerated for disobeying and striking a superior officer (Secretary Deckert, by the way). Stone's unwilling, malcontent nature grates almost instantly, as he and the thespian behind him have little of what made the original XXX pleasant in a renegade, extreme kind of way: Vin Diesel. The plot doesn't thicken at all, as what follows amounts to some of the dumbest action tripe in the modern annals of celluloid history. Scott Speedman (acceptable in Underworld) joins the debacle as Agent Steele, head of the NSA and one of those trying to make sense of the attack on XXX and the nation as a whole. He, too, gets tainted with the inept vibe pervading the project, and mostly does whatever you'd expect from a dashing, handsome and totally shallow G-Man.Characters grafted with idiotic names, obvious CGI bits, miserable action and a story your four year old niece could top any day of the week render XXX2 a waste of time deserving several inquiries by Capitol Hill committees. Maybe we could pin a national security breach on these people? Demoralizing the movie-going public and all. Although it should have been rated NC17 for disturbing scenes of boneheadedness, XXX2 instead made it to screens everywhere, but hopefully signals the end of this disheartening franchise.

Aside from the rap music, which I can take or leave, the music is a sort of JB/IMF combination and likewise goes down nicely. Where it's a bit deficient is in humor, the smart lines aren't played well, and sex. I mean in any decent JB film, you wouldn't get him passing over some of the ladies in this film, but Ice Cube does. Cube by the way is pretty good in his role. He's a charismatic actor, just like Defoe and Jackson. The sort who could read a phone book and make it interesting. And while I found Diesel acceptable in the first one, he got poorer in later films and had some deserved flops. Maybe he'll pick up and improve now that he's had to do something as out of character as Pacifier.",

I am from Iceland so I saw a name I had never seen before Ice Cube and I found out that he was a rapper and then I got more frustrated, a rapper replacing Vin Diesel,horrible!. But then I saw the trailer and I felt a little bit better I saw this guy Cube and he looked good as a loose cannon, I saw a pretty girl, Willem Dafoe as the villain and a plot which had something to do with minister using his power, interesting. Then two days ago I bought the film when I was looking through the DVD section of a local store and yesterday I watched it and....... I loved it!!!! Ice Cube bring this mean look to the Triple X and the history between him and Gibbons gives the plot a hate driven power. I was also surprised by the humor which I thought was great, Stone giving these one-line jokes much like 007 and then a few just kind of comedy scenes like Reverend Billy Bob Baker and hijacking a tank (Hilarious). I will admit that much of the film is very, very, very unreal but let's not forget that this is a movie so I go with it. Only thing that I feel this movie is missing that the first one had is death scenes I was expecting a cooler death scenes like in the first one but hey nobody is perfect. And after seeing this movie a came here on IMDb and I saw people complaining about this movie and I was so surprised that the first thing I did was watching the movie again with the complains I read in the back of my head and honestly I couldn't see anything wrong.

Jackson decides he needs a new agent xXx so breaks Darius Stone out of prison and sets about investigating who it was that organised the attack. Things don't go well for Gibbons as he is captured by the bad guy who is none other than Secretary for Defence General George Deckert played by Willem Defoe; with Gibbons out of the picture Stone must do everything he can to stop the traitorous politician. He learns that Deckert is planning to stage a coup d'etat by assassinating the president to stop him Stone must recruit an army of his own\u0085 luckily his old gang of car thieves are up to beating some of the best trained men in the US military! Obviously this isn't the most realistic of films and if you want a modicum of believability you probably shouldn't bother with this, if however you just want mindless action with lots of explosions and spectacular chases then you could do a lot worse. Ice Cube does a reasonable job as the new xXx and Samuel L. Jackson and Willem Defoe were good in their roles. The CGI effects were somewhat over used and in several scenes it was an obvious effect rather than a looking as if it might possibly have been a stunt that unfortunately reduced the sense of danger. Overall though this wasn't as bad as I'd feared it would be and I'd recommend any action fans check it out if it is on TV, I wouldn't go out of my way to see it though.",

            "review_title": "Solid But Superficial \"xXx\" Sequel",
            "content": "\"Day Another Day\" director Lee Tamahori's \"xXx: State of the Union\" amounts to a solid but superficial sequel to Rob Cohen's sensational \"xXx\" (2002) starring Vin Diesel with few surprises and revelations. Scenarist Simon Kinberg would graduate to better, more prestigious projects, such as \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" \"Sherlock Holmes,\" and \"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\" Nevertheless, like his standard-issue screenplay for \"xXx: State of the Union,\" Kinberg has penned some deplorable potboilers, such as \"Fantastic Four,\" \"Jumper,\" and \"This Means War.\" Reportedly, both Vin Diesel and Cohen walked off this movie, and producer Neal Moritz had to scramble to keep the franchise going. Despite Tamahori's fast-paced direction and some excellent special effects, \"xXx: State of the Union\" doesn't really resemble a genuine Triple-X adventure. Instead, this movie looks like a James Bond adventure as well as a homage to John Frankenheimer's brilliant paranoid government thriller \"Seven Days in May\" where the Chairman of the Joints Chiefs (Burt Lancaster) sought to wrest power from a liberal-minded U.S. President (Frederic March). Similarly, a hardline Secretary of Defense, General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe of \"Spider-man\"), chafes at the bit to commit treason against the current liberal President James Sanford (Robert Strauss of \"Nick of Time\") who wants to win their hearts and minds of our enemies. Eventually, Deckert does take Sanford hostage before the new xXx puts his foot into his plan. Aside from Samuel L. Jackson, the only \"xXx\" character returning to the fold\u2014or perhaps I should say\u2014surviving the initial massacre is armaments expertise Agent Toby Lee Shavers (Michael Roof of \"Black Hawk Down\") with his knack for dreaming up new weapons for our hero. Conspicuous by its absence are the set-up, training scenes in the two Vin Diesel \"xXx\" movies.\"xXx: State of the Union\" gets off to a fast and furious start. Deckert's dastards breach a clandestine underground CIA station in Virginia beneath a horse ranch and shoot anybody that moves with terminal efficiency. Later, we learn that Xander Cage was killed in faraway Bora Bora. Essentially, this revelation occurs during little more than an off-the-cuff exchange of expository dialogue between two agents as they survey the destruction done to the facility. Of course, now, we know better because Xander has reappeared in \"xXx: Return of Xander Cage.\" After making a hair-raising escape from that subterranean facility, Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson of \"Pulp Fiction\") recruits Cage's replacement from a nearby military prison. As it turns out, the new xXx, Darius Stone (Ice Cube of \"Ghosts of Mars\"), is pugnacious fellow with a criminal background until he become a top-notch Navy SEAL. Darius must beat up his armed guards with his elbows while his wrists remain cuffed, scramble frantically across a rooftop, and improbably enough hurl himself into the air to snag the skid of a helicopter in a rendition of the old Charles Bronson chopper escape thriller \"Breakout.\" Unlike Xander, Darius is no extreme sports fanatic, and he conducts his maneuvers without the fanfare of a skateboard, snowboard, skis, or parachute. Of course, our heroes thwart Deckert and his killers, even when they are speeding away from the capitol on a bullet-train designed especially for the president. Darius pursues Deckert and Sanford in a sleek Shelby coupe roadster that he launches onto the rails behind the bullet-train.Tamahori keeps everything churning at delirious breakneck speed in this sequel. There are plenty of explosive fireworks, but this is strictly a slick, superficial thriller that will eventually look dull in another decade. During a final quarter hour finale, Darius is stabbed in the forearm so he has something else to contend with aside from the obnoxious villains. Augustus is temporarily taken out of the action when Deckert's men abduct him and then plan to use him as the fall guy when they have the Chief Executive executed. Of course, Deckert's grand plan doesn't pan out. Incidentally, Dafoe makes a nasty foe as the chief villain. Scott Speedman is appropriately athletic in his suit and tie as another CIA agent after Deckert, while Alabama-born actress Sunny Mabrey doesn't cut it as a lethal wench with an attitude. British lenser David Tattersall, who shot \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" (1999) and \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\" (2005) gives this lackluster actioneer a sense of magnitude with his splendid widescreen cinematography. Solid but second-rate from fade-in to, fadeout, \"xXx: State of the Union\" gets by on bits and pieces.",

Challenges with their history that led to Stone being incarcerated makes their trust and mission challenging; but with the United States at risk, they will do their best to work together to achieve their common goal.This movie is directed by Lee Tamahori (Next) and stars Ice Cube (Friday), Samuel L.

They tried to pile as much action scenes in this as they could but Ice Cube had his limitations. Every car chase action scene was terrible, especially the final one on the train tracks, as the CGI was very bad. The acting is also fairly miserable.If this was a low budget movie there may be an excuse for this being so bad, but it isn't, so there's no excuse for this being this awful.

The ability to suspend all disbelief is probably a must-have, like for so many movies of its type. Parts of the story are a little predictable, but the action scenes were good and some of Ice Cube's stone-faced one-liners had us howling.Ice Cube was, I think, a better actor in this role than the star of the original XXX (Vin Diesel) was. I know others have criticized Ice Cube's acting, but I thought he did a credible job of playing the reluctant, royally ticked-off XXX character and keeping us laughing while we sat on the edge of our seats awaiting the outcome of the action sequences.Samuel L. Jackson and Willem Dafoe were awesome, as usual, and perhaps their incredible acting talent helped boost Ice Cube's believability. But I had no difficulty believing in Ice Cube as Darius Stone -- if there was anyone that seemed less than believable to me, it was Peter Strauss' wimpy President Sanford. But perhaps that was intentional, too; his lack of gumption made the other male characters look positively laced with testosterone.Highly recommended for action-flick junkies and those who enjoy a light-hearted lark of a movie.

The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible, the action scenes completely unrealistic, even Ice Cube played it badly. Where was the director of this movie? What was Samuel L Jackson doing in this movie? How about Willem Dafoe? Or even Peter Strauss? I guess these will be questions that will haunt humankind forever.The only one comfortable in his role was Xzibit, building and stripping cars, acting ghetto and saying little. They didn't even stick to the idea of the first XXX, which was the anti-hero. The hero here is \"the next tripleX\" because the first one died. We don't know how or where or when, he just died, nobody remembers him, he refused the role in the sequel, so screw him! The main character in xxx 2 is not a bad guy at all, just a poor ghetto black man, entering the navy seals, excelling there and thus becoming a good guy, then getting (wrongly) imprisoned by the villain. From anti-hero to clich\u00e9-hero.There was a moment in the movie when I thought this will go a little over the -10 IQ limit, when I saw the first scene with Willem Dafoe and Peter Strauss together. I said to myself: \"Clearly the villain is Strauss, since Dafoe must turn out to be a good guy in the end\". No. Willem's face, choice of casting and the role in Spiderman assured his role as the bad guy.Mr. Dafoe, if you ever read this: stop playing stupid parts, you're a great actor! As for Samuel L Jackson, he should either revise his choice in movies or stick to voice doubling. Damn, this was a bad movie :(",

First of all I would like to say that you shouldn't really expect too much from this movie so that you wouldn't be disappointed. Despite a better plot, or rather and idea for a plot, it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. One of the most annoying things was the occasional quantum leaps in logic but for movies like this, you just have to expect them. The second thing was the annoying close up cinematography made even worse by the very speedy editing. The clarity of events that DoP David Tatersall and director Lee Tamahori had managed to create in their previous joint effort Die Another Day was simply blown away. And third, there was the awful soundtrack by Marco Beltrami which is made up of lots of screeching music plus some bad rap songs. Only occasionally did it fit with the action. As for the action scenes, well there were quite a few made up mostly of CGI, fiery explosions and special forces guys running around in cool suits. Unfortunately there was no single scene that really stood out and what was left was destroyed by the annoying close ups. It was almost like they were trying to hide the fact that they weren't very good at creating action scenes. Ice Cube, despite his somewhat chubby looks did look quite convincing doing his stuff. The action scenes in this movie had so much potential but most of them were ruined. What could have been a great car chase was simply shown as some CGI vehicles being flashed before your eyes at a pace faster than Michael Bay and Simon West put together couldn't top. Another great car chase was ruined by trying to show you some cars doing some stuff crashing through stuff but never to give you a full overview of what is going on. And for the icing on the cake, a full CGI train/helicopter chase climax. And last and probably least, the plot. Now something about overthrowing the US government sounds as cool as hell on paper but what Simon Kinberg cooked up is something hovering over the surface. Conspiracies are supposed to have lots of interesting details and be deeper than what is represented by this film. Anyhow, it just barely barely, manages to pull things together and just to make sure you don't start thinking too much, everything is rushed. A 94 or 100 minute (not sure which) simply isn't enough for a plot like this to get developed. The film never manages to create some proper atmosphere because despite all the potential for showing nice sets and cool scenery, all of that is simply ignored. But despite all that, the plot was still enjoyable, Ice Cube managed to keep his act together and the action was still cool to some extent. I would rather recommend than not recommend.",

No, instead we recast the protagonist with a different director and lose the entire essence of what made the first film fun.

Wow, when the narrative and plot were so meanderingly confused, it's no wonder the film was instantly forgettable. The pacing was all over the place, with the final twenty minutes only just grabbing my attention. The extreme sports that had Diesel drive off a bridge and parachute to safety have been substituted for Xzibit pimping out cars. The only pimping he did was popping the pimple on my forehead as I sat bored out of my mind. That right there, is pimple popping. Pimping. Rammstein have been swapped out for Ice Cube and other generically dull hip-hop artists. \"Get XXX'd\" being the ultimate low point. Some of the action was coherent, basking in ridiculous explosions and gunfire, but not enough for me to say \"d'you know what? Go and watch this!\". The visual effects were \"off da chain\" as we witness a luxurious car rampantly drive on the rails of a train track in gloriously outdated polygons. It was as if I was playing 'Grand Theft Auto Vice City'. Cube apparently acted in this but I saw no such thing, he does not have the personality to pull off the secret agent persona he attempted to portray. Jackson was functional and Dafoe was the token antagonist. No character development, no entertainment and certainly no fun. This action sequel removed the \"act\" in \"action\", leaving just \"ion\". As in \"I'm out, now\". Urgh, I can't believe I miss Rammstein and Diesel...what's happening to me?",

            "content": "Oh my Gosh, where to begin. This film starts off full throttle with lots of hardcore action, and then just goes to hell-in-a-hand basket. With a film of this intent you are definitely not expecting Academy award nominations or even realism for that matter; but I draw the line at video game graphics\u0085.. and that exactly what the film turns into, xXx: State of the Union, the video game now available on PS 2 coming this Fall. The movie is just a 101 minute ad for the video game coming to a store near you this Christmas.In this go around, Ice Cube (Darius Stone) is tabbed as special agent XXX. When the agency's HQ in Virginia is infiltrated and sixteen agents are killed during the opening sequence of this film, Agent Augustus Gibbons (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to find another agent outside the company lines to track down the assailants. Former Agent Darius Stone, currently residing in a Federal prison, is the man for the job. In possibly the best action sequence of the film, Stone is freed from prison and is forced into deep uncover OPS. However from this seen on, the film nosedives into a flaming, fiery tailspin of hogwash misconceptions and horrendous inconceivable CGI special effects.**Spoiler** In a nutshell, General George Octavius Deckert (played by Willem Dafoe) plans to annihilate the President of the United States, and all the members of the cabinet ahead of him in line for the presidency during the President's State of the Union address speech. General Deckert has amassed his own private army to include an aircraft carrier full of equipment to assist in his mission. He plans to divert the blame onto Agent Augustus Gibbons and his group of Navy Seals, who once disobeyed a direct order of General Gibbons.I love movies. I can accept spiders swinging from buildings, unknown universes with light sabers, or even cyborgs from the future sent back to change history; but the rubbish being spewed in this film as well as its lame special effects is totally unacceptable. I highly suggest avoiding this film like the plague.",

Ice Cube plays a kind of for-hire protector of the good-old United States of America as XXX in this second in the series which started with Vin Diesel in the starring role. Cube is expressionless, for the most part, and the action becomes pretty ridiculous and Bond-like even though we're dealing with too close to home locations like the Capitol building and people being involved like the President of our good-old United States of America. I realize that this isn't the first movie to include these icons of our society in danger, but we never really believe any of this is real and that's the problem here. The acting doesn't capture us and the character's don't either. So the promised action-fest is pretty boring overall. The supporting players just seem to be along for the ride and don't add much even though they include a few talented people like Samuel L. Jackson, Willem Dafoe, and Scott Speedman(who was great in the Underworld movies but is horrible here). I'm sure a lot of money was spent on this one, but overall it really wasn't money worth spent in my opinion.",

            "content": "First off I am a big fan of XXX. I loved the feel of the first one and I thought it was a great concept. It is one of my favorite films. I am also a big fan of Vin Diesel's. I have enjoyed his work since I saw Boiler Room. Having been a huge fan of the first film and Diesel, I was quite disappointed to hear that he passed on future XXX projects for the Riddick Franchise. When I heard that the new concept for the XXX sequels was to introduce a new XXX with each installment I was intrigued. It was a different step for a new franchise to take. Then I heard that Ice Cube was going to be following in Vin's footsteps for the sequel. It was a very interesting cast choice. I have been a fan of Cube's since the NWA / Boyz in The Hood Days. I was curious to see what he would bring to the franchise. I saw the film last night and I absolutely loved it. It was the most fun I have had at the movies all year. It was loud, over the top, funny and exciting. Everything that made me love the first one so much. It has tied with the first XXX as one of my favorite action movies of all time. I thought Ice Cube was great in the role of Darius Stone/XXX. He was great in the actions scenes and he provided a lot of humor. Sam Jackson was also in top form reprising his role as Agustus Gibbons. I thought the actions pieces in the film were top notch. The Bullet Train Scene, the scene on the ship where Darius is toying with the soldiers in the tank and especially where Darius jumps the boat onto the bridge smashing the cop cars. I loved it.I am surprised by some of the negative comments towards this film. I don't know what film people thought they were walking into. The film is very similar to the original XXX in regards to it's tone. People on that post on this page need to lighten up. Not every film that comes out has to be the based in reality. I like films that push the limits of reality. I like to have fun at the movies. XXX State of the Union was so much fun that I would pay to see it again. Bring on XXX 3",

            "content": "When Vin Diesel starred in xXx (2002), the concept behind it was similar to that of The Fast and the Furious (2001). The Fast and the Furious (2001) was to try and popularize the craze of underground street racing. The early 2000s was also the time where things were trying to be emphasized as the next generation of \"whatever\". xXx (2002) was about trying to popularize stunts and extreme sports, which was what the character Vin Diesel played was all about. And while the film itself was loud and stupid at times earning middling reviews, it was granted a sequel. However, Vin Diesel did not return. Thus a last minute recasting was done and a short was produced titled The Final Chapter: The Death of Xander Cage (2005) showing exactly that. Was it the best call? Ehh,..no but the following execution probably was more the issue.After being ambushed at their headquarters, Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Shavers (Michael Roof Jr.) recruit Darius Stone (Ice Cube) as the new \"xXx\". Being that Stone had a history in the military, Gibbons felt like he'd be a good fit to take over. The problem is, there is a concern that a mole within the president's cabinet is secretly plotting a coup. The person in question is George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) who serves as secretary of defense to the president (Peter Strauss). Writing wise, the script is very basic and not that interesting for a couple of reasons. One being that having Willem Dafoe as the antagonist is not even surprising. He has played so many other villains in the past, his performance doesn't stand out.The script for this sequel was the debut for writer Simon Kinberg, the same person who would go on to write for X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Sadly, as a first for Kinberg, it shows. For one, the motivation for Willem Dafoe's role feels very unclear. General Deckert shares a past with Gibbons and Stone, however what specifically Deckert wants to accomplish as an end goal is muddled. That and the other being that the dialog relies too heavily on referencing the first movie when this story acts as a completely different animal. The style and themes presented in the picture don't involve anything related to sports and acrobatic stunts. Because Stone is from a military background, there's more military type action sequences involved. Yet it still tries to be like it's the same xXx.Directing this feature was Lee Tamahori, best known for Die Another Day (2002), another spy film and Once Were Warriors (1994). Sadly, with this experience, he doesn't seem to know how to transform it into a spy film. If anything it just boils down to a standard action romp and nothing more. The action is entertaining though. Anything using a tank to punch holes through thick walls is always fun and while some other scenes are entirely unrealistic, it is entertaining. Even Ice Cube, Michael Roof Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson do their best to keep scenes interesting. It's just the rest of the cast like Scott Speedman, Xzibit, Sunny Mabrey, Nona Gaye and John Gleeson Connolly who don't add much to it. All play characters that are just there for convenience of plot.Visuals are also a mixed bag. The special effects are a hit and miss at times. Being that it's from 2005, depending on the scene it can look out of place. Though the cinematography by David Tattersall was decent. Capturing as much as possible, Tattersall made sure to include as much action as possible, whether it be on a train, aircraft carrier or in the white house. Tattersall was also credited to The Green Mile (1999), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). As for music, Marco Beltrami replaced Randy Edelman as composer. And while there is a main theme, it's not as memorable as Edelman's. However, seeing that the lead has changed and is more rough, Beltrami's sound fits more with this version.While there are still some strong components to the feature, the sequel is regrettably not as good as the original. Ice Cube and the returning cast try, but the dialog relies too much on reminding viewers of the first film. The villain's motivations also are a bit hazy as well as some of the special effects.",

Most people have lost or forgotten any skills they hadn't used in that long, but he still seems to be able to fight like a special forces operative whose been in constant readiness. Right, we addressed that. The film has a brilliant start. The guy who walked out after 40 Min's who \"reviewed\" this film? You wasted your money mate! The film had one of the best opening sequences I've seen in a long time. High tech assassins storming a secret NSA base? He didn't like that? And the prison break-out which wasn't as good but still pretty cool. Xzibit was pointless in this film, anyone could have played his role. And he can't act, he was just being his normal self that he is in episodes of \"pimp my ride\". The girl playing ice cube's girlfriend? I get the feeling there was supposed to be either nudity or a sex scene with her and they cut it to get a lower rating? The outfit she wore, they may as well have left it in, she practically showed all of her breasts anyway.The car on the rail track (someone should check their physics, I don't think it would have landed on the track at all) was pretty unrealistic. And Ice Cube cant read a speedometer. He was doing somewhere between 140 and 160 miles per hour. Not the bullshit 220 like he claimed, idiot. There aren't many cars on the planet that are road legal that will do that speed. I don't understand why they didn't expose Willem Dafoe's character as a traitor, it would have made for a much better ending.

The sequel xXx 2: The Next Level is no better, in fact it is worse than the first movie. xXx 2 takes the series to a new level, that ends any chance of any further sequels. Despite the fact Vin Diesel (wisely) does not return, instead Ice Cube is the replacement lead. Though Vin Diesel has some charisma about him, Ice Cube is very unconvincing in the lead action role. He is better in supporting roles, and his character is repulsive and with an attitude problem. He spends the entire movie looking angry. Perhaps he was thinking what was he doing in this rubbish.Samuel L. Jackson and Willem Dafoe can't redeem this movie at all. Samuel L. Jackson seemed wasted in the first movie and although he gets more screen time in the sequel, he still appears to be useless. Willem Dafoe came across as an evil tyrant who is missing his trademark villainous laugh. It also looks as if they did this movie purely for the money.Although the first movie was meant to be nonsensical eye candy the doesn't bother with the story, the sequel was purely aimed for teenagers who get a thrill out of seeing stunts and explosions galore and to hell with the story and all logic.I was very glad when the movie ended, unfortunately that was a waste of 101 minutes. Looks like all hopes for a further franchise ended with this dud of a sequel. 1/10.",

Enter Darius Stone (Ice Cube), a former Special Forces badass on duty for attacking his commanding officer George Deckert (an annoyed-eyed Willem Dafoe). It would be easy and accurate to dismiss XXX2: The Next Level as exploitative shooter nonsense, but seen in its trashy terms, it succeeds brilliantly.A laser-guided missile aimed directly at the hearts of children young and old, XXX2 delivers a payload of explosions, speeding cars, swaying boobs, and military hardware with breathtaking determination. The original concept of James Bond XXX with extreme sports has been abandoned, along with the star of the first film (gargling Vin Diesel) in favor of an urban and hip tone.So the new XXX is hired based on his \"attitude\" rather than his paragliding skills. Ice Cube plays this little character note like a huge movie pout. He springs into action with breathtaking spunk, a huge smile pinned to his chubby cheeks as he rallies a private army of underworld car thieves to take on Deckert's fragmented military forces.Confusingly, XXX2 presents us with a heroically liberal president as the camera drools over the shiny hardware needed to protect him. The women also have fun, portrayed as cold-hearted sexual predators. However, the film moves at a good pace, and director Lee Tamahori captures the action with unusual clarity and panache.",

I don't know anything about this guy who actually changed his name to Ice Cube, but he sure looks and sounds just like the kind of moron who would do something like that in the movie.His acting is so mediocre, you feel sorry for him. His wimpy voice, total lack of face expressions and idiotic one-liners makes this character totally misplaced in a role as the meanest agent ever.He goes from being a pathetic moron to doing some amazing stunts that no man can survive, except with a huge dose of luck. Which is what saves him, time after time after time. In the end you want him to die, as he is simply too annoying.Not to mention his comic relief partner. A Q like figure who is just totally overdoing being stupid and \"funny\". Not since JarJar have I hated a comic relief character more than in this movie.Oh, and about the story. Well, I guess there is one in there but it is so full of clich\u00e9's and is merely there as a foundation for lots of action scenes. Not that anything is wrong with mindless action full of special effects, but it is just really poorly done. The clipping, flow of the movie, everything just crashes.It is a shame, as the original XXX had its charm, and was a great modern tribute to the James Bond type of movies. But this one just reeks of some investors who put some money on the table to buy some brands, like Ice Cube (man, what kind of moron calls himself Ice Cube??) and the XXX brand.Phew, I feel better now, after wasting 90 minutes watching this load of crap I needed to let out some steam. Oh, I left before the ending by the way, it was just too unbearable to sit through. And I normally LIKE this kind of movies!",

            "content": "XXX is back, only this time, he's not a bald white extreme sports star turned secret agent. He's now a black ex-convict with only slightly more hair in the form of Ice Cube. But that doesn't stop NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) from recruiting him to stop the country's Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe) from plotting a coup against the United States government.The premise is a non issue here and there's actually very little resembling a plot. Sure, there some whispers about protecting the president but there's nothing too complex here. The script was written by Simon Kinberg and he usually focuses on the action sequences and not the story. For example, he also wrote the screenplay for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and that film was heavy on action, low on story. The action sequences are pretty nice and entertaining to watch. The action is the real reason to watch the movie since everything else is handled poorly. Judging from the user comments, a lot of people took the film too seriously when really this sequel is a harmless movie. Obviously the story and action scenes are highly unrealistic but so what? This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining.The acting is alright, at least the important characters can act. Ice Cube actually gives a pretty good performance as XXX. He does a better job than Vin Diesel and he shows a lot of charisma in the role as well. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Gibbons and he also gives a good performance. Willem Dafoe gives a decent performance though he isn't given very much screen time. The rest of the supporting actors aren't as good. Xzibit, Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey all give awful performances which isn't too surprising but they don't hurt the film.I actually like Lee Tamahori as a director. He makes his films simple yet still entertaining. Lee did a good job with this film and the action scenes look terrific. However, this is probably his weakest film yet. Despite the action scenes, the film does get a little dull. I wasn't surprised by this and there was really nothing they could have done since the film was 95 minutes long. Before I saw this sequel, I was expecting the worst. To my surprise, the movie turned out to be okay. Sure the dialog is pretty lame and character development is non existent but the movie proved to be harmless and enjoyable. In the end, this sequel is worth a rental as long as your brain is turned off. Rating 5/10",

Jackson, Willem Dafoe, Xzibit, Scott Speedman, Sunny Mabrey, Nona Gaye, Michael Roof and Peter StraussRated PG-13Genre: Action/Adventure/ThrillerxXx: State of the Union is sort of a sequel to \"xXx\", what I mean by sort of is the fact that the director changed the main character instead of having Vin Diesel back from the first movie. Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen were signed to do the \"xXx\" sequel but then Rob Cohen dropped out to do \"Stealth\" (2005) and then the director who took Rob Cohen's place decided to cut Vin Diesel out and change the whole story and having something that didn't continue from the first movie! In this movie, Ice Cube plays Darius Stone who is a tough guy who has been charged with a few crimes and plays by his own rules kind of guy and is in jail. But when Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) has vast majority of his agents killed from a sneak attack including Xander Cage, Augustus Gibbons hires Darius Stone to be the new XXX agent to stop General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) and his dangerous military group from overthrowing the U.S. Government in the nation's capital! Originally before they cut Vin Diesel out, Ice Cube was going to be a sidekick character to Vin Diesel's character which I thought was a good idea but no!! The director wanted a new main character so they decided to cut Vin Diesel out and have Ice Cube as the main character! Why couldn't they stick with the original idea with returning Vin Diesel as the main character and Ice Cube as the sidekick? That would have been better. But at least Samuel L. Jackson was the only one who returned from the first \"xXx\" movie. Don't get me wrong I liked Ice Cube but I blame the director for ruining the \"XXX\" franchise.

So, do you guys think it is possible for a movie to completely suck, as a movie, but it still be \"enjoyable to watch\"? Some examples of these are Van Damme's old school movies, where the storyline and acting are not so good, but his fighting sequences are enjoyable. That is why I rated xxx2 a 5. As a movie, I think it is maybe a 2 or 3, but I enjoyed a lot of it, despite its terribleness.When Ice was driving in the car near the end, following the train, and then jumped on the train tracks, and the rubber from the tires came off etc etc, I hate that kinda stuff.. sure, movies can be unrealistic and still awesome, but... that's just too unbelievable.Good points I liked about it : * Ice breaking out of prison was pretty cool actually, * Some of the tension between Samuel and Ice is interesting * ( Samuel L Jackson saying to Ice *See? I told you u should have killed that bitch* was very funny. All humor of course, not to be taken seriously. After all, it IS only a movie. * The plot to set Samuel's team up, and kill the president was pretty cool, maybe a bit unrealistic but that particular unrealism is fine with me in movies.OVERALL SUMMARY = Yes it was a bad moviehowever Yes, I did enjoy it",

And anyone who's seen the first one should pretty much have expected the level of realism in the second one.On the other hand the producers of this move did a pretty good job of keeping most things within the realm of distantly possible. Yes, you had the technical geek who cracked the NSA security in no time. But the way it was done was more like: No one can do it. But I'm not just anyone. And he went off to have his fun and pit his skill against the NSA's let's not forget that this guy does work for a covert military operation, so he's a little more skilled at breaking into and out of government DBs than the average street hacker.And now that I'm done with that rant I'll just state that there was a definite plot. And it was actually a pretty good one. Ice Cube is former military, so his ability to do certain things isn't that far-fetched,with the admitted exception of the tank scene, which I loved but is pure impossibility.I'd definitely recommend this movie. It's total fun. How many action films do you know of which are truly probable? This one will keep you completely entertained from beginning to end.Now for the exceptions. First, it seriously aggravated me that they killed Xander Cage off. Not on screen of course but in a very brief moment in which it was announced that Xander Cage was dead. Like he wasn't that great of an agent anyway and no big loss. How crappy is that? And the other exception was the woman they chose as Cube's love interest. Come on. Not that she wasn't a relatively attractive woman, or that she wasn't excellent in the role, but the very first scene she's in she's wearing so much makeup you could see how caked on it was, which pretty much ruined her as someone Cube would be interested in and although she looked better in subsequent scenes, her character was really nothing special.",

Furthermore the action choreography made character's seem like they had superhero reflexes to help survive because of plot convenience.The genre was all over the place. One minute it tried to be comedic, then in the next shot it tried to be serious. This is called 'Bathos'. Speaking of comedic moments half of them looked like a cheap laugh to show that Ice Cube's character was still the Alpha.As for the other cast, Samual L Jackson basically played himself as typecast (seems like he read the script and just.....gave enough enthusiasm to earn his paycheck.)

I can understand for Samuel L.Jackson (even this is far bellow his professional level too) because he played the same role in previous XXX movie, so it was expected that he will continue (and he will probably play in next XXX movie scheduled for 2010 or 2011). It is quite possible that both Jackson and Defoe hate this one,but who cares-money is money, and fun is fun. If you want to enjoy in this i strongly recommend you to remove more than half of your brain first. And then you can somehow digest this Nintendo and Playstation hybrid made to destroy your thinking ability. Nothing more, and nothing less than that.",

Well, however Lee Tamahori (you know, the guy who introduced Madonna-techno to the Bond franchise) does it, he does it good: \"xXx - squared, muthafucka!\" is mindless, meaningless and utterly unenjoyable junk from start to finish.Ice Cube as an action hero? Hmm, yeah, why not. Maybe for the next sequel, we could get M'onique or Anthony Anderson to star? Cube is one dull guy to root for and the fact that the script is void of anything remotely funny or witty doesn't help.Samuel L. Jackson and Willem Dafoe? What the hell are they even doing in here? Were they doped up, or did they simply not read the script before signing on? One thought Jackson would have learned something from the first three-letter movie, but no: He's back, and more pointless than ever. Dafoe is a talented actor but this movie gives him absolutely nothing to work with as the \"bad guy\". A pointless Xzibit thrown in is just icing on the cake (if by \"icing\" you mean \"strong Indian spices\" and by \"cake\" you mean \"open wound\").There's no plot worth mentioning and the action blows. Despite a high pace, endless attempts at humour and lots of stereotypes (for instance, all black people are badass rapper-type characters while all the whiteys are stiff senators or gay computer hackers - however did they come up with this stuff? Genius I tell you!), xXx2 manages to, somehow, be less entertaining and even a tad bit worse than its predecessor. How anything could top that Vin Diesel-ridden garbage heap is beyond me. Congratulations Lee Tamahori - you blow chunks!",

Was annoying at times. I would have liked to have seen Will Smith in the Cube role, but no one consulted me. Cube is okay, but too much of a bull in a China Shop at times. Will Mr. T be resurrected for the next Triple X movie? The acting was good, and the stunts and special effects were outstanding and the cinematography was exceptional. Jackson, Strauss and Defoe gave this credibility and made it more enjoyable. Strauss, in the role of the US president, utters the only \"f\" word in the movie. Is this really necessary? Some think so. I don't. It's only done to get the PG Rating.But what made this more enjoyable was that most of the scenes were well lighted even the night shots. Yes, computer graphics are here to stay and I think they help things along, but that's just me.What didn't work: the love interest between Stone and one-time girlfriend Lola (Nona Gaye). But unlike a Bond movie, there was no chemistry here. And, her pumped-up headlights got in the way of any acting ability. As already mentioned, too much attitude by Stone and I kept seeing Mr. T instead of Cube. The music was mostly all Rap (yes, it's still around) and was annoying as well. But even with the things that didn't work, this was entertaining and did remind me of a Bond film. Again, it was the cinematography that really helped a lot.I believe the name of that girl group that played violins when Stone was at that party is BOND.",

I tried not to get my hopes too high, but I felt as long as the sequel delivered the action packed goods, I'd be satisfied.Well, it certainly does do that. It opens with a scene that is intense and a little more comic bookish than anything we saw in the first xXx. Admittedly, in the middle things don't get quite as wild as they were for the first 40 minutes of the film, but towards the climax things really do pick up. I did have some quibbles with the film... Ice Cube was good for the lead, but I never once thought he was as 'cool' as Vin Diesel. Vin Diesel was tough and had attitude. To me, Ice Cube just seemed to have attitude. Diesel was more fun (and more believable) to watch on the screen than Cube was. Also, the chemistry between Cube and Gaye didn't work like it did with Diesel and Argento in the original. It almost seemed forced.And I'm just not too fond of the whole ghetto aspect of the film. I like rough and tough, but there was too much ghetto gibberish between some of the characters that just made me roll my eyes. I realize that's a part of today's generation, and I grew up in the 80's and 90's, so I suppose it's natural I won't be into that. I liked the more industrial feel of the first film a lot more. I mean, Rammstein appeared in the first one for crying out loud! In this one, I almost expected a cameo by eminem.And lastly, the seemingly non-chalant explanation for Vin Diesel's absence is somewhat unsatisfying. It's just hard for me to believe a tough guy like that is dead. Hopefully he'll somehow manage to return for the third.Aside from the quibbles, I think it's a decent action flick. It's a lot of fun and I would recommend this to anyone who likes explosions and lots of special effects.Just don't expect anything to out do the avalanche scene in that first film.",

            "content": "This movie is the epitome of absurd plots. I'm not even too sure I could make a decent essay out of this thing. xxx-2: State of the Union is about the black man sticking it to the white man, seriously. xxx 2 revolves around ex-Navy Seal and now convict Darius Stone, aptly played by the man in black himself Ice Cube. Stone is spirited out of prison by Agent Augustus Gibbons, played by Hollywood's top angry man Samuel L. Jackson. Stone is recruited to discover the mastermind behind a attack on a intelligence base. field office built beneath a horse farm. I love the critic lines such as \"fires on all cylinders\", \"Tour DE force\", and \"Prepare for...\". Actually that last one is perfect for this film. I honestly believe people must prepare themselves for this creation.Race is huge in this movie. Its basically a cinematic hand job for the black population. If you are black, this movie will empower you. The most offending thing in this movie is how white people are just put down at every turn. For instance. When Stone is escaping from prison. If you happen to notice that all the guards are white, and nearly all the inmates are minorities. My favorite inmate is in the prison courtyard, he resembles a elderly Baptist minister. Anyway, he cheers Stone's escape from the white guards, he cheers because Stone is black and therefore innocent of whatever got him put in prison. Stone just kicks the ever loving crap out of all the guards then when running on the roof(7 stories up) and nears the end of the roof. Natuarally because he is black and has amazing and natural athletic prowess, he keeps running and jumps off the roof and grabs hold of a magically appearing helicopter's landing bar. He then fly to safety. There is also this hot blonde woman named Charlie who winds up being a double agent. She originally seemed like a trustworthy piece of eye candy. She invites Stone back to her father's house, but daddy is not home. She starts talking to stone like she wants to play a game of Big Buck Loose in the Plantation House. She frames Stone for murdering a general, who is white. When Stone finds the kidnapped Agent Gibbons being held under Charlie's control, Gibbons tells Stone to \"kill that b****\". Stone does not kill her. In the end of the movie Charlie is cornered by Gibbons who then kills her, Gibbons eyes dart toward Stone and calmly says \"I told you, you should have killed that bitch\".The amount of white people who die or are beaten in this movie compared to the amount of blacks that suffer the same fate are drastically lopsided. Honestly, a black person does not get hurt in this film other than Gibbons who gets thrown around in one scene. All the white people in this movie are totally disposable. There is this one character with the suburban name of Toby Lee Shavers. He is the \"Q\" of the XXX division. He has blonde parted hair and wears a sweater and a tie. He uses words like \"crunk\" when Stone is driving thru the hood. Xihibit also stars as one of Stone's old friends. They team up to save the president from assassination by storming the Capitol Building with souped-up, armored, and weapon laden Land Rovers which they build in an enormous and well equipped and yet illegal chop shop in the ghetto of D.C.. When a federal agent warns Xhibit that the enemy will have tanks, Xhibit puts his hands on his shoulder and says \"Leave the tanks to me, if it got wheels, we can jack it. Trust me daddy-o\". Although, not all black characters are strong steely types. Gibbons' reflects the Colin Powell type. He may be black but he gets educated by Stone on a quote \"Wars come and go, but my soldiers stay eternal\". Gibbons asks if that was Jefferson or Patton who said the quote. Stone replies, \"Tupac\".The whole movie revolves around the awkward white people getting re-assured by the black man. This movie is the wet dream of the African-American community. The whites have done got themselves into a fix, and its up to us black folk to get them out, and also save the President of the United States in the process. Honestly, this movie offends me greatly. The only main white character is Willem Dafoe's character of a deranged Secretary of Defense.Who in the final bullet-train sequence, kills everyone that looks at him cross ways or serves no purpose. So the only character the white audience sees is a murderous nut job. I love this movie and yet I cannot stand it. xxx-3 is apparently going to be set in South East Asia. Why do I get the sinking feeling that Jet Li will be fighting against an American Opium Lord as played by Jeff Goldblum.I give this movie a 4 out of 10 just for the sheer eye candy of it all.",

It was good for Vin Diesel because it elevated his status for rising action star, however this movie will do nothing for Ice Cube's acting Carrier. The story is quite simple, after Xander Cage, the original Triple X was killed and the NSA has been targeted by an unknown militia with connection sto a higher-upper inside the government, Agent Gibson(Samuel L. Jackson) recruits an old member from his unit(Ice Cube) to become the new Triple X and stop that militia and it's leader carry out their evil plan. The premise sounds good enough, but only then will you realize it's quite generic and clich\u00e9d. While some of the humor is gold(Cheese trucks carrying weapons? Priceless. And after a few years in the slammer, all Stone wanted was a hamburger and fries. Another funny. ), everything else is pretty much a wasted effort. Plot twists can be seen coming a mile away, the action scenes are even more ridiculous if you can believe that especially when you can tell Ice Cube doesn't seem fit at all to do those stunts. I don't understand why Willem Defoe is in this movie, his dialog seems to be coming out of a catalog for all I know. Other cringe-worthy mentions such as firing a missile inside a aircraft carrier, a hacker manages to break into the Defense Department in a couple of seconds, a tank-jack,seriously. Still it's slightly better then Alone in the Dark. I doubt there will be a sequel since this movie bombed at the box office, still the best way to enjoy it is to rent it with a couple of friends and point out the unintentionally funny bits all over the movie.",

Where it used to be snipers had red laser sights, these guys have red dots for eyes for which I'm just not sure how that helps them. Also in the initial scene is a UFO like camera flying around that is clearly added by the FX department; when the camera is later taken apart, it looks like a piece of Chinese plastic with a microphone and simple circuitry.The rest is more of the same: cars / trucks / tanks, more shooting (with really big weapons), the good guys come from chop shops (which makes them cool), piles of special effects and more women (with push-up bras).This very expensive film is the kind where your mind goes into a state of fuzziness, the ending doesn't matter and don't expect any of it to be plausible.

In this, everything seemed to be shot against a greenscreen. And if a 1996 movie (Mission: Impossible) could put a near-perfect CGI bullet train and helicopter chase - in broad daylight - on screen, why couldn't a similarly big-budget movie made almost a decade later do even a tenth as good a job with a similar scene at night? It honestly looked like something from a video game, nearly as bad as the climax of Torque.Thirdly: the story. It was so ridiculously implausible that it felt completely detached from anything resembling the real world, to the point where if dragons and zombies had appeared I wouldn't have been all that surprised.Director Lee Tamahori proved with Die Another Day that he's mediocre at best when it comes to directing action, and XXX 2 somehow manages to be even duller. All the big scenes provoked nothing more than a 'meh' from me; there was less excitement in the entire film than in a single minute of any action sequence by Spielberg or Cameron.The only reason I rated this movie higher than a 1 was for its sheer unintentional hilarity as I wondered if things could possibly get any more inane or fake-looking... and they always could.",

I wasn't a huge fan of the original Triple X and with a change in the main character i was intrigued to see how they fit everything into the theme of the movie. I however was pleasantly surprised. Now this was no \"great\" movie by any means, the plot was thin, the characters had little depth, and the acting was only adequate. But the action sequences are another story. they were great, they were very well done and definitely unique. The action was really the only portion of this movie that really worked. Unfortunentaly the ending of th is film fell into the usual trap of setting everything up for another sequel. How sad that Hollywood can only see dollar signs and not make good movies.",

Well, that and the fact that the first one was more filler and less substance plot-wise.However, I was happy to see there was a decent story-line and Ice-Cube wasn't taking on 50 villains at once like Uma does in the Kill Bill series.I could go on but I should get to worked up about it as most people who take the time to rate something online aren't doing so in an unbiased manner... most notably the director, leading male/female, etc.rtb",

This movie is directed by Lee Tamahori who is also known for the director of Die Another Day. You can notice his style and screen-shot when you watch this movie. xXx: State of Union can be categorized as an okay movie especially when you like something loud with big explosions everywhere and less care to the content. However, if you are a person who sees the content of a movie as the most important issue, then I do not think xXx will be a right movie for your evening.When I watched this movie, I have found many unrealistic scenes. Some of them are stupid I admit, but some of them can be entertaining although it might give you thoughts such as \"hey, what the hell is that?\". For the actresses and actors, in general they are okay. Some of them seem exaggerating their characters. In the case of Ice Cube, he seems forcing his bad attitude to the surface which is unfortunately looked stupid.Darius Stone, (Ice Cube) an ex-marine seal sentenced to the maximum security prison because several issues with his past, is chosen to be the new xXx by NSA agent Augustus Gibbons (samuel L. Jackson) after the NSA base in Virginia had been attacked. There is no surprise or secret that George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) is the bad guy. Both Stone and Gibbons have an unfinished issue from the past with Deckert, who wants to wreck the presidents and nominate himself as the new hero and president. Obviously the story ended happily after a long \"boom-boom\" scene.",

He constantly cowered before the bad guys and seemed to be in utter fear throughout the whole film. It would have been nice if he just fought back instead. Also, the Neil Diamond inspired soundtrack put me to sleep. Cube is scrawny, he obviously needs to spend more time in the gym - I don't think he was in very good shape before starting this film. Also, the moves he did (during what little action there was) seemed clumsy and things that my 85-year old grandma could do.The overly-intellectual dialog was over the top. C'mon, this is an action film, not \"my dinner with Andre\". There was too much exploration of the pathos of eastern Europe, long-winded speeches about world peace and epicurean phenomonalism - I mean, who cares? I may as well just go watch Mulholland Drive with a bag over my head so that I won't be able to figure out what's going on.Also, I think they over-did the homoerotic subtext - especially with Ice Cube and Williem Dafoe - I don't have anything against that - but I wonder if mainstream audiences are ready for it.The film could have used a greater variety of gear - instead of just the usual car chases. For instance, there was not ONE SCENE that used a jet ski, when one could have been obviously used during a certain part of the movie that I will not reveal here because then that would give away the ending to the movie and I don't want to do that because although it didn't have enough action I don't want to ruin it for anyone else that wants to see it.",

I pray they don't make a third installment on this series. I liked the first movie with Vin Diesel, but this one made me suffer through it. Very noisy, boring and exaggerated are some of the words I can find to describe it now. The boat race is well done but very unlikely to happen, just like the jump on the bridge in the first film. The difference is that with Vin Diesel is easy to believe. Ice Cube is big and fat, what happened to you, Cube ? Give your stomach a time and take some time to pumping iron. And Samuel, please, I respect you even when you do some crap like \"the deep sea\", but don't play me around or I will have to stop seeing your movies.

Lots of big explosions, cool high tech gadgets, great big handguns with laser sights, pretty girls, a REAL evil bad guy terrorist who wants to kill a bunch of innocents with a biological agent. Big bad guy plot by Vodka swilling Slavic types that are real easy to hate. OUTSTANDING relatively original '67 Goat with missiles in the grill no less! You pay to see a good guy flick, XXX One is worth the money and you don't have to think a lot about it, it's just fun.XXX State of the Union, is much, MUCH bigger. Bigger guns, bigger explosions, bigger egos, bigger belly on the lead actor, bigger peripheral vehicles most of which are HIGHLY modified SUVs and, sadly, big old ugly dubs on what is otherwise a tight redux of the '67 Goat, and this one has a wild ass $10,000 flip-flop paint job. If you watched the trailer and thought this would be just like the first one, though, you must have been quite disgusted to find out it was merely a very glossy piece of LEFT WING PROPAGANDA, which clearly is NOT what I paid for.ALL the bad guys are former military special ops guys and Decker, the Secretary of Defense (read Don Rumsfeld), is portrayed as a power mad psychopath hell bent on wresting control of the White House from the wimpy ass liberal lunatic President. A perfectly coiffed talking head, he informs us in the first scene that the US would be adopting a new policy when dealing with terrorists, like the ones who just killed 16 NSA agents in a bomb attack. His strategy is to invite them all to meet us at Starbucks for a nice latte and some pleasant conversation designed to \"turn some of these enemies of ours into allies\" through intense diplomacy and holding hands while singing Kum Ba Yah.ALL the GOOD guys are street thugs who steal cars for a living and, in fact, this criminal activity is GLORIFIED as \"the American way\" in several scenes. Also on the crap list are police, which are \"not to be trusted\", anyone who has a conservative viewpoint about the military and the war on terror, and anyone, except the limp wristed liberal idiot who is supposed to be the President, who works for the government. In addition, while Sam Jackson maintained extremely tight control over Vin Diesel (at least he wants Zander to THINK he does), Ice Cube is allowed to simply walk in and take complete control of the whole operation. In fact, Cube asks for everything INCLUDING the keys to the castle in the first few scenes and Sam Jackson caves without the slightest of objections. Wonder why that is? Now, to be sure, Decker, the antagonist, IS A DERANGED PSYCHOPATH and a very bad man who must be stopped because the coup he has planned could easily throw the country into total chaos. That said, the entire movie is little more than a thinly veiled attempt to vilify the current President's conservative agenda, our military and the President's foreign policy.I really HATE paying for a good guy flick and then being presented with a slick piece of left wing propaganda. How incredibly desperate to regain power the liberals must be to constantly enlist the help of Hollywood and its insane crop of left wing malcontents who, without the benefit of sound reasoning and core logic continue to fragment and decompose right before our very eyes. They should all be ashamed at passing this politically tainted drivel off as entertainment.",

            "content": "As you've probably found out by now this film isn't one to choose for action or for scripting but I will be more or less specific about what XXX2 tries to be.From the very start of the movie you can tell that the director had the creativity and the imagination of a 7 year old. The movie has abysmal action scenes such as pathetic flying motorcycles with hundreds of enemies trying as hard as they can to miss Ice Cube while showering the floor with bulletcases. Not even a hint of realism. Surely, the film's still gotta entertain, right? Wrong. What this film tries to be is another 'Undercover Brother' without any humour whatsoever and tries to show its \"seriousness\" by showing Ice Cube's useless posing face during various action scenes. The film also has a black and a white girl (whatta' ya know, the black one is the all-out bad-ass who stands by her ex forever while the white one is a back-stabbing sell-out). The story is flat-out bad. Your everyday villain tries to kidnap the president and fails miserably when the Cube and his homies come flying to the rescue.So what lesson does the ending tries show you? That white people are merely wannabes of the black James Bond wannabe that is Ice Cube and black entertainers such as Tupac are an inspiration to the white presidents of the USA. Usually, I don't object to the fact that this movie tried to manure on white people by showing how amateur white people are at secret services and other fictional all-black crime organisations (since I'm neither black or white) but it does this in such a way that makes me want to stab both Ice Cube and the director who made me waste my own cash on watching the poitnlessly bad film that is XXX The Next Level. Also it was obvious I wasn't the only one: half of the cinema's audience got up and left (surprise, surprise) and the only people who were left were people like myself who demand to see the good in the money they've spent something on. Also don't think that the people that gave this movie a descent rating are doing it any justice, they're simply very nice people who just feel a bit sorry for its low marks which it got for all justified reasons.Lessons learned? Don't ever see a film with Ice Cube, as he is simply without the shadow of a doubt the worst actor of all time. He's obese, which makes him look hilarious in any serious action scene and he CANNOT act anyone besides his annoying, repetitive dull self. If I ever saw Ice Cube or the director on the street, I'd make them suffer in the most painful way possible and make it last just under 2 hours of their life, so they'd know what its like to waste just under 2 hours of your life in the painful way that is by watching XXX2.",

This movie was so gut wrenching that I had to watch it in three installments.I could go through every scene and tear it apart, and I could literally do that, but that would be a waste of my time. The movie itself was terrible, the acting was stiff and unbelievable. Ice Cube is by far one of the worst actors to grace the big screen. I get really fed up with these studious placing rappers into movies based on their \"street\" credit. The other actors were just as bad, if not worst. And a couple of them are big name stars.

PATHETIC.And to be respected as \"A WOMAN\", you must be a top model and show that you know about BIG cars as much as the hero (so, she's in fact a man?). DOUBLE PATHETIC.

It is a military spy film, a Conspiracy thriller and a ghetto gangsta movie all rolled into one. It's a pretty unique combination and one that's not exactly well put together.At the start, when the film jumps genres, you can see and hear it in the visuals and soundtrack, but at the end, it all comes together although rather disappointingly. The man 'suit' turns out he didn't always wear a suit. A secret Ghetto Chop shop raids the white house and 'jacks a tank. It all becomes a bit of a mess. Although the characters are very distinct and all play their part in the story rather well, but all of them seem to have a history together which is never fully explained or shown. It does get annoying after a while to watch characters make continuous reference to something that you had no idea what happened or when.This movie reminded me of a video game (like Grand Theft Auto or a James bond game) that have you going for goal after mindless goal, but it kinda works. It's like 'Gone in 60 Seconds' or 'Speed' where you can just lay back and switch your mind off for an hour and a half. You don't need to think about why who's doing what.

Darius Stone is a hardened ex-Navy Seal, and he is soon put to the test when he is made to uncover the truth behind the attack and stop the growing threat.The movie is all you'd want out of the action genre - great acting, brilliant soundtrack, lots of explosions, crazy stunts, corny one-liners, fast-paced fights, plot twists, some good comedic scenes, and those times when you just think, \"Ah Darius, you genius...\" Of course, it does have its flaws, but so does EVERY movie.

The contrast between the nature of class in these elements is intended to be a source of comic value for the film, but the potential for any smart satirical edge is burdened by overbearing direction and an excessive reliance on the novelty of the main actor.\nxXx: State of the Union boasts Lee Tamahori as director, and though he was once the great New Zealand filmmaker who created the masterpiece Once Were Warriors, he is now a recognizable sellout of massively overblown proportions. With xXx: State of the Union, Lee Tamahori repeats the feat he \"accomplished\" on Die Another Day (2002) of crafting a film loaded with gadgets and over the top action without much in the way of practicality, favouring visual effects significantly more. Die Another Day was the film which made audiences confront the fact that director Lee Tamahori specialized in putting way too much CGI into a single film, while prior to that he made it clear on Along Came a Spider (2001) that he did not have an eye for convincing visual effects. If you can recall that intro scene from the latter where the poorly rendered CGI car crash happens, imagine that going on for ten times as long and you have xXx: State of the Union. The major scenes in the film to use CGI cross between two central flaws: being so overblown that the featre looks animated at one moment, then cutting to actors clearly placed in front of a green screen at the next. I'll admit that there certainly wasn't as much CGI overkill as I was expecting in the film, but the action had other faults to it too. Whenever the film makes use of practical stunts or close combat fight scenes instead of visual effects, excessively choppy editing is the central thing plaguing the film. In a reflection of the ridiculously fast pace of the film, the editing in xXx: State of the Union attempts to keep things feeling quick through choppy editing techniques. By that regard, much of the action in xXx: State of the Union features the two faults destroying the industry of action cinema today. There are some sporadic moments of intense fun within the high quantity of it all and the over the top nature of some of the stunts is surely funny on some level, but it is hardly enough to constitute a film that is any kind of legitimate. Still, the fact that xXx: State of the Union maintains a faster pace and significantly larger quantity of action than its predecessor means it is automatically superior in my opinion. \nxXx was a film which took its story too seriously, but xXx: State of the Union doesn't even pretend to care about having one. This proves to benefit and detract from the film because it paves the way for the film to focus significantly more on action, but at the same time it rushes through things at such a ridiculous pace that the manic energy can prove overwhelming. But even with such a rapid pace, xXx: State of the Union cannot run fast enough to escape the fact that its story is ludicrously senseless.  The plot in xXx: State of the Union is incompetent, desperately attempting to string together a collection of spy movie conventions and ridiculously convoluted plot twists with a series of over the top wall-to-wall action scenes without even much of an attempt to pretend there is anything strong enough to tie it all together.\nOne notable difference between the two xXx films is that the cast seem more relevant this time around.\nIce Cube's performance is a little much. The man has a heavy persona, but he lacks the muscular physique provided by Vin Diesel which makes him less convincing during action scenes. It makes him difficult to believe as Navy Seal Darius Stone, and as it is there are some moments where the use of stunt doubles is clear. The attempts to disguise this beneath the editing are not always convincing, and yet Lee Tamahori brushes over all this to pretend that it can be taken seriously. By contrast, the character cannot. xXx: State of the Union relies so heavily on the stereotypical nature of Ice Cube's street persona that it throws them in the viewer's face repeatedly without the use of subtlety, and as a result his jokes are milked bone dry. The most critical of viewers who are not already large fans of Ice Cube are bound to find frustration in this, and even for his fans it can prove a little much. Still, with everything around him being so ridiculous, he proves to be the better kind and brings audiences the gift of laughter. Giving the former rapper a leading role in a $110 million action film is a ridiculous enough concept as it is, and yet despite being ridden with a ludicrous nature on the surface and in deep, Ice Cube's performance remains the greatest thing about xXx: State of the Union. The man is a novelty in the film, and despite heavy repetition his persona is hilarious to me as a fan of his. He is clearly there to play a stereotypical character and appeal to an esoteric market, but since I happen to fall into that I was able to happily embrace everything senseless about his effort by favouring his instinctive comedic charisma as being sufficient. Ice Cube has more comedic edge than Vin Diesel did, and so I feel that there is more to the character this time.\nAnd Samuel L. Jackson gets slightly more screen time in xXx: State of the Union than he did in the preceding film, and considering that his sophisticated African-American stereotype contrasts with Ice Cube's \"gangsta\" edge there is a slight sense of comedy that comes from their interactions. He is condemned to appearing sporadically and delivering heavily generic language, but his consistent confidence always keeps him maintaining a sense of confident understanding over what he's doing. Samuel L. Jackson steps it up for his appearance in xXx: State of the Union and so he too is an improvement over the preceding film.\nThe presence of Xzibit is also a nice touch. But I will say that I found frustration with the role played by Scott Speedman. Scott Speedman is little more than an annoying detraction from Ice Cube in xXx: State of the Union. In an intent to create comedic contrast for Ice Cube's \"gangsta\" archetype, Scott Speedman plays the fish out of water stereotype as the honky among gangstas. Though he is naturally lifeless, the contrast to the more appealing stereotypes around him makes his effort seem even less appealing as a result. Scott Speedman fails to stir up any laughter and merely becomes a blank face and lifeless face in a film which moves much faster than he can keep up with.\n\nSo xXx: State of the Union benefits from the over the top nature of Ice Cube's stereotypical persona and an increase in action since the preceding film, but the overtly repetitive nature of the script, convoluted narrative (or lack thereof) and action that oscillates between CGI overkill and choppy editing ultimately ensures that it too is nothing to boast about.",

I'm gearing up to see the next film but I'm struggling after this one-two punch knockout franchise, how talents like Dafoe, Jackson and Foley joined this film is probably the central question after Diesel hated the scripts. I fell asleep 20 mins in and suffered through the remaining action film. Cube was a better lead than Diesel but the film crafted around him was beyond dull. I now understand the delay with the new sequel, a time when sequels rarely succeeded the originals. The film deserved to flop and I'm annoyed that a film of this size has horrible special effects. 07-05-2017.",

Ice Cube\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s performance is consistent, and involves better humor. His interactions with Scott Speedman are well timed and enjoyable banter. Through these encounters we learn that Scott Speedman\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s character is going to be more of an ally than an enemy.
