            "content": "I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",

            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).While not as awe-inspiring as Spirited Away or action-packed as Mononoke, it does work on the level of Kiki's Delivery Service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be (well, that's not a big surprise, that's all his films). And as with all Miyazaki stories, the story teaches without being preachy. And the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the character's physical appearance as well. It's that same attention to detail that has made Pixar so great.The animation is wonderful. The castle is itself is a mesh-mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. Through magic, of course. The magic being Howl's and the authoritative hand of Miyazaki's direction. The airships (wow, airships in a Miyazaki film? Who would have thunk?) are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war.Most of the voice work was very strong including Christian Bale (Howl) and Emily Mortimer (as the young version of the heroine, Sophie). The voice that surprised me was Billy Crystal as Calcifer, the little flame that could. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character.There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. Even my 40 year old partner, who had spent the day mountain biking, was dead tired and had never seen a Miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire 2 hours. When we left at 3:30 in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning, we realized we had seen true art.",

            "content": "Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw \"Ashes of Time\" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.Howl is a free person. He doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) He is disguised as different wizards in different counties, and when Sophie asks him how many identities he has, he said \"Enough to guarantee my freedom\". When Sophie confronts Suliman, she comments Howl as \"selfish and cowardly and unpredictable, but he's straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free.\" But in Miyazaki's world, nothing is black and white. According to Suliman, Howl's power is too great for a person without heart, and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).Sophie, on the other hand, is bounded by responsibilities. She is young, but her heart is old. She refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. When her sister asks her \"Are you going to spend your life in that shop?\" She replies \"It meant so much to papa. Besides, I'm the eldest.\". Even her sister asks her to \"look out for yourself\". When Sophie is turned to an old lady, it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has \"so little to lose\" She becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. She is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in Howl's castle and even tames Calcifer to cook her food. For Howl, his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (I'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) By the end of movie, he regains his heart. He feels terrible because it is like \"trapped under a stone\". And Sophie says, \"Yes, a heart is a heavy burden\".There are other wonderful things in the movie. For example, this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. But I do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.Since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system, I'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html",

            "review_title": "Ghibli's messiest, most nonsensical movie is pretty good",
            "content": "This is a very good movie, but I have a lot of issues with it.This movie, espcially its messy third act, feels like sensory overload. Everything is happening so fast and so loud and the quiet moments of rest (which are always the best parts of every Ghibli film) are very few and far between compared to other Ghibli films. It feels very rushed and overwhelming and it gives me a headache.Also, the exact nature of Sophie's curse (and the movie's world in general) is never really explained. I like how her age changes, but it would be good to know what exactly triggers those changes. A lot in this film is unexplained and it's very frustrating. This is probably Ghibli's most nonsensical movie.With that said, I do like it. While I think that the second half is kind of a mess, the first half is really good. It's a lot slower and more focused. There are less characters and there's actual moments to rest and contemplate the beautiful scenery. The ending is also really nice.The best things about this movie are the visuals (obviously) and Howl, especially when he's being a total drama queen. I want more dramatic Howl please.Overall, this is far from being one of my favorite Ghibli movies, but I think the good outweighs the bad just enough. I know it's really beloved, but I will still take Spirited Away or Whisper of the Heart over this anytime.",

            "review_title": "For those who love the book \u0096 or wondered about it",
            "content": "When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.I'd never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels \u0096 a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience's intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.I saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones' Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan \u0096 much was changed, but the soul is the same.For those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I've tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones's work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book:\u0095 Why the witch bespells Sophie\u0095 Where the door opens when the dial points to black\u0095Sophie's sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie \u0095 Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie \u0095 Michael (Markl) is a different age \u0095 The battles \u0096 magical and military \u0096 are quite different (but equally spectacular) \u0095 The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda \u0095 The scarecrow's relationship with Sophie is different \u0095 Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)My advice: go see the movie. It's magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki's films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones' books. (There is a sequel to Howl's Moving Castle \u0096 Castle in the Air.)And enjoy!",

            "content": "What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.He achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.The story is fantastic - I haven't read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki's work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.I can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!",

            "content": "Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.This is an interesting world. The start sets up an easy fantasy with an evil witch and a haunted hero. The twist is the heroine gets turned into an old hag. About midway, the movie takes an odd turn that deviates from that easy formula. The evil witch becomes powerless. There is a new villain but she's not really a villain. This is an anti-war movie but it isn't so straight forward. Even the simple love story gets a last-minute true love detour. While the world is amazing, the story seems to delight in odd diversions from the formula.",

And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it!

And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki.

            "content": "I tried liking this movie. I don't get what all the hype is about. It is very hard to follow. Basically, this old witch turns this little girl who works at a hat shop into an old woman. The girl doesn't mind too much, because she's always been sort of an \"old soul\" anyways. She runs away from home because she doesn't want anyone seeing her as an old woman. She then runs into this random-ass scarecrow. Finally, she comes across the titular moving castle, although at this point in the story she has already had a run-in with the owner, Howl.The moving castle is so confusing. There are so many weird and awkward aspects of it, such as a spinning color wheel by the door. I respect the creative animation, but it just doesn't spark my imagination the way that other films by Miyazaki do. Halfway through the movie, the old witch who turns the protagonist into an old woman suddenly becomes one of the \"good guys\" for no apparent reason. Howl is supposed to be mysterious and heroic, but he comes off more as arrogant and annoying. He is overall not a very likable character. He's a clich\u00e9 anim\u00e9 pretty boy.I understand that this movie is a criticism of war. I can respect that. But it's just kind of all over the place. There is no real continuity. Maybe I'm too dumb to grasp how good it really is. I'll give it another shot, but I must say, I was a little underwhelmed and very confused by this movie.",

            "content": "I love anime, and when I noticed that Howl's Moving Castle was showing today, I knew I had to see it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Terrific Miyazaki, although not his best",
            "content": "\"Howl's Moving Castle\" opened here in France on Jan. 12th (as \"Le Ch\u00e2teau Ambulant,\" natch), and I saw it at an avant-premi\u00e8re. As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there's no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney! I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it's less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki's best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there's a lot to love in \"Howl's Moving Castle.\" I am glad I didn't reread Jones' book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie's a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel's characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.Miyazaki's directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children's story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in \"Howl's Moving Castle\" evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in \"Princess Mononoke.\" I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists' character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones' book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clich\u00e9d imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children's tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in \"Princess Mononoke,\" and younger kids will need their parents with them.) On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of \"young Sophie\" doesn't strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice.",

But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of \"the heart\", a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story! There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie.

The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr. Miyasaki could have accomplished it.Not having seen the Japanese version, the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film. The big surprise was Jean Simmons, an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie. As the young Sophie, Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well. It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, as she seems to be having a great time acting her. Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl. Christian Bale is an amazing Howl. In minor roles we hear the voices of Blythe Danner, Crisping Freeman and Jena Malone, among others.This Anime film will delight young and old fans of Hayao Miyazaki who can look forward to a great time at the movies with this film.",

I feel like the story was all over the place and some things did not really much sense. There were some pretty funny moments and some great music but it was boring and slow towards the second part of the movie.

            "content": "Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, \"I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.\"The plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts a kind of late nineteenth-century European city in which hat shop girl Sophie alternately is wooed by a cute wizard, Howl, and cursed by a witch to be shifted into an old crone's body. Her Dorothy-like wandering with, among others, a pogo-sticked scarecrow, takes her to the titular castle of Howl, where she cleans, keeps order, and longs for Howl. Ultimately she confronts a sorceress, Madam Suliman. War ensues but can't defeat the power of love.The real strength of Howl's Moving Castle is in character diversity and development with a vain, kind, and immature hero; villains morphing into lovable friends and a fire that talks like Billy Crystal and surpasses Eddie Murphy's wisecracking donkey. These are just some of the touches of this hip Asian anime that comments on the folly of war promoted by very neocon-like leaders and the endlessly interesting conflicts between the good and bad angels of each character. Shape-shifting heroine Sophie says, \"I don't want to live if I can't be beautiful!\" Now there's my kind of self-centered lady, heroic and callow in the same film.No one-dimensional characters for this director, perhaps the most gifted animator in the world.",

But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer and the great Jean Simmons in the English dub) gets cursed by an evil witch, and then meets up at Howl's castle (Howl, by the way, is a slightly melancholy and quirky wizard, voiced in a fun way by Christian Bale), and sets about to make herself useful, however to also keep order in the guide of her now old-lady persona (and, more importantly, to free herself from the curse). She also has to contend with an overly cautious flame (Billy Crystal, odd choice for a talking fire, but it works better than I expected), and a scarecrow who sometimes just can't sit still.Soon Sophie becomes the unwitting assistant to Howl, as she goes in partial disguise to help him be present instead of him before his former tutor, Madame Suliman. And, of course, in the meantime, a love story unfolds. Although I could argue that Howl's Moving Castle begins to stray a little from the completely satisfying world portrayed in Spirited Away or particularly in Princess Mononoke- and that the story is given way, frustrations and all, for the visual wonderment- it's still a delight from start to finish. While I wondered when I first saw it if the Japanese dialog would make a difference by much, seeing the American voices didn't detract much at all, and if anything the cast fulfills the story more than one could hope for. And, of course, those visual inventions are never to be taken for granted in Miyazaki's world (more than likely attributable to the source from Diana Wynne Jones and leaning more to Western influence then the decidedly awesomely Eastern Mononoke). If anything individual moments, like when Howl almost melts away from not having certain powers, is really intriguing, or in just seeing the castle itself, with all of the little parts and spindles a marvel in and of itself (Ebert's not far off from saying that it's one of the great unique places of the movies, and for me almost resides on the other industrial side of the cutesy wonderment of Totoro).I definitely need to watch it again, as Miyazaki's worlds usually do, but for now I do recommend it, even if you've never seen one of his films. Little girls too, I'd imagine, might get an extra kick out of the strong-willed female lead and the strong romantic interests in the storyline (and having a handsome leading man voiced by Bale doesn't hurt either).",

The color and dynamic objects burst life into the movie. However, among the spectacle lied the changes in the two main characters who matured and changed their outlooks on life.The main female character, Sophie, got turned into an old woman, and this sudden leap transformed her character to becoming more confident. This reflects the theme of old age. Miyazaki showed that being old is not bad. Instead, it makes a person more mature, confident, and compassionate.The main male character, Howl, also matured as he remembered his identity and understood responsibility.An obvious theme is the anti-war sentiment. The visual, with its glorious spectacle, also showed the ugly side of war where bombs destroyed houses and people. This is a strong over-arching theme.My main problem with the movie was its fairly fast pace. As the beautiful visuals assaulted my eyes, there were a lot of things going on, and I got a bit confused on couple of scenes.Overall, a beautiful fantasy with complex characters. 8/10",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki (\"My Neighbor Totoro,\" \"Spirited Away\") with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones? The answer is \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family's hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman. At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city. Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious \"moving castle,\" owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time. It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it. Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work. The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us. This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us. Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago. The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second. Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood. But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" provides just the right vehicle to take you there.",

            "content": "I like the movie, but the film is way too different than the book to the point that it was a bit annoying. They change too many things. The story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. It's like taking 1939's Wizard of Oz and turning it into turning it into Sci-Fi's Tin Man (2007). It's a re-imagining of Dianne Wynne Jones's classic novel. Don't get me wrong, I love Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the book, Howl's Moving castle; I just wish it would had stay more true to Diana Wynne Jones's novel. This movie marks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service (1989). It is a really fascinating work with lively characters and incredible imagination through out the film. Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho), a 19-year-old hat maker who is taking away by the charm of a Wizard name Howl (Takuya Kimura/ Christian Bale) when she was rescue by him when she was trying to visit her sister. For punishment for trying to steal her favorite's wizard's heart, The Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/ Lauren Bacall) transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her old, Sophie (Jean Simmons) must searches for a way to break the Witch's spell. On the way, she makes some new friends: Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), Howl's young apprentice, a scarecrow nickname Turliphead, and last Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashun/ Billy Crystal). The visuals in the movie are amazing. It's a steam punk fan's favorite, the way, Miyazaki use CG to creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment, but held together by the burning heart of magic is interesting. The film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and interesting details of everything around. There is also the major themes that Miyazaki's works been known for such as such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. Miyazaki's Howl has a very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction. Both old and young Sophie were very interesting. I love Jean Simmon's voice as old Sophie. She gives some charm and funny moments. I love the stairs scene. I was laughing my head off. The dubbing by English actors match pretty damn good. Good job, Pixar. I love the English dub more than the Japanese since it's based on a English novel. The Japanese just looks a bit odd with the European themes in this film. The plot in the film is secondary, as it's nearly makes no sense and full of plot-holes. Things are mention at the last moment or not fully disclosure toward the end. There is nothing about Wales, no reference, no mention, no allusion to the place where the novel came from. The fate of a lost prince sub-plot comes nowhere in left field toward the end. Miyazaki turned the the story into a protest against the war in Iraq. I have nothing against anti-war propaganda, believe me, but let's call it what it is, and not try to trick people into pulling out cash from their pockets for what they assume is a film version of one of their favorite books. The story is utterly unrecognizable from the original. Several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. Sophie doesn't have her sorceress powers that allow her to turn things into living objects. While the Witch of the Waste is the villain in the book; the movie instead made her, into a weak, harmless woman. Then it made the male Suliman (Haruko Kato/ Blythe Danner) a alley in the novel into a female enemy in the film. Still, there are some changes I do like. I like Howl portrayed as a deep troubled hero rather than the arrogant self-centered wizard he is in the book. Still there is a bit of that self-centered narcissism attitude in him in the film. Reminds me a lot of the story Beauty and the Beast. I like how Calcifer is a cute cheeky little orange flame instead of an evil menacing fire demon. Overall: You have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear.",

I'm going to read the book, and I'm sure I will enjoy it but don't know how useful it's going to be.

The animation is so beautiful & I find the characters cute gorgeous, funny & very heart-warming.*SPOILERS*I figure that the face of the old Sophie changes & she instantly looks younger when she feels excited / happy / alive, even as a very old woman (she looks young when asleep, but I wonder if it's only in Howl's vision).It breaks my heart that she looks sad & immediately turns back into the old Sophie when Howl tries to tell her sincerely \"you are beautiful\". But then both Howl & Sophie must fight the war to save each other & the rest of their newly-formed family incl. their old enemy & the dog. The curse is already gone by the time Sophie comes back to present from the past through the door, finds the wounded Bird Howl & kisses him. She won't look old any more.Still, I also like the fact that earlier in the film, after the initial shock, Sophie was clearly able to enjoy herself being old. Think she was already in love with Howl when he came back to the Castle & found her, but she didn't have to be nervous or anything because she knew she was no longer a shy 18-year-old.And Sophie's first encounter with Howl in the back street ... did he say \"There you are, SWEETHEART\"? Has he actually been looking for Sophie ever since he (as a still very young boy) saw her & heard her cry FIND ME IN THE FUTURE. That's clever, and most romantic.",

Though it's not quite up there with Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki doesn't disappoint and the film is filled with breathtaking visuals, charming characters, humor, romance, drama, all of it. I was a little apprehensive seeing the dubbed version, but my doubts were unfounded as the English actors all did a great job.I had a couple of minor gripes about the film. The story doesn't seem as solid and cohesive as Miyazaki's earlier works, if I had to use one word to describe it it would be \"scattered\". The characters also seem to lack the depth of those in other Miyazaki films and I would think this is because much of their histories and motives are left unexplained, the viewer is left to simply accept them as they are, left wanting more.Compared to other Miyazaki films, Howl's Moving Castle doesn't quite feel as complete.

The enormous lumbering Gothic/sci-fi structure looming over the late-19th century Alsatian (!) cityscape reminds one of Hieronymus Bosch, of Pieter Breughel, of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, and yet remains resolutely unique - it is Miyazaki, and no one else.Neither a Hollywood computer-animated film nor a typical Japanese anime, Miyazaki's work is a phenomenon onto itself.As a movie, \"Castle\" (\"Hauru no ugoku shiro\"), at 2 hours' running time, is about a half an hour too long. As a work of art, a visual sensation, it's over much too quickly, although it is guaranteed to continue to run in one's mind.Adopting British author Diana Wynne Jones novel, Miyazaki tells the story of Howl, a terrifying and yet insecure wizard/demon; young milliner Sophie, who is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the Witch of the Waste; Calcifer, a fiery little demon, who powers the castle; Markl, Howl's young apprentice; and the mystical Madame Suliman.Heaven forfend that such a work be dubbed (\"Spirited Away\" was different - and superior - in the subtitled version), but Miyazaki admirers John Lassater and Pete Docter of Pixar have put heart and soul into the English version, and they succeeded. The voice talent for \"Castle\" is extraordinary: Jean Simmons is old Sophie (the film's main character), Emily Mortimer is the pre-curse Sophie, Laren Bacall makes the evil witch almost lovable, Billy Crystal is Calcifer (not overdoing it), and Christian Bale is Howl.For \"Spirited Away\" fans, \"Castle\" is a must; for those unfamiliar with Miyazaki, this is a splendid introduction to the work of a creative genius.",

            "content": "With HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki takes a popular British children's book by Dianne Wyanna Jones and transforms it into yet another breathtakingly gorgeous and sumptuously animated work of art. Indeed, from the opening shot where we see the title structure--a bizarre amalgam of iron, steam, and unexpected surprises--loom ominously out of the mist, audiences will find themselves on a roller coaster of visual delight and imagination.The story, set in a 19th century British countryside, involves a young woman named Sophie who is literally swept off her feet by the handsome yet enigmatic wizard, Howl--despite warnings from her fellow friends that this \"lady-killer\" of a magician eats the hearts of young girls alike. Soon after, Sophie finds herself cursed by the jealous Witch of the Waste--where she is transformed into a ninety-year-old crone. Forced to flee from her hometown, \"Grandma\" Sophie (who occasionally reverts from old to young as the film progresses) takes refuge in Howl's fortress, where she makes a pact with a wisecracking fireball known as Calcifer in order to break his own curse, and likewise, her own.The plot gets a little bit more complicated from here on out, with various side-stories that involve a war, a stern queen who wants Howl to serve in her name, and--wouldn't you know--Howl conquering his inner demons of despair and selfishness through true love. Yet this kind of complex-storytelling has been a well-known trait of Japanese animation, and should be no different here.Fans of the novel that this film is based on have argued that Miyazaki's movie is a poor interpretation of Jones' story (apparently he changed things from the original to suit his imagination). Not having read the book, I can't comment on what parts of the story have been altered or which remain faithful, but as a genuinely huge fan of Miyazaki's work, I have to say that his adaptation is a charming delight on its own ground. Probably the best way to appreciate this film is to approach it as an inspiration for a masterpiece of animation, and not as an undistorted incarnation of Jones' world.This is not to say, however, that Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is flawless--far from it. For fans spoiled by his more action-packed classics such as NAUSICAA and CASTLE IN THE SKY, this film offers little in the way of exciting set pieces. The overall story unfolds at a leisurely pace; this worked in favor of his more quieter, gentler children's tales such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, and of course the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY, but here it sometimes comes off as a bit of a detriment. Given the war subplot and a few occasional action-sequences, one would expect HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE to at least have a grand climax. Regrettably, it concludes in a manner that is slower and more drawn-out than SPIRITED AWAY does, undermining its potential for an epic fantasy. I lay this blame, however, on myself; I had unrealistically high expectations for this film, and so I couldn't help but feel a little bit let down by the finale.Still, in spite of its pacing problems, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE has a lot to offer in the way of visual fiestas, characters that one can identify with, and of course, Joe Hisaishi's richly romantic underscore. This may be a lesser film from Miyazaki, but HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is nonetheless leaps and bounds above the weakest animated features out there and certainly better than the cute but inspired THE CAT RETURNS though not as memorable as his more well-known works. Nonetheless, it earns my highest recommendation; see it on the big screen while you still can, for it's one of the ultimate ways to truly experience this film.On another matter, I am reluctant to choose a favorite out of the Disney/Miramax-produced English tracks for Miyazaki's movies because I have found every one of them to be of five-star quality and always a pleasure to listen to (even the ones that some folks are somewhat divided about, notably PRINCESS MONONOKE, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE). But for the record, Disney once again provides a very capable cast to lend their vocals to the characters and two skillful people to direct them (PIXAR's Pete Docter and Disney's own Rick Dempsey).As Howl, Christian Bale displays charisma, emotion, and charm; he tends to speak softly, except for when he throws a fit about his hairdo, but this actually works for his character. Emily Mortimer is excellent as the sweet, sincere young Sophie, as is elderly Jean Simmons as her 90-year-old counterpart. This triumvirate is amply supported by the gravel tones of Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Josh Hutcherson as the childlike sorcerer Markl (who can make himself look older than he really is), Blythe Danner as Madam Suliman (an astonishingly minor part for a role that appears to command great presence), and longtime Anime voice-over (and huge Miyazaki fan) Crispin Freeman in a brief cameo at the end. (You can also hear him play various roles in the English version of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.) Yet as with all the Disney/Miyazaki dubs, there is always one actor who will steal the spotlight from the others (not that this is a bad thing; I don't mind!), and this time it's the ever-amusing Billy Crystal. As the wily fire-demon Calcifer (who reminded me a lot of Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE in both sarcasm and tone), Crystal scorches up the scenery and provides all the best moments as well as laughs (hey, he's hot). All told, yet another A+ grade Disney production on a solid little movie from Miyazaki.",

I've read reviews where folks think that this movie is not as good as the other Studio Ghibli movies (we have almost all of them) and so we were wary. Frankly, this turned out to be such a great date movie! It was truly a love story, and I believe that this was the first of Studio Ghibli's true love stories. At least it seems to be the only one of it's kind in English.The best part of this movie happens when Howl introduces Sophie to a wildflower swept field, which is Howl's own personal space, and is a memory from his childhood. At that point, my husband and I were completely immersed in the world that Ghibli once again wonderfully and almost magically created. Believe me, when you reach that point in the movie, you will be \"spirited away.\" Pun intended. We will purchase this movie when it is released on DVD, and cannot wait to watch this movie again and again.

We bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. The voices in this were lovely, and Billy was especially wonderful. I'd forgotten that Christian Bale did Howl's voice until the credits, though. The plot's not perfect, but what's there is excellent. I was a little worried about this, because one of the bad reviews I saw on Rotten Tomatoes (and there weren't many...) said that the writing sucked. Though there are plot holes, the story moves along fast enough that you don't really notice them until you think back on the movie. And there's so much else to focus on that the holes aren't really a major issue. The movie is humorous and solemn in turns, and there's so much to see that the plot holes just don't matter.As far as characters, I fell immediately in love with Howl, who's very devil-may-care, but with a good heart. There's a great mix of other characters, from the main character, Sophie, who is cursed by a powerful witch because she's caught Howl's attention; to Calcipher, voiced by Billy Crystal, who is the main source of Howl's power. The characters feel like they have back-stories, even though we never learn most of them, and that's fine, given the limitations of a movie of this type. In fact, it makes me more inclined to like the film, as it makes the characters feel more like real people. Yes, I want to know more about them, but it's not necessary to know, and just knowing that there is a history there is enough.The world is wonderfully rich--kind of a mix of natural magic and the Great War period, with flying ships of all descriptions, odd tanks and battleships, and fascinating mythology, which, while not given much detail, still feels a part of the world, rather than something overlaying it. The Castle itself is not so much a castle as an amazing moving house, which has its own inherent magics, thanks to a fire demon. There were a lot of things that went unexplained, but given the time they had to explain, they did exceptionally well.That's really all I have to say, aside from the fact that anyone who enjoys Ghibli films should not miss this one.",

Once again the main character is a girl, in this case Sophie a young hat maker. One day when she is out she gets slightly harassed by two soldiers but is rescued from this predicament by the wizard Howl who it turns out is fleeing from strange blob-like creatures sent after him by the Witch of the Waste. They escape by flying away from them but soon after the witch visits Sophie in her shop and turns her into an old woman.After being cursed she heads out in to the wastes where she finds a scarecrow who brings the moving castle of the title to her. The castle is a wonderful creation that is hard to describe, it is a bit like a building that has been constructed by lumping several other buildings together and putting them on legs so it can walk about.Once inside sits by the fire to get warm and discovers it is no ordinary fire but a fire demon called Calcifer and that it is he who powers the castle after being trapped by Howl in exchange for his heart. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is cursed and offers to beak her spell if she can break his and thus free him.The castle has a strange door that opens into a variety of places including two cities that are in countries that are at war. In one city they think the wizard Jenkins lives behind the door and in the other they think it is the wizard Pendragon, of course both these are in fact aliases of Howl. Rather awkwardly for Howl both \"Jenkins\" and \"Pendragon\" are summoned by the kings of the respective countries to help with the war effort. Obviously there are plenty more things that happen but I don't want to spoiler the whole film.Howl isn't the standard cartoon hero, in fact he isn't that heroic at all, he is incredibly vain and he wants nothing to do with the war apart from to end it although he does fight against attacking planes.As one would expect from Hayao Miyazaki there are plenty of exciting flying scenes involving aircraft that could only work in an animated film. I can't really comment on the English voices as I haven't seen the whole film in English, I did however watch a few scenes out of curiosity and they sounded pretty good.",

            "content": "This is the only Miyazaki film I've seen so far that's what's on its surface is way, way less impressive than what's underneath it. Neither its fantastical story, its visual splendor, nor its understated yet funny humour hold a candle to its subtext. Howl's Moving Castle's weight lies on What's beyond its story. It's actually a meditation on age and love. Miyazaki allows you here to see the world through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again while conveying a plethora of lessons by his visual storytelling, which is here at its finest regarding practicality, but this is not the case regarding creativity.The film also has tons of pacing issues, most noticeably in the first hurried 15 minutes and the rushed denouement. It also never fully settles into its storytelling technique. I wouldn't have minded the self-indulgent dreamy-like narration (well, not so much), nor this of the your typical sweet fairly tale one. But the mix of both made everything feels quite messy instead of flowing like a hallucinatory dream or an intriguing fantastical adventure story.Indeed, these issues had me confused a little bit. But the unprecedented practical visual storytelling I've mentioned above undeniably compensates for that. As the film proceeds, I find myself understand almost every obscure detail without being explained. That's mostly, if not entirely, due to Miyazaki's unmatched ability to tell a story relying on visual symbolism that remarkably keeps paying off till the last second.Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is the least Hayao Miyazaki film I've enjoyed so far. But that should by no means indicate that it isn't an exceptional work that's as light-hearted and delightful as it's though-provoking and heartwarming.(7.5/10)",

After I seen this movie, it is still very enjoyable to me but there is something in my mind still questioning. Miyazaki want to tell us a love story, that we are sure but may be there is some more. After i read a local film review, the question is entirely clear now I seen this movie into another perspective.Yea, Sofi is the main character and the story are spin around her adventure. However, Miyazaki seem want to look into the aspects of modern Japanese man through Sofi view point. Howl is a powerful wizard; however his life is not as happy as other thinks. Every success had a price. He was chased by 2 waring parties who want to own his power, he living in a mess inside a moving castle which was keep hiding from one place to another place. Only thing that keep him going is his great style of hair and the believe that he is looking handsome. That why Miyazaki choose Takuya Kimura as Howl casting, in fact, Kimura is a top idol star in Japan which is share a similar burden as Howl, he is handsome, he is popular but he is not free, all the decisions are subject to his manager company, he could not date a girl openly. Yet Kimura married Kudo Shizuka despite all the opposition from his manager company. That strike the similarity that love shall triumph all. Even the war could be stop and the teacher of Howl would not stop him at the end.",

The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live.

Unfortunately, I must rank it among his weaker efforts. It's certainly not a BAD film - I don't think the man is capable of that - but after the brilliance of Mononoke, and Spirited Away, I was disappointed.The big problem, putting it bluntly, is that the movie makes no sense. It's possible the fansub I was watching mangled it, but I can't imagine a way for the script to be written to make the events cohesive. It takes the dream-logic of Spirited Away, but takes it to a point that it becomes nearly impossible to get \"into\" the movie. With Spirited, you always felt like there were rules to the world, even if as an outsider you didn't understand them. This never seemed the case with Howl.Furthermore, Miyazaki seems to have dipped into his bag of stock tricks a bit too often. There's little in here that you haven't seen in some form in his previous films. There doesn't appear to be anything new he has to say with this film, it's just retreading the themes that have run throughout his work. I could easily forgive Mononoke as being a thematic remake of Nausicaa, since I feel his message had grown sufficiently in the decade separating those films to be worth repeating. That's not the case here.But, as I said, it's still not a bad film. I suspect people who haven't seen all of Miyazaki's canon will find it quite enjoyable. The richness and nuance of his character animation continues to grow. No one makes more expressive animated figures than Miyazaki, and the characters alone nearly carry the film. And supported by another wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, as in all of Miyazaki's works, there are moments of staggering beauty rarely seen in films of any genre or style.And despite the incomprehensibility of the plot, he makes it compelling and watchable, even as you have no clue what's going on or why.So, I give the movie an above-average rating and a recommendation, simply on the strength of being a Miyazaki film. The worst of his movies is still better than just about anything else out there. But the purists are likely to be a bit disappointed.",

It really seemed like they were the original voices. I never once wished I could hear the Japanese like I usually do, even on Spirited Away. Now that is settled!This film deals mostly with the character of Sophie. I won't sum up the plot, you've seen that already. The heart of the film is at Sophie accepting herself, and accepting the affection of other people. That's pretty much the moral. The most winning character by far is Howl himself, at least for a girl like me. He is a really complex character, beautiful drawn, and voiced with precision by Christian Bale. He sounds really similar to his Batman voice in this, so get ready for that. Billy Crystal's Calcifer is refreshingly muted. I had worried about him being too flamboyant, but he is really a charming character. The entire cast of characters are so real, as is the world they inhabit, that it just draws you in. I smiled through the first half of the movie! I saw the film with friends in their mid-twenties, one of which is not into anime, and we all enjoyed it. Many of the folks at the theatre brought children, but it seemed like the adults enjoyed it far more than the children. It is probably too dark for kids under 8, in my opinion. There is a lot of bombing in the second half, and it can be startling. I all this is a really good film. The plot gets a little complicated in the second half, where it starts to greatly deviate from the book and become more Miyazaki, but there is plenty of action, comedy, romance, and fun to please every age group.

I will admit to being biased, since this *is* my favorite movie of any (animated or not), but honestly, whether you're 7 or 70, this movie is a guaranteed delight. Every time I see this movie, I'm immediately overwhelmed by feelings of wonder, delight, creativity, and hope, and I must say I've definitely seen this movie over 60 times. It doesn't get old, and it's one of those movies where every time you see it, you see something new in the background you'd never noticed before.Okay, on to actually telling you about the movie! The animation and musical score are so far above average it's not even funny. I could watch this with it on mute, and I'd still be struck by the wonder of all the scenery, and the excellent emotional responses of the characters. I could listen to the music from this for HOURS, and if you're any sort of creative person (writer, poet, musician, artist, etc.) it WILL inspire you. Also, I haven't seen the subbed version yet, but unlike many dubbed anime, you will NOT feel like you're being talked down to! Now, this movie is based on a book by Diana Wynne Jones. This is one of the handful of movies where I've watched before I read, and unlike most book to movie adaptations (I loathe nearly all of them), this movie stands on its own with excellence. The book is most certainly a bit different (you will get more of a background on the characters and plot), but for once, I can actually say I loved both equally. It's not necessary to read the book first by any means, but make sure you don't neglect to do so! As a writer, I work with words and their nuances constantly, but even I have immense trouble trying to find words to describe the utter fabulousness of this movie! I'm honestly trying to take a step back and take a critical look at it, but there are NO flaws, no things I would have improved. I wish this movie had actually been released to the public to see in the theaters (I would have had to drive 7 hours to see this when it first came out, and I live very close to a large city - we're talking practically NYC and LA release only!), so many more people could have been struck by the wonder this movie inspires.So if you need an uplift, rent this movie ASAP. Better yet, buy the DVD - it is quite difficult to obtain outside of stores that specialize in anime and the internet, but it is VERY worth it - the DVD has awesome extras and lots of artwork used in the creation of the movie.

Because what I was about to see was nothing less than magic. I forgot the last time a movie captivated me so strongly, the last time I truly felt that kid I once used to be-this movie delivered big -time. Such creativity and pure fantasy extravaganza is almost unheard of today, yet Hayao Miyazaki lets us indulge in it with such ease and simplistic honesty it feels as if he's the only person in the world with imagination worth mentioning. And his definitely is! A colorful palette of characters and a beautiful story are the key element why this movie is worth seeing.

            "content": "Miyazaki builds these wonderful little universes. Poetic, charming places that are at once familiar and exotic. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely bit of film that provides a great little escape.Miyazaki is clearly a master storyteller, because it's only after viewing this film that I realized there isn't really much \"story\" here, and what there is has many inconsistencies and unexplained twists. The ending, in particular, seems to just \"happen\". But, frankly, the characters are so involving, and the movie is so beautifully drawn, that any story shortcomings are easy to overlook.I know some are wary of the \"Disneyfication\" of films like this or SPIRITED AWAY. I think this is something of a labor of love, though, and is motivated less by greed than a sincere desire to bring these beautiful films to a wider audience. Certainly the talent isn't lacking in this English language translation, with great vocals from Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and the incomparable Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is quite funny as Calcifer, the fire demon, too.While I think I preferred SPIRITED AWAY on the whole, it's really just a few minor quibbles that lead me to this. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely place to visit for a couple of hours.",

            "content": "First of all, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this film and intend to see it several more times. On a technical level, Miyazaki has elevated the traditional 2-D animated film above the cheesier but more realistic 3-D Computer-generated works that seem to prevail everywhere else. Whether he used computers to simulate the 2-D look is beyond my current knowledge, but I applaud his attempt to abandon the technique that even crept into his previous work, _Spirited Away_.The film is *very* loosely based on the original novel. In fact, only the basic premise and the main characters seem to have survived Miyazaki's scalpel. As a story, it is unimaginative and trite. Furthermore, the characters lacked depth. Unlike he did with _Kiki's Delivery Service_, Miyazaki failed to improve upon the original work. All is forgiven, though. This is one-hundred percent pure uncut Miyazaki. I was left with the impression that he was going to have fun with a project, this was the project, and he had a great deal of fun with it. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided excellent musical support. I gave this film an 8.",

            "review_title": "Cynical and manipulative cut-and-paste job of other Miyazaki films with conservative message for girls",
            "content": "Up to and including \"Spirited Away\", the animated films by Studio Ghibli are of a high standard both technically and in spirit. With \"Howl's Moving Castle\", the soulful quality of the earlier films that peaked with \"Princess Mononoke\" disappears and what we get is an empty shell of a story that exploits typical Studio Ghibli motifs and themes and the studio's technical virtuosity. All the familiar devices of earlier films \u2013 a young female protagonist on the verge of adulthood, elderly women, a flawed hero with shamanic characteristics, heroes and villains manipulated by more powerful characters of uncertain quality, sophisticated flying technology in an alternative 19th-century steampunk world \u2013 are worked over in a fantasy aimed (cynically it seems to me) at a mainstream Western audience and the result looks very cheesy and manipulative with an ulterior message that superficially celebrates female bravery but channels it into socially restrictive roles.The story's heroine is a plain-jane working-class hat-maker called Sophie who accidentally meets a young wizard Howl and so arouses the jealousy of the Witch of the Waste who turns her into an old woman. Sophie runs away and meets a scarecrow called Turnip who takes her to Howl's over-sized trailer-park home. Here she meets a fire demon called Calcifer and Howl's child assistant Markl. Sophie insinuates herself into Calcifer, Markl and Howl's lives by claiming to be a cleaning-woman and through her association with the unlikely trio, is drawn into a war between Howl's country and an enemy realm missing its Crown Prince; during the film's course the war also moves into Sophie's country. Howl is forced to participate in this war at the cost of eventually losing his humanity through repeated transformations into a bird creature. Sophie comes to realise that Howl and the Witch of the Waste are pawns of more powerful forces, represented in part by Madame Suliman, the former mentor of Howl, and Sophie's work for the rest of the film is cut out trying to locate Howl's missing heart, the mysterious connection between Howl and Calcifer, ending the war and locating the missing Crown Prince.Working out all the different strands of the film and connecting them together might take viewers 2 \u2013 3 viewings which would expose them to an excess of saccharine musical schmaltz and a deadly \"love conquers all\" radiation cloud in the tradition of Beauty-and-the-Beast stories. I think if I had to sit through this film again, my hair and teeth will start falling out, my skin will break out into ulcers and bruises will mysteriously appear and spread. Characters are poorly developed and the love Sophie feels for the feckless Howl is so unbelievable as to be laughable; she would have been better off taking her chances with Turnip who performs a noble act of voluntary self-sacrifice in comparison with Howl who fights because he is compelled to, not out of free will.The war merely forms a backdrop to the events and all the various characters can do is try to stop it without understanding anything about the lead-up to it and why Suliman forces Howl to do her dirty work; or participate in it. Even the animation of the war and its participants looks like a cut-and-paste job of previous Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli films like \"Nausicaa of the Valley of Winds\", \"Porcorosso\", \"Laputa: Castle in the Sky\" and \"Princess Mononoke\": several flying machines look like those giant bug monsters of \"Nausicaa \u0085\" with wing-flaps added as an afterthought. Backgrounds are visually gorgeous at first but turn out to be generic according to the role they have to play so, for example, town scenes have a dreamy alternative-universe quality similar to scenes in \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" which takes place in a similar alternative 1950s universe that might well follow on in the future from \"Howl's Moving Castle\".The film is too long and its story is too intricate to work as a family film, the characters are shallow and implausible, the animation is cynically overwhelming and unoriginal. Worst of all is the film's message about what happens to girls eventually: they get to play brave heroines for a brief while and once they are adults, they can be either beautiful scheming bitches like Suliman or domestic-goddess workaholics like the geriatric Sophie slaving away for love. Issues like the nature of war \u2013 Miyazaki made the movie partly in protest at the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2013 are sidelined so much that all the eye- blinking in the world couldn't make them more missed. No way in the world would I recommend this film for families with young daughters. I feel so cheated having seen it.",

            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle has everything that we've come to expect from Hayao Miyazaki - stunning animation, surrealistic touches and a whimsical storyline. Miyazaki has almost created his own genre, such is the distinctiveness of his work. Howl's Moving Castle is yet another example of why Miyazaki is in a league of his own.On the surface, Howl's Moving Castle appears to be a rather standard animated film for children, albeit with startlingly good production values. The storyline resembles a fairytale with Sophie, our hard working, plain Jane heroine being cursed by an evil witch. In fact, for the first 10 minutes of the film I feared that Miyazaki had lost his edge. My concerns were put to rest from the moment the witch of the waste's blob like henchmen emerge from the surrounding walls and chase Sophie and Howl through an alley. Miyazaki moves from Cinderella sweetness to Donnie Darko -esque weirdness in the blink of an eye without missing a beat.The weirdness continues as Sophie is transformed into an old woman and goes off in search of a wizard to help lift her curse. This results in Sophie moving into Howl's castle as his cleaning lady. There should be something seriously subversive about a love story between a young wizard, who really is a bird-like monster with feathers, and an old, hunchbacked woman but within Miyazaki's weird and wonderful world it appears perfectly normal. It is this underlying sense of the surreal that truly sets Miyazaki's work apart. Howl's Moving Castle offers strolls through the sky, alternate realities and a hero who occasionally melts into green sludge.Needless to say, the animation is breathtaking. The level of detail is astonishing and Miyazaki's sense for time and place is unrivalled. In comparison to this film, Pixar's computer animation feels cold and lifeless. Howl's Moving Castle is a work of art, while films like \"Robots\" and \"Madagascar\" are simply technically proficient. The animation is well matched by a memorable score and excellent voice work. Lauren Bacall stands out as the Witch of the Waste. If I have one complaint, it is with Billy Crystal being cast as Calcifer. His characterisation is a little too \"Dory\" for my liking. Unlike \"Finding Nemo\", this film did not require cheap comedic relief.By the film's conclusion, Miyazaki has succeeded in taking a fairytale and turning it inside out. Howl's Moving Castle is a magnificent achievement. It may not be quite as audacious as \"Spirited Away\" but in comparison to most children's films, it is positively twisted. Be a cool parent and hire this for your kid instead of dulling their senses with an artistic void like \"Chicken Little\".",

            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle is phenomenal. Presenting itself initially in an odd way, our protagonist Sophie seems somewhat dry and dull. But this lasts only a few moments until a series of fantastical characters pour into her world. Each of these characters, whether it be Calcifer, Markl, Turniphead, the Witch of the Waste (during the last half) or the quiet dog are immediately likable from the get go. You genuinely care about them and their constant references to one another as a family only make the group seem all the more close. It's not very often I'm immediately pulled in by a group of characters but the colorful cast of Howl's Moving Castle are quick to bore a place in memory.The animation quality is also superb. Vibrant colors and visuals fill every frame and a great attention to detail is thoroughly evident from beginning to end. Though at times it may seem very basic in style, take a second look as every frame holds something distinctively unique and profound in its beautiful fashion. Howl's dazzling transformations are superbly animated throughout his personal endeavors of self-loathing, missing love, and thirst for power. Wheteher he be taking the form of an enormous blue bird or enshrouding himself in the company of dark spirits during a bout of depression, Howl is a spectacle all on his own. The castle he inhabits along with his family is also a treat to the senses. Other than the obviousness of how distinctively creative and complex the outermost appearance of the moving castle is; the magical functions it performs are just as remarkable and interesting. This magnificent creation serves not only as a haven to our heroes but also as a portal to both time and space. It is a mystical labyrinth filled with humorous and surprising secrets and feats at every turn.The film has a lot to say on love, life, loyalty, war, bravery, and family. And it succeeds gracefully in bringing all these themes together in a very thoughtful and stirring manner. By the films end there is a lot left lingering with you. I found myself thinking about the film as a whole long into the credits' enchanting music. The overall brilliance of its unfolding story, captivating characters, moving relationships, strong themes, elegant visual beauty, and thrilling conflicts is more than I've experienced in a long time in terms of animated films. Yes his last too works Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke were also brilliantly captivating, but Howl's Moving Castle just stood out to me as something extra special in Miyazaki's body of work with Studio Ghibli.I have seen all of Miyazaki's films with the exception of Kiki's Delivery Service and must say that Howl's Moving Castle is one of Miyazaki's most impressive accomplishes to date. The Academy Award for Best Animated Picture was robbed from this delightful and exciting adventure. I'd have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is my second favorite Miyazaki film, surpassed only by Nausicaa of The Valley of th Wind. Like Nausicaa, this film was grossly overlooked by both general viewers and critics alike. Heres hoping that the DVD release garners more great rating from viewers on this deserving gem.",

So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered.

So I'll put my two cents worth in anyway.Of the three big name and one independent feature films I've seen in the past six weeks, this is the best. The first thing that catches your eye (ahem!) is Miyazaki's wonderful animation. His scenes are to film what Hal Foster did to the Sunday comics. They are colorful, lifelike, have great attention to detail and are... well, just beautiful.A late 19th European setting done to a fare-thee-well by a Japanese artist? You bet. He did it in Porco Rosso and he's done it at least as well here. That's another recommended Miyazaki masterpiece after this one charms you.I was quickly caught up in the film. The characters are believable and the voices, well it's a shame to call it dubbing. I doubt it was easy to match English dialog to a Japanese film but they did a superb job. What this means to you is that you never, ever notice. The voices are appropriate to the characters and, I think, really enrich the character's personalities.While kids will appreciate the animation and action, Howl's Moving Castle is really for adults. Take your kids to see it. When they see it again in ten years, they'll see an entirely new film all over again.If there's any justice in the Academy Awards, this should get Miyazaki another one - I think it's even better than Spirited Away.When they're worth it (rarely) I pay attention to film scores, and Joe Hisaishi has written one well matched to this fine film.Did I make the point that I LOVED this film?

The young hero (Sophie in this case) fighting against events that are over it's understatement, the cursed prince, the war feeling, the evil witches, the bizarre monsters, the charming characters... Is like a crossover of all his movies, like a gallery of paintings where you walk and you see each frame of his devious imagination. With the aid of Joe Hisaishi mesmerizing score, Miyazaki takes us to another ocean of original ideas, without being completely original (well, not every animation movie has a moving castle, and such a twisted plot of spells, curses, war and conspiracy). In a year full of Tripods, remakes, polemic movies and some flaws in the box office, Howl's moving castle is a relief.

Basically young Sophie (Emily Mortimer) is the innocent girl who works in her late father's hat shop, and after a chance encounter with the magician Howl (Christian Bale), famous for his moving castle, she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall). The witch turn Sophie into an elderly woman, to become Grandma Sophie (Jean Simmons), and trapped in this body she tries to find a way to reverse it, but more than that to seek her fortune inside the Moving Castle. There she meets and befriends Calcifer (Billy Crystal) the fire demon, he powers the castle and recognises that she is cursed and helps however he can to help her get by. But he also makes a deal with her, if she breaks the contract she is under with Howl, whatever that is, then he has the power to lift her curse and she will go back to her eighteen year old self. I will be honest, this is pretty much the only story I can understand, the rest of it is really complicated, and just see the characters muddling about, helping each other in whatever is going on, and Sophie goes backwards and forwards sometimes with her age state. Also starring Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, Josh Hutcherson as Markl, Jena Malone as Lettie, Crispin Freeman as Prince Turnip, Mark Silverman as King, Mari Devon as Honey and Liliana Mumy as Madge. I can certainly agree with the critics that the makers seem to have concentrated more on the spectacle than creating a story that you can follow and not get confused with, which is exactly what I found it does, but of course the animation is fantastically imaginative, overall it is not a terrible animated fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Okay!",

            "content": "Young Sophie is a plain girl who works in a hat store. When she meets the wizard Howl on her way home she finds herself protected by him as he flees from the demons of the Witch of the Waste. Later that night the Witch visits her in the shop and casts a spell turning her into an old woman but preventing her from telling anyone. Setting out into the wilderness, Sophie comes across Howl's castle and, thanks to a cheeky fire demon, settles in as the new cleaning woman while she can try and work out how to break her curse of old age. However while she retains her young heart in an old body, she learns that Howl has long since lost his heart and the pressure of wars is taking its toll on him.Although it is inferior to Spirited Away in some areas, I scoff at those that heavily criticise Howl for this because this film is still a lot better than a lot of the \"Happy Meal marketing campaigns\" that are served up to our children as films. This film has the usual Miyazaki traits of imaginative visuals, a range of characters, magic, humour and an interesting plot that is more than just easy sentiment and clich\u00e9. I agree with those that have said it is hard to follow at times because, although the main thrust of the narrative is engaging, I did find it distracting to not totally understand things like Sophie drifting between degrees of age etc. However this still served to engage me as I tried to understand the meaning of it within the plot. The theme of hearts is well used within the film and, again although I didn't understand the narrative totally, I liked the meaning within the story about the importance of the heart within each person. It touched me and although the detail will go over most children's heads, hopefully it should impact upon them to some degree. The pace is pretty good for the most part but I was a bit disappointed with the delivery at the end \u0096 it was all neatly tied up and done very quickly; the downside of this being that it does feel a bit forced and obvious in contrast with the more controlled material up to that point (Turniphead's fate is a perfect and unnecessary example of what I mean).The animation is typically beautiful and audiences should guard against accepting this as the standard simply because it is the case so often. I loved the look of the film, from the trademark things like the European feel to the cities, to the design and beauty of the flying machines right down to the usual mix of imagination within the characters. The characters are the usual delight as well \u0096 not afraid to make them \"ugly\" while also drawing beauty and goodness out of their hearts. Most obviously this is seen in the character of Sophie, who is never better than when she is old \u0096 how many other children's films would be confident enough in their audience to put an old woman in the lead role? Howl is just as interesting although his transformation may be hard to follow for younger viewers. Simmons and Mortimer are both good as Sophie although Simmons dominates her younger counterpart. Bale is always good value even if he could have benefited from a slower pace to develop his character better. Crystal is a joy as Calcifer and he adds humour and spark (sorry) to his scenes. Bacall is classy presence in a good character while I liked Hutcherson's turn as Markl.Overall this is not the perfect film because the plot is not as easy to follow as it could have been and the heart (sorry) of the story could have been delivered in a more patient and slower manner, this isn't too much of a problem (although the ending is clumsy) and the majority of the film is strong enough to cover it. The animation is flawless and the characters enjoyable while the story has plenty of interest in there to hold the interest. Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film for the family, children or adults.",

The story was a uniquely creative one and the animation art wasn't as off-putting as some anime can be.As Sophie went through her various age related metamorphisms, I tried to keep track to see if there was a common denominator for becoming young again after the Witch of the Waste cast her spell. It occurred when she fell asleep, but after that it was hard to distinguish any common elements responsible for the change. Maybe it was an aspect of her mood at the time? I have to admit, there were times in the second half of the story when things were getting a bit difficult to follow, where cause and effect didn't seem to have any connection to each other. The one thing that occurred in the story that caused some concern was when Sophie threw the bucket of water on the old Witch, summoning up a reference to Dorothy defeating the Wicked Witch of the West. That coincidence I think detracted from the story's originality a bit.But otherwise I came away feeling good about the picture. I've seen a few other works by director Miyazaki, among them \"Princess Mononoke\". That one too was somewhat complex in trying to understand and I don't pretend to 'get' all of what he was trying to say, but he makes up for it to large degree with interesting characters and a very nice palette that's pleasing to the eye. I just recently happened to view the movie that beat this one out for Best Animated Feature, \"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\", and for my money, this one appealed to me a whole lot better.",

Yes, his smile was so magical and powerful, that I believed he is just like that. Until yesterday I watched it again with my pal, and the image of Howl changed in my mind completely.It's less about Sophie's salvation, but more about Howl's. He is the one, who was left alone by adults all the time when he was the kid; he is the one, who escape to his little cabin, whenever there is big problems, that he doesn't want to face; he is the one, who wears the \"smile-poker-face\" and appears confident, not daring to show his true self under that facade; he is the one, who voluntarily gave his heart to the demon Calcifer in his childhood, since he hadn't had any significant other, to whom he could even use his heart, so what for to keep that \"useless\" heart. That little cabin was and is his hideout, so is the moving castle. Howl is still a kid, longing for (parental) love, and Sophie gave him first time this feeling. Sophie \"activated\" his sleeping heart and rescued him out of his little hideout.",

As usual the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive - but what really holds the film together, for me, are the amiable anthropomorphic characters (Turnip the Scarecrow, Calcifer the Fire Demon and Heen the Dog) rather than the 'human' leads, the villains, or even the elements of fantasy so prevalent in this particular film-maker's admittedly unique brand of art.",

Everything is created by magic or cursed by magic so you just have to call the film magical.

            "content": "I'm glad that Hayao Miyazaki reconsidered his decision to retire otherwise his 2004 \"Howl's Moving Castle\" would be his last movie I'd experience and well, you got it, it wasn't as pleasant as the previous ones. I watched it three times, as I used to because his movies tend to be rich content and form wise so the two aspects can distract one from another, but then checking some other users' comments, I stuck to my initial reaction: the animation is as great as you can expect from the master but it's one of these cases where, paraphrasing Emperor Joseph from \"Amadeus\", you can just sigh and say there are simply too many 'notes'.Don't get me wrong, it's not a case of Emperor with no clothes, but with so many clothes you can't even recognize him anymore. But I had my reservations from the beginning because the title reminded me of \"Castle in the Sky\" and that film didn't leave me ecstatic either, an action-packed coming-of-age story, puppy romance with environmentalist and anti-war messages venturing in the realm of magic led to a real overdose of effects not easily 'digestible' by a younger audience. The film is still just a lighter version of \"Howl's Moving Castle\", a real 'fantasy' bouillabaisse and perhaps the unique instance where a point came I stopped to care about the film and was waiting for it to end.Was it because Miyazaki was so intoxicated by the universal (and deserved) acclaim of \"Chihiro's Travel\" that he felt he could fly that close to the sun and get away with it, there was just something a tad pretentious in that late-minute eruption of fantasy and witchcraft. And yet it started so promisinglyI just loved the quiet beginning in that small European town, I figured the action took place during World War I, then it started with a meek and mousy milliner named Sophie who's saved from two bullying soldiers by a handsome flying 'angel' named Hauru (the titular Howl) and then you have your set-up for a typical Miyazaki journey, a young female candidate for a great coming-of-age story, flying, magic and war as the backdrop. Then the troubles begin: a cruel sorceress named the Witch of the Waste turns Sophie (for no apparent reason) into an old woman and not only we've had to say goodbye to the pleasant look of Sophie to (yet another) ugly looking grandmother. What's with Miyazaki and old women anyway?Still, the real problem is that the personality of Sophie changes as well, in fact, it changes so radically that she becomes like another character. This might be the most disturbing thing about the film, all through her adventure; the changes in Sophie's looks and personality are so inconsistent that I had a hard time detecting the aspect of her personality that was meant to evolve. I initially thought being an old woman would help her to embrace life with more enthusiasm, but she seemed to have understood it very quickly and become your typical domineering lady as soon as she enters the castle (with the help of the turnip-face scarecrow). So what was Sophie's lesson to learn? From the ending, we gather that \"Howl's Moving Castle\" was meant to end like a love story. I didn't read the original novel from Diana Wynne Jones (in fact, when I heard the name \"Witch of the Waste and saw the scarecrow, I expected a 'Wizard of Oz' like journey) but even in the novel, I guess there was an arc to close, but here, Sophie falls in love with Howl or Hauru, why? She did save him in a way but since she spent most of her time as an old lady trying to break her spell, she acted more as a motherly figure helping an insecure kid, those were interesting twists on the usual characterization, but at the end it seems that there's a return to a basic narrative that didn't match the beginning.I quite enjoyed the film say after the visit to the Queen and then, the overuse of magic and ominous malevolent spirits, then the chants and the chases and I just stared at the screen and thought \"boy, that escalated quickly\". The problem with magic is that it's a double-edged sword, basically when the main protagonist is victim of a curse, her 'love' interest is a wizard, the nemesis turned protagonist is a witch, and the wise queen an even crueler witch, and the castle is a magic spirit moved by a talking fire, well, there are so many possibilities there's no savor to unpredictability anymore, it becomes boring. The movie goes in too many directions and magic shortcuts itself in a chaotic extravaganza. Kiki's incapability to fly the broom was more intense than anything from \"Howl's\" climax.Yes, the film is visually pleasant but at some point but so are many Terry Gilliam's movies and they're not in the same league of greatness. At least, \"Castle in the Sky\" had the pirates and couldn't be a love story anyway, while \"Howl's Moving Castle\" seems to cut-and-paste all the usual elements of Miyazaki and provide a great entertainment without any 'ubstance', the ingredients are all there but making a film is also like making a good cake. Miyazaki did this film like the pastry cook who's just finished his cake, added some Chantilly cream, then some fruits, then some raspberry coulis, and then some walnuts... individually, they all taste great but in the same recipe, they can only contribute to something indigestible.While not a bad movie or a misfire, I think this is just Miyazaki being carried away at the most pivotal moment of the film and realizing at the last minute that it should have a proper ending. Definitely a case where the best was the enemy of the good.",

            "content": "Hayao Miyazaki's \"Howl's Moving Castle\" revolves around Sophie, an insecure young woman who is transformed into an old lady by a spiteful witch. An outcast before her transformation, Sophie takes to her new body like a fish to water; she leaves her bustling town for the anonymity of life in the mountains. Here she gets a job working for Howl, a powerful wizard.As is typical of Miyazaki, \"Castle\" is filled with loving details, picturesque towns, interesting machines, beautiful landscapes and that fusion of steam-punk and retro-art which Miyazaki so adores. More interesting is the way all of Miyazaki's major characters go through a physical metamorphosis. Sophie's outward appearance, for example, seems to fluctuate based on self-esteem and mood. Howl is similarly preoccupied with \"how he looks\", using potions and magic to create the illusion of a handsome wizard.These themes dovetail into the film's thoughts of war and conflict. Here Howl's gradually tainted by partaking in a war between two rival cultures. The more he fights, the more his body becomes black and monstrous. He also literally \"loses his heart\". For Miyazaki, deeds and actions affect beauty as strongly as private perceptions. You are what you do.\"Howl's Moving Castle\" was based on a novel by British author Diana Wynee Jones. Miyazaki has altered Jones' tale slightly, however, and included vast air wars which he says were designed to evoke the Western invasion of Iraq. \"The film was profoundly impacted by the war in Iraq,\" Miyazaki would later reveal. \"The reason I didn't attend the Academy Awards was because I didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq.\" In this regard, the film moves slowly from peace to chaos. When propaganda fliers fall from the sky (perhaps echoing the 2002 dropping of 500,000 pamphlets on Iraq by US airships), Miyazaki's landscapes begin their slow slide toward smoke and flame. For Miyazaki, peace with oneself forestalls conflict, but more importantly, those who pretend to oppose \"evil\" often partake in the very \"evils\" they denounce. By the film's climax, all sides are responsible, even Howl, who spends his days and nights catching the bombs which threaten to fall on innocent civilians. When he retaliates against those who drop them, his hands become overrun with black feathers; he begins to turn into the very monsters he decries.\"Which is who?\" Sophia asks, looking up as armadas swirl. \"What difference does it make?\" comes the reply. Throughout the film, divisions between \"us\" and \"them\" seem irrelevant. There can be no \"good\" and \"bad\", no \"love\" and \"hate\" when the sheer act of partaking in violence makes everyone indistinguishable. Such a stance is reductive and at times false - one can oppose evil and violence, even with violence, and not be \"evil\" - but nevertheless offers an interesting contrast when we consider how wars are actually mis-sold (\"We're under attack because we love freedom, and our enemy hates freedom. They hate and we love. We differ from our enemy because we love. Our enemy hates.\" - George Bush).Whilst \"Howls\" first three acts are strong, its final act overwhelms its audience with confusing subplots which make little sense upon first viewing. Only with re-watches do Miyazaki's intentions become clear. Indeed, the film becomes more tragic with familiarity. Howl, for example, is revealed to have \"caught falling stars\" as a child, saving them from impact and so death. One of these \"falling stars\" he \"gives his heart to\" in order to \"save its life\". As Howl grows up, this desire to \"catch falling stars\" stays with him; like the infamous dream in The Catcher in the Rye, Howl's preoccupied with preserving life.The \"castle\" of Miyazaki's title refers to Howl's home, a bulbous walking machine which epitomises Howl's rootlessness. As the film progresses, this castle falls apart, until it is reborn with wings. Howl and Sophie then fly off into the horizon, recalling an early, charming scene in which he quite literally sweeps the girl off her feet. The film climaxes with conventional light-shows of the kind you don't usually associate with Miyazaki. Howl's also designed to resemble traditional Manga heroes (sharp hair, big eyes, triangular jaw), lending some of the film's visuals a familiar feel. Still, the film's early moments, aided by composer Joe Hisaishi, are as good as Miyazaki at his best.8/10 \u2013 Multiple viewings required.",

Or maybe just 'average', which is the worst thing you could possibly say about a film from a director who had previously sought to delight through imagination and vibrancy.In Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki struggles to find original ground and ends up retreading now increasingly familiar ideas and motifs from his previous work, even the opening title sequence seems to reuse music from his breakout hit Spirited Away. We have a teenage girl (Sophie, the protagonist), a silent and ineffective partner (Turnip-head), a humorous sidekick (Calcifer), a collection of wishy-washy tag-alongs (Markl & co), vague enemies which are totally unexplored, and a mysterious and largely undeveloped male teenager, who here happens to be the titular Howl. All characters also suffer from abysmal phoned-in performances for the English dub (I can't comment on the original), in particular Christian Bale (Howl) who barely varies his delivery throughout, and Emily Mortimer (Sophie) who gives an appallingly flat performance for the lead. Only the ever-reliable Billy Crystal gives value for money as the fire daemon Calcifer, though it's nothing incredibly special - more accurately simply a cut-price Robin Williams.Elsewhere there are more significant problems. The story is a mess both in terms of plotting and pacing and scripting. It begins well enough but falls into predictable buddy-buddy routines all too early, fails to head in any clear direction for a long time and then ends on a half-hearted note (which is to say ridiculously hokey) with a total non-conclusion. Whole ideas are thrown into the mix and left unexplained, like the war which is at the center of the action, the king (queen?), the other wizards. Miyazaki could arguably be even trying to say something about the Iraq war, with a myriad of none too subtle contemporary references, but even that didactic aspect is lost.You will likely not leave the cinema satisfied, unless you are ten years old - and even the kids behind me were bored to tears long before the finishing line. A rethink is needed over at Ghibli studios..4/10.",

The conflict with Sophie vacillating between youth and old age depending on her feelings toward Howl is a visual metaphor for one's state of mind. In the end, when she looks young but still has the silvered hair of old age, it represents a coming together of energy and wisdom.Like most modern Ghibli output, it mixes hand drawn and computer animation in a very subtle way, and has that distinct look and feel of wonderment that makes them very naturally enjoyable. The environment is a little blander than some of Miyazaki's other work but the Castle itself and some of the characters are imaginative as ever. Sophie is another in a long line of young female protagonists in Miyazaki films and Howl is another in the line of supporting male counterparts. Their relationship doesn't have the normal twists and turns you might expect, but that's part of what makes it interesting. The supporting cast is a little more broadly drawn but does well to serve the needs of the story and some comic relief. It wasn't the best thing he's done but still quite above average.",

            "content": "I just saw this movie yesterday and I haven't felt this way about an animated movie since \"Spirited Away\" (albeit the latter left me much more in awe than the former, since it was the first of its kind).This movie had many of Hayao Miyazaki's other movies' trademarks. Lush landscape, endearing characters, haunting soundtrack (courtesy of Joe Hisaishi), great attention to details and all the little quirks, which brings a smile to one's (mine, at least) face.Its been a while after \"Spirited Away\" was shown, and \"The Cat Returns\" has been rather disappointing, so I was really looking forward to it. And I am glad to say that although I felt that there weren't any breakthroughs in \"Howl's Moving Castle\" (HMC), it was on par with \"Spirited Away\" (SA) and \"Princess Mononoke\" and it was most certainly satisfying.Spoilers!!!! However, there seemed to be many parallels (coincidence??) between HMC and SA, which seemed kind of bizarre since SA was an original story while HMC was adapted from a book by Diana Wynn Jones (I most certainly will be paying my neigbourhood bookstore for it!).In HMC, Howl made a deal with Calcifer and it was up to Sophie to find out and help break the enchantment that held them both since they can't tell anyone what it is. On the other hand, Sophie herself was cursed to look like YuBaba (from SA) by the Witch of the Wastes and only Howl could help her, but she could not mention it to anyone else. In the process, she fell in love with Howl. What was revealed to us in the end was that Sophie actually witnessed the event where Howl and Calcifer met and signed the contract with each other, and told Howl to wait for her to help them break the enchantment.In HMC, there were also many interesting characters, most notable was the Scarecrow named Turnip and the dog (can't remember what its name is).In SA, Haku made a pact with YuBaba to become her disciple, in the process losing his true name and ended up being her henchman and doing all her dirty job. Chihiro stumbled into the enchanted world and had to become a servant in the land to save her parents through Haku's help. Haku helped her remember her real name. Along the way, Chihiro helped Haku remember his true name and he reveals to her that he once saved her when she was a child drowning in a river. They too fall in love.In SA, there was the child of YuBaba when he got turned into a fat rat (which has since spawned many soft toys) as well as the crows and the workers which helped Kamaji with the coal.Similarities aside, I enjoyed both movies. I've been a sucker for stuff like that since I was a child. I thoroughly enjoyed Neil Gaiman's \"Stardust\", which I think Hayao Miyazaki would make a fine adaption as well.Furthermore, in HMC, Miyazaki explored the idea of war (the 2 countries of the world were involved in a war), making HMC a tad darker than SA, showing the destruction and mayhem brought about by the fighting.All in all, this movie is the best full-length animated feature I have since in 4 years (since SA). It definitely has more heart and soul than any of the Disney and Pixar features. Whilst it is true that \"The Incredibles\" can dazzle one with the CGI and their American-centric wit while Shrek 2 entertained the masses with (by now dated) popular wisecracks, it is the eternal message of hope and love that will transcend time and technology, making HMC and SA timeless milestones.",

Except in Spirited away, they did a flawless job at intertwining their astonishing imagination and animation with great plot, character development and writing. Issues I noticed: Sophia fell in love with Howl so quickly and it didn't really feel very plausible, obviously she loved the magic he brought into her world but because of him she turned into an old lady and never really makes any effort at fixing the curse. It was very vague what would fix Sophie's curse and its never really explained why she would appear younger every now and then. Why was she so forgiving to the witch of waste, she literally almost ruined her life and Sophie's response is to add her to the family and say she loves her? ok. Kissing the scarecrow to free him was pretty clich\u00e9 not to mention how would the prince returning home suddenly stop the war? Logically it kind of falls apart in the end which is a real shame cos I straight up loved this movie from the start.",

            "content": "I think many people are complaining about Miyazake because his movies are starting to look alike and their plots are beginning to get very similar. I don't have problems with that. The elderly Sofi here looks a little like Yubaba in Spirited Away and Dola in Castle in the Sky. However, you can generalize that all anime women look alike with their huge eyes and we can even go racist and say all black people look alike to Asians and Asians look alike to Americans and Mexicans, Spaniards and Argentinians look alike to Asians.Miyazake is animating and he's doing what he knows best. His Nausicaa looks like they borrowed clothes from his TV series, Conan, Boy of the Future (and his son's upcoming film, Gedo Senki, looks like they borrowed production and costume designs from Nausicaa). I look at it this way, they are riffs of the same theme, similar yet different, and each riff is a gift for humanity and I have no cause for complaint. Miyazake has white hair and I would want him to work on forever but I'm going to break my heart over him one day so I'm grateful for every film he makes. He will never do less than his best anyway.Despite this apology for his work (which does not need excuses anyway), Howl's Moving Castle has many virtues that makes it stand out from Miyazake's body of outstanding films. The movie has a tender eye for the elderly. It's a better version of the tale told in the Freaky Friday movies and 18 Again, because it's really told by an old man.And again, Miyazake repeats his refusal to make true villains out of his characters. A villain at the start will appear again in a wilted, helpless form, then still later as a supplicant, then finally as a friend.By the end of the film, Miyazake, that old master, has made me half in love with Sofi myself, whether she's the old lady with creaking bones, or the young girl with severe, conservative clothes, or the old lady with quick thinking and lightning reflexes or the young girl with hair like starlight, she's a complex creation, golden hearted yet not maudlin, plain in looks yet beautiful whether young or old.",

Hoping to reverse the curse, Sophie searches out Lord Howl (Christian Bale*), a youthful but powerful sorcerer who lives in the titular castle with his assistant (Josh Hutcherson*) and Calcifer, a captured fire-demon (Billy Crystal*) who maintains the strangely anthropomorphic ambulatory fortress.

While the film is clearly a paean to pacifism (as director Hayao Miyazaki intended), the message does not overwhelm the film, which is amusing and entertaining. As others have noted, Howl, ostensibly the hero of the story, is somewhat morally ambiguous but Sophie (both young and old) is resourceful, resilient (she is very philosophical about having her youth and beauty stolen) and compassionate (as she cares for the witch, who has had her power stripped away). Marvelous. *voice in the English version",

The story is about a moving castle lived in by a wizard called Howl as kind of a way of escaping from the responsibility of serving in a war he doesn't believe in. A young girl becomes attached to the character after a spell from a witch makes her old and she goes into the castle. These and other characters are very likable and include a mute scarecrow, a talking fire that moves the castle and more. The animation is wonderful even though sometimes the story is hard to follow. It's also a romantic movie about the young character and Howl, although this doesn't really kick in til' near the end. The female character teaches Howl eventually about not avoiding responsibilities and he learns to deeply care for her. All in all, a very complex story that really is fun also. A winner from this heralded Japanese director.",

The spell by a spurned witch seems to have ironically turned the hero into a threatening woman-chaser, though, confusingly, as the spell progresses, and even more confusing when we travel to the past to see how he got enchanted, he becomes a peacemaker when the film suddenly changes to a war, causing him to fight off another physical transformation, like the demon-bitten hero of \"Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime),\" with a strong anti-war message.The witch has also cast a spell on the heroine, turning her into an old woman, and much of the delightful humor is from her struggling with her infirmities even as gray power triumphs, such as a scene when she and her nemesis compete to get up the royal stairs.Every inch of the screen is filled with a dazzling and quickly changing scene and climate and would make the sub-titled version a distraction. The English-language voices are mixed in effectiveness. Christian Bale is surprisingly bland with his Americanized accent, Emily Mortimer confusingly British as the young heroine. Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner are marvelous as mature witches, and Jean Simmons as old Sophie is both touching and humorous. Billy Crystal is way over the top as Calcifer the fire, but brings to mind his small role in \"The Princess Bride,\" and such sidekicks are usually done for broad humor.This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen in a theater so I don't know if the detail in his previous works is quite so breathtaking. It is charmingly set in a Jules Verne-period Victoriana where technology can coexist with magic, such as in flying machines. A complex townscape with streetcars is trumped by lovely scenes of snow falling and rain slowly soaking a dress.While the mother isn't dead as in most such films, just a bit pre-occupied, the occupants of the Castle re-create their own family, including caring for the apparently now senile witch -- wouldn't it be nice if we could all just add another bathroom to our houses.The music is fairly corny, so the long patches of silence are a relief.I don't know why this has been mostly distributed through art houses as children in the wider world of multiplexes would enjoy it, even if the story is a bit complicated and confusing.",

The first time to memorise the different themes in this film, i.e. curses and preparation. The second time to really understand what all this is about. And the third time to become emotionally involved.\"Spirited Away\" is by comparison pretty straight, this film is a little overcrowded. If this would be a Wagner opera, then it'd be \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\". But I like this film more, it only shares its complexity and the corniness of its love theme with that opera. Speaking of music, that's quite a job on this one. From second Vienna school \u00e0 la Berg over cosmopolitan \u00e0 la Korngold to Vienna operetta \u00e0 la Strauss, a fitting counterpart to the visual amalgamation of European architectures and machinery presented in this film.It's an indifferent could have been land, mixing German, French and English influences, located for most of its aspects around 1900. There is one major deviation from this setting, namely the battle ships, which are a clear WW II reference. In WW I it were the soldiers themselves who had to face the unspeakable, not the civilians.Now, the film is about love. It makes a vital point. That \"Mut und Willenskraft\" are necessary to steer your course in life, but that you are facing a double challenge, not only to be brave and determined, but also to use your virtue for the right purpose in a world that is specialised in harvesting inexperienced young men for any kind of purpose. It might be for sexual consumption, like the Witch of the Waste is doing it. Or it might be to channel their strength into inhumane efforts, like Lady Suliman does.The film tells in fact many such stories, stories about people that subscribed their force to aims that make them both unfree and inhumane. And it tells stories about the tasks those face who want to rise to the occasion of their own lives.It is a wonderful film. Poetical, rich, true.

I wasn't as impressed with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and have yet to see any of his other feature films. But this one, however, has great characters, a sense of humor, a unique plot, and would have been perfect in my book had it not been for a the sappy ending in which everything is easily and predictability resolved Walt Disney style. This being the same unfortunate state that marred another one of my favorites, Garden State.'Howl's Moving Castle' refers to just that, a floating contraption which looks like an island conglomeration of houses and trees which move around on robotic legs and emit plenty of pollution. Our main character is not actually Howl, but a young girl who befriends Howl, but through a curse, is turned into an old woman. Trying to figure out how to restore herself, she finds work in the Moving Castle as a maid where she befriends it's few residents--a young boy, a ball of fire (or rather, the igniting soul of a fire, and the mysterious Howl. In the meantime, she likewise becomes involved with Howl's participation in an ongoing war. The plot by this point becomes slightly complicated to explain without giving too much away only because several other characters enter the story, imposing a few more subplots.The beauty of this film is, unlike other animated features, not wonderful by any means for the animated style. For the most part, if you've seen one Japanimated cartoon these days, you've seen them all in their inglorious, standardized form. And perhaps, this is where Hayao Miyazaki and his film-making team should experiment with new styles and approaches. Instead, the beauty of the film, at least for me, is largely due to such a unique and engaging story. I am normally not a fan of this genre, but I really enjoyed this particular one.",

Yes, I agree that quite a few of the ideas have been used before - but not in the same context. I disagree that the faceless ink-like servants are anything like 'Null-Face' from Chihiro, and the overall feel of the movie is very different. The Ghibli trademark of beautiful landscapes is here in large amounts, some of them will make your eyes water with longing for being there, making the images of war even more gruesome.Some parts of the movie may seem confusing to children and adults alike. It's a bit like a good poem: You might not understand it entirely, but it feels right. Leave daytime logic at the doorstep, this is a fantasy made from images of your childhood dreams and with the same surreal logic.The war in 'Howl's Moving Castle' is largely unexplained. It is simply going on, killing and destroying. Had this been a Disney movie, we would have known the reason for it and probably even sympathized. Here it is only hinted at, which may seem confusing. But it is entirely on purpose: War IS meaningless, absurd, unnecessary, if you ask Miyazaki. If you want straightforward action, good and evil easily distinguished and distilled into separate characters, skip this one. Skip any of Miyazaki's movies. Good and evil are present in all his characters. There is no villain to hate, apart from war and greed itself which always ruin people in Miyazaki's world. But oh, what a world that is.",

            "content": "Director Hayao Miyazaki has always given more than simple animated films. With deep roots in the fantasy genre, his stories go beyond the concept of fable and become epic stories of love, drama and comedy thanks to his highly developed writing style and his multidimensional characters. \"Hauru no Ugoku Shiro\" or \"Howl's Moving Castle\", is a film that serves as very good example of Miyazaki's style; it contains the epic fantasy elements he has constantly developed since his debut in 1984 with Kaze no Tani no Naushika (Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds) and also contains the light-hearted comedy of efforts like \"Majo no Takky\u00fbbin\" (Kiki's Delivery Service) of 1989.The movie is set in a fantasy version of Europe where magic and technology coexist. Sophie is a young girl in a small town of a nation on the verge of war; she is very mature and responsible but is also very shy and unconfident. One night she is visited by the Witch of Watse, and transformed into an old woman. Since the curse forbids her to speak about the curse itself, she decides to go and find a way to return to her real age by herself, but in her quest she ends up in the fabled Moving Castle of the legendary wizard Howl, who is said to be a cruel ruthless monster. She will discover that Howl is very different than what legends say.Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Miyazaki completely makes the story his own while still retaining the story's core plot. This in no ways means that the adaptation is not good, it just means it is different. As usual, Miyazaki focuses in his favorite themes of love, redemption and catharsis and gives the story his touch. The humane traits of the characters makes them multidimensional and like in the rest of his work, there is no clear good and evil, only complex relations between characters.As I wrote above, the film feels like a summary of Mizayaki's previous work and it is probably the movie that most clearly defines the director's style and philosophy. The classical elements of epic quests are present but are mixed with elements of romance and comedy that never feel out of place. Miyazaki mixes genres perfectly and gives the movie an unnatural charm that can only be described as magic.Of course, the animation is top-notch like Studio Ghibli usually does. The beautiful landscapes inspired by European towns and cities make a great contrast with the advanced technology and the visually stunning magic of this fantastic world. The Moving Castle, a walking metal behemoth, is at the same time imposing and strangely beautiful. There is no scene in the movie that is not either beautiful, mesmerizing or both. The animation by itself is a work of art.The characters are very well defined and are very likable. It is easy to identify with them thanks to the very well-written script. The detailed emotions the characters have go beyond simple plot points, and it was great to see so complex characters come to life in an animated film. I have not heard the English dubbing, but I must say that the Japanese one truly captured the feeling of the characters and as usual in Ghibli, the cast was up to the challenge.\"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a very enjoyable film that displays Miyazaki's style at its best. It is a great film not only for kids or fans of Japanese animation, but for the general audience. Very few films these days capture this kind of magic, and I must add that \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is not only among Hayao Miyazaki's best works, it is one of the best films of the last years. 10/10",

Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the film takes the basic premise of the story and takes it into a new direction.The basic story is this: 18-year-old Sophie is a hatter who believes she is an ordinary nobody. But when the witch of the waste curses her to be trapped in the form of a 90-year-old woman, Sophie must go on a grand adventure to find a way to break the curse. Along the way she meets a strange cast of characters including the living scarecrow affectionately dubbed \"Turnip Head\", a wisecracking fire demon, and a mysterious and tragic wizard named Howl.Fans of the book will realize right away that Miyazaki takes great liberties with the source material. While I found this fine, (as the film weaves the tale in a splendid fashion) I did wish that perhaps he had titled the movie differently and added \"Based on Howls Moving Castle\" as the film is more a taking of the IDEA of the book and using it to form a story, than a faithful adaptation of the novel. However, the changes Miyazaki makes works for the film brilliantly, and I have found I like the movie and the book equally.A tale full of magic, romance, excitement, and wonder, this is a highly recommended film for lovers of fairy tales and mythology, as well as Miyazaki fans.

A recent Film Four retrospective on the work of Miyazaki and the famed Studio Ghibli has given me the opportunity to reacquaint myself with some of his earlier works, which has really been great preparation for readying myself for a second helping of this!!Howl's Moving Castle is loosely based on the well-known book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, with Miyazaki and his collaborators opening up and elaborating on the text in order to incorporate many of the more recognisable Studio Ghibli trademarks. So, whereas the book once focused more clearly on the character of Howl, a wizard of dubious reputation, Miyazaki puts more emphasis on the character of Sofi, a heroine in the classic Studio Ghibli tradition. As the story unfolds the changes in the text point back to that earlier Miyazaki classic Porco Rosso, with the film continuing the idea of a character transformed by a curse (in this case, the young Sofi is cursed into the body of an old hag), seeking redemption in a anachronistic universe sometime during the First World War, that is overrun with flying machines, magical potions and other such Ghibli-like touches, such as fire demons, witchcraft and supernatural underworlds.As with Porco Rosso, the film's setting and the use of iconography suggest deeper themes that most children probably won't pick up on, meaning that this is very much a film to be cherished by adults and adolescents too!! As with all Miyazaki's work, the animation is astounding, here advancing on the lush visuals of previous film Spirited Away to create perhaps the most jaw-dropping animated film ever made (though Mamuro Oshii's Ghost in the Shell 2 and Katsuhiro Otomo's Steamboy are both serious contenders). The colours are rich and vivid throughout, whilst the attention to even the most minute of period detail is impeccable, all adding to that sweeping Miyazaki grace, his feel for characters and his deft understanding of how to construct a sequence (both in terms of action and drama... making the film both magical and plausible in equal measures!!).Howl's Moving Castle might be a little too obscure and sober for some viewers, especially when compared to some of Miyazaki's more celebrated works, such as My Neighbour Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, however, some perseverance reveals it to be every bit as memorable and beautiful as those two films, whilst the subtle references to early Miyazaki works like The Castle of Cagliostro and Laputa - Castle In The Sky make it an integral and equally magical entry into the Ghibli/Miyazaki canon.",

Sophie and Howl fall in love.It's hard to describe this animated film. It's mysterious. You can never really get your bearings with this movie. The moving castle is an amazing invention. It's completely unlike American animated Disney films. The director/animator Hayao Miyazaki is considered a Japanese master and his films are so highly regarded the Disney company is involved in getting them released in the West. The plot is a curious blend of fantasy and reality. There is definitely a strong anti-war message in the film.Hayao Miyazaki also did the recent Spirited Away which was released a few years ago in the US.",

            "content": "I saw the commercial for the movie a few days before the premiere and it just grabbed me - I had to go see it. Howl's Moving Castle is pure magic.First, it has an entertaining and charming storyline, but not something that I would consider deep. That's okay though because I didn't go in expecting to find a profound message hidden in there somewhere. There's plenty of humor, including commentary on old age that even my mother chuckled at. Secondly, the animation is amazing. The settings, the people, the vehicles - all are detailed and interesting. I'm told there is 3-D sneaked into it as well and I didn't see anything painfully obvious so bravo on incorporating it successfully.I said it makes me feel like a kid because it didn't rely on logic. I mean, it has a castle that walks on little stick legs and looks like a pile of junk held together with who-knows-what. But the sheer weirdness of it fit the movie. I didn't once sit there and try to puzzle out how it could move - I accepted its ability to walk. I think we too often expect something as illogical as magic to work by rules.Not that there weren't things that couldn't be improved upon. The characters were a bit flat: they didn't really develop a great deal as time went on, but again this wasn't a deep movie. Bale's voice for Howl might not have been the best choice as it sounded a bit too deep and forceful for the slender wizard. The rest of the character voices were more or less fine. Jean Simmons did a great job and Billy Crystal's always good with the funny lines. The ending was a bit rushed as if they realized they only had a couple of minutes to wrap things up so a few things happened so quickly that they seemed more like an afterthought.All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I was really happy to see it and come out with the feeling that magic still does exist somewhere out there.",

In the real world during World War II, wars raged and the situation was turbulent, and the people were forced into a brutal war without help. However, Miyazaki sketched such a castle: it has doors leading to various places to avoid the flames of war and go to the peaceful countryside; it is powered by talking fires and has fairytale colors; it is transformed from industrial scrap Cheng, ugly and clumsy and some love. Its interior is so incompatible with World War II, and the outside is confusingly chaotic. It is the reflection of the people of World War II and the choice to avoid and join the world.The pacifism and humanitarian spirit are the core contents implied in every movie of Mr. Gong Lao, and are passed on to the next generation of young people in the world through cartoons. Hayao Miyazaki is a film worker who deserves admiration. The humanities and social feelings of his life are put into film",

Sophie gets a spell on her by the Witch of the Waste and enters as an old lady Howl's moving castle hoping to make it undone. What follows is an incredible imaginative story where real and fantasy elements mix to create a movie universe where literally anything can happen.The castle / house has one door that can lead to any of four worlds. One is the ordinary world, where Sophie comes from, to make clear that ordinary people suffer from war as they lead their lives. The second leads to a capital city (London?), where power is exercised and war decisions are made by a king. The king is also under a kind of 'spell' as his power is almost taken over by the witch Madam Sulliman, deciding on war and peace (her loyal dog follows Sophie by the way). The way up to the top is long and steep, as there is also a large distance between ordinary citizens and the king, between not having power and having power.The third world is the world of magic and fantasy, only entered by Howl through the black state. As there is also war in this world, i.e. between good and bad, this is a mirror of the war in the real world. The last world is of peace and quiet, but only shows landscapes and almost no people in it, it can both stand for a post-apocalyptic world or for heaven. All these worlds and their boundaries are not strictly defined; a certain world often assimilates into any of the other worlds.As Howl starts winning the peace, Sophie grows younger again, the whole aging process an indication of the suffering of people under war. But Howl pays an increasing high price for his war involvement, as he starts having black feathers. Besides space shifting in the story, time shifting is also used; Howl is at the end under a spell after his battles and only saved much later by Sophie. Calcifer is Howl's heart and soul, therefore almost dead due to his war actions in the fantasy world; even his masterpiece the castle is falling apart as a result of that. The Witch of the Waste meanwhile, is turned into a friendly grandma, indicating she was used by the powers in the fantasy world like a politician or a soldier would be in the real world.The animation is traditional, as always from Ghibli. Most viewers think computer animation is not used at all here, but there is some limited use. The pacing is somewhat slow, its war story is interesting but not that compelling, so we have to rely on Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination to keep us involved.One advice: if you can see this in its original (Japanese) version.",

In fact, it's his worst since the embarrassingly contrived Kiki's Delivery Service.It seems to me that the strange mess of Howl's Moving Castle confirms there is a theoretical pattern that Miyazaki does his best when he creates original stories inspired by the fantastic works of European & Asian literature and turn out fantastic animated films and manga, but his skills do not translate well in the attempted adaptation of previous published works.Don't get me wrong; I have a great deal of admiration for Mr. Miyazaki. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind comic book series is a worthy companion piece to C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien's famous epic literacy works. He has an incredibly imaginary mind with the penchant for telling outlandish stories reminiscent of Aesop and Hans Christian Anderson. That's the only positive compliment I have for Howl's Moving Castle in spite of its mind-bendingly glaring story and character development flaws.The story as written by Mr. Miyazaki (I watched the Japanese version with English subtitles instead of awful-sounding English dub) starts all right. . .then it became a confounding mess leading to the bizarre ending that feels rushed as though the production schedule had to be fulfilled on time in time for a projected theatrical release. Tim Burton's horrible 2001 re-make of Planet of the Apes suffered the same \"rushed production\" effect and this lesson remains unlearned.A further production delay with Miyazaki's storyboard revision to iron out the problems might have improved the ending and clarify some plot points and character development to keep the story consistent, but that wasn't the option. Studio Ghibli and its subcontractors came close to missing the production deadline for Spirited Away (as tensely explained in a documentary as an extra on Region 1 DVD) but miraculously turned out a masterpiece right on schedule.So Howl's Moving Castle, however visually pleasant, falters in the second and third act in terms of marginal storytelling. The film resorts to Miyazaki's scenarios that border on the incomprehensibly bizarre towards the closing. Not to mention the fact the movie carry the sledgehammer approach to delivering the main theme. It's better to be subliminal than to be so screeningly obvious it becomes annoying that may inspire \"who cares?\" apathy at the end when the two-hour ordeal is over.I get the point, Studio Ghibli. Try to be coherent and subtle in the next Miyazaki production, please.The last third of the movie embodies the term \"deus ex machina\". Look the phrase up in a dictionary. That's why the movie is an abominable mess that render the plot incomprehensible that rely on overactive imagination to move the movie along to unsustainable and unnecessarily overlong length. The Neverending Story this movie ain't. It probably isn't faithful to the source material, either.* out of four, courtesy of a very disappointed Miyazaki fan.",

And yet, I usually find myself remarkably surprised and, in the end, both moved and thoroughly entertained. This happened when I watched both Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. There's a very unique feel to the films by Miyazaki and it's immediately foreign, yet after a little time, I find it tugging at my soul in surprising ways.Howl's Moving Castle is about a young girl named Sophi, who gets turned into a 90-year old woman by a curse and ends up living with a wizard that she has a crush on. And some stuff happens afterward.Immediately striking is the visual style of the film, which is in the same fantastic and imaginative vein as other films produced by Studio Ghibli. The central theme of love, although often ambiguous, is quite potent, although not as nuanced as the portrayal of maturity and hope found in Spirited Away. Nevertheless, the story, which cannot be described without throwing spoilers everywhere is wonderful and whimsical, but maintains all the coherence necessary for a western audience to understand it.And, there's precious little more that I can say about this film, other than that it's great and I highly recommend it. It's a beautiful little film about love. Also, the professional American voice talent recruited for this film are far competent for their tasks and Billy Crystal in particular is surprisingly suited for the voice of the fire demon, Calcifur. Great voice ensembles like these put the amateurs that voice dubbed anime television programs to great shame (the 6 people that do all the voices, that is).I love it. 9/10.",

Movie suffers a bit from being thematically all over the place, from \"age is a state of mind\" to \"make the best of the hand you're dealt\" to a general distrust of power to what eventually becomes a kind of antiwar message. On the other hand, there is an utterly fantastic moment toward the end of the picture (where Sophie stumbles through a door and sees the young Howl make a bargain with the demon) which sent a real chill up my spine: it's the kind of thing you go to the movies to see.

            "content": "I went to see Miyazaki's newest work \"Howl's Moving Castle\" with some minor trepidation. This was not a pet project for him from the start so I had reservations as to whether it would be able to match the visual mastery of his earlier works. I was delighted to find out that Miyazaki delivered a film that has become an instant favorite with me.Being a Miayzaki enthusiast, I have seen all of the master's feature length directorial efforts. \"Howl's Moving Castle\" now only trails \"My Neightbour Totoro\" as my favorite Miyazaki work. What works for me the most in this film is that Miyzaki was able to join together the best of his early and later film-making traits into a brilliant baroque work of art. \"Howl's Moving Castle\" possesses the innocence and quiet beauty of his earlier films and the haunting, darker, more brooding excellence of \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"Spirited Away\".As with \"Mononoke\" and \"Nausicaa\", \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a deviation of a previous Miyazaki film. It is, in many ways, reminiscent to Laputa: Castle In The Sky when one considers elements such as Howl's castle paralleled with the castle of Laputa, the central theme of war and the multidimensional villains (or are they? Consider how Miyazaki's characters are rarely purely evil, as there are layers of goodness in all of them).There is a scene in this film that had me in awe and made me realize that I was witnessing a masterpiece within a masterpiece. It is delightfully underplayed. When Howl sends old Sophie to see madame Suliman she winds up climbing a dreadfully long set of stairs with the witch of the waste on the way to Suliman's castle. I was astounded with Miyazaki's craftsmanship here. First of all, the visuals are astounding and and humorously over-the-top. Miyazaki wickedly underscores the age of Sophie and the obesity of the witch of the west to bring out the humanity of both of these characters, their weaknesses in particular. Miyazaki is also very consistently patient here - one would expect in a Disney movie for the director to simply cut from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the stairs as the characters come to the entrance but he lets the viewer in on this amusing experience. There are nice subtle touches here like Suliman's dog who is carried by Sophie to make the experience even more strenuous for her. Miyazaki also goes to great lengths to show Sophie's kindness - this first becomes evident on the stairs when she is surprisingly sympathetic to the witch, developing into a central themes of the film - the theme of kindness, forgiveness and understanding.These characters are multidimensional, they have human traits and allow the viewer to identify. Miyazaki's approach is the complete polar opposite to that of American animators who worked on cartoons like the roadrunner and the coyote or Bugs Bunny. These characters are mortal - they feel pain, they feel joy and sadness and we are in on this to experience these feelings as well. Miyazaki never cheats the audience with pop culture references or token characters - there is warmth and touching humanity even in the most cunning personages. This is missing today in works by studios such as Disney where we expect characters to be immortal, even in the most violent sequences. Miyazaki borrows more from Russian animation - works like \"Hedgehog in the Fog\" and \"The Snow Queen\" - to make these characters absorbing and devoid of clich\u00e9s.\"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a film for all ages, moreso than his previous two efforts which seemed to cater to adults, I would say. This film's humour, I felt, was much sharper than in \"Spirited Away\", bringing back Miyazaki's patented light-hearted silliness of \"Porco Rosso\" and \"Kiki's Delivery Service\". I felt that I had to have been missing something in the character of Howl (as I saw the dubbed version into English) - he is serious, tragic yet also surprisingly goofy, especially in his obsession over his looks, specifically his hair. I am looking forward to seeing this with subtitles so I can admire the Japanese voicework to see if Christian Bale's dubbing was appropriate.I cannot recommend this masterpiece enough. If this is Miyazaki's swan song it could not be more appropriate.4/4",

There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie.

            "content": "Love at first sight and love slowlyIt was clear that Sophie had fallen in love with Hal at first sight: from the time he put his arm around her to rescue her, to the time he took her for a walk in the air, to the time she talked absentmindedly to her sister, to the time she drove home and stared into the distance, it was a sign that she was secretly in love with Hal. In fact, for the life of the ordinary Sophie, how to refuse the magnificent as a prince Hal? (smile)On the other hand, Hal's good looks are definitely not lacking for girls, but it is Sophie who can finally understand Hal's weakness and give him courage and support. So Sophie gradually wins Hal's love in her relationship with him.2. Sophie's transformationFor Sophie, who had been dressing in grey and blue for years and making hats in front of the window, duty and obedience were the themes of her life, a life that hid her inner glory and made her live like a grey mouse, looking in the mirror and desponding even herself.The situation is broken when Sophie is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the badlands witch. Because Sophie could no longer stay in the hat shop, she finally had a reason to escape from the arrangement of life. Sophie said: the good thing about being old is that you have nothing to fear and nothing to worry about losing.\nI prefer Sophie as she grows older, because Sophie's mother-in-law is lovely, has a personality, aggressive, and compassionate.In one scene, Hal throws a tantrum over dyeing his hair. 'what's the point of being alive if you're not pretty,' he says. Sophie was angry: I've never been pretty! Then he went out the door and cried. It's an amazing transformation: as soon as Sophie becomes a mother-in-law, her previously repressed inner feelings begin to release and her bright spots come out.The opposite loverSophie represents the person who has no outward appearance but an inner abundance. (a mother-in-law's appearance is bad enough, but the clean crazy witch is actually pretty cute.) Hal, on the other hand, represents a man who looks gorgeous but feels empty and timid. It was dramatic that the two men fell in love.Love is growing up togetherSophie and Hal turned out to be evasive people. Hal avoids facing his inner weakness, while Sophie avoids fighting for her right to live. The witch's persecution of the wasteland brought them together and gave them courage and hope for love. Finally, Sophie no longer felt inferior, and Hal no longer covered his heart with vanity.5, magic,Miyazaki hayao like magic, as big friends keyang like machinery. The person who loves magic represents a state of being: a strong desire to achieve the dream of the heart. Because magic means strong faith. And love is the catalyst to activate this belief.6. The world is oneIn the original, the conflict between people is obvious, and the wasteland witch finally gets the destruction. And in the movie, there are no really hateful characters. Saliman, the wasteland witch, as the villain, also has a kind and lovely place. This shows that miyazaki hayao's world view is getting wider and wider. There is no absolute good or bad in the world.Hal's moving castle is easy in general. And plain truth is always in simplicity. I think miyazaki has returned to his roots. Life, itself is used to romance.",

However, I found Howls Moving Castle enchanting with some excellent characters and ideas - the animation is beautiful as is the scenery (some of it being classic Miyazaki, ie lush green landscapes, gently drifting clouds and the the sounds of nature). Without hesitation I'd put Howl above Princess Mononoke, although it's not quite as good as the superlative My Neighbour Totoro and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.Go see Howl - even if you don't like it as much as Miyazaki's other works then you'll certainly see something thought-provoking and imaginative.",

I love fantasy movies, I love Studio Ghibli (usually), but this was just taking the mick - great animation ruined by an incoherent story; it just made no sense at all. If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought this was done by Hayao's son - who's take on the Tales of Earthsea was also absolutely horrendous (see my review for that movie), in fact Howl's is just as bad. Studio Ghibli has had some really great hits, but they've also got a good chunk of misfires, and when they do, you really know - you get that sinking feeling, you're bored, you don't know what's going on, and everything seems to happen randomly.",

            "content": "Director Hayao Miyazaki took Diana Wynne Jones's novel as a basis for his follow-up to Oscar-winner Spirited Away (2001), but adds in his own overriding themes - man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight. The natural world is beautifully represented as in his previous films, with some absolutely breathtaking mountain and lakeside landscapes. The finest creation of the film, though, is the Castle itself, a cross between Baba Yaga's hut, a Heath Robinson contraption, and one of Terry Gilliam's strange hybrid hens from Monty Python's Flying Circus. The film won a clutch of awards in Japan and overseas, including an Oscar nomination. Howl's Moving Castle is essentially a love story. Talk of magic being used to shield palaces while innocent villages are bombed clues viewers into the deliberate parallels being drawn with the Gulf War of 2003, a conflict that enraged the pacifist Miyazaki during the film's production. If there's one criticism, it's that the overly neat happy ending feels like a cheat after the previous seriousness of the war strand of the story. Yet it remains a complex, rewarding film graced with the acutely observed, colourful and imaginative artwork that is the hallmark of Japan's greatest living national treasure of animation.",

            "review_title": "Great imagery but poor story",
            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a well know Japanese director for producing some of the best 2D animation films since the old school Disney ones. His vision is always extraordinary and inventive, and this trademark is continued in Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately though it is not as good as his previous film Spirited Away, which is a lot better. This could be because at least Spirited Away had a story that you can grasp onto. Howl's Moving Castle doesn't have much of a plot to really hook you in, and I found myself floating in and out of the film due to this problem.The story follows a young girl called Sophie, who is rescued by some obnoxious guards by the notorious wizard Howl (Bale). This moment is watched by the Witch of the Waste (Bascall) who, when Sophie is alone, casts a spell on her out of jealousy, turning Sophie into an old woman. After this change Sophie, who is now known as Grandma Sophie (Simmons), heads up the mountain in search of Howl, in the hope that he can reverse the spell. When she finds his home, which is a giant misshaped castle made out of unshaped metal pieces on legs, she enters it to find a young wizard learning from Howl, and a talking fire call Calcifer. When Howl returns to his home she tells him she is the new housekeeper, and decides to befriend Howl before asking for his help. Whilst she cleans for him she mixes up his box of magic, causing him to lose his power. At this Sophie must go and visit his former mentor, Madame Suliman (Danner), to gain back his power and this visit causes the Madame into uproar and she declares war between two worlds, with Howl seeming to be one of the only ones who can defend it. From here the truth about Howl's magic powers come to the surface, and we find out that he may not be all that he seems. Will Sophie be able to ever go back to her former self?The synopsis above is rather vague as the story of Howl's Moving Castle is also very vague. It is slightly difficult to follow and doesn't really make much sense. These animated Japanese films, directed by Miyazaki, are often about magic, potions, and objects that are not of this world, but usually we can buy into them easier then what this film allows us to. The characters aren't as well developed as well as they are in Spirited Away and this helps less in enjoying the story.Half of this problem though could be down to me. This sort of film isn't particularly to my liking, Spirited Away was a slight exception, and due to this I find my mind wandering throughout and not really concentrating on the film. Reading other opinions on the film, I do see that I am not the only one who struggled to really grasp the plot, but I do seem to be the only one that isn't a huge fan of these movies. They can be good just this one wasn't particularly.I watched the English version of this film, which is why I have credited English actors above. I have been told that the Japanese speaking version is better as some of the dialogue is lost in translation and the Japanese voices are much more enthusiastic. The voices in English are typical of the actor and little emotion seems to be involved, that is other than Billy Crystal as Calcifer who steals the show. Christian Bale doesn't strain his voice, and is so much like him that the minute he spoke I knew it was someone I had heard before. It took me a few minutes to realise and again this was a few minutes that I spent not really indulging in the film. I do prefer a good animation when the voices aren't obvious of the actor.All in all it isn't the best Japanese animated film. Some of the imagery is beautiful and the moving castle is very imaginative indeed. However this is nowhere near as good as Spirited Away and if you feel the need to watch a Japanese animated movie, I suggest you rent that instead.2 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I caught this wonderfully animated family film when browsing Independent Film Channel (IFC) on cable TV in 2009. IFC claims all the films they shown are uncut. I had no preconceived ideas about the film, never heard of it before hand, and was not familiar with director Miyazaki or his previous work. So my review is based on how I felt about the movie, not how it stacks up against classics or film technique.Although I am an elder adult and watched it alone, not with my grandchild, I found it engrossing and enjoyable. (Although it is as suitable for young viewers as \"Snow White\" and \"Sleeping Beauty.\") The story, an anti-war fantasy or fairy tale, was original and unpredictable, which I like. The wizard Howl (who turns out to be the main male character of the film) says at one point something to the effect of \"The problem with a war between rulers is that the bombs fall on the innocent civilians.\" The villains turn out to be complex, not just pure evil, and sometimes not evil at all. The scenery and costumes are done as a period piece, sort of Victorian era Europe. Even if just viewed as a series of still paintings with no story they would still be interesting to look at.In keeping with the imaginative story, I think with some imagination they could have come up with a more romantic English title than \"Howl's Moving Castle.\" The moving castle certainly is interesting and plays a huge role in the story, but I would have liked something that suggests a struggle between wizards, a struggle over love and hate, and a struggle over war and peace.",

            "content": "A film truly filled to the brim with wonder. Howl's Moving Castle never ceases to surprise you with its imagination. No matter how far into the film you get, and no matter how certain you are that you have finally seen everything, the film just keeps on giving.Although Howl's Moving Castle isn't quite as good as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is still a wondrous and gorgeous movie. Indeed, it is just as spectacular visually as the other two films.\nHowever, where it lacks a little, is in the story. Ultimately it ends up being a rather simple, yet pleasant story about the power and magic of love. It does tackle themes like the futility of war, as well as the difficulties we face as we age. What on paper sounds like a rather intricate but exciting draft for a story, ends up being simplified into a story of love.I certainly didn't mind the story, however comparing it with Miyazaki's other films, it leaves something to be desired. But, what Howl's Moving Castle lacks in story, it more than makes up for with its endless imagination. Even though I'm relatively used to the weird and wacky that fill these movies, this one just kept on surprising me.\nJust the castle alone is a spectacular showcase of the desire to think completely outside of the box and to do things that no one else has done. Add everything else that this movie has to offer and you're in for a magical ride.The thing that makes Miyazaki's films so great is the sense of wonder and adventure combined with beauty and emotion. In that regard Howl's Moving Castle is no different. I faintly remember seeing this in the cinema when it came out and the feeling of absolute astonishment I experienced. I was quite a bit younger then and I had never seen anything like it. And even still today, 16 years later, that same sense of astonishment fills me.While Howl's Moving Castle isn't as good as some of Miyazaki's other films, it certainly holds its ground. I have always struggled to not love these films because of how fearless they are in their vision and execution. While this film doesn't tackle with particularly heavy themes, it is endlessly entertaining and will fill you with joy.",

But this movie is so much more than pretty graphics-- the plot is interesting, the characters are complex, and the message strikes at the heart of a lot of what is wrong with this world today. A great deal of it has to do with the evils of war, but I especially loved the messages about true beauty and love that this film had to offer. It's been a long time since I've been teary-eyed at the theatre ^.^ Miyazaki also does a great job with the balance between reality, fantasy, and sci-fi, which is always a true pleasure to watch.

These people should watch the movie again, I'm sure they will notice the answers the second time.The story was so unusual it completely captivated me right from the beginning.Every bit as good as any of his other movies.If you love animation, take a break from the commercial works of Dream Works and Pixar (which are fine movies) and treat yourself to something different.

Nonetheless, I couldn't stop smiling until my brother came to pick us up. I especially like Christian Bale's voice as Howl, and his entrance was one of the best I've ever seen. The anime club at school agreed with my suggestion to watch it.It was incredibly refreshing to find out that the American adaption of Howl's Moving Castle did NOT rely on a boatload of famous actors to draw in an audience; as voice-acting is completely different from on-screen acting, casting celebrities in a Miyazaki film (most notably with Mononoke-Hime) is a mistake that will eventually detract from the impact of the movie. However, in Howl, the lack of easily-recognizable voices is both obvious and rather relieving, as I was more able to enjoy the movie without having to dwell upon any lackluster voice-acting, as I did with Princess Mononoke.EDIT: Since writing this comment, I have read Diana Wynne Jones' novel. There are quite a few differences, such as the scarecrow's relationship to Sophie, Howl's degree of self-centeredness, and an obvious mistake in translation for Markl/Michael's name.But in spite of the differences, Howl's Moving Castle is an incredible movie with an acceptable to enjoyable cast, fantastic art that is expected of Miyazaki, and a film that both adults and children alike will be able to enjoy.",

Frankly the latter film is significantly better, but received poorer IMDB ratings. Go figure ...As to the oodles of positive reviews? I'm at a loss. Anyhow, here are my technicals:STORY: While the setting is endearing, it's like old world meets new world. It would have been OK, but too many things happen out of nowhere, no lead up, no context, and we're just supposed to accept it. Characters appear with little, if no, explanation. Events just happen, with little context. You could argue that it's a simple story. No. It's messy, even for kids that aren't paying attention.ACTING: Well, for an anime, I guess OK.TEMPO: Seems reasonable, though things just \"happen.\"CINEMATOGRAPHY: On one hand they did a fantastic job with the visuals, and some of the audio. Unfortunately, this is the only highlight of the film.DIRECTING: I'm having trouble commenting on the directing outcome here, or whether it's true to the original writing, but needless to say ... it's a mess.Overall, I would not recommend this film.

It's just an intolerable style of animation framed with a so-so story. I keep expecting Speed Racer to come to the rescue.Sorry! Flame on!",

To describe it too much would be to spoil the fun; suffice to say, this is a film packed with incident and insight, with engaging characters and larger than life situations.This time around, it's an anti-war feature, with war providing the backdrop to the central tale. The character of the young girl who is transformed through witchcraft into an old woman is an intriguing one, and the titular castle is a superbly animated creation. I particularly liked the supporting characters in this film: Disney usually make the characters that support the protagonists irritating in the extreme, but here they're quite brilliant: the bounding scarecrow, the living fire, even the Witch of the Wastes.I find Ghibli films to be fairly hit or miss; some I love, but others like PRINCESS MONONOKE and SPIRITED AWAY are overrated in my mind.

The characters behave in frustratingly random and unexplained ways. The core plot points are half-baked. And the ending is truly terrible. As I neared the end of this overly long story, I was just wishing it would be over already, and when the end did come, it seemed as though the director was in just as much of a hurry for it to end as I was. The ending felt rushed and corny, with a good dose of deus ex machina which still failed to bring sense to the plot.Read the book - it's pretty good. But give this movie a miss.",

Sophie's voice was by C.Baisho. I think she's alright, when Sophie was old lady but when she was young girl her voice didn't meet the character (C.Baisho is I think in her late 50's or something like that). Over all, I enjoyed it very much. And I will watch few more times to understand his message. I didn't enjoy \"Sento-Chihiro no Kamikakushi\", but I think I liked this movie better in someways. Hopefully, he will produce more great movies in the future. I'm surprised to see that he didn't introduce great characters(Such as Totoro, Makkuro Kurosuke, Ji-Ji and etc). P.S.

We've seen quite a number lately from Hayao Miyazaki and others - but to my mind this is our favourite so far.The story is of a plain girl who is turned into an old maid by a witch who is in turn in love with a wizard called Howl. The girl goes to work for Howl in his 'moving castle' as a cleaning lady and meets and befriends various characters during her adventures. Her relationship develops with Howl against a backdrop of a futile war and her struggle to find her youth once more.There is so much visual imagination in this film that you find yourself hitting 'pause' a lot to take the scenery in. It deserves the time. Some vistas are barely on screen for more than a second - but will take your breath away.The voice overs are well done - but I particularly liked Lauren Bacall as the witch of the waste. The music is equally stunning - with a main theme you never tire of. All in all - superb.PS. If you liked this - then you should also check out 'Whisper of the Heart', and 'Laputa'.",

            "review_title": "Surprising Disappointment from Uncommonly Incompetent Miyazaki",
            "content": "For the first time I have seen a Miyazaki film I actively dislike.Howl's Moving Castle is one of the worst films I have ever seen, period, Miyazaki or otherwise. My reservations about it were totally founded, since Miyazaki does best when he doesn't do overt 'romance' (but then the 'romance' in this was a total joke) and does his own work. The novel upon which the film is based is an annoying clump of nonsense spouted by someone whose writing style is apparently to be as irritating as possible.Miyazaki's version, which takes some liberties with the source material, is just as sickeningly bad. Visually beautiful, it's incoherent plotwise and has some of the worst acting ever appearing in his films...thanks for casting the talentless Takuya Kimura (boy band singer) as the lead. His lacking, cardboard delivery was as weak as any English dub could be. The 'love' is forced and stupid, between two lame-duck characters who have about as much chemistry as a piece of lettuce and a cork. The ending is a shambles and cheapens the entire previous film, and the forced inclusion of an anti-war message actually manages to be insulting to those of us who are anti-war; it's embarrassing to watch it be handled in such an incongruous and outright embarrassing way in this film.The stupid, unsympathetic heroine for no real reason gets a curse put on her and stumbles into the realm of the vapid hero (if you can call him that; casting in-type for Takuya Kimura though), and boring hijinks ensue. There's no real reason for anything happening in the film, and you aren't moved to really care about the conflict between these countries, nothing of which is expanded upon in the excuse for a 'story'. Some things happen, people are introduced and subsequently forgotten about, and nobody any impact on the screen; perhaps it's because these were never Miyazaki's characters. They have no strength like his usually do. Their designs are utterly uninspired. Then in the last four minutes, everything gets tied up in the most unconvincing, stupid way that makes you feel like you just wasted two hours of your life waiting for it to happen. It's not made to be an experience like Totoro, it's supposed to be a direct sort of story...but it takes forever.Miyazaki could've...and should've...taken a few pages from his own book and drawn us into a conflict as in Nausicaa...a film where we could actually understand what was happening and actually care about the outcome, and why these people were fighting. Nausicaa, in the film, was a strong and sympathetic heroine entirely resolved in her convictions. Howl's heroine has little real conviction except what other people persuade her to have. She doesn't suit Miyazaki's usual style of youthful yet strong heroines. She was just some stupid girl on the screen, nothing more.Similarly, Howl was just a vain, inept 'wizard'. He wasn't sympathetic or likable, cute or endearing, he was just stupid and narcissistic and had no real redeeming qualities. Were we supposed to imagine he fell in love with Sophie or whatever her name was? Uh huh...what with all their powerful scenes together and such...if they had a single scene together that ever indicated anything even approaching so much as friendship until the last five seconds of the film, I missed it. The two had no chemistry and acted as two strangers who happened to be in the same general vicinity. Yet another stupid anime standard, the two characters who 'fall in love' because they just happen to be of the opposite gender and spend some time together in the same general area. Because, you know, nobody ever can spend time together with the opposite gender without falling in love, especially during a stressful period of conflict! For once, the supporting characters were just as vapid. There was not a single likable character in this film, nor did anyone stick in my memory as much as any other Miyazaki film. No bizarre and strange No-Face. No knight errant of Nausicaa. No gentle father of Totoro. There was no one even remotely distinct. It was irredeemable. And that is a shame, because something to which Miyazaki gives such effort should not be. It should be better, by its nature, than anything else put out at the time. Howl's deserves to be forgotten, and quickly. It's really pretty shameful that Miyazaki, in his zeal to make an anti-war statement, chose such a sloppy vehicle to tack it onto, and in such an indelicate way. Where is the subtlety we saw in his other movies, the beautiful message we could take to heart and understand, and love? Compared to a masterpiece like Nausicaa, Howl's Moving Castle looks like any other stereotypical shoddy anime joke. But it's not just a joke, it's a tragedy since it should have been good.I hope the low opinion of viewers both in Japan and abroad of this film will encourage Miyazaki, if he opts to make another film, to use his own story. Maybe next time, if he wants to make a statement, he can take his time and do something decent instead of embarrassing.I looked to Miyazaki's films to be different from most anime output, to be a refreshing and unique outlet for beauty, hope, optimism, strength, and lovely morals that are subtly communicated. This film was a joke by comparison. It stumbled through its clumsy storytelling from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet...don't! It's awful, and if you've seen any other of Miyazaki's work it will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. If you haven't seen any of his work, after seeing this you won't want to.We should never have to say 'I found your movie terrible'. He's better than that, or used to be anyway. I hope perhaps he will put out something decent before he retires as he's discussed many times.",

The characters have no real motivation for their actions, other than that its what the script told them. The continuity is *terrible* (I don't mean Sophie morphing randomly between old and young, I understand that, I mean, how come howl can fly at the start and at the end he can only fly when some weird bird thing). It loses the whole part of howl being cursed by the witch, you never know WHY calcifer makes his deal with howl, WHY the scarecrow is following Sophie, and what IS it with all the huge war vehicles with massive guns? This isn't dominion tank police - but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was.

I hadn't seen Spirited Away (though now I am motivated to go and rent it), but I had heard people raving and singing praises for Miyazaki's films. Also, I love manga art and to see a movie done in such an elegant style; made my mind up.From the moment the film started, I was enthralled. The music was so incredibly captivating, it swept you along with it and the choice of dialogue was just the right blend of serious, moving, heartwarming, and downright comical. I also have not read the original book this was based \"loosely\" on, so I basically went with a very open mind. On the whole, I really cannot fault this movie. In my opinion, it has something for *everyone*. Adults of all ages, teenagers, kids....I have no doubt that everyone can find something to enjoy in this movie and I would honestly be extremely surprised if anyone came out saying \"Wow...I HATED that!\" As I mentioned before, the music is incredible. It flows so beautifully, and the theme tune was been in my head ever since I walked out the cinema. It was also extremely refreshing to see a film that warms your heart, has no sex scenes or real gore (ie: blood spurting) or swearing and yet still manages to hold its audience in this day and age. *laughs* Just goes to show really. Another thing I really admired was the underlying moral and heartfelt issues throughout. The idea that everyone is beautiful no matter what their physical appearance and also the way the film dealt with the issue of war and the devastation it causes, really made me want to stand up and cheer.Christian Bale was awesome as Howl. His voice seemed to alternate throughout from confident Howl, to crushed and depressed Howl so easily and with such sophistication. I know it is an actor's job to portray different tones of voice but wow....Christian was beyond excellent. At several points, I really felt for Howl and at others, I felt like melting under the sound of such a velvet like voice. Personally, this is the best film I have seen for a long long time and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

Howl's Moving Castle is both an opulent feast for the eyes as well as a cleansing tale of good vs evil for the soul. But unlike in JRR Tolkien, where the line between good and bad is thick and easy to discern, in Howl's Moving Castle the good hearted characters can be threatening demons and the forces of ill will can be sympathetic figures of love and woe. It is distinctly non-Christian at it's core. I found this refreshing and frankly more like the inner workings of my own self, where the hero within must find the good and accept the bad in the same grasp. As far as art goes the film is stunning. I missed Miyazaki's wonderful relationship with food that was in Spirited Away (I loved how every character in that film was moved by tiny plates and giant piles of odd looking treats). This was missing in Howl's Moving Castle, replaced more by an obsession with architecture. But Miyazaki's brilliant mix of crumbling rot and bloom flowers was all there. Gorgeous vistas and quaint villages blend together with filth and decay so that they are all beautiful (as does good and evil blend so they are all as they should be). This is not my favorite of his films but it is an absolute must see for anyone who loves moving paintings and fairy tales bordering on the surreal.",

I'd even say that her character shows that we look how we feel. On one note the story is amazing, beautifully designed, and crafted perfectly, however, I feel as though the whole thing was too fast. As in, I couldn't fully grasp the whole picture. I can see how the fast pace can make the movie more intense and exciting, but it mostly made the movie slightly bad for me.I do recommend people watch this movie, because almost all of the Studio Ghibli movies are amazing. Some are very depressing like Grave of the Fireflies, but it was still a good movie.

I was disappointed that I'd missed about the first 20 minutes, but it didn't matter: The story immediately pulled me in, and as the story progressed, I was able to piece together what had gone before.Many other reviewers have written about the look and the content of the film, so I'll just note on how the movie made me FEEL: Howl's Moving Castle, like all the rest of Miyazaki's films, alternately evoked feelings of awe (I mean, the mouth hanging-open type), wonder, sorrow, and indescribable joy: His works are as much a labor of love as Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

            "content": "The more you've seen Miyazaki's films, there is a chance you'll less likely enjoy this movie. Why so? Because you can familiarize almost every single element from his previous works in Howl, which is actually quite strange. Before Howl his films were ALWAYS unique and new, when compared with the ones he had made before. But in Howl we can (at least subconsciously) easily compare those black liquid shades chasing Howl to Spirited Away's No-face and the whole ambiance stands somewhere between Kiki and Laputa. Not good.If you take all those before seen Miyazaki trademarks away, the entity of the movie is frankly said quite fragile; Mages used as part of the military machinery. I haven't read the book version of Howl, but for the movie part I can say, that it is a very traditional piece of Ghibli and also has a worn-out story. The original and thus powerful themes we saw in Mononoke and Spirited Away are gone now, and have been replaced with the used ones: war and love. So \"unmiyazakian\".Yet I'm quite sure that I would appreciate Howl a whole lot more, if it was the first Ghibli, and above all the first Miyazaki-manufactured movie I've had ever seen. The technical asset of Howl has been substantially improved and Hisaishi's score is once again a top-notch personal performance. The usage of 3D-imaginery has been increased, but the animation is still 99% hand-made, which I naturally appreciate. The characters have variable personalities and especially Witch of the Waste had something, that this movie truly needed.Maybe Mr. Miyazaki shouldn't have done a book adaptation in the first place, since his purely imaginative mind is meant for bigger things. Instead of \"loaning\" ideas from others, he should be the only source of inspiration, when preparing for his new project. I sure hope that Howl won't be Hayao Miyazaki's final depot in his long career, rather I want to see him leave the ring as a legend instead of a champion.Rating: ***\u00bd",

Later, at somewhere around ~40 min in it's running time, and starting to have some questions. Later on, i started to wonder - what the heck is going on in here. By the end i didn't care at all - just which it would end sooner, but this movie is SO long, way to long. I know that this is fantasy, but in director other movies stories were very interesting and intriguing, but this one lacks any credibility. By the end of this movie i had so many question why that or that happened, how and etc. But it would have had any sense, i would care.Overall, \"How's Moving Castle\" is amazingly looking and amazingly empty and not involving movie. The story is here is beyond any fantasy stories he ever made, there are no rules - everyone can fly or whatever.

Austria?) and there's this sorcerer, Howl, who wants to use his power to stop this war. Impressive, but not quite there. The fact that this subplot seems so weighty but weakly developed makes it ultimately look superfluous. So is Howl's obsession with beauty and the involvement of the Queen of the Dump. There's a lot of dazzle in the movie (walking and flying in the air, exploring Howl's past, Califer's powering the moving castle) like Spirited Away, but like Spirited Away, the film floats on too thin a plot to make it memorable like Miyazaki's previous works. And in fact, Spirited Away and Howl's moving Castle share a lot of common elements (a monster/animal/what-do-you-call-it turned human, which or who can fly, an ingenuous girl brought to a place full of magic, black-shadow like demons, etc) one constantly reminds the audience of the other.While still enjoyable on the whole, the lack of freshness of the storyline renders it an anime with a Miyazaki plot built on a different set.",

Christian Bale and Billy Crystal fit the parts perfectly and it's great to watch a movie that doesn't have overly popular voice actors like \"John Goodman\" or \"Robin Williams\". This movie appeals to kids as well as adults. I took my 3 year old daughter to see it and she was completely drawn into it. This movie has an intelligent sense of humor that makes you honestly want to laugh, and not some shallow \"slapstick\" humor. There is plenty of action and drama to be found as well. You will have your emotions going all over the place while watching this. At first I was skeptical about the idea of a \"moving castle\" as the title implies, but once you watch it, things will make sense and you wouldn't want the plot to be any other way. The directing/writing of this movie makes Tim Burton look like an amateur. Go see it! And if you can't find a theater nearby...then sorry about your luck! Write an angry letter to Disney or request it at your movie theater.",

I prefer the movie which I think does a wonderful job in taking some of the original ideas of the book and creating a new and wonderful story even if it doesn't follow the book.

Getting to experience one of Hayao Miyazaki's films on the big screen was just amazing. I love animation and I love seeing other worlds come to life. If you have an active imagination and love animation as much as I do, this is a movie that you have to see(I am avoiding saying anything about the movie so that you can fully experience it for yourself).

Just wish the DVD would be released sooner than Spring 2006 :(I identify with Sophie, she has a good heart and is beautiful, but doesn't know it. A selfless character anyone could appreciate.Loved the \"villains\" and the curses were so creative, so enriching for a fantastic setting, storyline, and those characters!Calcifur is lovable. Still curious about where Howl's apprentice came from and his story. The setting is marvellous. I share the sentiments about war expressed by the main characters.Exciting, romantic, pure enjoyment. It will leave you feeling satisfied as though you'd just been on an adventure of your own and it had an ending that made you feel complete. You can't help but truly feel for the characters. :-) Turnip Head was such a great idea. Oz has nothing on that guy. The castle will blow your mind. The character animation is enthralling, the backgrounds are idyllic. Excellent humanistic storyline! Every writer/director has something to learn from Hayao Miyazaki. If I could e-mail him I would praise him and tell him how his stories always have touched my heart.All in all, Howl could steal my heart any day.

Howl's land of witches and wizards, steam-powered societies and shadowy machinations, calls back to several preceding chapters in the Studio Ghibli catalog, while still standing firm as its own original story.The first hour is particularly good, setting the stage with the director's usual doses of playful imagination and enchanting personality. We've got magic doorways, talking flames, witches' curses, fantastic flying machines, ticker-tape military parades and, of course, gigantic palaces propelled by mechanical chicken legs. Ghibli always profits from these long establishing shots, having mastered the art of breathing life into a world and watching it blossom, and the opening act is stuffed with so much of it that I couldn't have wiped the smile from my lips if I'd tried.It falls into a bit of a rut after that, struggling to stretch an airy premise into something larger and more meaningful. There's depth to the story, but much of it remains unrevealed as the plot meanders and stumbles its way to a hazy finale. The animation is great, as expected, with colorful characters and alluring scenarios to spare, but Howl grows lost after that initial sheen wears off.",

This is THE most amazing movie I have -ever- seen, I repeat, -EVER-, and not just in a range of Miyazaki and anime movies, though Howl's Moving Castle has given me whiplash when bypassing Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke by a mile long-shot. This is the story of a young hatter named Sophie (Zofi) who is the oldest of two (three in the book) daughters and believes the fairytale rule of the-first-is-always-the-worst. On her way to visiting her sister Lettie she bumps into two drunken soldiers who flirt shamelessly. She is saved by a handsome young man, who takes her on a \"stroll through the sky\" while escaping from \"ravenous globs of black goo\". When she returns home she meets an obese, ugly lady-later known to be the Witch of the Waste-who curses her into turning into a 90-year-old-woman. The next morning Sophie leaves her home, attempting to get as far from the town as possible. And she ends up in the house belonging to said handsome young man: Howl (Hauru). If I say any more, you would be spoiled. I have seen this movie 5 times in theatres and plan to buy the DVD, rumored to be coming out in November.

            "content": "I just returned from seeing the Japanese version with English subs thanks to an International Film Festival and I have to say... Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli crew do not disappoint with this one. Whether you're a Miyazaki virgin or a devoted fan, this film is all-around excellent and I'm definitely planning on seeing it again. Perhaps the English version the next time around.One of the things that stood out for me the most was the sheer volume of references to his other movies that were included. Half the fun was picking out scenes and characters that echoed ones in Tonari no Totoro, Spirited Away... quite a few, really. The movie was laugh-out-loud funny all the way through (the whole theatre was in hysterics) and they did an excellent job of balancing the humor with the drama so that neither detracted from the other. There was one scene closer to the end that I was a bit confused on involving the castle, and one of the overarching plot themes involving a war seemed to be lacking motivation, but otherwise there weren't any plot nitpicks. I'm very interested in reading the book now--those who had read it seemed to think the movie adaptation was pretty faithful.Aside from the feeling that maybe Miyazaki should branch out from the 'young girl coming-of-age' story, I very much enjoyed the characters. The heroine, Sophie, is likable both as a teen and an elderly woman, and as with many of the other characters, it is interesting to see her character (both physically and mentally) change throughout the story. The dynamic characters definitely kept the pace moving and even seeming-villains could become likable in a matter of minutes without seeming forced. And for you anime fangirls out there... yes, Howl is a bish. A very likable one too, even as he's complaining about his constant need to be pretty. He's another very dynamic character and one that I enjoyed watching immensely.You must see the movie for yourself to really appreciate what Studio Ghibli has done this time around. Employing a visual style much closer to Spirited Away than to former works, their constant creativity is astounding. Howl's Moving Castle is a masterpiece that ties the family of Miyazaki movies together, yet stands on its own as a true work of art. Run, don't walk. And I mean it. I was wearing heels.",

The astounding animation fully brings to life the booming steampunk world that the director as created, from the smoggy Victorian streets, to the steam powered vehicles roaming the city, it's extremely aesthetically pleasing. It's themes are often light enough for children to enjoy but it does delve into some darker themes that will appeal to older viewers, and the entertainment factor is for all ages, it's a truly magical story with a great message, albeit with a rather overly mushy and sappy ending. Characters have always been a strong suit for the auteur, and while there are some similarities with these characters from other Miyazaki films, they still have their own personality and are never a clear copy of past characters, each bringing their own insight and humor to the story, they just follow a similar formula that strays away from being too familiar adding new set pieces (this one is action packed), twists and elements to make this a wholly original watch.",

Sophie is a girl who does things because she is expected to, not at all because she herself wishes to. When the Witch of the Waste turns her into a ninety year old woman, she immediately sets out to cure her curse. She chances upon Howl's moving castle, and after striking a deal with the fire demon Calcifer, she becomes the new cleaning lady. Fraught with adventure, wizardry politics (of a sort), and endearing romance this movie has everything.... I only wish it were longer. Or for several more just like it. If you haven't read Diana Wynne Jones' perfect fantasy novel, you should, and read it before you watch this film (if you can wait that long). It will help you in understanding the movie to it's full extent. I was at first afraid that Miss Jones' novel would be turned into something wholly unrecognizable, and without any of her original humor. But Miyazaki captured all of her characters beautiful, and was able to make a great movie, without losing any of the characters' original charm.***spoiler alert***My spoiler is for concerned parents, who might wish to know if anything could be considered objectionable for young viewers' eyes. I can name a few things at least. The battle scenes are not particularly horrendous or frightening, except for the black blobs that come after Sophie and the other characters. There are 'mad wizards' who have turned themselves into 'demons' for the war effort, and they attack Howl a few times. There is also a scene where Sophie has a vision/dream of Howl in a monster like form, and he has scary looking teeth. Madame Suliman is a strange 'head wizard' sort of person, who almost viciously destroys any wizards who stand in her own/or the war's way, and there is a scene in the film where she hypnotizes Howl and begins to turn him into a 'monster' so she can steal his magic and, as it appears this way, kill him. This scene in particular might be frightening for very young viewers.***end of spoiler***All in all, I did not find these things particularly frightening, and upon viewing the film yourselves, you might find it perfectly harmless. Nevertheless, I advice that you watch the film yourselves before showing it to your younger children. Older kids shouldn't have any problem with it at all.This movie deserves more then ten stars. And I think the Oscars should give more awards to animated films then just Best Animated Film. They should start doing best Director of an Animated Film, best voice acting in an animated film (male and female naturally), and best animated film soundtrack. If they did that, more people then just California would tune in to watch.All the voices were excellent, and the animation superb.From start to finish I felt it was exactly what I had hoped for and wished it could be.

The magic is richer and cleverer and darker and more compelling. The dream has burst into reality, the magic is not dreamy, but *awake*, wide awake and sizzling with wild delights, in the form of a castle that walks around on chicken legs with a fire-demon at its heart. It's every bit as good, the emotional tones are even more beautiful than in that other masterpiece of the unbridled childish imagination.My favourite scene is the flashback when Howl watches the falling star people fizzing across the sky to the high, clear, pale blue lake near his little house in the mountains, and catches one and starts talking to it. It lights up his face in the dark...You either love this sort of thing or you don't.And, better still, it has a *grown-up* fairy story, the story of a girl who must cast away her self-imposed prison of excessive common sense and dare to dream.Again the plot is meandering, but it's even less important in this than in Miyazaki's other movies. The last scene is a breath-taking and unashamedly primitive romantic confection. Just like Disney used to be...10 stars. 100 stars... 1,000 stars...",

I saw both versions of Hauru no ugoku shiro/Howl's Moving Castle and loved this lovely piece of animation.I've always been a fan of pacific rim animation and was exposed to it at an early age, at its early age. Some of the best characters and stories as a child and pre-teen came from many of these artists, so I am always interested in looking at recent animations and animes. If I were 6 again, I would love the heck out of Howl's Moving castle as I did those pieces of animation and anime. Even now that I am older, I think this is just a wonderful whimsy piece of animation.The images/the animation in this film are remarkable especially: Howl's Moving Castle. You cannot deny how much work was placed into just this piece. Every time it came on screen, it catches your attention. Just wonderful. The story was whimsical and as with many pieces of animation and anime of this kind, you have to suspend your belief and just be taken away by the entertainment. The story is simple: a very shy unconfident girl (Sophie) gets cursed by a vengeful witch who turns her into a 90 year old. She hides in Howl's moving castle until she can find a solution to her problem - hoping that elusive Howl can also find a solution to her problem.Once in Howl's very strange castle, you do keep hearing: \"How can you help me when you can't solve your own problem?\" Even when Sophie finds the witch who cast the spell on her the witch relies, \"I can only cast spells, I cannot take them back.\" How odd! But that tells you much about this film as well.And then there is Howl. Why is he elusive? What is he trying to do? Is he good or bad, or just trying to escape both to find out exactly who he is? You actually watch Howl's transformations as he himself battles this out. It's quite interesting to see.As in much animation and anime of this kind, nothing is tied up nicely-neatly and there are a few things that make you think about it afterward. But this is a story of sorcery, of change, of strength, of war, of peace and finding enough love within yourself to love others.",

It's filled to the brim with interesting ideas, inventive visuals and inspired animation, which makes up for its somewhat scattershot central story and slightly strange pacing. The characters are all very well realised - and beautifully dubbed, I'll add - but the titular Howl is ever so slightly inconsistent (or, at least, presented inconsistently). Of course, his enigmatic nature is a part of his appeal, but he seems to lack a solid motivation - as do several of the other side-players - and the more we learn, the less it makes sense, in a way. Even our protagonist loses her drive part-way through, putting aside her quest simply to spend time as a housemaid. In her case, however, her character always shines through as she's constantly a wise, kindhearted person who's willing to forgive even those who have done her the most wrong. The narrative she finds herself caught up in isn't quite as strong-willed, but it's suitably tumultuous and charmingly off-beat. It keeps you engaged through its duration and is certainly unique, allowing Miyazaki and his team to play around with their intriguing designs and animation techniques. I especially enjoy the tar-like henchmen that pursue our heroes; their bulging bodies squeeze through small gaps, twist together as they struggle to stay upright and merge with one another to form huge, undulating masses. Overall, though it has some issues and doesn't hit home as hard as it perhaps should (in its more emotional moments), this is an entertaining affair throughout. It's a visual treat, too. 6/10",

Definitely Miyazaki is a creator who has chosen animated films as the best way to express his ideas. Sophie is a young lady living a bored life in some place in Europe (not defined), at the beginning of XX century (not defined either). War times, and this is an important issue in the meaning of the film. Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie can prove it. Howl, the young-beautiful man blessed (or punished, it all depends how you look at him)with magic powers, is a struggler who fights at nights breaking down anachronic war ships . Even more, he refused kingdom call which pretends he fights in the front. Sophie will be victim of the trick made by an evil witch (later we will find out that the same witch has been cheated)becoming in an 90 years old woman. Without hope, she'll rove until to find a fantastic roding castle with strange people living in it. The movie takes an oniric twist, in which logic is suspended, plot back and forth following undetermined parameters, as the castle does it.Hauru no ugoku shiro is a powerful visually film, which is not afraid to play with fantasy.

It makes you feel as you're stepping into a whole another world. The elements in the movie are so different that you could only imagine them, but somehow Miyazaki manages to make them real.Even though love cannot be defined by simple words, our best bet of understanding it is by feeling it. Sometimes we feel a weird weight on our chest, as Howl says. And it's usually the heavy burden of heart, as answered by Sophie. Holding onto our loved ones makes us vulnerable in a way that when they're hurt, it brings an unbearable sadness to us. In any case, they're the ones that adds a meaning to our lives; and Howl's Moving Castle is an exceptional movie in telling this fact.",

            "review_title": "I have watched this film 3 times, purely because enjoy criticising it",
            "content": "--before i say anything let me just say ordinarily i am quite a fan of Miyazaki, i have seen Spirited Away and enjoyed it imensly and now own, however all directors make mistakes (Tim Burton directed 'Mars Attacks' remember) and playing with the plot of Diana Wynne Jone's best book is definitely a mistake--I have to admit, picking holes in things is like a hobby to me but in the case of 'Howl's Moving Castle' I know i am quite right to do so. I can't even give this film a 2 for it's pretty pictures, i hate it too much!Why do this to that story!? Considering the standard of Diana Wynne Jones' book it is hard to see how this film could have such a weak plot. I can't understand why Miyazaki would take such a wonderful story and put it through a mangle.When i first heard there was going to be a film made of my favourite book of all time I failed to see how this could go wrong, when I saw what the castle was going to look like i was even more optimistic the style of animation seemed to suit the book rather well, i am now forced to eat my words.None of the character's look quite right, Howl looks like an inflatable chair on stilts, Sophie just looks plain pathetic and Calcifer looks as if he's just come off the British Gas advert. Calcifer should be genuinely frightening, not comical.The film had a promising start, Sophie's lines were remarkably corny and she herself was so nice and quiet she became detestable, she showed no character whatsoever and she didn't talk to hats but apart from that the castle looked promising and Market Chipping wasn't too bad either if you ignored the ridiculous aeroplanes and tanks. Then Howl appeared and it all went downhill from there.Howl is welsh. One of the reasons I like the book so much is it is one of the only books that uses a Welsh hero, when i read it I also give him a welsh accent in my mind. It surely wouldn't be too much to ask to get Christian Bale, who I found out after watching it is in fact welsh, to put on a welsh accent at all? In stead he puts on this dull deep droning voice which I find both dull and creepy simultaneously.The story is terrible, nothing is explained. Whilst in the book an explanation is provided for why the witch curses Sophie, why the scarecrow roams the hills and why Calcifer asks Sophie in particular to break his contract with Howl no such explanation is provided here.Before I forget to mention it i must also tell you that I find the characters tedious and dull. Each one being far to perfect. The Sophie of the book is presumptuous, intruding, outspoken and nosey and Howl clearly recognises this and finds her irritating and tiresome. Howl is vain, cowardly, selfish and careless all of which Sophie takes note of and finds him frustrating and despicable, on several occasions she attempts to leave the castle having no patience left. Neither of them are perfect and neither of them so much as pretend to like each other.As for the love element, it barely emerges until the last few pages. Sophie goes through most of the book without even realising she's fallen in love with Howl, certainly neither of them would confess to anyone but each other in the final few pages and even then it extends merely to Howl saying 'I think we ought to live happily ever after, don't you?' in a welsh accent of course. In the film it's obvious and it makes me cringe. Sophie is too nice.I won't go too far into the other plot differences although their are plenty but major things this film misses is the intriguing dog-man, the seven-league boots, the chilling English teacher Miss Angorian, and the individual love stories between Sophie's sister Lettie and Percival, and Sophie's half-sister Martha and Michael (the equivalent of the film's Markle but about sixteen instead of six). And not to mention Sophie and Michael's short but amusing adventure into Howl's own world and his native country modern-day Wales.The plot of the film is clearly weak and far to simplified. Instead of wathcing the tedious and predictable plot of the film unfold why not enjoy the surprising if slightly more complex but far more amusing and likable plot of the book instead? People who read the book love it, in fact the majority of people who have read DWJ's 'Howl's Moving Castle' would tell you it's better than Harry Potter, read the amazon reviews if you don't believe me, they say it all.Ooo! Now I'm angry! I just read a review on here blaming the book. the Book!!! It makes me angry since this person clearly hasn't read the book they just assume that of so perfect Miyazaki couldn't have made a mistake so blame the book!!! The idea of it!!! I sgree the plot and characters in the film are awful but don't blame the book!!! Read the book, Howl's a coward in the book and he's a lot more likable that way, and he gets drunk at one point read it!",

            "content": "OK here's another Miyazaki's film. As always, its graphics are nice, and its feel is dream-like. I admire Miyazaki's imagination a lot (I haven't read the original novel of this movie).However, the movie doesn't impress me a lot because of several reasons:***spoilers ahead*** 1, You can always see something familiar from it. Well maybe it's Miyazaki or Gibli's trademark, but when I see characters flying, war, a request to stop the war, etc. etc., I begin to feel a bit disappointed. I'm not saying that Howl's not creative enough, but I was expecting something more creative and original, like Spirited Away.2, Some ideas are quite vague. For instance, why Howl is always flying around the dangerous war scene, while doing nothing at all but getting tired and hurt? Maybe I'm slow, but I didn't see a point for him doing so. Another example, why that return-to-the-past door suddenly appears in front of Sophie? What's its function besides letting Sophie know Howl's past? To me, this part is not really necessary. Even it's a imaginary world, it still need some logic right?3, The ending is quite predictable. Well, happy ending. But I can't figure out why the war suddenly ends. They fight so hard, for so long time, the Queen even sends out fluid strange people to gather soldiers, and all of sudden, she agrees to stop the war? It doesn't make a clear sense to me. And the cursed-prince-return-to-human-form part looks a bit stupid and abrupt. I'm not saying the ending is disappointing 'cos it's still a good and happy ending, the story deserves it, but...oh well.***Spoilers End*** So, yeah that's roughly about it. I still appreciate all the work and effort, and the movie itself is really nice.6/10, for the nice wonderful word Miyazaki delivers.",

On the positive side, it is a gorgeous piece of animation, beautiful from start to finish, and the story is magical, unconventional, and unpredictable. It deserves credit for originality. On the negative side, much of the film makes no sense. The plot moves from one scene to another without demonstrating their relevance to the overarching storyline. The characters' emotions are mystifying and their motivations opaque, so it's difficult to understand why any of them do anything.Eventually such lack of clarity becomes irritating. About three quarters of the way through the movie I gave up trying to figure out what the point of the story was and stopped caring about the fates of the characters. Thus, for me, the film failed Rule 10 of Mark Twain's Rules of Literary Art: \"the author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad ones.\" Sorry, Howl's Moving Castle.

            "content": "I have to admit to being swayed by the jacket covers for DVD's and the marketing material used to promote movies. So when I saw Howl's Moving Castle and one of the characters (Howl) as a half-human, half-blue beast, I immediately thought, \"Eww, that's weird. What in the world were they thinking?\" Even though it is by Miyazaki, I have to admit that bias/immaturity on my own part. So I stayed away from the film for quite some time. (I've also noticed a pattern: I tend to stay away from the best films out there for the most stupid, shallow reasons only to be later blown away by how good they were.) So eventually I managed to rent this film. I do not even know why it got on my Netflix list. But I saw it. And I was hooked. I watched it once, twice, three times, okay, I stopped at five times because I had to return it or incur the wrath of my girlfriend. But there were several moments throughout the film that really touched me and I was so moved by Emily Mortimer's rendition of Sophie's emotions that it left me perfectly spellbound by the end of the film. \"Okay, I'll just watch one more scene...\" (I also realized you probably can not do this, because pretty soon if you start at any part of the movie chances are you will continue watching until the credits...) Okay, the review: It's a spellbinding film. A bit unconventional by Western standards, but definitely a movie that takes the audience on an adventure (which is rather refreshing if you consider how many movies promise adventure and give you recycled material today). This film is very endearing as all the characters feel real. Miyazaki excels in creating humorous characters and situations, developing a very warm view of life and everyone in it. The story is sometimes slow, but overall it feels honest and original which is saying a lot in today's cinema. Definitely worth renting at the DVD store, or, if you can, watching it on the big screen.",

While walking down a back street, Sofie unexpectedly meets this mysterious Howl. People have known Howl as a vicious wizard that eats pretty girls hearts. Though the wizard Sofie meets is a confident, care wizard. That night, Sofie also meets the Witch of the Waste; a vain and selfish witch, places a curse upon Sofie, cursing her with the body of a ninety year old woman. Desperately to have the curse lifted, Sofie travels across the country. Meeting a strange scarecrow, Sofie soon finds herself upon Howl's moving castle. The legged castle is a rusted, decrepit place, which looks to fall to pieces in any given moment. Here she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who is also under a curse, and a young boy Markl, a training wizard.With the success of Hayao Miyazaki's last film Spirited Away, it was a hard step for him to make a film to equal that wonderful film. While you shouldn't really just compare Howl's Moving Castle just against Spirited Away; though it doesn't come to it, Howl's Moving Castle is one of the weaker films from Hayao Miyazaki. Based upon the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the story of Howl's Moving Castle seems inconsistent, jumping around to much, making an uneven flow. When an important piece of information is told, the scene jumps somewhere else. The story starts very clear, yet during the later half of the film the story seems muddled and abit chaotic from the strangeness that Miyazaki presents.Though the story of Howl's Moving Castle does hinder the film somewhat, it's the artistry that really creates this film. Much like many of Miyazaki's film, the world he is presenting to us is so out of this world; inhabited by some outlandish characters, wizards and demons. What so impressive about the animation is the handcrafted style, where animations are so heavily made with computer animation. The warmth just emanates from the screen, and you can see so much sweat and blood went into the vibrant detail.While Howl's Moving Castle isn't one of the better films from Hayao Miyazaki, it's still a very impressive film all the same. You can't help but be drawn into this beautiful world.",

I'm not a huge fan of this style of animation, it is too similar too Pokemon, but it is really well done here. The strong point, for me, being the backgrounds, ships, planes etc, but not the characters.We never really know all that much about the war of the background, apart from the fact that it has something to do with a missing prince.

It is not nearly as heart warming as all his other films. This one is dark, moody, plodding, and contains too much badly scripted dialog. Therefore, I would have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is a disappointment. Sophie is a harmless young girl, who is cursed by the Witch of Waste with an old woman's body. One day while wandering on her own, she finds a strange mechanical mansion sitting on a hill and when she goes inside, she meets the young magician Howl, who she befriends and ends up traveling with. Along for the ride are Turnip head (a living, but mute scarecrow) and the power ridden Witch of Waste. Sophie slowly learns of Howl's darkest secrets, and finds herself with growing affections for him, despite him trying to keep his distance. she discovers that the boy's soul is ill because he is missing his heart, and she seeks to find it.Miazaki's creative genius is still strong, no argument there. The world he creates here feels like a combination of glamorous Victorian England and 'The Wizard of Oz', although the setting gets darker as the movie progresses. The story on the other hand is not well crafted. What is meant to be an elaborate story instead becomes complicated, dark and eventually dull. Howl's Moving Castle is neither adventurous nor romantic, and too far from the emotional grasp of the viewers. I don't recommend it.",

In fact, I almost wonder if that's how it was all put together.The one thing that I find really interesting is that you can take something which barely makes any sense at all and have it hailed as genius. I suppose that's because it's different from most other films. Well, it certainly is that.Oh, and be sure to throw in a bit of an anti-war theme. It doesn't matter whether the war planes are ours or theirs, we're all morally equivalent here. No matter what our reasons for defending ourselves might be, we're automatically as evil as those who attack us.Someone else commented that this film was \"art.\" Well, it depends what kind of art. There is currently a movement that has begun to recognize that all of the feathers glued onto steel girders painted blue (and similar works of the 20th century) were just... feathers glued onto steel girders painted blue.Just because something is different doesn't make it brilliant.To be fair, Howl's Moving Castle wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. Some kids will like it. For the animation and music, I give it about a 5 out of 10.(And by the way, I don't know how people can find this comment not to be helpful. It's my honest opinion of the movie, and in my personal opinion it's an accurate view. The movie is simply rather incoherent. If you like incoherence in your movies, fine. I don't. On the other hand, my young teenage daughter liked it because \"it had a strange plot line.\" My preteen daughter thought it was \"fantastic.\" But I found it incoherent, and my wife thought it was just plain awful.)",

            "content": "Having waited eagerly for \"Howl's Moving Castle\" ever since I learned Miazaki was directing it I have to say I was disappointed. In my opinion this is the worst of all Miazaki's films. Please don't get me wrong, this is a really good movie. It was enjoyable and technically beautiful. The animation couldn't have been better, and at times even verge on genius. The character of Sofi moves so naturally from the young girl to the old woman that you completely believe that they are one person. Sometimes you will catch a turn of the old woman's face and see the perfect reflection of the young girl that is trapped inside. This is something only the greatest of artists can accomplish.Where the movie breaks down is in it's mishmash of a plot and it's few likable characters. Other than the love story going on here the plot is hollow and lacks any motivation. It seems like there's a whole lot going on in the background that we need to know for it to make sense. Everything is ambiguous, and nothing is ever tied up to any real satisfaction. Then, suddenly a plot point will jump out, make an appearance, and never be resolved. I find this unfortunate.It's sad when of all the characters in the story the one that makes the biggest impression on me is Hin the dog. This weird little mutt steals every scene he's in! Oh, I think the characters of Sofi and the Witch of the Waste are well developed (particularly the Witch of the waste) but other than that I couldn't get involved with anyone. Even Howl seemed one dimensional and lack lustered. It doesn't help that I was forced to endure Disney's typically poor translation and awful cast. With the notable exceptions of Jean Simmons and Lauren Bacall I thought the casting uninspired. Billy Crystal is particularly bad. He takes what should be, and is, a very important character to the story and makes a poor joke out of it. Un-funny and unsympathetic, he almost single handedly ruined the film for me.As a Followup to \"Spirited Away\" this movie was a disappointment for me, but even though I consider it Miazaki's worst film you must consider the caliber of his other films. Everything he touches is magic. The worst Miazaki film is still far superior to almost everything else comparable. This could easily be one of the 5 best movies of the year, however the competition isn't that great.It's worth seeing.",

The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie. Lastly the name is fitting to the movie, I love how much of a role the castle itself plays in the film. It always seems to be interesting in every scene and frequently reveal something new about itself.",

Lack of new ideas (almost every trick, character, face, music passage not to mention a style) and on the other hand lots more of syrup and pathos instead of openness and sincerity. It felt more like a \"Hollywood Blockbuster\" than any of his previous masterpieces - though some have had hints of it here and there. Laputa comes to mind.Again, as others have mentioned, everything is relative. Regardless of its drawbacks, it is still Miyazaki with most of the greatness this inevitably implies. Disney still can't touch this and it still was great to watch.It's just... that I will still prefer to watch Totoro or Kiki or Spirited Away all over again instead of this one.

            "content": "Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones's 1986 novel, this is the tale of young hat-worker Sophie Hatter. When a curse is placed on her by the Wicked Witch of the Waste, she turns into a 90-year old woman. Ashamed of her looks, and fearing she will be of no use to her step-mother in their shop, she flees to the countryside in seek of shelter and to somehow get help to lift the curse.On her journey she meets a helpful scarecrow (who, incidentally, is a source of terror in the novel) who directs her to local wizard Howl's 'Moving Castle'. This isn't just a name - Howl's castle does indeed move - it hops along on spindly legs, groaning under its weight, and puffs of steam emanate into the surrounding air. Inside, Sophie finds the castle is not all as it seems - it is disproportionately small and shabby, and able to open its door onto four different locations at will. Calcifer, a fire demon, powers the castle and Howl is not quite the evil, girl's heart-eating wizard he's made out to be. Instead he's shallow, vain, tempestuous and, to Sophie's horror, handsome. Sophie makes a deal with Calcifer to break the contract he holds with Howl, in return for her curse being lifted. But will Sophie end up breaking the spell herself, and will Howl in fact see her for what she really is - a beautiful, resourceful young woman, and return her feelings?World-renowned director Hayao Miyazaki has done a good job here. He has taken great liberties with Diana Wynne Jones's original story, but this is no bad thing in some ways - the film is a pure visual feast. From the Wicked Witch of the Waste's obese puffing up the palace stairs, to Calcifer's near death, and Howl's slime explosion, there are some brilliant images here. The scope and depth of the scenery, the close-ups of Sophie's eyes, and Howl's blond hair have all been obviously attended to with great detail.I would urge anyone to watch the original film with subtitles. The actors' voices are much more in tone with what's on screen, in particular Calcifer's comical screeching shouldn't be missed.I'm all for artistic vision, and the different ways that novels translate from page to screen. However one major aspect that I didn't agree with in this version was Sophie's differing appearance - when angered, or in a fit of passion, she grows younger before our eyes. She's cursed, not just emotional! If it was as easy as that perhaps she wouldn't need to hang out at the castle mopping Howl's floor.Don't worry if you haven't read the novel first, but do make a point to do so at some point (anything written by Wynne-Jones is worth a read, for that matter). Although this film does arguably stand on its own merits, to miss the genius of Wynne-Jones's writing would be a great shame.This film is a good example of well-crafted animation, inspiration and directorial vision.",

Of course, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but: putting down a film because it doesn't spoon-feed you, the way 90% of US films do nowadays, and dropping it's rate so people might think it isn't a good film (and therefore not watching it) is just plain wrong. Howl's Moving castle is an excellent film. Period. Yes, it is a Japanese film(therefore a \"foreign\" film. LOL). Yes, certain aspects of it (very few really) speak only to the natives. Yes, some matters presented in the film require you to think about them once it is over. But only because the film industry is almost monopolized by US films doesn't mean that we should accept its manufacture as a standard.

(Sophie's point of view is the exactly the same as Howl, and if you watch the movie sympathizing to Sophie you will have a different perspective of the tale....it is not too easy to explain....but basically his characters have a life of its own and you can feel their emotions and reasons why they say or do things!) I think that is a magic of Miyazaki''s movie. He puts so much effort of developing the story line and it is not only one dimension, but all characters have their own. It may seem too much information and too rushing toward the end when I went to see it at first, but then once you (sort of) figure out the story, it is pretty natural that things happen that way. Like the world we live in all of us have different story to tell....His visual is simply stunning....it is amazing what he show us!

But, as usual, Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job with this movie, and it is well worth the price of a movie ticket.Some Miyazaki fans feel like this movie was a disappointment after the splendor of Spirited Away. But I heard Miyazaki say that Spirited Away would be his last movie because it was so wonderful, so I don't think his fans should expect Moving Castle to surpass Spirited Away in any form. The story lines are so different that you almost can't compare them at all. While Spirited Away is more elegant and Asian in its themes and its storyline, Moving Castle is a much more European. Because the story is so much more western, the music and scenery are very different from Spirited Away, which I think was very appropriate. Overall, I think the techniques Miyazaki used really fit the story well and that's why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Hauru no ugoku shiro\" or \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a Japanese animated movie from 2004, so this one will soon have its 20th anniversary or maybe it has happened already depending on when you come to read this review of mine. Of course, this is a Studio Ghibli production and the writer and director here is Hayao Miyazaki, the man who is probably the one everybody thinks of first when hearing about (slightly older) anime. However, he is not the only writer credited here. This film is based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, who is no longer with us anymore, but still lived when this film got made. Miyazaki is still alive, in his early 80s now and almost a decade younger than DWJ, which means that he was also already in his 60s when he directed this movie. It is anime from Japan, but Disney was also a bit of a factor as you can see if you take a closer look. By the new millennium, Disney had already come to terms with Ghibli's brilliance you could say and wanted in on it and if a big company like Disney wants in on something, there is pretty much no holding them back with all the money at their disposal. This is as true today as it was back then. The cast sounds interesting. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, but I cannot really elaborate on the actors there because I am not familiar with the names, but I think they did a good job overall. I must mention the American cast though. I mean Christian Bale as Howl. Enough said. Add to that the likes of Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons and also the very young Josh Hutcherson spanning through several eras of Hollywood film. Guess I can also mention Emily Mortimer, but I am a bit hesitant because she is not a good actress in almost everything she has been in over the years.The title character or more like the title vehicle in here is the one you also see on the imdb poster. I personally felt that, even if a great deal of the action took place inside it, it could have been used in a more memorable way somehow. Maybe it was the curse of the action taking place inside and when it takes place outside, we are at very different locations really and hardly saw the castle. When we did, it sometimes felt more like an old train or old locomotive to me than a castle really. Surely because of the fact that it was moving and also because of how it was moving. As for the inside, maybe the fire that was the reason why it was moving was more interesting to me really than the people inside, especially the owner. Howl did not do too much for me here as a key character. I am glad the film was not called Howl. I mean when he was up there in the air flying or literally walking early on, it was quite spectacular, but nothing of that entertained me as much as the boy (for whatever reason) living with Howl there when he put on his beard to look like a tiny old magician. That was hilarious and maybe the funniest moment for me from a film that seemed ultimately aimed at children as much as it was aimed at grown-ups. Many lighter moments in here than in Princess Mononoke for example. As for the main character this time, she experiences a pretty tragic fate when she is visited by an evil witch in her store and turned into an old lady around the age of 80 or so. Plus she is not able to talk about what happened to her. But boy, does she have a forgiving character. The witch who did this to her was apparently just somewhat taken over by demonic powers and the girl forgives her so quickly really when this witch basically becomes nothing but an old woman herself. She even sees her as some kind of grandmother figure that she trusts when it comes to talking about her secrets and she is also in on the \"girl's\" affections for Howl, even if she realized those herself.Once again, like on several other occasions with Ghibli, the film is named after the most magical character if you wanna say so, not after the one at the center of the story because that would have been the girl who is turned into an old woman. This has happened on other occasions too like the aforementioned Mononoke again, but we talked about that one on another occasion, so let's stay with this one here for now. It was memorable how quickly the girl adapted to her situation. She is a maker, she did not cry for a long time afterwards, but just kept going. She even said something like how she manages or wants to show people what this old lady still has inside her. So she somehow ends up as a housekeeper for Howl's castle where she really employed herself to take care of the place. In the process, she meets many friends. The flame inside the castle which has everything running was one of them, so magical and entertaining. It also reminded me a bit of the Olaf character in Frozen or more like a reverse version of that I guess in terms of elements. But still there are similarities. They also both face imminent death only to be brought back. Luckily. I would really watch a movie that focuses on this flame only, maybe on how it got to meet Howl and ended up there. It sounds early on as if the flame is also a prisoner there, but you quickly see how it delivers because it wants to. I guess this initial impression still had to do with the idea of Howl being maybe also a bit on the evil side with what was mentioned about him before that in terms of how he loves eating hearts. Maybe it just meant in the sense of breaking women's hearts. There is really not too much more I can say about Howl. The scene with the changed hair color was a bit ridiculous and the best about it was even some awkward comedy when the female main character carries around his body and realizes that he is completely naked. Very brief moment.In terms of the key plot, of course you would think that maybe the Witch of Waste how she was called in the translation would be the main antagonist, but actually this \"honor\" moves elsewhere eventually, namely to a female character who is more of a politician really, even if she has great powers too and said Witch of Waste surely underestimated her. In general, we have a world of magic here, but regulating forces were a key aspect too and could not be denied. There is no one-man army with such power to defeat the establishment. This also becomes obvious with these folks ringing at the castle's door relatively early on too. They do not care about the magic. They are just going through with the orders they were given from their superiors. So this is where today's world maybe comes into play. Also the opportunism of it all at the very end. We find out how in a somewhat rushed and maybe even forced happy ending the primary antagonist (of the second half) declares that there shall be peace again. She even calls the war atrocious or so, even if it is hard to believe she really cares about casualties or something. Pay attention to the scarecrow too and how his transformation (after a kiss of course, kinda strange though because it was not a kiss of love) results in him becoming human again and completely out of nowhere this event means that he will make sure there will indeed be peace again. By the way, I just said that he was a scarecrow before that and this was one reason why I thought this film had some parallels to The Wizard of Oz. I am sure I am not the only one who thought about this. I even felt at some point, it could have been a remake, but nope. Like also pay attention to the name of the first antagonist and the letters it starts with. Pay attention to the dress the main character is wearing for large parts of the film, especially in the second half. It looked like Dorothy's in terms of cut and color I thought. I wonder to what extent Miyazaki and Wynne Jones were inspired by the American 1930s movie.Oh yeah and I must also say that this is a film that does not take place in Japan. If we ignore the Heidi series I think, then this is something quite unusual for (Studio Ghibli) anime, but they stayed with the location from the book of course, even if we do not hear the exact name of a place. The amount of people with light hair is always an indicator. Speaking of hair (color), you can also look at the protagonist. She is back to her young self again eventually, but the grey hair stays. Maybe it was a compromise to make the film somewhat more attractive in terms of female characters and yet not totally move away from the old woman inclusion. I don't know how it was handled in the book. Still, it made very little sense to me from a story-telling perspective. Another reason why I found the animals and magic creatures like the fire in here far more interesting than the human characters. One more character I have totally not mentioned yet is the dog. Now he was epic. It did not even need to talk or anything. Every time I saw it on the screen, I had to smile. Not a huge surprise that it was not really Howl after the main character was so sure it would be Howl. Maybe if she had known where it originates from, she would not have helped it to stay with her. But it was worth it as this cool canine also becomes a member or the gang quickly and no longer serves the ruler. The dog's final move to show his previous owner what is going on was also memorable because this accelerated the road to peace as well. Actually even made her say so. Finally, from a comedy perspective, the scene in which the two grannies were walking up all these stairs was also nicely memorable. One of my favorites, even if you see them, especially the witch, suffer. But it's nothing serious. As light as the rest of the film really. I wish I could have liked the fantasy element, the overall plot and the male title character as much as the comedy, but it just wasn't possible and I also feel it won't change on rewatch. So I think it is a good movie, but the rating here on imdb and the consequent top250, actually even top200, inclusion is way too much. Still, it's a thumbs-up from me and a nice watch for the entire family. Just don't expect real greatness going into it.",

However, up until Princes Mononoke, these worlds were also accompanied by a solid story, which allowed the director to express himself and at the same time made sure the audience was not confused and the theme of the movies was delivered withing their time frame.Howl's Moving Castle and in my opinion Spirited Away move on a basic story thread and theme, but the individual actions of the characters are sometimes unexplainable and impolitic. In Princess Mononoke, in every action we could see the motive. This is not always the case here.Besides that, this movies reminds us a lot of Miyazaki's previous works, like Laputa. As a result, this world does not seem as impressive as the ones we've been used to so far.What gave me the worst impression was the ending. To me it was so over the top that it made one forget the rest of the movie and the other themes just to focus on the relationship between Howl and Sophie.In the end, how bad can a Miyazaki movie get? At worst, it will be simply quite good and that's what Howl's Moving Castle is. I could not use a negative word for a Miyazaki film, so let's not say that it is his worst, but it is definitely the least good.",

Most I simple do not care for, not really understanding how such primitive animation is considered revolutionary. The fantasy elements are good, but we need better animation.This film seems to be the exception. More than any other anime I have seen, \"Howl\" looks like a professional job, with a great story, fun characters, and rather decent animation. Some of it is still choppy, but it has a more slick look than the others.",

Still, the message of peace and courage is very relatable to our world.I have read the book in which this movie is based and, even though the movie has some significant differences, they made a very beautiful plot. Some answers are a little vague, like everything regarding the cause of the war and the scarecrow, but that is because they changed this aspects from the book (the war does not have so much focus on the book and the scarecrow has much more). Another thing that gets lose is Sophie's mother participation in the end (what was her goal?).However, this details are not important for the main plot, and the studio likes to pass meaningful messages (like the horror of war).This is a great movie for the entire family and I was very surprised is not more famous and didn't get more recognition.Definitely worth the watch.",

Simply put, some directors make something so good they cannot beat it. So we should not expect too much. Needless to say, this is still Howl's Moving Castle is a very good film. The animation is rich, not quite as much as Spirited Away, but you cannot expect that much from one person. It's just fun to watch.I guess what hurts this film is that it uses every same plot device Miyazaki has used before. Howl has much in common Haku. The Wicked Witch of the Waste becomes much the same as every other MIyazaki initial villain. Sophie's journey has much in common with Chihiro's or Sen's. In many ways, this repeats a lot from Spirited Away but with too much absurdity and not of charm. The plot and explanations become complex or thrown together. It just doesn't have that usually ingenuity of his other movies.The entire point of this movie in the end was to take our breathe away with amazing sites. And it did. The animation is better and while it is not as good as his other films, it still is better than a lot of the stuff out there. So if you like Miyazaki or if you just like animation, see this movie. It's worth the five or six bucks. But don't expect a masterpiece like \"Spirited Away.\"",

            "content": "I haven't read the novel by Dianne Wynne Jones that this is loosely based on(but I understand that while this is not that direct of an adaptation, she is very happy with how it turned out). The young Sofie, a girl who doesn't feel attractive, becomes the victim of a spell that ages her. She then becomes the cleaning lady at the titular legged, moving castle of a powerful, selfish yet insecure young sorcerer Hauru, who she is infatuated with. We go with her on the ride to this amazing world of magic(in the universe this takes place in, it's almost commonplace) and quirky, strange and imaginative creatures, including a helpful living scarecrow, a charming, small and very old dog and the fire demon Calcifer(that eats egg shells and such to sustain himself). The focus is not on a ton of different creatures, settings or curses; the ones there are, are hypnotic, unforgettable and effective. This builds atmosphere and really gets to you, taking the time to draw you in, instead of the often scared-to-stand-still American norm(just because animation *can* move fast doesn't mean it always should). There is real personality to the locations, the beings and of course the characters. The sheer level of creativity and detail here is spellbinding. This has a great plot, if it is perhaps a tad vague at times and leaves you with unnecessary questions. I watched this with the original Japanese voices and subtitles, and I would definitely say that is the best way to go. The acting is spot-on. This has a marvelous score. While some of the humor is pretty silly, this is also genuinely funny at times. It can also be rather cute and sweet. This is 110 minutes sans credits. The art and designs are breathtaking, with little CGI. There is disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 19 and a half minute featurette about how they animated the walking structure, a 7 and a half minute interview with the author of the book and a couple of TV spots and trailers. I recommend this to any fan of Anim\u00e9. 10/10",

            "content": "HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, my first Miyazaki film, is the story of shy young woman named Sofi who is turned into an old woman by the Witch of the Waste. As an old woman, Sofi leaves for the hills where she is picked up by the legendary Moving Castle. There, she meets a fire demon named Calcifer who bargains with her to help her reverse her curse if Sofi can free Calcifer from serving Howl himself.This film is an example of someone allowing their imagination to be completely free... and Miyazaki manages to bring his creativity together in a visual spectacle of a film. How cohesive the job is in the end is up for debate. At times, the story leaves too many stones unturned, or adds too many complications to keep everything clear. As a result, the emotional impact of the film is dulled b/c the audience is left unsure of what everything means... at least I was. However, this is a film that rests on the strength of it's sheer creativity.At times, the story feels so wonderfully creative that I was reminded of true classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Sofi makes for a wonderful leading lady and it is a joy to follow her through this story. She changes from a gentile, shy young shop girl into a grumpy old woman... and yet she always remains a likable central presence. However, what separates this film from classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and WONDERLAND is it's inability to be clear.Those pieces feature some of the most wildly imaginative characters and stories ever created, and yet in the end they always make complete sense and are incredibly satisfying. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE captivated my attention the entire time, however, it never left me feeling that I was watching a concrete story arch.In addition, the central character of Calcifer is a real disappointment here. The character, voiced by an uninspired Billy Crystal, stands out as a poor animation job amidst the beautiful artistry that makes the rest of HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE so enjoyable. The character of a fire demon should have opened the doors for some wonderful artistic interpretation... but instead, Miyazaki seems to have opted for a character straight out of the \"how to create a funny/cute sidekick\" guidebook. In a film so full of wonderfully out of the box creations, it is really a shame that such a central element is so boringly clich\u00e9.Otherwise, though the story definitely has loop holes and Calcifer is a huge disappointment, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE still is an incredibly enjoyable and interesting film. It takes chances with it's imagination unlike 90% of the animated films being released today b/c it takes a refreshingly non-commercial approach (except for Calcifer). HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a fun, interesting film that may have some noticeable flaws... but it does deserve extra credit for reaching further then the average animated film.... B/B+ ...",

            "content": "One of my most memorable screenings of the last 20 years has been attending the lone screening which took place in my area at the local \"Art House\" cinema of Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle. Usually playing films which have just come out on disc, this sold out showing has always stood out to me,thanks to everywhere I looked there being a fellow Miyazaki fan filling the small screening room.15 years later:Looking at the listings for The Electric Cinema in Birmingham, (oldest working cinema in the UK)I checked their \"Summer Family Films\" tab,and was thrilled to find a 15th Anniversary Screening of Howl (in the original Japanese) was to take place soon. For the first time in all my viewings at cinemas,I stood in a line which went half-way down the street,picked up a lovely Inglorious Custards cocktail,and got set to witness Howl's castle moving again.View on the film:Guided by living scarecrow \"Turnip Head\" into Howl's moving castle, writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki greets Sophie to a magnificence Steam Punk design,whistling from the 80 individual 19th century machinery segments agitating each other with every movement of the castle's legs shifting on a bustling sound of hot steam and fragile wooden foundations.produced digitally that transfers the 1400 storyboards of the hand-drawn backgrounds and the characters into a digital medium, Miyazaki pens the styles together with his distinctive stylisation.Blossoming from the fluid animation sparkling in a beautiful vibrancy on the detailed,expressive character designs and razor sharp editing wrapping the audience in a soaring flight of fantasy atmosphere,Miyazaki sharpens the digital 3D rendering on the moving castle in a contrasting style, via the digital animation of the building sending it rolling along the silky hand-drawn backdrop. Adapting Diana Wynne Jones novel when he wanted to express his anger over the Iraq war, Miyazaki travels up the stairs to Madame Suliman's remote palace, who at a safe distance from the effects, shatters the floor with a all-consuming viciousness in keeping conflicts in a abrasive state.Turning Sophie into a 90 year old, Miyazaki continues to brilliantly build upon his theme of the lead breaking out from primary focusing on themselves,in this case Sophie spreading a compassion to the residences of the moving castle,and even to the witch who cursed her. Initially scared of her old age appearance, Miyazaki threads his themes of compassion and a hatred of war with his recurring motif of a feminist aspect,lit in Sophie finding a solution to the war with a brave thoughtfulness against the volatile masculinity of Howl within his moving castle.",

Maybe also for the fact that Roger Ebert gave it a negative review. But I'm glad I finally watched it. There is stuff in this movie I have NEVER seen before. And the storyline kept giving new twists so that I was never sure where the movie was going.I will admit the movie is not perfect. The almost two hour running time, and the fact that there is a substantial amount of stuff that could be called \"padding\" are liabilities. I think the movie would have been better if it were shorter, with scenes tightened. Another problem I had was that some of the questions that came up in the movie were never answered.Still, overall, this is a movie worth seeing for adult viewers. What about children? Well, I think they could like it, but I recommend that they first see Miyazaki's KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO first to warm them up to Miyazaki's style. Then afterwards, when they sit down to watch this, plan the occasional break when you press pause on your remote. If you don't do this, your kids may get overwhelmed as well as impatient.",

Sadly Howl's Moving Castle falls into the second category (along with Nausicaa IMO). The plot is almost non-existent, and what little story remains is confusing and fragmented. The film suffers from the same problems as Nausicaa, in that an intriguing premise is established, but which never reaches a satisfying conclusion.",

Ghibli (Miyazaki) fans will of course enjoy this one, but I would recommend it for anyone. It has elements from virtually every movie Ghibli has done thus far, and fans will enjoy noting where they've seen certain themes and characters before. But it has certain qualities all its own. Fans of Diana Wynne Jones book will find that it takes a lot of liberties with the story.

            "content": "From the writer-director of Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke & the Academy Award winning Spirited Away comes another spellbinding journey into the creative world of this highly revered filmmaker. Howl's Moving Castle continues the remarkable success streak of Hayao Miyazaki's esteemed film career & is a fascinating take on old age difficulties, futility of war & magic of love, all encapsulated with Miyazaki's unique storytelling ability & infused with his distinct artistic flavour.Howl's Moving Castle, on a superficial level, is a love story between Sophie; an unconfident young woman & Howl; a powerful but insecure wizard. When a witch, who's after Howl, casts a strong spell on Sophie which transforms her into a 90-year old woman, she moves out of town & travels to seek a cure for her spell and eventually finds shelter in Howl's strange & mobile castle. There she meets a fire demon amongst other acquaintances who offers to break her curse if Sophie is able to set him free from Howl's service.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Howl's Moving Castle features another intriguing drama that's effectively paced & expertly narrated by him. It also boasts a compelling set of characters amongst which Calcifer; the fire-demon, turned out to be the most interesting for me. Like all Miyazaki's films, the animation is impressive while the lush cinematography captures every moment in fine detail. The humour is nicely timed, the themes are elegantly explored & Joe Hisaishi's score wonderfully accompanies the whole drama with its blissful tracks.On an overall scale, Howl's Moving Castle may not rank amongst Miyazaki's finest works but this anime is still full of life, love, joy & magic. The only complaint I have is that the final 30 minutes are kind of messed up plus the ending feels slightly hurried up. Yet it doesn't take away much from the film as it still manages to transport its viewers to Miyazaki's wonderland and will surely leave most of them emotionally fulfilled & satisfied. Another visual wonder from start to finish by Studio Ghibli whose creativity never seems to tire out, Howl's Moving Castle is thoroughly recommended.",

Unfortunately, Howl's Moving Castle is not the shining example of Ghibli's/Miyazaki's best work.The art, often reminiscent of Nausica\u00e4, might have been considered stunning several years ago, but having been spoiled by visual masterpieces like Princess Mononok\u00e9 and Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle simply fails to impress and often seems dated, both in terms of character drawing and background art. True, there are moments of artistic brilliance; however, the competent but ultimately uninspired body of this picture's artwork overshadows these moments. Perhaps Howl's worst failing is the unacceptably unrealistic rendering of the \"old\" main character.As is often the case in movies originating in Japan, character motivation tends not to be explored and may seem confusingly unclear at times. Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki have consistently overcome this stereotype with well-defined scripts and superior direction in their previous films; yet in Howl's they take a step backwards and often leave the audience scratching our heads wondering why the characters are behaving the way they do.The sound effects, music, and voice acting are all well done -- with one glaring exception: Billy Crystal's performance as the fire demon Calcifer. Try to imagine Billy Crystal's brilliant performance as Miracle Max in The Princess Bride. Now take away the sarcasm and anger, and what you are left with is the almost emotionally dead portrayal of what otherwise could have been a very entertaining character. Why either Rick Dempsey or Peter Docter, who are both experienced voice directors, chose to allow this is truly puzzling.Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enjoyable enough movie, particularly for children who may not notice it's many flaws. However, anim\u00e9 fans have come to expect much more from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki and are bound to be disappointed.",

There's something about an animated movie that dives into your imagination that is more fascinating than actual people in a movie. Miyazaki is most definitely one of the most visually stunning directors that always seems to find the balance between great character development and large fantasy spectacle.It's loads of fun and in my opinion easier to understand than Spirited Away. Perhaps it was because it wasn't my first time seeing Miyazaki's work this time around. To me this film feels a lot like the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. A man/creature who was put under a long spell ends up meeting the love of his life and they fight to try and resolve the everlasting issue. Although this time, the girl also has a spell placed upon her. There are great supporting characters as well, the turnip and the Calcifer are funny and sweet as helpers to Sophie along her journey.The American voices were solid and I think everyone fit their character except for perhaps Christian Bale as Howl. Bale is one of my favorite actors but his deep and grim voice didn't particularly fit with the self indulgent Howl. Other than that it's a great journey and a memorable one. Although I think the film would have benefited from about a 15 min less runtime.9.0/10",

Even though his movies appear to be light entertainers on the surface, Miyazaki doesn't shy away from bringing important issues into the story. He does it very subtly like how, in 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro', he depicts the characters (except Sofi) as being conscious of their physical image. Whereas today we live in a world where almost everyone is overly conscious of their physical appearance.The story of 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro' follows young Sofi, a saleswoman at a hatshop. Sofi doesn't think she's beautiful but she's not too preoccupied with her looks unlike the people around her. She goes on living her routine life. Until one evening, just when she'd closed the shop, she receives a visit from a customer, a rude elderly lady, who turns her into an old woman. Sofi is surprised but not terrified. She puts her routine on hold in order to find a solution. She rescues a scarecrow who helps her get to Howl's moving castle. From then on, begins a new adventure.Miyazaki is a sincere storyteller and one of the finest. He has an excellent imagination. His stories always have heart and even though he includes elements of fantasy, his characters are always real.The animation is first class and the whimsical score is superb. The special effects department have done a competent job in designing the movements of the moving castle.'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro' is another gem from the Studio Ghibli factory and I'd recommend their films to anyone who loves cinema and imagination.",

In this movie we watch a young woman who is cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch trying to break this spell, but she has only one way to do this.\"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a movie that I think that if you like this style of movies you will love it. I also want to tell you that if you liked the other movies made by Hayao Miyazaki then \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is your film and you have to see it.",

It's simply gorgeous, and I came out of the movie theatre in the most amazing mood.I only discovered Hayao Miyazaki a couple of years ago, and so this was my first chance to view one of his movies at the cinema. I have copies of Spirited Away, Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke, and so walked into Howl's Moving Castle with very high expectations. I was not disappointed. The animation is rich and lush, with the characters delightful to watch. The voice acting was also a pleasant surprise. Whilst I am a fan of watching anime films in Japanese with the English subtitles, the theatre showing Howl's Moving Castle was only showing it dubbed. I was slightly worried about this, but should not have. Billy Crystal, and Christian Bale in particular,were fantastic. Lauren Bacall's voice and tone perfectly embodied her character's spirit. It is one of the few movies that I have not winced through because of poor voice acting. Howl's Moving Castle is a sensory delight and although many critics have suggested it is not on par with Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, I would have to disagree. I believe it to be right up there.A most thoroughly enjoyable and amazing movie, for all fans of majestic films.",

            "content": "In Howls moving castle, Hayao Miyazaki flips his own script and turns a coming off age story into a film where people should have come of age but didn't. Howl, Sophie, Markl, Calcifer, are people who don't want to take responsibility for where they are in their life, and don't want to move on. The great thing about this film is that all they layers to the film are neatly wrapped up in strong character-based storytelling which remains the core of the film. Sophie has a lovely outlook on life at the beginning of the film. She doesn't want to live her life in the back room making hats, but 'it's still better in here than out there'. So when Sophie gets her 'curse' it's actually great for her. She's really quick to embrace it because it means that she can skip this adulting thing entirely and go straight into old age. The point that the film makes is that while all adults are horrible in their own special way, all these coping mechanisms to avoid becoming and adult do not work. This resolution comes when the characters can learn to define for themselves what adulthood is.",

It is an even better movie by Hayao Miyazaki.This film adaptation of a novel is one of the very few that I've found that actually IMPROVES itself by changing the plot of the book. Roughly the first third of the movie follows the pattern of the novel: a girl named Sophie is transformed into an old woman and must seek out the mysterious wizard Howl in the hopes of changing back. From there, however, the basic structure and purpose of the story are altered to fit Miyazaki's unique style--and it works wonderfully. The movie retains the same humor and heart that makes the book such a delightful read; and does it on its own, without bothering to align the tiny details. In the hands of anyone else, I would have been woefully depressed by the result; however, Studio Ghibli succeeds masterfully in creating a meaningful and deeply fun story that is enjoyable for every age. The art is whimsical and bright, the plot is coherent, and the characters are dimensional and interesting. I'm not a fan of anime in general, but even I can enjoy the liveliness of this delightful movie.So read Diana Wynne Jones' book for a great story. Watch this movie for a completely different one. But be prepared to enjoy yourself either way.",

I was shocked, he didn't sound like Mike from Monsters Inc at all, he sounded like himself really. It's rather odd since I would know his voice but just not this one!

            "content": "Witches and wizards under curses living in harmony in a world of humans in a more futuristic spin on WWII-era England -- let's just say the knowledge that Hayao Miyazaki merely adapted this story from a book (by Diana Wynne Jones) is surprising yet incredibly encouraging for those who love the fantasy genre, that there are artists out there with such free imaginations.\"Howl's Moving Castle\" is another incredible Miyazaki film that captures your imagination in every frame and its teaming up with Disney for the U.S. release proves that there is still some dedication to the animated fantasy genre and that we aren't just enjoying the last few jewels falling out of an old 2D treasure chest.In what seems like a classic Miyazaki story, a girl named Sophie is put under a curse by a witch that turns her into an old woman. Seeking a cure, she ventures out to where the witches and wizards live, only to get swooped up by a mechanical castle owned by a young wizard named Howl (voiced perfectly by Christian Bale in the American version) and powered by a fire demon named Calcifer (Billy Crystal, another fantastic move by Disney). In the background, the country they are from is at war and Howl is on the run from being called into duty. It's a fairytale with romance and action to boot.Imagination abounds in this movie as one would expect. Just when you think you have an understanding of the universe that's been created, there's another something magical to grasp. It can get a bit tough to make sense of as you go along, but fantasy-lovers will be captivated by how vast of a world of possibility the story creates while still sticking to the fairytale conventions that have grounded the genre throughout time: stolen hearts, curses, beastly transformation, etc. Unlike some Miyazaki movies, \"Howl\" is also more accessible through its in innocent human character living in a world much like ours that gets swept off into unfamiliar territory -- a lot like his last film, the Oscar-winning \"Spirited Away.\"Like its predecessor, \"Howl\" will excite you in ways you generally don't experience at the movies these days. It is escapism at its finest but not entirely out of touch with our world, a true delight from the master of imaginative film-making.",

It is full of corny dialogs and has a very cheesy ending, which delivers the final blow to the movie.The main character Howl is a run-of-the-mill anime figure with annoying gestures and facial expressions (funny detail: his hair is always wobbling around, which reminds me a bit of a hair shampoo commercial). Calcifer, the fire-demon, you could also find in a Disney production (which is not a compliment, in my opinion). The evil witch, who becomes a good witch later in the movie, would be nice, if we haven't seen the same \"evil enemy becomes nice guy\" thing in spirited away before.The general artwork however, is good. The best thing is the moving castle itself, which is the most innovative idea you'll see in this movie.

The attention to detail in the drawing, colouring and design in every single frame is without equal. The images are so vibrant that at times they almost saturate the senses: cities with a fantastic splendour from an imagined Europe of a century ago; mountain meadows with clouds scudding across them and drifts of wild flowers; a wizard's bedroom crammed with magical instruments and rendered in such detail that you could discover some unseen facet if you watched the scene a score of times. Unforgettable image follows unforgettable image through out this film.All the characters are well drawn, with the usual Ghibli trait of ambiguity as to the \"good\" or \"evil\" status of each. If there is a weakness in this movie then it is possibly in the plot. More precisely the plot resolution, which does seem to leave a few loose ends. Given the strength of every other part of this film, this is a point that is easily forgiven. A brilliant film that can be appreciated by anyone from the age of five to ninety-five.",

Still, the film, like all of Miyazaki's work, is extraordinarily inventive and revisits familiar themes and motifs. The character mix has close parallels with \"Spirited Away\", just as the dark, oily forces of evil resemble army's of the former film's 'No Face' character. The Joe Hisaishi music is strong but not amazing, and both the Japanese and American voice actors acquit themselves well. The film is not engaging on a visceral level, but it is filled with enormous warmth and rich humanity.

Each time, the viewer knows that by the time the movie is over, there's a huge chance that they will have another title to add to their list of favorites. That's a wonderful thing...but with expectations like those, sadly there is bound to eventually be disappointment. I suppose that time has finally come for me.\u00a0I certainly didn't hate Howl's Moving Castle. Some parts of it were as wonderful as I could have ever expected. First of all, it's beautiful. I could not have asked for more in that regard. The backgrounds, settings, and characters are so gorgeously drawn and animated, that each frame is its own individual work of art. A number of the characters were very appealing to me, as well. Who didn't instantly love Sophie and Turnip-head? I even liked the character of Calcifer (and Billy Crystal's voice-acting). On the other hand, I never warmed to Christian Bale's Howl or The Witch of the Wastes, but that makes complete sense within the context of the story. Those two creations were not really written to be liked.(A special commendation has to be given to the animators and voice actors who kept Sophie as a clearly recognizable character, even as her appearance underwent several changes. That couldn't have been easy to do, but it really helps the viewer form a bond with her.) \u00a0So, where did my disappointment come from? The story. I realize that this isn't an original Miyazaki creation (instead, it's an adaptation of a popular British book from the 80's), so perhaps they had difficulties in working within another person's vision? So much that I wanted to know about the characters and their world, is left unexplained. Huge plot points come and go in a brief span of time, with very little comment. Howl's story was fortunately fully-resolved, and it could be argued that everything else is unnecessary, but it\u00a0feels to me like there were a lot of missed opportunities. Even the main plot was a bit boring and frustratingly vague. Howl's Moving Castle could have been a fantastic movie, but these niggling issues make it no better than average.There's a wide-range of discussion and contention about which Miyazaki movie is the best, but general consensus is that none of them are less than decent . Some people will absolutely love this, it just didn't appeal to my tastes as much as some other Ghibli films have.

This time around, we have a disparate group of people suffering under various curses who find their way together and form a ragtag family to fight the forces of evil -- in this case, a seemingly never-ending war between two nations. Having said this, I will say HOWL is suitable for even the youngest viewer, because Miyasaki knows how to make such subject matter palatable for even the youngest among us. While not his best work, it is absolutely gorgeous and almost hallucinatory as it tells the story of a walking castle and its owner, a shy young warlock. In some scenes, the castle is CGI; in others, it is standard 2D. Either way, it is a marvel and at the heart of the story, which is loosely based on a novel by legendary fantasy author Diana Jones. Emily Mortimer plays Sophie, the heroine of the story. Christian Bale is Howl. Billy Crystal is the fire that keeps Howl's castle together (don't ask), and he is very funny. A mute scarecrow plays an equally important role. Highly recommended. Make sure you also catch SPIRITED AWAY, PRINCES MONONOKE, NAUSICAA and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO by this animation genius.

Diana Wynne Jones weaves the most creative, exciting, fun and magical stories around. I've been fairly annoyed with all the attention (+ movie spin-offs etc.) that JK Rowlings \"Harry Potter\" has received, since they are not, in my opinion, on par with Diana Wynne Jones' truly magical works.I had always wished that Howl's moving castle would be made into a film, but knew that it would probably be a disappointment. I've been proved wrong, Hayao Miyazaki is probably the only film-maker in the world with the fantastical vision required to bring this story to life.This is my favourite movie of the year, it has been a dream come true to see this most magical of stories told through Miyazaki's stunning imagery.My only concern with this is that many people seem to value watching it in the original Japanese with English-subtitles. I feel that this would probably be pretty confusing: an English story, translated to Japanese and then back into English! I've never heard of a translation of a translation that didn't get pretty confused. Besides, the English voice talents are world class, this is not a second-rate manga with a hammed up voice-over.",

I often end up half-rooting for the villains in most movies, but not here. Miyzaki, has created such deep and lovable characters(especially Calcifer) that every little problem they faced had me doubled up in worry. The story is interesting too, though a little lacking. The cities are on the brink of war, due to foolishness and random gobbledy-gook that i didn't understand. And here's where Miyazaki goofed up. While he should have made the entire war drama more, well, dramatic, he instead replaced it with cleverness. We get a serious scene that could have easily escalated into something more profound and moving with Miyazaki's talents, but rarely does. Many of the scenes (especially the ending) feel like they should end with an earth shattering bang. Instead they all end abruptly, leaving us scratching our heads and wondering what the hell was the point Miyazaki was trying to make.Of course, Miyazaki has to be aware of his target audience, which unfortunately includes the little ones, so I can't really blame him for not going further. I would have preferred it if he went for the profound rather than the clever, but hey that's life. This is STILL a great film that everyone should see. 8/10, maybe 8.5/10",

The story starts with a young woman called Sophie working in a hat factory who is suddenly turned into a 90 year woman through a curse by some witch. She then tries to meet the wizard Howl, to see if he can help her. As it later turns out, Howl faces some curses of its own. The story soon becomes very convoluted, almost impossible to follow it wholly in just one sighting. After a while, you give up on understanding everything that is going on, and concentrate on enjoying its vivid details (Howl's literal melting of sadness is probably my favorite scene). What I found most engaging about the movie, rather than certain aspects of the plot, is its background details, which betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy. I haven't read the original book, I know some people who had has taken issue with Miyazaki's liberties with the plot, but as it is, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even if the ending is a bit preachy in its endorsement of pacifism and environmentalism.",

            "content": "I loved just about every second of Howl's Moving Castle, but I can understand why some folks had problems with it. 1. Several visual ideas reappear from Miyazaki's other films - blob men, flying machines, laser-pointer crystals, and so forth. Still, nothing feels recycled or rehashed. The referential nods just encourage the notion of a cohesive Miyazaki universe - that all his stories chronicle different periods of a single imaginary world where just about anything is possible. I especially appreciated the Ghibli references since Howl's is rumored to be Miyazaki's final film - this made the experience all the most sentimental and bittersweet, especially when combined with the \"what it means to grow old\" subplot. If Sophie feels all too familiar to you - consider this: there is an inside joke at Studio Ghibli that a single imaginary anime actress plays all of Miyazaki's different heroines.While Howl's Moving Castle is certainly not the first Charles-Dickens-high-on-absinthe-and-anachronism anime I've ever seen - its the only one that spiritually takes that Old World European \"turn of the century\" feeling to Sgt.-Pepper's heights. 2. Howl's Moving Castle lacks a traditional narrative plot in favor of presenting a surreal, dream-like experience. The story itself does not suffer from this treatment. It's still a very interesting tale - it just might take some folks a couple of screenings to really get it. The final resolve comes about thanks to a sort-of deux ex machina, followed by some Scooby-Doo worthy revelations. Its a ruthlessly, beautifully, absurdly happy ending that knows very well just how ridiculous it is, and pushes it as far as it can go - but this perfectly follows the film's dream-logic. To claim that Howl's Moving Castle doesn't make a whole lot of sense it to miss the point entirely. I can't vouch for the book - but unless it was written with Miyazaki in mind - many changes must have been made. A handful of traditions from other fantasy classics are represented - yet all the while, the film feels totally original.Its a surreal, dream-like experience - you just have to let yourself go with it. I felt like I was 10 years old again, you get that same overwhelming sense of wonder. In a single word, the film is supremely MAGICAL. Although I'm still in my 20's, the subplot concerning what you lose, and what you gain with old age really got to me. Of course, the visuals are jaw-dropping, esp. the kinetic sense of motion - the way Howl's Castle moves, the way characters' faces morph - its all beyond words. Plus, its hilarious, with a kind of grandparent sense of humor. So many classic moments. And it can be very unsettling at times, esp. during the passages where everything seems too good to be true, we keep waiting for the earth to drop out from underneath. I love the way Miyazaki's heroes accept their doom, and just move on. Its like, \"Hey - what do you know?...I aged 70 years when I woke up this morning, oh well, that sucks, guess I better head off for the mountains.\" I feel I should warn you - Sophie's mom comes across like Scarlet O'Hara on bad acid! I entered the theater expecting to be a little bit disappointed - how could it top Spirited Away? - maybe that's why I was so pleasantly surprised. Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect Miyazaki movie.PS - I did eat one brownie, but by Act II, it felt like I head eaten four.",

I think it is generally a respectable work, immensely enjoyable from start to late into the film, but somehow the last 20 minutes or so seems less polished in terms of story and character transition, resulting in a *slightly* disappointing ending. One aspect I really like from Miyazaki's works is that the characters are almost never one dimensional--for example our master Howl who first seems like the perfect leader may have surprised us when his semi-metrosexual attitude is revealed. In this manner, Howl's Moving Castle, like the other films I have seen by Miyazaki, blends reality (imperfect human traits) and rich imagination (excellent visual) in its magical universe.",

The second enemy attack for a good second and then nothing happened. At last the war ended all of sudden, happily ever after.There are no consequence of any actions from any characters. The war could have mean something or impact the characters but it didn't. I also find the main characters love unfounded as they only interacted a few times. There was a back story of the male lead which could have potential but it wasn't developed in the movie and he's as interesting as a staled bread.I don't understand why there were so many high reviews of this movies, but if you appreciate a certain amount of common sense and logic in the stories then I won't recommend this movie to you.",

Miyazaki has done it again. The magic is still here. So far I've yet to see a bad Miyazaki film, which just shows that he is one of the most creative and inventive animators of all time. His works inspire and enthrall us. Not too long ago, he gave us his first big film, Castle in the Sky, a good film with wonderful animation. He followed up by the fun family film, My Neighbor Totoro, which was also good but not near as good as some seemed to think (ala Roger Ebert). He made other little hits here and there, but nothing compared to when he made his first big hit, Princess Mononoke, one of the best film's of '98. The animation was that much better than his previous films, and the story was a lot more involving than say \"Totoro's\". Following this, he created Spirited Away, a true masterpiece and definitely one of the bests films of 2002. A film that deservedly won best animated film at the Academy Awards. I think that Spirited Away may become a great classic someday in Anime history, as Snow White has done in Disney history. It had breathtaking visuals and an even more interesting (and totally bizarre) story than \"Mononoke\". While \"Spirited\" and \"Mononoke\" may be hard to top, Howl's Moving Castle sure comes close. Its visuals are stunning, the characters are just as ever entertaining, (I especially loved the character Calucifer, who is an \"evil\" made entirely out of fire; or there's turnip head who's a scarecrow with magic that makes him alive) and the story this time while mostly fantasy, actually has a more realistic side plot: The war. This adds some interesting twists to the story, and really makes it that more original than any of his other films. Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke may be impossible to beat, but Howl's Moving Castle can definitely stand on it's own.Miyazaki's films seem to have constant trends, similar characters, and sometimes identical story elements. But that is not to say that all his films are exactly alike. It is just interesting to watch and observe and realize that Miyazaki has made a world of his own and these films inhabit that world. Every time we see a Miyazaki film, we are seeing the world through his eyes. And, oh is it a wonderful place. You might notice a lot of characters that are alike in his films, especially his usage of young girls as main characters. And what would a Miyazaki film be without: strange, obscure oozing creatures, crazy old woman, and people who can transform into animals. And don't forget, what's a Miyazaki film without flying.These are all themes of Miyazaki. This is his style, and it may perhaps be the new Disney. While American hand-drawn cartoons are dying out, and computer animated cartoons are becoming the new trend, it's still good to know that we have Miyazaki films to look forward to the good, old-fashioned way.",

During an encounter with a rival witch, Sophie is cursed and becomes old. Sophie seeks to reverse the curse and takes a position in Howl's castle.Much like other Studio Ghibli animated movies, Howl's Moving Castle is a magical adventure. This movie has grand animated moments that are beautiful to behold on the screen. Much of the movie places the characters in unique and compelling situations. The movie executes these moments well. Many of the sky scenes have a creative and colorful background that plays into the fun atmosphere of the movie.Howl's Moving Castle follows Sophie completely. This movie is a love story between Sophie and Howl with the war waging in the background. The concept and execution are different to experience. Sophie is turned into an old woman and learns how to be selfless. Howl is selfish and likewise also learns how to be selfless. This is a movie where both characters gradually come to an understanding with one another. This is a movie that has both characters undertake an adventure that ends up helping one another. The gradual respect that Sophie gets from Howl and Calcifer feels organic and real. This is one of the best aspects of the movie.The English dub of this movie is great. Every cast member in this movie nails their lines. As the love story between Sophie and Howl continues, the voice actor and voice actress deliver the gradual audible tones in their relationship. It may be worth watching the movie again in Japanese.Howl's Moving Castle is rife with themes and allegory. This movie talks about war under false pretenses. This point is exemplified by Howl's relationship as he discovers both kingdoms are going to war. However the war's reasoning was done under false pretenses. In addition, the war is shown to have only affected the lower classes of both nations. Howl and Sophie both opposed the war, but there was not much ability for either to stop it. The movie explored this deep theme with its characters and setting and utilized all of it masterfully.I highly recommend \"Howl's Moving Castle\".Grade: A.",

I am no stranger to the films of Hayao Miyazaki, but for some odd reason I seemed to have always managed to have missed this particular Miyazaki classic. I finally picked up the film, and I can definitely say it doesn't disappoint.The big draw of this film is the imaginative animation. The animation is as fluid as ever, just like every other Studio Ghibli production. The animation under Miyazaki's direction is simply perfect, creating certain shots where you are simply left in awe, wondering how someone could have come up with a shot that is so fantastical. Of course what truly keeps you captivated to these tales crafted by Miyazaki is the story. This film's story is a surreal love story about a wizard and a bewitched human; it is a quirky, yet lovable premise. It is lighthearted and fun, featuring quirky and unique characters, alongside some breathtaking fantasy, both staples in Miyazaki films. The story of the film is complex, but never gets convoluted, it is well paced and never feels as if it is rushing or going too slow. Two more things worth mention is the magical score from Joe Hisaishi, and the wonderful voice acting; in particular from Christian Bale, who steals each scene as the voice of Howl.Howl's Moving Castle is easily one of the most imaginative films ever made. Every time you see the gigantic lumbering castle, made up of rundown houses and pieces of scrap metal, you get this great feeling of excitement and wonder which truly takes you back to the days of your carefree childhood. Hayao Miyazaki has done it yet again, it is another instant classic.A perfect 10 out of 10!",

            "content": "Directed by Hayao Miyazaki Studio Ghibli 14th film Howl's Moving castle tells the story of Sophie who works at her late father hat shop along with her sisters and mother. She meets a Wizard name Howl and she rather smitten with him. She's then return to the shop late night is approach by the witch of the wastes who's jealous of her and curses her into an old woman. Desperate to find a way to lift the curse she leaves home traveling west, meets a scarecrow name turnip head who leads her to Howl's moving castle where she ends up becoming the housekeeper. The characters are all unique having something different to offer. Sophie is rather Unconfident with herself she doesn't really feel happy with her life at home. However she still has a optimistic attitude even when she becomes old, it doesn't seem as if she acts like a old women but just herself. She finds some sort of peace staying with the others and doesn't actually mind. Markl who looks very similar to Oliver from Ni no Kung : Wrath of the White Witch is the apprentice of Howl,spends a considerable amount of time with Sophie and is really likeable he's not annoying like a lot of little kids in films and is actually useful. Calcifer a fire demon who powers Howl castle that aloud it to move has a mysterious past to him. Lastly there's Howl himself he probably the most laid back of all the ghibli characters he's a mysterious figure to the public everybody knows who is but nobody knows who is. He uses several false identities to conduct business with various kingdom while still keeping his freedom to do as he pleases. He gets to the point where the war between the lands start to take it toll on him starts to lose control of himself. The Film's visual stunning. With the idea of having a castle that move it offer many opportunities for various locations. There several shot of landscapes accompanied by the music the film seem to take inspiration from Belle \u00c9poque France the towns are full of color, the outfits are vivid to building's are vivid. The neighboring kingdom palace is it lined with gold ornament decor it's stunning. Lastly is of course the castle industrial steam punk this one of the most bizarre design creation ever the amount of detail to the animation is remarkable each piece moves seperate. The only problems is the curse with Sophie is inconsistent there are points. She Just swaps back to herself with no reason. Turnip head is alright he's funny but kinda obvious that they were trying to go with another character similar to No-face from Spirited away. He just doesn't leave the same impact and exactly want he is come completely out of nowhere.",

            "content": "I've wanted to see this ever since I saw clips of it on Jonathon Ross's \"Japanorama\" show on BBC3 several years ago. I guess you'd class it as Anime but it was clearly made with a Western audience in mind as most signs and numbers are written in English (Although I did see a poster written in German & some boxes labelled in what looked like French).You don't need the subtitles switched on as there is English dialogue but the subtitles were clearly translated from Japanese as they do differ from the spoken English dialogue in grammar and structure, not all translations are exact either.The look of the movie is very much like something from the mind of animator Terry Gilliam, especially the castle on legs striding across the rural countryside. Its very much like something he'd have thought of. It's difficult to know what time period the movie is supposed to be set in seeing Cavalrymen on Horses but steam powered Trams, Trains, Steam Cars & Sedan Chairs too.It appears the lead character of the film is Sophie who works in a millinery shop (thats hats to you philistines) and we start off meeting her leaving work, being rescued from the over amourous attention of 2 soldiers by a chap who not only seems to know Jedi Mind tricks but can also fly and is being chased by evil black ectoplasmic creatures.Sophie discusses her encounter with her sister Lettie and they also discuss Howl (he's clearly a Wizard and everyone thinks he's evil and eats womens hearts), returning to the Shop Sophie has a spell cast on her by The Witch Of The Wastes which turns her into an old women. She avoids her mother and leaves town rescuing a scarecrow which repays her with a walking cane and helps her to find shelter, inside Howls Moving Castle. A bit like the Tardis, even though its moving the inside of the castle always remains stationary as though it were a normal static dwelling.This is obviously a world where magic is totally normal (as Sophie wasn't surprised by a magical scarecrow) as meeting a Fire Demon called Calciifer didn't even seem to phase her, it seems Howls Castle is even more like the Stargate as it is able to be static yet its front door and exterior can be in many different locations at once (Actually it seems to be based on the Terry Pratchett idea of Wandering Shops).All of the callers seem to think different Wizards live there but none think it is Howl. We discover the man who saved Sophie is of course Howl (who can't be that great a wizard if he doesn't recognise someone under an spell) and to remain close to him she pretends she is his new cleaning lady.We also discover (thanks to Howl) that Sophie appears as a normal girl when she sleeps. One thing can be said for certain, this is a world where several cities or countries are involved in a war (with flying battleships and iron ships that look like US Civil War steamers) but even the Witch Of The Waste seems to have a Tardis-like Sedan chair, definitely bigger on the inside.It's rather strange that whilst talking to the Kings Head Sorceror Sulliman (a mistranslation surely as she is clearly female) that Sophie briefly transforms into her younger self whilst making an impassioned speech on Howls behalf. Sulliman had also taken all the magic from The Witch Of The Waste and tried to trap Howl who saves Sophie.Sophie escapes back to the castle and wakes up but is still young, checking on Howl she tells him she loves him. When he rejects her she becomes old again but it is difficult to know if that was a dream or not. Afer using Calcifer to move the Castle it also completely reconfigures and repairs the interior (again like another aspect of the Tardis, able to add new rooms), Sophie also appears to get younger again when Howl takes her into his secret garden.From what I could understand Sophie gets younger when she acknowledges her feelings of love for Howl. Sophie is visited by her mother (who was forced to leave a spying bug by Sulliman) but it is destroyed by The Witch Of The Wastes using Calcifer to burn it but it leaves him weakened and unable to protect the house from invasion and bombing.So many of the images of flying ships and burning birds remind of Battle Of The Planets (Gatchaman) it made me wonder if the maker of this had seen the cartoon as a child. Trying to help Howl Sophie removes Calcifer from the castle which destroys it but he is able to reconfigure it only smaller when she returns him and gives him her hair.The magical scarecrow saves them from certain death and she kisses him which releases him from a spell, he turns out to be a missing Prince who can stop the war. Sulliman also stops the war using her royal contacts and calcifer repairs the castle and Sophie and Howl fly off into the sky.It's an odd ending to an odd but sweet film which is apparently very loosely based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, the film is just under 2 hours long but I think it could be cut by about 20 minutes as it is just too long in places.",

It had a very unique and wholly childish view of wars as novel games with no purpose. Interestingly enough it doesn't have any problems with violence so long as it is in rebellion of the establishment. The love story is sadly too faint, yet the fanciful imagery and delightful characters make this move entirely entertaining to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.I think fewer words are better, IMDb thinks otherwise. So I am forced to add more.If you stay focused on the movie you will easily understand it and it will be pleasantly predictable. If how ever if you want you want to be surprised or want to tax your mind, walk away from the movie skip 20 or so minutes. I don't believe this movie to be too childish but a child would enjoy it equally. No obscenity and fairly tame with no death graphic injuries. I believe shallow people will not get into this movie completely, but they should watch it the same.

            "content": "This weekend took the kids to another Hayao Miyazaki film known as \"Hauru No Ugoku Shiro\u00e2\u0080? in Japanese or \"Howl's Moving Castle (2004)\u00e2\u0080? in English. The film is advertised as being based loosely on a novel and I would hazard to say the loosely part probably has something to do with the injection of Miyazaki's frequent themes which include allusions to the Hiroshima bombing, and pacifism. However, this time out Miyazaki doesn't demonstrate the environmental concern normally prevalent in his work. Our eighteen year old animated heroine is Sophie who hides from society after being cursed into old age by the Witch of the Waste. Miyazaki borrows some elements of \"The Wizard of Oz\u00e2\u0080? in the witch's name and in the form of a talking scarecrow. Sophie takes refuge in the moving castle of the title and consistent with the dream-like quality of Miyazaki's films, this keep is a monstrous contraption composed of thousands of moving, steaming and grinding parts on 4 spindly legs powered by a fire demon called Calcifer. Howl is a self-centered wizard who is struggling to avoid being drafted into destructive war along with the rest of the kingdom's magic denizens. The war is over the disappearance of the prince of the land \u00e2\u0080\" a plot point that does not become important until the very end of the picture. Markl, Howl's apprentice and Suliman, his former tutor, round out the cast of good and evil respectively. Sophie's first task is to bring order to Howl's castle and by extension to Howl himself who is extremely powerful but largely adrift in self-indulgence. Her second task is to get the Witch of the Waste to lift the curse which she ultimately fails at because Suliman tricks and disarms the Witch first. Sophie makes peace with this former enemy and winds up caring for her. It is left to the newly focused Howl to defeat his former tutor lifting the curse from Sophie and from the scarecrow who turns out to be the missing prince thus stopping the war. The story drifts quite a bit and there are definitely points in the film where things grind to halt. However, the animation, particularly the actual castle, are amazing and this helps to carry the audience through the 2 hour runtime.",

One day, while she was walking in a alley, she is confronted by two men who seem to be flirting or trying to get a number. Luckily, sexy Howl (voice by Christian Bale) saves her and takes her through a unforgettable stroll in the sky. But, the Witch of the Waste (voice by Lauren Bacall) finds out about this stroll and casts a wicked curse on Sophie, making her a 90-year old woman. From there, old Sophie walks great lengths to find this witch and comes upon Howl's Moving Castle. She then meets Calcifer (voice by Billy Crystal), a smart-mouthed and witty fire demon and a aspiring young magician named Markl (voice by Josh Hutcherson). Sophie then falls dramatically in love with Howl. Howl often turns into a bird-like figure, trying to stop the idiotic war that is going on, and in result, comes back to his castle in blood or slime. Whenever Sophie would feel beautiful or happy, her true young self would reappear, but vanish if she began negative. Howl and Sophie go through hard times and adventurous moments, but come out OK.

For those who have seen Spirited Away, I find too many similarities between it & Howl's Moving Castle. I can't remember the name of the dragon wizard in Spirited Away but I feel that Howl is like an adult version of the dragon wizard. For instance, both are \"trapped\" by some form of evil forces and risk turning into demons. the whole plot was also a tad too confusing. I had to watch it twice to grasp the full meaning. (and even after that, I'm not sure I really do understand it). I therefore won't recommend it to young viewers.

This is an adaption of the book by Diana Wynne Jones, so don't be surprised when you hear English names throughout. While I normally disapprove of overhauling a novel for the big screen, this is one occasion when it seriously needed it and it was masterfully done. Howl is a far more admirable character in the film than he was in the book and the movie moves along at a fair clip without ever getting bogged down. Sophie's many transformations from young to old to not so old to young and back again (many of them very short-lived) are wonderfully done and add a wonderful dimension to the story that I'm sure Ms. Jones would (and probably does) approve of.

            "content": "I am going to do something that I haven't to this point done, in my IMDb history. I am going to point out a trend I have noticed on this website and possibly ridicule some of the opinions of other IMDb contributors. I do realize this is not normal and believe it may be due to the 80 hours or so I am going to complete this week at work and my lack of cranberry juice or Nutella spread for this morning's bagel breakfast spread. That is like spitting on a man ablaze. First of all, you are spitting on someone. Secondly, the ludicrously small amount of water in the spit couldn't put out a match (of course unless you are a spit marksman, in which case I apologize). And finally, you ARE spitting on someone. That is how I felt about this movie. I was actually hoping Miyazaki could help me out in my temporal predicament, as he had done many times in the past. With hopeful enthusiasm, my confidence and trust of my fellow humans deteriorated to the point of despair and disdain. I realize I should probably sleep on this topic before writing a review, but here we are. The trend in question involves the best of the user comments. I have noticed that many of the under performing movies' (in my opinion) top listings all praise these movies. That is not that strange. What is strange is that these top listings usually are contributed by \"authors\" with 20 or fewer contributions (a bunch of them are in the single digits). Is this some form of gorilla marketing ? A devoted single-serving, nom de plum for Shakespeare's modern living legacy or something completely different? It is not for me to decide, but merely to point out a perceived pattern.This movie is a clear indicator of the above patterns. It took to #11th best comment to get the first \"prolific author\" (only in the teens), who saw it as a disappointing 7/10 film. I would love to be that disappointed. It would make this day for me seem like drinking warm soda on a hot day. It took to the #14 best comment to get the first true prolific author, who didn't actually see this movie with the original Japanese audio. This duality, this contradiction permeates the movie and it's fans as well. For me it is hard to reconcile. Outside of my current state of being (in which case it is the proverbial straw on the posterior of a dromedary), I would have found this movie comparable to a lukewarm bath. It's not annoying or cold enough to get out, yet not hot enough to want to stay in longer or build a summer home there. With Miyazaki mediocrity is not expected, but here we are.The world is a Victorian-like Era complete with WWI/WWII like technology powered by steam and various non-nuclear fuels. Victorian covers everything from the structures, the clothes, the technology and even the behaviors. Its turn of the century European influence is quite pronounced. At the same time it is part European and it is also part Japanese, but in more subtle ways. A young, insecure hat maker's apprentice (Sof\u00ee) stumbles upon a magician and his situation, quite by accident while walking on the streets at night. This leads to the Witch of the Waste cursing her with old age. She seems to get older and younger over the course of the movie. I am not sure if this is due to the nature of the curse or if she is affecting the spell itself, with her emotions and thoughts. Maybe it is just a colossal film continuation blunder. I don't know. I do know it was very distracting along with Sof\u00ee herself. She then finds the wizards again (Hauru, a.k.a. Howl) and decides to hire herself as the house-keeper of his multidimensional castle. She also makes a deal with the boiler (a.k.a, Karushif\u00e2, Calcipher ; a fire spirit holding the castle together and source of Hauru's power) to help her dispel the curse. I had a hard time connecting with most of the characters, their motivation and the story (especially the main characters). It was an amalgamate of contradiction. It is a movie that takes its time to build up the story and characters, yet ends in a quick breeze complete with a nicely tied red satin bow. It wants to be a love story, built upon loneliness, insecurity, chance and proximity, yet expressed in the juvenile form. I felt like an adult watching a kid's movie or better yet watching an alien trying to emulate human behavior or thought, but never personally experiencing it. It felt contrived. Logical steps seems to skip, as if human motivation is a mere trite and the result is all that is important.The animation is the only saving grave of this movie. The style, color and attention to detail is amazing. This world is alive, even though our protagonists are cardboard cut outs of real people. This world is so character shallow that wars are started and ended as simply as one would bite into a cookie. I love the idea, layout and detail of Hauru's moving residence. It is in the title of movie and deservingly so. The most memorable character of the movie would have to be Karushif\u00e2 and unfortunately his story takes a side-quest to the main story : Sof\u00ee and Hauru. The rest is cute and simplistic. It strives to be deep, yet when we examine the evidence of the inner meaning it is bare or non-existing. These \"people\" don't live, they just follow a life trajectory. If you like floating around through life, not interested in what is going on around you, then this movie might resonate with you. I on the other hand, would like to believe there are things and people yet to see along my path to wherever.",

It tell the story of a girl who is turned into an old woman by an evil witch and then seeks refuge in the castle of a wizard, howl, disguised as a cleaning lady. This has all the magical and fantastical elements you would expect from the mind of a mad Japanese animator. It pure fantasy and freedom the kind you can only do in a cartoon. It looks great the style is amazing and it's the attention to detail that stands out as far as the graphics go, howl's castle as it walks round the land wobbling and creaking like a huge engine. It is just a delight that adults and kids alike can sit together and enjoy this film for all sorts of different reasons. From wildly bizarre to oddly strange the story twists so many times you never know where it's going to end up and by the end I still had no idea. I think that is where some of this films charms are, in that it doesn't have to make sense to be enjoyed its just so mystical and aesthetically pleasing. Disney and Pixar have very good looking computer generated films that are funny but if you want to see a film with a real soul and old school animation right at its heart then you can't go far wrong with howl's.",

            "content": "This and 'Spirited Away' are quite possibly the two most well recognized Anime films ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is just one of those film makers that attracts all sorts of people regardless if those people like the style or not. His films are bright, vibrant, and stuffed with sci-fi type elements. 'Howls Moving Castle' is no exception to this. We start off with our main character, Sofi, being turned into a very elderly woman. Not wanting anyone to see her like this she runs away from home and becomes a maid for the mysterious wizard Howl. And now we have our movie.Just like all of Miyazaki's films this is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The hand drawn style is great on its own, but it's the detail in the world that is so impressive. Whether it's Howls gigantic moving castle that is made up of many different moving parts or the bustling streets, it's hard to be sucked in by the world.It's beautiful, bright, and filled with color. Which was nice to see considering the amount of films these days that are very bleak and void of color or life. It set the tone for the rest of the film as a fun but kind of dark tale. What really springs this world off the screen is the soundtrack.Each song is undeniably unique and perfect for each scenario in the film. It's an excellent score that doesn't force the film on you. Hayao understands that the majority of the audience can recognize subtly. So, unlike many other films, he uses the music to accent what is being seen on screen. Not to try and force you how to think or feel in a particular scene. All this helps the film move along at a shockingly brisk pace. The film is two hours long but goes by in no time at all. This has a lot to do with the previous elements that I mentioned. Really the only times it slowed was when characters decided to just spew exposition. I understand that some children need things to be spelled out for them considering that this is a kids movie but by doing this the film doesn't have any interesting characters.It says this character is like this and they are like that. It kind of sucks that the majority of the film is smart about not pushing things in your face but it doesn't even try with the characters. Instead of showing you who they are it just blatantly tells you. Then they don't really behave the way the film says they should.This happens with the story as well. It says OK we are going to do this and then this. And I can't help think that the characters they are talking to already know this. The only people that don't know what these characters are talking about is us. At that point it's fairly obvious that the film is no longer having the characters talk to each but to us instead.Now I'm not saying that children's movies have to have the same complex characters of 'Prisoners' but this film doesn't even try. It will say one thing but not give us any indication of who that person actually is through their actions. It makes some of the motives in the film very unclear. It's a shame that the film couldn't simply write consistent story and characters because this film could've been one of the best. It's animation, voice cast, and original ideas are enough to get one through but don't expect much more than that.",

When I finally bought the book Howl's Moving Castle it had the promotional cover on it that simply said Now A Major Motion Picture (not with any artwork from the movie on the cover). I had a couple of days of wondering about that. I hadn't heard anything about Howl's Moving Castle being a movie. I thought maybe it was some sort of fluke and the printing press had accidentally gotten my hopes up. And than by some mysterious force I found out who was doing the movie...Hayao Miyazaki! Imagine my surprise! I was ecstatic.I love these movies more than the Disney movies I grew up with. My family has been doing art for years (in fact my dad told me that my great-grandfather worked on some backgrounds for Disney back in the day) And we've all been disgusted at the way Disney has become completely CGI and none of the original hand-drawn artwork.So if you like the book or Hayao Miyazaki or even old time hand-drawn animation this would be the movie for you!",

Feeling like a classic fairy tale, the film revolves around Sophie a young girl who has a spell put on her making her an 80 year old woman. She runs away from her family before they find out about her new look and she becomes a maid for Howl, a powerful wizard who lives in a walking castle. Can we all acknowledge that the castle is one of the coolest vehicles/homes in all of film?Powered by a fire demon, it's rooms can transform into anything, it has magic teleportation doors and just looks like a wonderful place to stay. It's not the only cool looking thing in the film though. Everything in this film is designed to perfection, every outfit, character or building looks different and interesting. Henchmen have these creepy masks and run like weird mannequins, the evil witch is this fat lump that ages weirdly throughout certain scenes. There are wonderfully complicated looking airships and strange demon dimensions. No matter what it is everything is gorgeous to look at, a real feast for the eyes. I think the story here is fairly standard, but the characters are loveable and you endear to them quickly. Especially Calcifer the fire demon who starts off a pest but who you WARM to overtime.

That's one of Pixar's first shorts along with Luxor Junior, and I remember it because I was working in a computer graphics company in the UK and it was about 1986 ish. We all huddled round a small TV and watched awed as raindrops fell outside the bike shop (Red is a unicycle) and hit the puddles, rippling out and distorting the reflection of the shop lights. It was a magical moment where we first saw that never seen before water effect and all went \"Wow\"....Hey mac. What about Howl's Moving Castle - What's your point? Move it along! Ahem, well... The animation in Howl's is of frankly awesome quality. I'm bleating about CGI water above and then I go and see Howl's and there are waves coming up the beach in one scene and they are translucent, perfect and get this ...hand drawn! There is just something about the craft involved in replicating an effect like that with a pencil and some colourists. No it's not CGI style realistic. It's better than that. There is sometimes a thing about CGI in that it is too perfect. That's why companies try hard to top Toy Story. Great movie but everything is so round, hard and shiny.The water in Howl's is like a poem about water rather than a slavish copy and therein lies the difference. ...Something like the essential difference between a painting and a photograph.That's just one item in one scene and things like that go on throughout the movie and my eyes just basically got wider and wider. I find the whole thing just astonishing and really must look up the other movies like Spitited Away and Princess Mononoke. To paraphrase another reviewer. (This ain't CGI) \"This is Art\".Ah... but you wanted to watch a film really didn't you? It works well enough but I'm going to have to give it an 8 instead of a 10. Quite simply there is something that probably makes sense in Japanese that goes wrong here and makes the story a little puzzling and disjointed in English in places. Other than that it's great. You'll continue to see some scenes in your mind's eye for months afterwards. This movie is not easily forgotten. (And my 12 year old daughter thought it was great too!)",

And Howl's Moving Castle was\u2013 still is one of my favourite books from her and having read it more times than I can remember, my imagination has come up with a different way to visualize the story. So as the film is really different, it did not really affect the way I imagined the book to be. That being said, though I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki (director and screenplay), I feel that they should have stuck to the book more instead of creating a totally different world.As characteristic of a Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki film, there are lots of expressionistic scenes as well as underlying messages. It has the feel of World War II and Nazi Germany, which could very well be what Miyazaki was going for (Sophie's town was based off a street in France) plus there was an actual war going on in the film. Some aspects too reminded me of Paprika a very expressionistic, confusing and intriguing film, which to this day, I have no idea what is about. This goes for Howl's Moving Castle, though not to the extent of Paprika. There are just some scenes or details in this film that I don't get the relevance to.The character progression was well done, in that we could see the characters growing and maturing, as well as forming stronger bonds between each other. There were points in the film that seemed to slow down but it made it up with the fantastic visuals. The colours and everything were really stimulating and well defined.I remember finding it weird that the book was made into a film by Studio Ghibli because the author is UK based and then I found it even more shocking when I heard that Disney bought over Studio Ghibli. Actually I just found that out. In 2014. How slow am I? Anyway, I just hope they don't destroy the Ghibli reputation and become all Disney like.Read more of my movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",

The story follows a young girl named Sophie, who is transformed into an old woman by a wicked witch's curse. In an effort to reverse the curse, she enters the employ of the mysterious wizard Howl and becomes embroiled in his conflicts with other wizards and a powerful military force known as the \"Witch of the Waste.\"The animation in this film is truly breathtaking, with intricate and imaginative designs for both the human characters and the fantastical moving castle at the center of the story. The film also features a strong and compelling storyline, with themes of love, sacrifice, and the power of self-acceptance. The voice acting in the English dub is also noteworthy, with notable performances by Christian Bale as Howl and Emily Mortimer as Sophie.In addition to its technical and storytelling merits, \"Hauru no ugoku shiro\" also deals with thought-provoking and mature themes that are not often found in animated films. It explores the consequences of war and the human cost of political power struggles, as well as the complexities of love and relationships. The film manages to be both fantastical and grounded in reality, making for a truly engaging and impactful viewing experience.Overall, \"Hauru no ugoku shiro\" is a must-see for fans of animation and storytelling.

The movie, in short, is about a girl with low self esteem and poor self image. It is also about a selfish, egoistic and pampered boy who is too indulged with his beauty sometimes. Then fate brings those two, along with a lot of marvelous characters, together in a motivating, breathtaking adventure where each and everyone learns there weakness and strength through the other. Perhaps i was a little biased with the last two lines, because that is how i hoped it would be... The story line is somewhat weak, and if you watch it once, might look purposeless. The animation was great, but less than what he has achieved in Spirited Away. The English dubbing was good, yet weak when it comes to the fire spirit and the heroin. Overall: The movie is worth watching once in the cinema. And it is definitely worth getting the DVD to add it to the Miyazaki collection and to pay attention to those minor, yet powerful, details that one can never catch from watching the movie once.",

I found reading the IMDb Message Board comments on this film to be enormously helpful in my understanding of the movie and would have appreciated seeing the movie even more with the knowledge that gave.For instance, I didn't realize Sofi was also a witch with magical powers or that her sudden old age was partially a result of her own self-doubts about her appearance and vitality.

However those were slightly dampened by again seeing the Disney brand attached to this man's wonderful work. I have browsed a lot of sites, reviews, etc to see if anybody else came away from this movie with the same impression as me and so far I have not seen any similar views. Maybe some of this site's users can give me some feedback. The references to The Wizard of Oz are numerous and obvious and yet there seems to be a subtext here that is not so much explained by The Wizard of Oz but is more in keeping with a Japanese man who knows his work will be distributed by a major American company. The images of war and aerial bombings are not in keeping with a treatment of Oz and it is only when you view the \"Wicked Witch of the Waste\" in her powerless state with her bulbous, purple nose puffing on a cigar that only one character comes to mind. Winston Churchill! This movie to me is a Japanese viewpoint on World War II. When viewed in this light even the blob-men who come out at night during bombings take on a cancerous appearance that echoes the mutations suffered by generations of Japanese civilians post Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even the main character, Howl, suffers a struggle of duality where he was once blonde, beautiful and pure but is increasingly in danger of turning into a large black bird due to his increasing involvement in war. The more this movie continues the more his bird-form resembles the black eagle of Nazi Germany. To me this movie is an attempt to explain the duality of Japan's involvement in the war. Continue to fight and end up as the fascist state of the southern hemisphere or withdraw and yield to the inevitable revenge bombings of the US as retaliation for Pearl Harbour. You may call me mad but there are many more instances to support this theory scattered throughout the movie and that is why I don't think this is a great movie. It is too concerned with making a heartfelt point while dressing it up in a more superficial wrapping as a Wizard of Oz-like commentary on age and beauty. However, this is probably the most subversive movie we will see for many a time.",

I think I'll have to visit \"Majo no takky\u00fbbin\" (1989) next to see if Miyazaki can turn my head around again. I don't tire of telling this over again: there's nothing as enlivening as returning to films and finding so much there that had gone unnoticed previously.And I thought that \"Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi\" (2001) was the ultimate exploration of colour in Miyzaki's animation. How wrong was I! I can't believe, and couldn't believe, my eyes \u2013 every scene is so sumptuously and purposefully lit, allowing every detail bask in the glorious foreplay of light and shadow. The first five minutes are, as a sort of prelude, some greatly effective filmmaking: the beautifully detailed interiors, the everyday hustle and bustle of the townsfolk, the remarkable intimacy and homeliness of the narrow streets; the dank cloths, the oil lamps, the small, everyday objects laid to waste in the castle. But what makes Miyazaki's film come alive is the heart. The heart of the film is not captive, but rather bursts through and frees Calcifer through Sophie. His characters often tread the line between light and darkness, and other opposites: youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, good and evil, night and day, blessing and curse, war and peace, life and death, freedom and captivity. It's through these opposites that the film comes alive, the characters often a kind of white space to which he pours the contradictory sentiments, coalesced by the narrative thrust where the same forces battle it out on a larger scale.",

Storywise it was pretty good. its the kind of brilliance you've come to expect from a Miyazaki film.Its definitely easier to count the ways it IS like the Howl's Moving Castle novel by Diana Jones than the ways that it isn't, because aside from the characters- and the two subplots where Sophie is turned old by the witch of waste, and the way Calcifer is bound to Howl, the movie and the book are very different story wise, and other character wise. Even character personality wise.At first I thought that would be a bad thing, but now, its not. Now the two can stand alone without being compared to one another. I kind of like that idea. Saves the heated debates you see with the Harry Potter movies for example. lol.The casting was very good. Especially in Japanese. The English cast was pretty good, but I could not grow to like the English voice for Sophie. The voice for young Sophie seemed way too old for her, it sounded like a thirty year old voice in an 18 year old body kind of thing. the voice was too loud, too deep, the British accent, while I believe the actress is British, it sounded almost fake it was so over enunciated. it didn't grow on me. but other than that, it was great casting.Its a very good movie as long as you don't expect to be seeing Diana Jone's book come to life. the two are pretty different. but in a good way. Its a stunning artistic work from Miyazaki and its got a little bit of everything. Romance, action, comedy, drama and while the two are very different, there are little nods to the novel that inspired the film. there are some confusing \"How did, when did and why did that happen\" moments in the movie, but I noticed that in Spirited Away and Only Yesterday. So it must be a Miyazaki thing. ^_^ 9 out of 10.",

I thought that Miyazaki killed the book \"Howl's moving castle\" by making this terrible adaptation. Did Miyazaki understand the book when he read it? He simplified the story so much, and yet he made it somewhat confusing because there wasn't any explanation to why things happened in the film.I wonder if any of the people that think the movie is so good has read the book.First: The most pointless part of the film is the war.Second: The film didn't explain why Sophie was cursed in the first place. There was no explanation for the pointless war either. It seemed that the story was floating around. The plot was not well developed.Third: They changed all the characters, and their personalities.Fourth: There were a lot of clich\u00e9d things. Miyazaki preferred to replace parts of the book that showed originality with clich\u00e9d scenes that can happen in any fantasy story.For example: Sophie going to Howl's childhood telling him to meet her in the future. (time travel) Example 2: Sophie kisses the scarecrow, and the scarecrow becomes a human because of the kiss from his true love(Sophie).If you thought this movie is good, you should read the book.

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of the characters, which are not so memorable and fun. Here we don't have anthological creatures like Totoro or No-Face, nor do we have such charismatic characters like Mononoke, Chihiro, Haku, Lupin III, Nausicaa, Porco Rosso. The plot is confusing, tiring and boring. Miyazaki movies usually have crazy twists and crazy situations, but the Howl's Moving Castle is just too confusing in excess. The beginning, when Sophie is a young woman, is spectacular, but then the story becomes a mess as it moves on - the idea was good, but it was not well executed. THMC has probably the most beautiful sceneries I've ever seen in a Miyazaki movie, but in term of character, soul, life, story, plot, it falls far short of such classics as Spirited Away, The Castle of Cagliostro and Princess Mononoke.",

Miyazaki paints an other-worldly environment filled with flying machines, monsters, princes, kings, and wizards, while maintaining subtle messages about freedom of the heart and persevering will.The movie at times almost seems stream of conscious. The plot meanders to introduce dynamic, colorful characters. However, the focus on the characters proves artistic and compelling; any tangents taken to introduce new characters breathes more life into a film that radiates with personality.Howle's flying Castle sparkles from the very beginning with beautiful animated scenes and colors intertwined with compelling and unique characters. However, the one weakness to the movie was the ending. It remained consistent to the simplistic charm of the movie, but almost too much so- the ending seemed like an understatement of the entire movie. Some clich\u00e9 means were used to break the curses placed on the characters, but overall the beauty of the movie more than made up for a plain ending.",

I've seen pretty much most of Miyazaki's more famous and also less known works, compared to Spirited Away, this movie does lack something, probably the charm and soul, I'm not quite sure. None the less, it is a lovely film. Each character is well voiced and well personified through the animation, such as Howl himself whose vain nature and cowardly reputation cover a more charming, more darker persona that is unveiled by Sophie. When the curse is placed on Sophie, I found she was a more likable character, as the older version had a much richer sense of humour and lovable attitude. Calcifer is definitely a show stealer, as Billy Crystal's voice is much suited for the fire demon, he is much of the humour that can be found in this film, along with Turniphead who still stands as my favourite character in the whole film. The story does flow nicely, but the dub may have lost some of the general plot as it can be all over the place at times, and reading the novel doesn't always fill in the blank spaces. That is most likely where the film falls due to such a long winding confusing plot, but nevertheless!Howl's Moving Castle is worth the watch, just because of the charm it has.",

Characters in the film stop to stare when it passes, and you too will be taken in by its awkward majesty.Like a lot of other people, I am a Miyazaki fan and I must agree this is not his best work. But when your body of work is as accomplished as his, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, I would still say Howl's Moving Castle was my favourite film that year.I agree with those who say watch it in its original Japanese soundtrack. Yes, the American actors do their best, and it's not a bad cast, but there is something quintisentially Japanese about all of Miyazaki's films, and these subtle nuances are inevitably lost in translation. No fault of the English-speaking actors or Lasseter himself who supervised the dub, that's just the way it is.So to calibrate your expectations - it's not as good as Spirited Away, but it does have that Miyazaki magic, and that's all the reason you really need to go see it.",

I think this is a great movie, and I want to write down my experience and share it with all readers who love Hayao Miyazaki and the flames of idealism still in their hearts.Hal's moving castle is a city that has not yet flown to the sky, and Hal is our ghost prince, and Ambergawa who lost his name.

The so-called magic is not to weave a dream, let you walk in, but it seems to be true.

The characters are fascinating to hear and watch, and have very interesting stories, all rounding up in a way that each of them make the film balanced in its list of characters. The story flops in some spots, but it holds up very strong in plenty of places, and most of the time I barely noticed potential flaws since I was still recovering from what had occurred beforehand. Studio Ghibli has proved once again that animation is for all to cherish for lifetimes, and compared to plenty of other 2004 animated films (besides The Incredibles and maybe Shrek 2), this is top tier stuff that you don't want to miss. Anyone who tells you to skip this film (besides Miyazaki fans who have seen a majority if not all of these films) clearly is only jealous of how much Miyazaki has implanted himself into critics' minds and has made \"animation\" not synonymous with \"cartoon\".",

            "content": "Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greatest animation directors. Famous for directing the prestigious acclaimed by the Academy: Spirited Away (2003). Through a career that has spanned five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a masterful story teller that usually focuses in strong young girls protagonists. He started his carer in 1963 as an animator and was involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he command attention with his endless ideas for moviesIn 2004, Hayao Miyazaki along with Studio Ghibli, released his new project - Howl's Moving Castle. The plot is about a young insecure girl named Sophie who work in her fathers hat shop, different from her sisters. One day she is cursed by a witch who shapes her body as a 90-year-old woman. In order to undo the spell, Sophie run away from home and end finding the castle of wizard Howl Jenkins Pendragon.I watched this movie a long time ago when I was in my pre-adolescence and I decided to reveal it because every time it's a new experience. What I like about this movie is his simplicity, purity, and a feel of a real world - even if it's a totally fantastic world. It's like if the characters are from one emotion to another and we follow their development as people.Hayao does very well that very simple structure of his narrative. He knows exactly the right time to apresent each element to us. The moments that needs to be calm, those that needs action and the exciting ones. Also, being based in a book by Diana Wynne Jones we found common elements of fantasy story books. At first, we have the main characters: a girl who will go through a magic adventure and the wizard Howl who, at first, appears as a selfish prince as the ones in a Beauty and the Beast (1991). Then the antagonist who is the evil witch, the secondary characters who have charisma and help the main charactersHowever, having a lot of subtexts some ideas or messages can be confusing to understood. Like, for example, Howl's relationship with the witch or how Sophie manage to undo her spell over the course of the movie. At the same time Howl is handsome and powerful, he is cowardly and selfish. He is complex and in the movie this may not have been well explained why.But despite that it is a great animate film. So if you are looking for pictures scenes, dynamic characters and a very complicated character or story driven by plot, you will not necessarily find them here, but you will find this nice and pleasant. Miyazaki's passionate, sincere and surreal dream",

The backdrop of the film is a war, but whether the films motivation is to say something about that war or war in general or anything else relating to the characters whether allegorical or literal, it's just too meandering to say, it's just lots of little scenes that, while connected and lovely as snippets, don't go anywhere and often seem to go on for far too long.

Nonetheless, the magic spells are not the only unusual thing here, it is also quite unusual that Sophie adapted and moved on quickly as an old lady which is actually a lighthearted watch. In brief, this film has beautiful visuals from characters to the landscapes and it is certainly high in fantasy. If you do watch this, you can even tell that you will be expecting something different from the start as this film is indeed mysterious and will remain mysterious even after the film ends.PS. I know this film is nearly 2 hours long but I still feel that this film is too short and hasty. :(",

            "content": "Miyazaki's version of Jones' story concentrates upon Sophy's humility, goodness, and sturdy common sense. These qualities cause the Scarecrow, Markl, Heen (Sulliman's messenger dog), Howl, and even the Witch of the Waste to respond to her loving kindness by loving her. Howl, who has traded his heart to Calcifer in exchange for power, strives to resist the demands of his King and Madame Sulliman that he fight in their senseless war. Howl dodges their summons by surrounding himself with toys and baubles and swanning around like a rock-star. His salvation occurs when he discovers something worth protecting and fighting for, Sophie and the small family she has gathered about the two of them: Markl,the Scarecrow, Heen, and, yes! even the Witch of the Waste, who, at the climatic moment, resigns Howl's stolen heart into Sophie's hands. In the end even the fire demon Calcifer cannot resist Sophie's love. And so Miyazaki, following his heart, draws good out of evil. What a wonderful story with a truly glorious ending! I love it!",

But when I saw the whole thing, I was astonished of how great the animations were and the beautiful, gorgeous artwork. I wouldn't call this movie the greatest movie by Hayou Miyazaki... okay... maybe not. I'd give it a 3rd place behind Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. While because, this film is not in the Top: 250, it should receive a third place. I've seen not all of the Hayou Miyazaki movies, but Spirited Away (which I'll mostly compare) was amazing. Howl's Moving Castle I don't think suits the writer. I'd have to read the book, I know it's based off a book. But Hayou Miyazaki usually makes some movies with child-like romances like let me explain, Porco Rosso... I didn't really enjoy. And Whisper of the Heart... the film I did enjoy. Hayou Miyazaki's movies have many adventures, friendship (with little romance), mostly fantasy. And some lyrical drama and comedy every once in a while. This film mostly had too many kisses especially the main character, who kissed almost everybody on the deck or whatever. But the film received its nice-paced drama and comedy and the action keeps some children from getting scared or crying.Howl's Moving Castle is a definite must-see movie for grown-ups and children.",

            "review_title": "Perfect for art, but plot on the other hand...",
            "content": "This is the second time i watched this movie. The last time I watched it was when I was much younger, where I obviously didn't really understand much. Ten years later, I realize I still don't really understand the plot, especially around the last 30-40min of the film.To be honest, the universe in which the story is set in is definitely interesting. It's hard to get tired of the magic universe in the end. However, I felt like this film fell short of its potential.1. Loose climax with minimal explanation\nIn a 2 hour movie, too much time was spent building on a \"climax\", which was in the end rushed through with minimal explanation within the last 30 min. To be fair, the first half of the movie is really well done in the sense that it brought me into the world of the magical elements as well as the characters. However, this perfect sense of momentum and detail building built me to expect more from the what is to come - an exciting climax, a good explanation for everything that has happened, an adversity overcome and a happy ending. Of the four mentioned which I expected, the first two were not really there. The climax was apparent, but not exciting enough simply because it lost me in terms of its story. I spent more time being confused and annoyed at \"huh, so what's going on?\" and \"why did Sophie do that?\" when it was a period I should be most absorbed into the story. Explanation for why Howl looked the way he did like a bird; what Howl has been doing flying around so often and getting hurt; why Howl swallowed the fire when he was young, why the war was on-going (all was described was that it was \"foolish\"), why the war could end so easily in the end, etc ... pretty much left unexplained. I am honestly, truthfully, glad that Howl and Sophie got their happy ending (they deserve it), but I have to admit that the story left a mild bitter taste for me after I finished the film. After so much hardship for the characters, I felt like there wasn't a good enough closure for their story. I could have been happier for the first couple that \"officially\" ended up together, among the many movies I have watched of this animator - if I didn't felt like there's something missing to the story and their love as well.2. Sophie\nOkay, I was initially impressed at the female protagonist at the first half of the film... She was brave and optimistic despite the curse placed on her. Going beyond the first half though, I got annoyed at her character. The story tries to portray her as nice and kind, but I wonder why then, does she seem to treat Califer so badly? Califer kept telling her that he will go out if there's water, but she kept openly ignoring that. Near the end, when she tried to rebuilt the castle, she even brought Califer out into a rain without even a shelter for the poor fire despite wanting Califer to work hard to rebuild the castle. ??? It hardly made sense right. She could at least bring another pan to cover the poor fire... Then, she went on to dump water on Califer even AFTER she heard that it was Howl's heart inside Califer. I understand she is trying to save the witch, but really?? After claiming that she love Howl, her first instinct is to ignore that her action is about to kill Howl off, in order to save a witch who cursed her? I was about to bash her (and the witch obviously) after that scene. I feel like her character isn't portrayed very well in this sense. To me, several of her actions portray her differently from the image the story tried to build her as.Well okay, the two points above are my main put-offs for the movie. The ending, while a tad cliche, wasn't that bad if I just pretend that everything that needs to be explained has been explained. At least Howl and Sophie ended up together in a happy ending.In a nutshell, this is a movie worth watching if you like beautiful art and fantasy/magic alternate universe. Try not to expect too much of the plot (even if the story seems to build up an expectation right until near the end - when you finally realize it's not gonna meet it) and it's still a good watch. Howl's drawn so suave and beautifully may I say :P",

Howl's Moving Castle is another living proof of his untiring work of art, a masterpiece to be exact. The Movie intrigued me after seeing Spirited Away and some of Hayao's famous pieces like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso and Castle in the Sky are just some of his successful works.Howl's moving castle isn't only and ideal imaginative anime one could witness. It is filled with inner depth and story of values one could appreciate. The story begins with Sofie, a young woman who lacks confidence later being cursed by a vindictive witch called \"Witch of the Wasteland\", and the only way to repel the curse is to find an unlikely immature young wizard named Howl. One remarkable facet of this animated movie is the upbringing of old chaotic wars into an unimaginable mix of existence of sorcery. The pace of the story doesn't saturate the mood by focusing only to the main characters. There are later revelations and reconciliations that made the story more likable. One good thing about Hayao Miyazaki's mood of story is that it doesn't spoil the movie's story by the usual predictable flow, but it will make one amazed with new twists and atmosphere. And most of all is how the Movie characterized the environment of the story, it rather creates and ecosystem one could appreciate how the movie occurs (well even though it is an animated film).Overall it is an outstanding achievement for Miyazaki, though it didn't win an Oscar, its still worth to collect and admire.",

            "content": "Almost everyone who watches Howl's Moving Castle praises its eloquent condemnation of senseless war or its inventive fantasy world\u2014and rightly so. But I don't think the movie is about either of those things. At its heart, Howl's Moving Castle is the coming-of-age love story of the flamboyant, elusive, immature wizard Howl and the mousy Sophie. If you read it as such and watch it closely, the somewhat puzzling details resolve themselves\u2014and you will even learn about love. Yes, this movie is unusually complex. But, never fear, you're in the hands of Hayao Miyazaki, a master storyteller, so you can trust that there is coherent meaning in every detail. I recommend watching the film at least twice: once just to enjoy and again to trace the various subplots (the missing prince, the draft-dodging, the curse-breaking, the time-traveling, the villain-vanquishing). You'll begin to find significance in the gentlemanly service of \"Turniphead,\" Sophie's shifting age, and Howl's first line in the movie, \"There you are, sweetheart. Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you.\" Even though Howl's Moving Castle is set in a fairy tale world, complete with witches, wizards, and demons, I find that the main story is readily applicable to the non-magical human. Here's how I would summarize it: Sophie and Howl are two dissatisfied loners, but they find the capability and the courage to protect each other and the family that they acquire through their adventures. Along the way, Howl's Moving Castle teaches us that true love . . .1. Enables us to see the potential in each other. 2. Grants us the courage we need to protect our loved ones. 3. Can prevent or end \"idiotic war.\" 4. Spreads beyond two people and embraces those around them. 5. Doesn't require us to be flawless or boring. But my favorite lesson on love occurs at the end of the movie when, in typical fairy tale fashion, Prince Charming finally appears to claim Sophie as his \"one true love.\" She, however, is all but oblivious to the prince because she's so unapologetically in love with Howl, the man that she's made a life with. The much-neglected truth here: true love, despite its challenges, is much more magical than a fairy tale love that doesn't require us to struggle and grow. There are lots of flawed ideas about love out there, but every time I finish Howl's Moving Castle, I experience an uncanny feeling of recognition that's best summed up by a song title from the soundtrack: \"Now that's Love.\"",

            "review_title": "Howl's Vain Imagination",
            "content": "I think Howl is perhaps the most fascinating character in this film because the first impression I had of him was completely shattered as the story progressed. At first, he seems to be this sort of superhero, crime-fighter\u0097one that is confident, clever, and courageous. This was made seemingly apparent when he saves Sophie from the Witch of the Waste's minions lurking in the alley. After being harassed, Howl dashingly comes to Sophie's rescue, literally sweeps her off her feet, glides through the sky with her in arms, and safely carries her to the top of her home balcony. Immediately I thought, \"He's like a charming superman.\" This impression was later changed quite dramatically when I realized how timorous Howl really is\u0097two scenes in particular stood out.First, when Howl comes home after fighting the sky wars he appears exhausted, trudges through the hallways and collapses on a nearby chair. Sophie watches him with caring yet surprising eyes: she's never seen him look so un-gaudy before. Howl's entire body then starts to liquefy into this greenish slime as it drips onto the floor\u0097he is wasted, disoriented. This was a particularly interesting shift in my perspective of him because he no longer carried that stereotype of the invincible superhero, but was subject to fatigue and pain. Second\u0097the more dramatic shift\u0097was during the scene when Sophie is talking to Howl sick in bed. Howl is complaining about how if he isn't beautiful there's no point to living. This was as shocking for me to hear as it was for Sophie. In this moment, the image of who we think Howl is\u0097the chivalry knight\u0097turns out to be a vain, insecure and superficial child. Even Howl's living space suggests his vanity: filled with all sorts of golden shrines and jewelry, sculptures and other materialistic idols. All of these idiosyncrasies, though, really made Howl's character alive; believable; real. I mean, superheros are often thought to be omnipotent, fantastical and ones who perform the impossible. Though people are typically drawn to these types of superheroes, no one believes they actually exist in external reality.I think Miyazaki purposely made Howl first appear supernatural so that he could later break that stereotype and show that even real superheroes are subject to certain frailties. This way the audience can really identify, connect and feel empathy for Howl's character. All of us want to have superhuman strengths but all of us are bound by imperfections; we all want to appear strong and confident, yet we all struggle with things that we're embarrassed to admit to others\u0097Howl is no different. His character reminded me of Steven Seagle's superman character in his graphic novel, \"It's a Bird.\" One line from this novel reminded me of Howl's persona: Alternate universes remind us that super heroes do not come from distant planets, but are harvested on this planet as ones that can see past their own little world, and reach out beyond their limited scope of existence and help others.For Howl to conquer his weakness and to become a true superhero, the irony is that he has to help those around him break the spells they are seduced by; rather than focusing upon his own supposed ugliness. This is where Miyazaki's theme really hits home: that in order to become great and powerful (like a superhero) you have to help others become great and powerful. It wasn't only Howl that had to accomplish this\u0097they all did. Sophie helps Turnip become a prince; Howl helps Sophie become young again, etc. Howl's problem was that he was so self-consumed that he was blinded by how to properly wield his magical powers: he was immature. He was even warned by the queen that if he did not carefully temper his skills, he'd end up like the Witch of the Waste\u0097corrupted. I think this is a really powerful theme because it clarifies several things. First, the importance of engaging in the relationships that surround us to get what we want; we can't isolate ourselves like hermits and throw pity parties like Howl did. Second, our need to bridle the gifts (i.e. superpowers) that come to us: not to abuse them or think we're better than others because we have them. If we do abuse them, we'll lose them like the Witch of the Waste.The use of animation also helps illustrate this theme more poignantly. It seems in my mind that to become a superhero you have to enter a different world\u0097enter a different state of mind; one that is fantastical and chimerical. Animation typically has that effect on me. That is, I feel that I've entered a completely different world and state of mind when watching something animated. I think to heighten the sense of reality that these characters live in, Miyazaki used the fantastical world of animation to help the audience to not only feel that they are part of a superheroes world, but also that they feel like superheroes themselves.",

The story of Howl's moving castle is mysterious and incredible. It is an illustration of the magical world that provides various stunning scenery. The production of this anime is perfect, the motion is smooth and clean. The anime covers color theory which could bring us to the wonderful world of Howl's moving castle. However, Howl's moving castle is not a realistic story. The story also presents the gap of the society which becomes a great war in animation and especially teaches me about self-worth. The one main character of Howl's moving castle, Sofia has a problem with being a confident person. There are various causes in her life. This point of a story became my inspiration for doing something. If you are going to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope this could be your inspiration either. One more thing which made Howl's moving castle the best animation is the soundtrack which has beautiful music notes such as 'Merry Go Round of Life', the perfect match included in the anime made the perfection and complete the magical world on the screen with the aesthetic orchestra band.Howl's moving castle animation is inspired from the original novel.

            "content": "In a climate where animation has moved from primarily hand-drawn to CG-inspired (thanks largely to Disney Studios and Pixar), Hiyao Miyazaki (a notable and well-respected figure in Japan) proves once again that hand-drawn animation can be moving, more picturesque, and more beautiful than its counterpart. This is another visual feast from Studio Ghibli; a true work of art.The story itself is a rather fascinating one, again catered for more mature audiences as opposed to children. The story develops at pace, and moves along smoothly until the last 20 minutes or so where the ending feels a bit rushed and out-of-time with the rest of the film. This may have been due to Miyazaki's intention to complete the film in less than 2 hours.For me, HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO was not as enjoyable as my first Miyazaki film, SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI. But that's not to say that I did not enjoy it thoroughly. One of my main complaints was that I did not feel as connected to Sophie as I did to Chihiro (of SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI). I also felt that Howl was a bit too petulant and moody for my liking. Nonetheless, the vast array of characters and creatures makes this a truly worthwhile watch. A final note about the voice acting (featuring Christian Bale and Emily Mortimer as the leads): it at times feels bland and generic and Billy Crystal has to step in to save the day with his comedic voice talents. Another problem that I personally had was the constant shifting of Sophie's appearance during the film, depending on who she interacts with, and what she does.Overall, this is a fantastic film, with awesome visuals, and a moving score to match. Not as amazing as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI, but a rewarding experience nonetheless. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 300 at 257. Strongly recommended.",

            "content": "Unsurprisingly, Studio Ghibli has done it again. Loosely based on the novel of the same name (written by Dianna Wynne Jones), Howl's Moving Castle is sure to entrance viewers from start to finish. The richly imaginative world is brought to life by stunning artwork that is typical of the japanese animation studio. And it was written and directed by the legend himself: Hayao Miyazaki. Need I say more?While reminiscent of a classical fairytale, the film ambitiously attempts to integrate steampunk elements as well. In short: Howl's Moving Castle is a whimsical whirlwind of everything you could ever want.Sophie Hatter, the protagonist of the film, begins as a reserved and decidedly unremarkable individual. Her character works in stark contrast to the flamboyant Howl Pendragon: a young wizard rife with power and pre-established potential. When the two fatefully cross paths, Sophie is quite literally swept off her feet by the legend himself. Unfortunately, this chance encounter ruffles the feathers of the scheming Witch of the Wastes, who fancies Howl for herself. In a spiteful fit of jealousy, the Witch casts a curse on the young hatter. Thus, the plot kicks off when Sophie wakes to find herself trapped in the body of a decrepit old woman. The gorgeously rendered kingdom in which the protagonists reside is inspired by the colourful city of Colmar, France. So, if the plot itself doesn't intrigue you, the beautifully illustrated landscapes are sure to have you hooked.Following the success of the critically acclaimed Spirited Away, this film certainly had big shoes to fill. And fill them it did. If anything, the enchanting tale of Howl's Moving Castle provides reassurance that Miyazaki has not yet lost his magic.",

            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. The animation is spectacular, the English dubbing is near perfect, and the story is complex and engaging that might move you to tears at certain points. The story is taken from the book of the same name written by the late Diana Wynne Jones. It follows a young woman named Sophie who owns a hat shop and leads a very sheltered life. Until one day she meets a strange wizard named Howl who literally sweeps her off her feet. Later she encounters The Witch of the Waste(an old flame of Howl's) who turns her into an old woman out of spite. Sophie now travels to Howl's Castle to try to break her spell and work as a cleaning lady. There she meets Howl's apprentice Markl, and a fire demon named Calcifer. Calcifer says if she can break a certain pact with him and Howl then he will try to break the spell that's on her.That's the basic plot behind the film but as we enter the middle of the film it becomes much more complex and it all leads up to a thrilling climax and Sophie trying to break the spell that's on her and Howl. This is not only my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie but it's also my second favorite animated movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",

Miyazaki is one of the best of genre, so it's difficult not to like this movie.Sophie is an ordinary teen with no self steam. Meets Howl, the hero, the wizard, the handsome man. Jealous, a witch turns Sophie to an old lady. The story continues through magic kingdoms, goddess, demons and wars.Like a fairy tale, Miyazaki criticizes war, jealousy, vanity, but storyboard could be better. Animation is great, with a huge living castle moving thousand parts at the same time. Kind of bizarre, but really good.Humor is everywhere. Isolated and adult, but the best comes with Calcifer, a simple demon. The fire of the castle. Simple, but funny.Worthy, even if you're not an anime addict.",

The design work of Howl's castle is very creative and steam punk-esque and the entire film has an amount of steam machinery such as cars, boats and trains etc. The voice acting is pretty good and I was surprised that Disney/Pixar had casted Christian Bale as the male protagonist, I always try and come up with a Batman impression of him for his character just for the fun of it. The fantasy of the plot is good but it's really not his best film but granted it's still a watchable film by the visuals of the film.",

I found the final plot to be somewhat incoherent and very problematic in terms of reinforcing negative gender stereotypes and un-empowering gender roles. For example, why is the main female character and an additional female character attracted to Howl when he is never around, highly volatile and outrageously needy? Why does the main female character give up her hat business to clean his castle? Why are age and weight the predominate indicators of social disgust and unattractiveness? Why does Howl's big scene displaying his love for the main character consist of little more than buying her gifts and showing off his power? Why is the broomstick the most considerate, caring male character in the picture and also the one that no one wants to be in love with? I have very little experience with children's films, but would like to think that a theater full of attentive, undiscerning children would be an arena that demanded a higher level of responsibility in terms of presenting characters that empower the viewers as opposed to propagate oppressive stereotypes.",

I just can't understand how Wallace & Gromit \u0096 The curse of the were-rabbit won the Oscar. Of course, this film is all the same inferior than Tim Burton's Corpse bride. The story is about a young hatter, Sophie, who casually meets Howl, a wizard. But a baleful witch misunderstands the sort of their relationship and transforms the poor girl into an old woman. So, Sophie becomes the governess of the Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is a great, not only in in the extent of Japanese animes, but he is a master of the world animation: for example, you must see the sequence of Howl and Sophie's flight. Miyazaki includes all of his favourite themes: the metamorphosis, the flight, a girl lead. Congratulations to the score by Joe Hisaishi.",

What can I tell you but it is a brilliant piece of film, successfully captivating audiences in it's bright colours, wonderful scenes, incredibly deep storyline, and that's not even half of what this film has to offer!The story begins in a coastal town where an insecure girl named Sofi owns a hat shop. On her way into town is confronted by a legendary wizard known as Howl and rescued from a group of strange morphing henchmen. She is immediately fascinated by his charms as is he but their meeting is short-lived as he disappears into the crowds soon afterwards. Later that evening, she is confronted in her shop by an overweight woman known as the Witch of the Waste, who begins to make snide remarks about her and her shop. When Sofi takes offence at her comments, the Witch punishes her by cursing her with the body of a hagged old lady, she is also unable to explain about the curse to anyone. With her inability to explain, she decides to leave home and venture into the Wastes outside of town, there, with the assistance of a strange hopping scarecrow, she manages to climb aboard Howl's Moving Castle, taking shelter from the cold winds. There, she meets the heart of the Castle known as Calcifer, a fire demon that gives the castle it's life with his power. Throughout the rest of the film, it is up to her, Howl, Calcifer and a young boy named Markl to help stop the war that is raging between theirs and a neighbouring nation, as well as keeping Howl free from being forced to fight in the war as wizards who do degenerate into Mindless Monsters.Again, a wonderful film that truly demonstrates the finest in animation skills and some of the greatest storyline's I have ever come across. A truly enchanting film that is well worth a watch!",

            "content": "In an alternate world where magic is taken granted, a young woman named Sophie Hatter, lives a quiet life. While her sister gets all the attention in the world, Sophie has accepted a far less visible role as a silent woman who works in the back room of her family shop. Then one day, by a misunderstanding, Sophie angers a powerful Witch of the Waste, who transforms Sophie to an old woman. Sophie starts to look for a possible cure for the spell and ends up working in a moving castle, run by Howl, a young sorcerer with a questionable reputation. How will a headstrong young/old woman who has finally started to come out of her shell manage with a vain and self-centered sorcerer, who might be her only hope?\"Howl's Moving Castle\" (Hauru no ugoku shiro, 2004) is loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel of the same name. Those who have read the book, especially if they loved it, should prepare themselves that although settings and the characters are mostly the same, the movie does not follow book from word to word, but makes its own version of the same situation. There are some rather notable changes; like that Howl's young student is much younger in the film than he was in the book. However, the themes of the book are present in the film, as well as characters have retained their personalities mostly. Wynne Jones herself gave the film her blessing and enjoyed it, so I guess there is no harm done.Technically the film is once again a delight from maestro Hayao Miyazaki, though it doesn't reach the heights of his previous works. The many details of the alternative, very European looking, world and the moving castle itself (which gives the feeling that it will fall to pieces any given moment) are amazing to watch. Joe Hisaishi also delivers once again a beautiful score to the film, also very European sounding. From the voice acting department I can only comment on the great original Japanese ones, though I've heard that the English dub is not too bad either. Biggest difference would probably be that in Japanese audio Sophie only has one voice actress, whereas in English dub her young and old self are voiced by two different women.After such amazing masterpieces as \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"Spirited Away\", \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a slight step back in Miyazaki's career. However, it certainly is not a bad film and easily outshines majority of western animations of the past five years. A recommendable film.",

One day, on her way back home, a group of young men harass her and this is where she meets the very handsome and stranger Wizard Howl (voiced by Christian Bale) who saves her, but at the same time gets her involved in a long bittersweet adventure. But, the Witch of the Waste is displeased with Sophie and Howl's growing friendship, and turns the pretty young woman into an ugly 90-year-old (voiced by Jean Simmons).Not knowing what to do, Sophie decides to take residence in Howl's moving castle as a cleaning lady, in an attempt to find a way to reverse the witch's spell with the help of Calcifer a demon in the form of fire who only takes orders from Howl and Markl, a young boy who protects the door which can open to 4 different worlds and dimensions.Adapted from a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, the film is a journey of enchantment, through the eyes of very wise Sophie. Despite her young age, she acts perfectly adequate in the skin of an old woman and becomes indispensable in Howl's moving castle. She adds feminine warmth, organization and her own natural charm to a group of wizards. She was warned from having her heart broken but Howl can see through her old face and does everything to protect her from evil wizards and wars while she brings sanity back to his life.Miyazaki teaches his viewers valuable lessons about life, love and wars with visually striking means. But above all he allows us to dream, to walk in the sky, to fight demons and make it all seem so logical and so real.

            "content": "Alright today I watched Howl's Moving Castle, my fourth film from Studio Ghibli and third film from Hayao Miyazaki. It's always hard for me to figure out where to begin with reviews for Ghibli movies since they're so unique. So, I won't really say much about what the movie itself is about because I didn't really know anything going in and I'll let anybody who watches the movie after reading this review do the same. Howl's Moving Castle has such a wonderful cast of characters, each of them brings something great to the movie and they all have vibrant personalities. This movie also has one of the most interesting worlds I've seen on screen (much like Spirited Away). Miyazaki just has a talent when it comes to his sheer creativity of crafting worlds and characters. This movie does involve the use of magic, and usually everybody gets all caught up in magic systems and their rules and whatnot, but Howl's Moving Castle doesn't even need to worry about that. The couple of rules for magic laid out for us make sense, but you're so immersed in the world and story that if there are any inconsistencies I didn't even notice because the movie is, well it's magical. Something that I've learned since I started watching way more movies is that it's not about understanding every aspect of this world and the magic, it's simply about what the movie makes you feel. Howl's Moving Castle has so much heart and definitely makes you feel something. The animation looks fantastic here as well, the whole movie is just really beautiful. The score here is also great, and the audio editing in general works really well. This movie is just really captivating and entertaining, my only problem is that it starts to lose steam before we get into the finale.\nOther than that, I didn't really have any problems. I feel like this review isn't as in depth or well written as my other reviews, but the truth is this movie is an experience, something I can't describe. I think I like it better than Spirited Away but I'd need to give it some time to decide. It is definitely a masterpiece, and I'm going to give Howl's Moving castle an 8.5/10.",

I still don't quite get everything that happened.That being said, I still love this movie. It's very engaging, well paced and, interesting. And retrospectively, it's a well written story character wise. It has a lot to say thematically about war and love. It's really compellingBut what really makes this movie actually work is, like I said, the well written characters. Sophie is a good protagonist. Not one of the absolute best Ghibli protagonists, but still good. Howl is an interesting enigma of a person. His heartless kindness is a strange mix that somehow still works.Markl & Calcifer make for very good supporting characters. Billy Crystal as Calcifer is probably the best dub in the movie. He's super funny. This movie in general is a lot funnier than most Ghibli films. The best scenes in this movie are the ones where all of them are just talking with eachother. The found family in this movie is wonderful.The animation is really good, especially on the castle itself. A great many excellent backgrounds as well. Like many other Ghibli movies, this movie has such a perfect sense of whimsy that's also mixed with a lot of genuine darkness. And none of it feels out of place. It's well balanced tonally The music is also pretty good. Nothing amazing but never ill fittingI really like this film. Its not perfect and I can definitely see why some think it's overrated, but it has great characters and a great sense of atmosphere. Also a fun magic system. Great movie.",

Some of the best moments and characters of the book are absent or have been changed significantly. For instance, many of the angry and exasperated interaction of Sophie and Howl have been cut. For example, Sophie's anger when she realizes that Howl and Michael know that she is enchanted through espionage, or the battle of Howl's suits. However, it is redeemed through excellent animation, artwork, and characterization. All characters are excellently played, although Howl and Calcifer are most true to the book. It is disappointing that Sophie is portrayed as insecure about her appearance, although that is done excellently. However, I simply feel that Sophie's reasons for suppressing her independence were excellent in the book (a feeling that she would not amount to very much due to tradition, and that if she could not realize her dreams, she must take care of her family) and that appearance is too often a concern for young women in movies. While appearance can be a major factor in limiting young women, it is not the only factor. Only discussing appearance shapes how young women will often react to discussing other problems: they will be less likely to. Even more worrisome, they actually may begin to consider the problems unimportant and singular to themselves.",

Now let me be the nail that can not be hammered down with the praises this movie wrongfully receives.When I first thought about writing my review I was thinking to start with this line \"Come one, come all and witness your favorite childhood story being murdered in the most horrific way possible\". Well I changed my mind. While I do not think that the movie version of Howl's moving castle is by any means a good movie I do not think that it is the worst thing out there either.Howl's Moving Castle that Hayao Miyazaki created surely is a bold move, it was taking on an already well known work and was destined to be faced with lots of nostalgic and overly obsessed fans and maybe that is why the movie is so weird and different from the original book. I mean sure Hayao Miyazaki's worlds have always been weird but you could explain them easily (except Nausicaa's movie) but with Howl's Moving Castle he took a step over the border to the gaga land.Howl's moving castle is beautiful, colorful and alive but it is also uninspiring and a re-skin version of Miyazaki's other movies. I believe that to escape the comparison between the book and the movie Miyazaki decided to create a retelling of the story which is loosely based on the book.The movie is emotional and the beautiful soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi helps you feel the emotions even better however that is all the movie is. A big 2 hour long Japanese anime filled with emotions that are not even justified. Sophie falls in love with Howl in no time, feels sad for him, tries to save him and saves him. Is Sophie a complex character? Well she used to be but then Japan's Walt Disney decided to turn her into a shallow character that we get nothing from but sobbing, smiling and calling Howl's name constantly. Is she heroic? well not really, is she the depressed character in the book? nope she is fine. She is a very normal person, she can actually even switch between her old grandma state to a little bit less older woman and the 19 year old girl state on the get go. The character is never believable and you do not really feel for her. You really do not feel for anyone of them. The story also does not help here. You already know that I am disappointed with the movie being so different from the original work but I would have been fine if we had received something like Akira in which you at least get some story line, even the weak story line that Nausicaa of the valley of the wind had would be fine but we get nothing. There is a war going on (going ahead of the books are we Miyazaki sensei?) and since this is a Miyazaki movie we must have that anti war message too but OK still there must be a place for improvement right? WRONG! That's it. A war is going on, everything else is just there. Witch of the waste? pfft, she is not the real villain she was just there to put the curse on Sophie for the sake of the plot, I am sure Miyazaki would rather had her not be a part of the movie just like Martha, Sulliman, Prince Justin of Ingary!!!, Howl's place of birth WALES! and other stuff like magic and stuff, who wants that right? All that matters here is the war that is going on and how bad it is. Howl is not really worried about the Witch of the Waste that 5 minutes in the movie sends a curse for him through Sophie, he is more concerned with the bombed cities of the coast lines. Howl does not fight a magic duel with Witch of the Waste in Porthaven instead fights a legion of flying creatures that once were wizards but subjugated themselves to the king (if you do not see how bizarre this movie is I don't know what more to write) and Mrs. Pentstemmon, Woops I meant Madame Sulliman. We do not read about Sophie's emotional struggles with being the oldest and being cursed and also jealous because Howl is a pimp but we get a 10 second scene in which Sophie goes under the rain and cries after Howl's outburst with slime but it is resolved as I said in 10 seconds when \"Markl\" comes to deliver the message that Howl needs help. By the way why is \"Markl\" a kid here? was it too hard to keep him a teenager? There is no way to feel any connection with any of these characters, Markl is underdeveloped, Howl is underdeveloped, Sophie is just there for no reason and the list goes on.You can not believe that this is a movie by the guy that made Spirited Away. As I said the scenery is beautiful and even though I would rather have the castle from the book, movie's castle is interesting too and the music by Joe Hisaishi is just perfect but that is all this movie has got for it.",

Only so much: The villages in this one and of course the castle are some of the sweetest, most charming and coziest places I have ever seen. They are the childish and nice brother of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. But now for the 3 things that made this movie a very exceptional pleasure for me: Hihn the dog, the scarecrow and Calcifer the fire. Where else do you see a paranoid flame, a dog with the voice of a chain smoker and a jumping stick with a tuxedo on? If you agree with me when I say these examples show the brilliant fantasy of Hayao Miyazaki and truly prove the reputation Studio Ghibli enjoys to be right, you will probably also cheer at the end of the movie, just like I did. Inside the universe of fairy tales, I am happy to have the Studio Ghibli, since this is the only studio to create stories for children and adults as well. I don't think I will ever get too old for their films. At least, that's what I hope.",

            "content": "I had heard great things about this movie and I'm a big fan of the other Hayao Miyazaki's films I've seen (Princess Monoke & Spirited Away) so I was sure I would enjoy this movie. Alas Howl's turned out to be my favorite Miyazaki film and is one of my favorite movies of all time.As in his other films the animation in Howl's Moving Castle was stunning. The behemoth walking castle, the vibrant colors of the various landscape, the ever-changing skies overhead, all contribute to the visual beauty of the movie. The plot of the film was fantastically woven with many surprises, delights, and triumphs which are a testament to both Hayao Miyazaki for the screenplay and Diana Wynne Jones for the novel on which the movie is based. A surprise for many viewers may be the depth of the characters in this animated film. All of the main characters are developed fully which allows the viewer to relate to characters that aren't even necessarily human, in addition to adding realism to each character. The steampunk technology and the mix of magic and science create a novel type of world for the film to be set in. Its intricate set-up allows the viewer to connect to something entirely different from the world he or she lives in by mixing realistic & fantastical elements. In fact I think one of the things that makes this film particularly astounding is the way it can turn the mundane into the magical. Things that all people can relate to (cleaning, aging, family, war, love) are taken from our world and put into the otherworldly realm of Miyazaki's imagination, where they take on a completely new light. I absolutely adore the film and it was an immediate 10/10 in my mind. The only thing I disliked was the feeling near the end when one knows the masterpiece is coming to a close which is, of course, unavoidable. Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely beautiful, beautiful film and I recommend it to everyone!",

            "content": "I have been a huge fan of Studio Ghibli films ever since I stumbled across Spirited Away one rainy afternoon. So when I realised this film was made by the same company, I was reluctant in case it didn't match the superiority of spirited away but decided to give it a go.The story follows Sophie, a young Hatmaker who is cursed by a witch that enters her shop into an elderly lady. Frustrated, she heads out into the countryside to find a way to break the curse and encounters a scarecrow that she names \"turnip head\". He leads her to the Moving Castle where she enters uninvited and meets Howls apprentice Markl and Calcifer, a fire Demon that is bound to the Castle and who's power is the key to its magic and movement. She bargains a deal with Calcifer to break his curse and he will in return break the curse placed upon her.Howl returns and Sophie announces herself as the new cleaning lady which seems to amuse Howl and he is happy for her to stay. From this point on although relationships are strained at first, there is a real development between the characters and they become a mismatched family in the moving castle.Sophie is a very important character within the film and most of the film focuses on her understanding that she is more than she thinks which is a common theme in most of the Studio Ghibli films. She goes to the city under the guise of his mother to speak to the Kings head sorceress, Sulliman. There she learns more about Howl, she confronts the Witch of the Waste who loses her powers and you begin to realise that most of Sophie's curse revolves around how she sees herself. There are clear moments where she completely returns to normal only to return back to an elderly lady when she loses her confidence.I won't spoil the ending because it has to be seen to be truly appreciated but the film is visually stunning, the characters are all very likable and easy to follow and there is a really good development between the characters. The imagination and creativity in regards to the film and the setting is wonderful and it's a film that everyone in my household enjoyed from my husband to my 9yo daughter. It's definitely a film that I would watch again as I think the second time it would be appreciated more.The English speaking cast do a great job of bringing reasonably realistic and accurate voice portrayal to original Japanese voiced characters.The voices fit the characters well, they convey emotions well and I really enjoyed watching it.",

The dubbing was excellent and the US casting blended beautifully with the gorgeous animation. I enjoyed it every bit as much as Miyazaki's other films, with the same brilliant dream world slight-of-hand that surprises you at every turn. Miyazaki has affection for even his most selfish characters, setting him apart from other animated features which still insist that all characters are either good or evil. It's important for young audiences to learn that bad actions aren't motivated by evil but by real human needs and emotions. If there is one message that needs to be shared in our world today, this is it.",

            "content": "The thing with a Miyazaki film is you don't simply watch the film, you step both feet first into his world, invest your heart and soul into the story unravelling in front of you piece by beautifully animated piece. you develop feelings for every one of his detailed, vibrant characters from the films swashbuckling hero to the tiniest of creatures and revel in the quaint and often logically challenging events that these characters go through . 'howl's moving castle' is no different to any other Miyazaki outing.One major difference the film has compared to both 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' is its slightly westernised setting, this is clear from the very first few shots central characters home town. The film focuses around a rather dreary, old before her time hat maker named Sophie, the eldest of what appears to be a rather large family of daughters she feels the heavy burden of being the eldest and carrying on the family business of making hats. Its not until a brief encounter with the mysterious and handsome sorcerer howl that you really begin to see the Miyazaki magic beginning to weave its web and my oh my what a web, shortly after her meeting with the enchanting, romanticized magician she comes into contact with another magically inclined being whose traits couldn't be further from howl's, she is the legendarily sinister witch of the waste, a rather large, grotesque and somewhat generously proportioned hag ( I mean to say she's rather fat). She is as ugly as she is powerful, as Sophie soon finds out when the insanely jealous witch places a curse on her as a result of her encounter with the elusive howl , Turning Sophie from a frumpily garbed yet captivating beautiful young woman into a time ravaged, grey haired old lady, as if that wasn't enough the witch reveals one final but sinister twist in Sophie's curse \" The best part about that spell, is that you can't tell anyone about it\" she chortles as she leaves Sophie reeling in despair and its here Miyazaki's tale really takes off, without revealing too much (more that is) Sophie heads off to the wastelands, a place teaming with the magically inclined and stumbles upon howls moving castle as well as a host of other equally endearing friends, including turnip head a rather tatter some scarecrow with a secret , the disgruntled but often hilarious Calcifer the fire demon and the imp like Markl a young apprentice of howl's. The film offers a sentimental, heart warming tale of a band of misfits who were lost within the realms of normality finding a place (and a family) somewhere they least expected to, inside howls moving castle. The film has major helpings of tyranny, war, love, hate and of course the oh so relevant subliminal messages all Miyazaki's lovingly crafted masterpieces contain. Stunning visuals, engrossing storyline and the deliciously dreamy score make howls moving castle a cut above the recent batch in computer generated animations which lack both the character and charm howls moving castle so poetically portrays putting it on par if not above its Miyazaki predecessors.",

            "content": "I know I'm going to get slammed by people who love the original book, which this movie is only very loosely based upon, but I have to say it. I like the improvised storyline of the movie that Hayao Miyazaki wrote compared to the original. Yes, the original is funny and upbeat whereas the movie is a little dark. But I don't care. To me, it's a beautiful love story with an anti-war message. I feel Miyazaki san is right to have Sophie as a not-so-pretty girl in the movie rather than somebody lovely like in the book. OK, it makes me feel good that at the end of the day, the kindness of Sophie ie the inner beauty, overcame superficial look. Howl's character in the movie is also more interesting and I thought the the producer made the right choice of having Takuya Kimura to provide the voice-over for Howl's character. It makes him really attractive and fascinating. Somebody wrote that that Howl's character might bring in the female audience like Haku character did in 'Spirited Away'. I must say that person could be right. I was in Kinokuniya a few weeks ago, looking at the Japanese books of Howl. There was this girl with her kid brother also looking at the same books and she commented to him that all her friends like Howl. I thought that was pretty funny considering that Howl is an animated character and not a real person. But Takuya Kimura really breathed life into Howl making him into a sort of devil-may-care, sometime brooding, sometime rascally, good looking wizard who is swoon-worthy, thanks to the animated artists.",

As always with the Japanese master, it was an outstanding feature; magical, real, intoxicating, wonderful, exciting and adventurous all at once. Still, this one, one of his last to date, was one of the best of the best.It tells the story of young Sophie, an insecure, silent and sad girl who works in her late father's hat shop. One day Sophie meets a young man who saves her from some bad soldiers. It turns out he is on the run himself, running from some strange creatures. When it seems that they are caught in the middle between them, the man suddenly jumps high up in the air, taking Sophie with him, and starts walking in the sky. That night, when Sophie is at home again, the women in charge of the followers turn up outside Sophies house...Like I've said, \"Hauru..\" is an always captivating movie, just like all Miayazaki-features, but this is even one of the best of them. 9/10",

            "content": "Diana Wynne Jones novel is adopted by film-making legend Hayao Miyazaki to create a subtle classic.It tells the story of Sophie, a simple city girl with low self esteem, who works in a hat shop in a Eurasian-fantasy country plagued by war. The local celebrity, Howl, is a mysterious magician about whom rumors fly like flocks of pigeons. After a chance meeting with the sorcerer, and an unfortunate encounter with a more infamous personality, the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is transformed into an elderly version of herself. In seeking a way to avert the curse, Sophie finds herself caught up in the twisted politics of the conflict, but more importantly, she discovers that it truly is love, in this case, the love of a family, that is the cure for war.What makes this story so brilliant is that the environment is removed from our earth completely, so that no racial structure or borders can be identified. This reveals the true madness of conflict, which is used as the background for the kind of enchanting story that one might curl up with on a rainy day--or even a sunny one. Studio Ghibli's textbook superior visions are on display once again to push forward the technical quality of the film, and the capable U.S. production team and cast have presented the story in a way that does justice to the visuals. For those who are thrown by the message, think nothing of it--it took me a few viewings as well. But I did come to realize that this is actually a rather powerful allegory for our own war-torn world, and the things that really matter within--the desire to love, be loved, and shun yourself for others based on that love. Perhaps, like a fine wine, it will gain appreciation with the passage of time.",

            "content": "Miyazaki follow's up the universally acclaimed Spirited Away with a heartfelt and wholesome film. I've been a bigger fan of Studio Ghibli music than its films but I was absolutely blown away by this film. It has just the right mix of children's tale with adult messages and art film themes thrown in to make a film of captivating depth.The film itself is visually superb. Every frame a painting is not taken lightly here. Every background looks like it was done over hundreds of hours with a paintbrush and the finer foreground details have bold lines and fine penciled details. There are absolutely no complaints. This is certainly one of the most visual anime films I have seen. The story itself is very whimsical - it reminds me of Alice in Wonderland or perhaps Dorothy running around the Wizard of Oz. Yet the themes of war and self-confidence and unconditional love it presents are very much adult focused. The characters are smart and memorable. There are absolutely no characters that blend in together. The dialogue is relatively sharp but the bond they all share is so damn wholesome I could not wipe the smile off my face for the entire second hour and a half. The bold moments are okay, but the film really shines in its tiny moments where everything just feels right. The visual cues relating to the plot are incredible. I can't sing the praises of the plot and writing enough. Despite it feeling somewhat loose, the plot feels very natural; it is fitting for the world we have been given.Oh and by the way, the music is breathtaking. But you already knew that.My only slight criticism is that the plot is a bit too loose at times. Sometimes you are left asking questions that only the book has answers to. Furthermore, the climax is fine, but would have been better served by slightly more setup.Hot take: I enjoyed this slightly more than Spirited Away.",

Howl's moving castle is his second adaptation of a novel by the same writer (The first being \"Castle in the sky\") and his latest film. It opens fairly quickly with not a lot of time to establish the characters, but then after a few other goes-by-fast events, the movie starts into an acceptable pace. Sophie is a young girl working for a hat-shop in a witch and wizard version of Europe. One of the most well known Wizards- Howl lives inside a giant legged castle, and is commonly believed to come down and steal the hearts (literally) of young and beautiful women. When the watch of the waste comes into the hat shop, after a brief argument of sorts, curses Sophie and turns her into an old woman. She then flees her town to the wastes in hope of finding a way to have the spell broken, and along the way finds a cursed scarecrow whom she asks to find a place to stay- and finds Sophie Howl's castle. When inside she meets Calcifur, a demon of flame who promises her he would break her curse if she freed him from Howl, he uses him as a slave. I do not know how close this adaptation is to the novel, as I have never read it, or even heard of the authors name until recently. This movie is extremely well done, as with Miyazaki's other films, but when it comes to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, or any of his other films, Howl's moving castle falls short. It's lacking some of what made his original films so unique (Not to say it doesn't have some of that style) and doesn't feel as fresh or interesting as his others.",

All the elements are there: gorgeous animation, interesting story, a beautifully crafted world and perhaps the most fun and imaginative cast of characters Ghibli has ever brought on screen. Yet, staggeringly , the elements never quite come together, and the end result feels more like a collection of bits than one coherent whole.The story is ultimately the movie's downfall: whereas previous Miyazaki films have had either a strong narrative (Laputa, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke), or a character-focused approach with barely any story (Totoro, Ponyo), Howl's Moving Castle falls somewhere in the middle and suffers gravely for it. There are many strong characters with their own stories, yet there is also the main plot to keep track of, and these two ultimately don't mix. The main focus seems to get lost time after time, as plot twists appear seemingly without any setup. It's also strangely difficult to describe Howl's character: Is he a superficial douche? Is he a wise and kind yet young wizard? Is he a cold bystander or a tormented power tool torn by his indecision? I myself never really figured it out.But all the things Miyazaki is known for are still here: the animation is beyond beautiful, the score is great (if not very memorable), the sheer amount of imagination brought on-screen is amazing and the characters, especially Calcifer, are delicately crafted and all likable. It's just sad that the messy story overwhelms these aspects, and the end result feels uneven and in need of streamlining.Recommendation: This movie will undoubtedly be understood better by those who have read the novel. For those who haven't I would recommend adjusting your expectations. Don't watch this movie for the story, just let yourself drown in the visuals and the atmosphere.",

The plot barely resembles Jones's original creation and the characters, who mostly bear the same names, have lost nearly all semblance of their original personalities.While Miyazaki's world is rich in color and imagination, it is most definitely Miyazaki's world, and hardly Jones's at all.I am exceedingly glad I saw the movie before reading the book, as I would have been too distracted by the complete deviation from the book to enjoy the wonderful voice acting, art, and music provided by the Japanese crew. (I have no desire to see the film dubbed into English, as screen actors and not voice actors have been cast in the roles.) As is, I am still able to appreciate the very excellent craftsmanship that went into the film. However, those who enjoy Jones's works should be forewarned that this is not the same tale, and one should not expect much to be the same. Had the title and names been changed, one would never have recognized it for the same story.Aside from the lack of resemblance to the original work, the film was also somewhat confusing, and ended abruptly, as though they ran out of time or paper. And isn't that the same girl from Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke)? What happened to Sophie's red-blonde hair, to say nothing of Martha! Doesn't Michael look a bit young for fifteen? Sophie's entire transformation, both first and last, go almost thoroughly unanswered for. Howl's directness of comment, \"slithering,\" and his penchant for beautiful young girls go quickly by the wayside in adapting him to screen.However, if you like Miyazaki's works in general and for their own merit, you will probably greatly enjoy Howl's Moving Castle, as I did (before reading the book).",

            "review_title": "Howl's Moving Castle - A Flawed Delight",
            "content": "Supreme Japanese animation lord Hayao Miyazaki's latest film release, Howl's Moving Castle, is both a solid success and a slight failure. Based upon the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle lacks nothing in terms of imagination or strong characters. Despite being adapted from the novel, the film still reeks of the delicious Miyazaki flavor, and fans of his previous work will be right at home. In fact, Howl's Moving Castle has such a Miyazaki-esquire plot that one would never infer that it's based upon a novel.One would think that being based off of a book would ensure a detailed and nearly perfect plot. The plot, however, is the movie's greatest shortcoming. While it starts off as intriguing, it eventually deteriorates into a somewhat sloppy, vague mess. The film's most significant and apparent plot devices seem rushed and lack necessary background info, forcing the audience to fill in many dark areas based upon their own inferences. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if the movie didn't have the habit of merely alluding to the slightest of implications.For instance, the entire cataclysm for Howl's plot is the Wicked Witch of the Waste putting a curse on main character Sophie which turns her into an old woman. The witch walks into the girl's shop after hours for no apparent reason (though in the book it's made clear that the witch is in actuality dissatisfied with a purchased garment; this is never brought up in the movie), bullies poor, innocent Sophie, and then sets her curse without a second thought. It isn't until much later in the movie that the audience can even begin to piece together a strong reason why the witch would do such a thing to Sophie (it seems to me that it has to do with a strong jealousy in regards to the character known as Howl), and even then the audience doesn't gain much evidence from the movie to support such interpretations. In fact, the entire plot line suffers from similar faulty foundation: the entire war situation is barely developed, the declared love between the two main characters seems to come out of nowhere (sure, the film has its charming subtleties in this regard \u0096 don't think I missed them \u0096 but it seems a bit unrealistic that the two characters would be so settled on their feelings), and the main villain is utterly wasted.What the movie lacks in terms of plot is more than made up for in almost every other aspect. The animation is perhaps the finest I have ever experienced: I was on the verge of goose bumps the first time I saw Howl's castle walk across the fog-shrouded landscape. Just as impressive are the sprawling environments that the characters find themselves in. The interior of Howl's castle is beautiful and unique, particularly Howl's bedroom. Howl's \"secret garden\" is awe-inspiring, and all of the various towns have a very real look to them. The numerous aircraft are also lovingly detailed and are certainly something that Hayao Miyazaki is to take pride in considering his love for planes and flight sequences.Howl's Moving Castle also has some of the most fantastic characters ever conceived in an animated movie. Every single one of them, no matter how major or understated, is absolutely bursting with personality. Much of this is attributable to Miyazaki's distinctive art style, but the writing and situations are perhaps most important in developing the characters. Take special note when main characters interact with secondary ones: oftentimes, the underplayed characters are perhaps the most interesting, particularly Sophie's mother: she's even more detestable than the main villain, even despite her subtle deviance.Also worth noting are the movie's numerous and potent messages. While Miyazaki's pro-nature messages are growing to be a bit pedestrian (and are a lot less pungent here than in Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds), his thoughts on greed and love are quite different than anything he's preached before. Indeed, the sheer beauty of this movie's messages is that they're so effective because of the wonderful characterization and the glorious art. At one pivotal point in the movie, the Wicked Witch of the Waste is transformed into a most miserable state, which is perhaps the most powerful tool in conveying the sorrowful yet human anti-greed message.All in all, despite a somewhat frail plot, Howl's Moving Castle is a resounding success. It's not creative enough to top Miyazaki's Spirited Away, nor is it deep or serious enough to be considered on par with his masterpiece Princess Mononoke, but it is a worthy entry to his overall legacy. Fans young and old alike should experience this film, and they should definitely bring a friend. You'll laugh, and with a bit of luck, maybe shed a tear or two. Maybe. If you haven't seen any of Miyazaki's past work, this is perhaps not the best place to start as it certainly isn't his best work. If you're hungry for more, however, make no mistake: this is a movie worth seeing.* * * out of * * * *",

If this is the case, how can Sophie say that she loves Howl so easily? They barely know each other.There really isn't an Evil Antagonist that they fight together throughout the movie. The first witch enacted the curse, so you would assume that she was the antagonist. And then she joins the house later on. This idea is stupid.Then you had the Master Sorcerer as the Antagonist for no reason, after she praised Howl and said that she wanted Howl to join her.The idea about Howl's Heart is stupid as well, and how it was solved at the end.This Anime sucks, and it lacks a lot of requirements that makes an Anime great.",

There were some background scenes (inside the castle) that were painted photo realistically, yet as a viewer, I did not find them jarring with the foreground characters at all. Also, the CGI elements blended in perfectly.The bad: Plot? What plot? The plot didn't make much sense.On the whole, the lack of plot didn't effect me much at all because I was too busy putting myself in Sophie's shoes or else ogling at the amazing animation. This movie had me on a very emotional level.Other interesting little tidbits: There were many similarities between this and my other favourite Miyazaki film- Laputa: Castle in the Sky. Some of the scenes seemed to be updated shots from Laputa. In fact, I had a sneaking suspicion that the two films were set in the same alternative universe. And I wasn't in the least bit surprised when Pazu (from Laputa) made a very brief appearance about 20 minutes into the film. Catch him if you can.Conclusion: Don't expect a coherent plot line.

The characters are all fabulous, detailed, and full of depth and life; my favourite parts of the movie are just watching these people be themselves (my favourite part of the entire film is when Sophie first arrives at the Castle and goes about cleaning and making breakfast). The animation and score are both superb as always and add a lot to the viewing experience. There's just nothing I dislike about this movie, and contrary to other Miyazaki films I find it every bit as gripping upon multiple rewatches.

The general story is so utterly fantastic that you immediately know that it can't happen in real life. My only complaint is that there are so many times where it justdoesn't make ne sense. At the start of the movie, well, you basically have to take a long time to make sense of everything thats happening, especially since if u don't comprehend Japanese, everything has to be co-ordinated between your reading and watching. The ending really disappointed me, because it basically made so little sense it ruined (to a small extent) the wonderful experience of Howl's moving castle. What do I say? I recommend it to everybody, because it really has a good blend of the ingredients for wide appeal movies. Don't watch ne voice over versions, it completely ruins the delicate balance the movies achieve, especially when one character's lines stretches for 5 seconds after the animation's mouth has stopped moving.",

            "content": "Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is truly in a league of his own. His fantasy, tedious attention to details, unpredictable and gripping style all make his work stand out. And what I mean by stand out is that it really captivates you, every scene makes you demand for more and at the same time wonder how could one think of something this surreal. Yet, no matter how surreal, vivid, and sometimes outright ridiculous Miyazaki might seem at times, his work is still full of valuable lessons, meaningful comparisons and fairy tale-like emotions. Howl's moving castle is no different.Our antagonist is a hat maker Sophie, who, due to a spell had been turned into an old woman, and a brave young wizard named Howl, who constantly spends his time in a constantly moving castle, powered by a quirky little ball of fire named Calcifer, who itself is a part of Howl's heart. Howl's moving castle takes us on a beautiful, thrilling and breathtaking journey that introduces us to some of the funniest and bizarre characters a viewer would expect to see. All the characters however are there for a reason and each little story, from Sophie helping the witch that cast the spell on her to Howl constantly running away from his problems, are there to teach us a lesson. But not in the kind of a way Madagascar or Ice Age would. Miyazaki really forces us to think and come to our own conclusions. I think this is the essence of all truly great films \u2013 everyone takes lessons of their own out of them.Howl's moving castle, like most Moyazaki's films, is a true work of art. The plot is thrilling, unpredictable, subtly funny and remarkably original. The animations are stunning. The details in every scene will leave you dazzled and amazed, to say the least. The classical music soundtrack, that is constantly fading in and out is perfectly in tune with the beautiful style and scenery. Yet again, Hayao Miyazaki manages to raise the bar on what true animation and story telling is really about. A near perfect film.",

Unlike other Japanese anime directors he doesn't get weighed down in pointless fights and explosions (which the exception of his early film, \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds\"). When watching his films you get a feeling of beauty in the artwork that can't be experienced through any other genre of animated films. \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is no exception.Like a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is lacking somewhat in plot and it is this aspect of his films which causes much distaste among a great deal of Westerners. You can see where they're coming from, things are slow moving, confusing and rarely explained but that's what gives the film its sense of secrecy and mystery. Its sense of magic.The characters are arguably the best yet providing a believable and indefinable approach to them. They can also be side-splitting; I found myself laughing far more in this film than in any Disney production. Also, as is often a trait with his films, Miyazaki does not create an obvious \"baddie\" but provides us with real characters to whom you can relate to, even if you don't agree with their cause.Hayao Miyazaki is at the top of his game. No where else will you find such love and devotion dedicated to all of his films and there is no better film than \"Howl's Moving Castle\" to illustrate that. Some complain about its differences to the book it's based on by Diana Wynne Jones, and yes, it IS very different, but that was the intention. She was recorded to say in an interview: \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u0097I write books, not films. Yes it will be different from the book\u0097in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\" I couldn't agree more.",

His other two that I have watched are Kiki's Delievey Service(Not really confusing just boring),and Spirted Away(confusing,and UBER boring). So I was real skeptical on liking this one when I hated the others. Well imagine my surprise when not only did I like this movie,but have watched it a total of 7 times(about to be eight once I finish writing this review LOL!)just to see the memorable,lovable characters. I guarantee that if you don't like anything else you will love them. They are so endearing. Even the sub-characters make this movie.Plot: Sadly, if I was going strictly by plot when rating this movie I'll give it a 4 because it needed some huge work,but happily I went with the flow because the characters are so great.Characters. I LOVE them. You have Howl a vain, effeminate,metrosexual,cowardly wizard that literally has no heart,and is voiced by Cristian Bale. Let me just say Bale's voice MADE Howl. It is sexy as hell. I have re-watched Howl's scenes over, and over, and over just to hear him speak!Sophie a young women who's confidence is so low that she thinks she's ugly,and has a spell put on her by a obese witch(seriously)that is obsessed with Howl for some reason,and who turns Sophie old. She try's to find away to break the curse and ends up in Howls Castle. Howl and Old Sophie play well of each other,and the ending is so sweet.If you are wandering yes her and Howl get together eventually.When she's old her confidence is higher then it ever was when she was young.The there's Cacifer a wisecracking,hilarious fire demon who has a strange link to Howl. He is voiced perfectly by Billy Crystal.Lastly out of the main characters is a young apprentice of Howl's who's sweet,and funny also.Music. Most is very good. Almost eerie in some parts.Visuals: Good for hand-drawn animation.Bottomline: If you just don't like Japanese animation ,but want to see this movie rent it or watch it on you-tube like I did. The characters make this movie and just to see them in action I implore you to check this movie out. Forget the shaky plot(First and last time I'll ever say that. That is how fantastic the characters are)and just watch for them. 6 1/2 stars",

Anyone less than physically perfect and young will be outraged by Miyazaki's indefensible tying together of youth, beauty, and kindness. In Miyazaki's world, as in most Japanese anime, goodhearted characters are not permitted to be ugly, and vice versa. Old age is ridiculed nonstop throughout the film.The film is sexist in the sense that women's chief preoccupation is romance, housekeeping, frilly hats, and child-rearing, while men are portrayed as warmongering metrosexual tin soldiers.The dubbing into English goes fairly well, though the original Japanese is so curt that the voice actors clearly struggle to say their lines rapidly, thereby losing much of the emotional inflection that the lines deserve.There's also an embarrassing oversight in the voice casting: one character magically becomes old and young versions of itself (without time travel), and when the age alters, the accent stupidly switches from British to American. The voice casting was sloppy-- it should have kept the accent uniform.",

S. Lewis in the foreword to \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Apparently, a similar growing up overtook me. I had a strange attitude towards Miyazaki - on the one hand, I've watched and highly appreciate almost all of Ghibli's movies, which were not filmed by Miyazaki, but on the other hand, this were his movies, except for \"The Wind Rises\", which I did not ever bother watch completely. The same applies to the \"Howl's Moving Castle\" and \"Spirited Away\", which I began to watch several times, and was utterly bored somewhere in the middle. It's funny, but something unlikely brought me back to both films - the mythological symbolism in the pattern of interaction between masculine and feminine principles and proper representation of a female archetype in Miyazaki's movies. Indeed, what Miyazaki was filming are true fairy tales with the structure and symbolism of myths. Both \"Castle\" and \"Spirited Away\" tell about becoming feminine, about the transformation of girls into young women, their interaction with \"monsters\" - a male archetype embodied in one case in a shapeshifter-wizard, gradually forgetting himself and losing his humanity; in another case, in a shapeshifting river dragon, who has forgotten his name. Both beauties must first find their femininity in order to free the \"monsters\" (from the deal with the demon / evil sorceress), return them to normal from the borderline, awaken them as men. The heroines of these Miyazaki movies are the embodiment of femininity. They find their true strength and splendor through acceptance of their femininity, rather then through denial of femininity and imitation of men. They self-actualize through acceptance of their nature and following the greater good, not through self-denial and mimesis of men like Rene Girard would probably say and as it is customary to portray lately through the trope of a \"strong independent woman\", which is in the essence is epitome of self-denial and radical form of misogyny. Such self-denial and mimesis could only lead to conflict, scapegoating and destruction. Not so in the \"Castle\". The masculine and feminine are embodied here in a proper way, acquire completeness and integrity, creating harmony and the feeling of a fairy tale. Traditionally for Ghibli, the story is implemented through gorgeous animation and beautiful music, woven into the atmosphere of this fairy tale, which can absorb and hold your attention for two hours if you are still young enough or already old enough to love fairy tales.",

If you read many of my reviews you should know that I belittle movies for not being faithful or capturing the spirit of their source material, however I have not gotten around to reading this book so I'll just review the movie for how it is. Like most movies Howl's Moving Castle follows the three act structure, and to be honest I had a different reaction of each of the movies acts. I really loved the first act. An insecure girl is stricken with old age by a witch so she becomes the cleaning lady for the infamous Wizard Howl. This follows the usual Miyazaki formula, a simple premise, likable characters and top it off with some of the best hand-drawn animation you'll ever see, by the way the movie was going I was looking forward to the rest of the movie. However I did love the first act I just like the rest of the movie. The middle of the film some subplots drop their anchors and it started getting very needlessly confusing; Like how Howl was a lover with the witch of the wastes, and Howl as even worse self-esteem then Sophie (Hilarious scene, if you've seen you know what I'm talking about), Howl's hearts is lost or something, there is a witch who wants to take everyone's powers away and there was something about a war etc. Yeah like I said it get a lot more complicated then it needs to be.By the time the third act rolled around it was just a mess. I have to many spoilers in here already so I'm not going to say anything about, like I said before if you have seen the movie you should know what I mean.But with that said, even with it's problems aside the movie still has the magical, innocent, and heart-warming charm that only Hayao Miyazaki can deliver. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "First to note: This is probably one of the best English VA'd Miyazaki films, especially for Calcifer (who is portrayed perfectly by Billy Crystal.) Anyway, this is another solid Miyazaki film, though probably not his best. The film begins with a character named Sophie in another magical world. There is a French commune undertone in the city. She is transformed into a very old woman and learns to live with her problems by living in well, a magical Moving Castle with Howl, Calcifer, and Markl. The plot becomes convoluted by the end but overall, it's the relationship between these characters that makes the film what it is.However, the villain is a bit underwhelming here, the oddity between Calcifer, the Witch, and Howl is strange, and the ending has a deus ex machina feel to it. At least past the scene at the King's castle, the movie feels quite rushed as well which results in the ending feeling a bit too weak compared to his other films.As with most of Ghibli's films, it deals with the environment. The main girl is also older than in many of other Miyazaki films, being in her late teens rather than early or younger like in other films. It is overall different but similar, but not the best of either type.7.7",

I have not read the novel (by Diana Wynne Jones) that the film is based on, and as much of the story that the film did convey is going to get me to check out the novel. I am betting that the cutting that was done was HUGE.I thought the PG rating was a little much, I'm fairly sure I've seen 'G' ratings with more objectionable material.

            "content": "I liked this one even better than Princess Mononoke, as it maintained the focus on its main character far longer than the latter (which lost itself in the greater plot.) Visually stunning, I quickly found myself wishing to visit the magical vision of Europe that Miyazaki provides.Somewhere in the cross between steampunk and fantasy, we're introduced to a semi-industrial city on the borders of a rugged, green waste. Sophie is a young, plain girl who works in a hat-shop, and is, entirely by accident, caught up in the affairs of wizards when a mysterious stranger rescues her from a pair of churlish soldiers. Soon after this Sophie is assaulted by a jealous witch. Left with the fall-out of this encounter, Sophie refuses to feel sorry for herself, but sets off into the waste to remedy the problem, where she meets a number of eccentric characters. Romance ensues.From a character standpoint, Sophie is a marvelous heroine, providing a down-to-earth contrast to the beautiful, self-important wizard Howl, though the romance between the two did not quite convince me (her falling for him made much more sense than vice versa), much like that of Mononoke. I think this would have worked better if Howl had been given more character scenes, he was a little bit too idealized and feminine (Manic Pixie Dream Boy?). The whole relationship felt like Jane Eyre opposite a more perfect Mr. Rochester. But quibbles aside, it's still a lot of fun, incredibly creative and beautiful. Miyazaki, once again, thoroughly wowed me with his sumptuous visuals. I'll be watching again.",

            "review_title": "One of Hayao Miyazaki's most structured and intriguing films",
            "content": "Howl's Moving Castle is a 2004 film directed by one of my favorite film- makers, Hayao Miyazaki. The movie is based on a series of books by Diana Wynee Jones. The use of romance and sacrifices made for each other to help rise each other to the top while working together makes the film very delightful and enjoyable to experience. There are many friendship and teamwork lessons within the film which makes it great for audiences of any age. The magic and fairy tale like theme makes it spectacular watching the use of good and evil contradict each other but you eventually realize that each character has a justified reason to their actions which ends in delight for even the not so good characters in the film. Everyone deserves a happily ever after and Hayao Miyazaki shows that well in this piece.Insecurity is a large influence in this film. Sophie, a hat maker who works in her father's shop, is practically saved by Howl and literally swept off her feet from perverted officers while walking to her sister's bakery and that is when her life is changed forever. Howl is a wizard with a moving castle that he uses to flee from the dangers of his magic powers. Sophie is eventually cursed by the Witch of the Waste since she was seen with Howl and turned into an old woman. The catch to the curse is, she is not allowed to talk about what has happened to her. This reaches out to audiences and allows them to relate to Sophie's insecurities with how accepting she is to being an old woman. She eventually sets off on her own adventure to figure out how to reverse the curse which leads up to magical experiences and teamwork with involvements of romance and friendship.Despite Sophie's low self confidence, she put on a brave face and made it to an empty land where she befriends a scarecrow which leads her to Howl's castle that she uses for shelter for the majority of her adventure. The fire that keeps the castle moving is a demon called Calcifer who is under a curse which keeps him stuck as being nothing but a fire. Also living in the castle is a young wizard in training called Markl. Sophie, Howl, Calcifer and Markl all support and make sure each other are safe and secure. Howl was a coward but with the help of his friends he becomes one of the strongest happiest wizards in the land. Disaster strikes when Howl is called to war. The spinning dial at the front door is a portal to different parts of the land. Sophie poses as Howl's mother and is accompanied by the Witch of the Waste and a dog to Madame Sullivan's castle, who is the ruler. The Witch of the Waste is stripped of her powers while Sophie explains how Howl is not able to fight his battles. Once Madame Sullivan angers Sophie, Howl must come to the rescue to escape back to home when they are joined by the Witch of the Waste and the ruler's dog. This part demonstrates strength, Sophie originally went to the castle to explain Howl's failures but then allows Howl to gain courage and save the love of his life. From this point forward, Howl is portrayed as a hero and a fighter. He goes through weakening battles during the war to protect his true love, Sophie, and to help defend his land. Miyazaki demonstrates character development in many ways starting with Howl's bravery. In addition, the deeper Howl and Sophie fall in love the more Sophie is able to embrace herself and reverse the curse on her own. You notice throughout the film sometimes Sophie looks younger than other times and those are the moments when she is feeling confident. The more that goes wrong, the more Sophie is able to allow her strengths to shine and she becomes a more secure person. As you can see, I am amazed by the story line leading up to Sophie's confidence rising. The Witch of the Waste follows this pattern when she discovers Calcifer holds Howl's heart within his flames. She grabs the heart which results in disaster for everybody, but when the situation becomes more content, Sophie persuades her to give the heart back and save Howl's life. The use of examples of growing from your troublesome experiences makes it an eye opener to audiences to realize that when life gets rough, you can always find a way to prevail. The life lessons in this film are outstandingly portrayed by the producer. He never fails to provide a strong female role in his films which implies self confidence and examples of leadership for girls everywhere. Sophie may seem stronger than Howl in the beginning of the movie, but by the end they balance out each other's strengths and weaknesses to make a great team. Friendship is a major component in this movie. Calcifer is set free of his curse but returns to his friends as the free spirit he is. In addition, the scarecrow saved the crew from falling like an avalanche from the top of a mountain once Calcifer's spirit is freed, but once Sophie kisses him on the cheek, his curse is reversed showing that she is his true love. He is very accepting to the fact that Sophie loves someone else and just wants to do the best for his people by attempting to put an end to the war. The ending is well for everyone, even Madame Sullivan! When the dog somehow checks in with her through a crystal ball, she decides to put an end to the war due to seeing Howl using the potential of his powers and finding his true love. In Miyazaki's movies, he uses his knowledge of every soul developing so they deserve their happily ever after no matter how cold they may seem.",

I cried so hard I felt in the souls of my feet.

I have read articles saying that villains in Miazaki's movies are never really all bad. The witch of the waste in this movie was used as an example. I somewhat disagree. While the witch was indeed on the darker side of the moral spectrum, she was not the true villain. The king character, whose motives are never clarified in the dub, seems to be bad with no redeeming qualities. So there goes that theory. I've heard a rumor that this will be Miazaki's last film. It does contain references to his other films throughout, such as the black ooze characters, which strongly resemble Noh Face from Spirited Away. It would be appropriate for him to pay homage to his earlier works if he is indeed no longer going to make films. It also creates a very sad blanket over the film.",

Eventually, though, Howl learns to cope with his altered appearance, and he and Sophie develop a relationship with each other. It is a storyline that is almost like Beauty and the Beast in a sense; in both instances, you have the man in the relationship who has been \"dehumanized\" or turned into a monster, while you have the woman who wants to bring out the man trapped inside the monster.

If not familiar with his name, Miyazaki-san also created \"Spirited Away,\" \"My Neighbor Totoro,\" \"Porco Rosso,\" and \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds.\" Howl's Moving Castle is his latest film to date and is sure to be an instant classic.The story follows nineteen-year-old Sophie, a shy girl with a lack of self confidence who works in her family's hat shop. Everybody in town is talking about the mysterious Wizard Howl who arrived recently- they can't wait to meet the handsome wizard! Sophie, however doesn't bother with the gossip and decides to walk to her sister Lettie's work and pay her a call. While walking to her sister's job, a bakery, she turns down an alley and runs into two soldiers. Shy and a bit confused, she tries to avoid their flirting, but fails.... A handsome blonde man saves her from the flirts, but involves her into his own escape- from the dreaded Witch of the Waste's henchmen. The man takes hold of Sophie and lightly lifts her up and flies through the sky. He drops her off at her sister's work and flies off. Could it be the mysterious Wizard Howl?!?!?!? When Sophie returns home from her sister's, she closes the hat shop. A large, bulging woman enters the closed shop, jeers Sophie, and when Sophie sticks up for herself, the woman turns Sophie into an old woman. The woman admits that she is the Witch of the Waste and leaves speedily. Sopie is then left with the problem of being a nineteen-year-old girl who is stuck in an eighty-year-old's body. Sophie leaves her house and job to find a cure for the curse. She finds a scarecrow on the way and he leads her to HOWL'S CASTLE! She falls asleep by a fire and wakes up to see Howl's apprentice, Markl. She tells Markl that she's the new cleaning lady. Howl arrives back to his castle... but Howl's the handsome man from the day before!!!! What could this situation evolve into....?If you find it hard to love the remarkable, AMAZING story, you won't be able to help falling in love with the colors, detail, and the scenery of this animation. The Japanese and the English voice actors are great, but I recommend listening to the Japanese- it's a great version and has much more detailed dialog (the English subtitles are good, too).

The film is based on the novel with the same name, written in 1986 by British author Diana Wynne Jones.The story is set in a fantasy kingdom with magic and 20th century technology. It tells about a girl named Sophie. She works in a small shop. One day a witch enters the shop and curse her into an old woman. So she escapes from the city ans encounters a wizard named Howl. He has a castle, but it's a very special castle. It has mechanism that lets it wander around, so the location always changes. Together with the wizard Sophie experience exciting adventures. Of course, she hopes that the wizard could disband the curse: that is one of the reasons why she follows the wizard. And at home, no-one would recognize her, or they would have been scared of her and who knows what they would have done to her.I chose this movie, because it has a deep meaning that gets clear while you're watching the movie. The film shows many facets. It contains strong anti-war themes, influenced by Miyazaki or to be more precise, the whole movie is influenced by Miyazaki's life. In an interview, he explained his love of flying and said that he used to like playing with army planes. But later he also developed a hatred for it. Since these were created to bring destruction. Even that the film is a fantasy story and animated, it is very realistic, except for the magic. Howl's Moving Castle is a very beautiful story that is made for children but also for adults. A perfect film for the whole family.",

For a brief summary of the plot, Howl is a young yet powerful wizard who is very sought after by girls infatuated with him and by the King that wants to recruit his services to the ensuing war. Sophie, a young girl working at a hat store, is cursed by a witch that turns her in to an old woman. As she wonders out of town she ends up working as a cleaning lady in the moving castle where Howl roams about in the countryside, escaping the frantic of civilization. There she meets a fire demon that recognizes her spell and tells her of a mysterious spell that links him with Howl. Howl's moving castle is a touching love story and fantasy fable all rolled in to one. Of course, Myiazaki's trademarks (and Ghibli's production values) are very much present here. The painted landscapes are just breathtaking, among Myiazaki's best drawings. In deed the fictitious country where the movie takes place, that could very well by from turn of the century Europe, has much of nature depicted through these landscapes as of civilization and technology starting to boom from its cradle. Here magic and wizards are a part of society and the front line on the upcoming war with the neighboring country. War, civilization opposed to nature, the difficulties of growing up, all of these are usual themes in much of Myiazaki's work and are here presented in a way reminiscent of some of Disney's nineties classics. Another interesting fact, also common to many of the director's movies, is that some key elements from the story are suggested radder than explicitly presented, allowing you to sink in with every new viewing and reevaluating it's relevance in the Japonese master's work. A truly wonderful experience, that only a handful of directors know how to do. Despite it's inevitable similarities and comparisons with other Myiazaki movies (which tend to arouse criticism), Howl's moving castle is, first a foremost, a beautiful love story!",

            "content": "My first experience of Miyazaki's work was 'porco rosso / crimson pig' and I still consider that his best movie with Howl's Moving Castle running a some way behind.Howl's Moving Castle has an opening scene that reminded me of 'porco rosso' (namely the enthusiastic crowds cheering on the military parade). At this stage I was thinking that this would be a collage/mix of his other movies - and indeed most of the characters are drawn in similar style to the 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' movies.The plot is good as always (although primary credit must go to the original author). I find the worth of his movies to be in the plots and sub-plots that he puts into them. His movies seem to impart morality much more convincingly than anyone else (disney are you listening). And I agree totally with another reviewer when they said that Miyazaki can masterly blur lines between an enemy and a friend. This is what Disney should try and be like - kids are more sophisticated than we give them credit for and I think this movie can be appreciated by anyone over the age of 5.I like his level of animation detail too - I tried looking for flaws in the animation but I don't see them - even when someone slams a door in the background you can see things like dust and such moving - and this is just in the background. It's flawless anime.Anyone who doesn't like 'spirited away' or 'princess mononoke' movies will want to steer clear of this movie - but I found it to be a really good movie and the least you should do if you're a Miyazaki fan is rent it out and see it for yourself - maybe you'll end up buying it too :)",

I left the theater disgusted that i paid ten dollars for this movie.The carefully sculpted plot of the book is ripped away. Replacing it is a mediocre mixture of Mononoke, Spirited away, and a bit of Nausicca. The ending, specifically really stupefied me. I didn't see any morals, or anything i could relate to. The revelation of Howl as a giant bird completely threw me. I seriously caution all DWJ fans to NOT see this movie. If you want to see a good adaption of a book, save yourself some money, and don't go.

Since watching Howl's Moving Castle (dubbed version) I have eagerly sought out other films by Ghibli and particularly by Miyazake. The artwork is stunning and the attention to detail beyond anything, especially since this is hand-drawn, with little, if any, CG. So much better than the flat 2-dimensional work seen in much of Disney's offerings. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation - but I found the story satisfying if occasionally a bit light in content and explanation (without spoiling - the details of the curses and their 'cures' are mainly left to the viewer to work out) - but this is minor in the overall effect of the film, which is amazing. You get sucked into this fantastic alternative reality; the characters are appealing and the stellar cast for the English language voice-over (Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons, etc)did justice to the animation characters. My one niggle was why Christian Bale had to adopt an American accent for Howl (when he is in fact British), whilst the character of Sophie spoke with a British accent - but this is just nit-picking! See this movie! It's fabulous!",

            "content": "See my full review here: ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/03/film-howls-moving-castle.htmlHayao Miyazaki's groundbreaking animated films, like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, can be described as sweeping, fantastical, and heart- wrenchingly joyful. Equally epic, Miyazaki's 2004 film Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from Diana Wynne Jones' book of the same name, renders the viewer immobilized through the experience of a young girl on a journey of discovery. The film reaffirmed Miyazaki's role as the global ambassador of Japanese animation. He is a visionary man who understands that discovering an alternative side of life can be a revitalizing experience, and in that sense sends his audience right along with his characters.The film begins in a world at war. Young Sophie works in a hat shop and bumps into Howl, a known wizard and local heartthrob She quickly falls into a world of magic and finds trouble when the Witch of the Waste binds her with a spell of old age. In her newly geriatric state she goes in search of Howl. His house, a walking, magic fortress serves as his headquarters and main point of departure for his war-related missions. Now known as Grandma Sophie, she enlists herself as his maid and finds a place among the other house mates. Howl, a tenacious wizard full of defiance and destructive power, is caught in his own difficulties. Dealing with pacifism in wartime, he has become a political casualty of the raging conflict. The struggles crescendo and combine - as they are often wont to do - and the characters face difficult, life-changing choices. The whole things comes together in classic Miyazaki style.Is this starting to sound a little too \"magical\" for you? Maybe you think its just for kids? Well grow up and accept that some children's movies are even better for adults. This film was released on the tailwind of Miyazaki's most globally recognized film, Spirited Away, which had just become the first anime film to win the Academy Award for Best Animation. The two films, along with most of his movies, communicate many of the same themes. Howl, which set box office records in its own right, was highly influenced both by the previous success of Spirited Away - still the highest grossing Japanese film of all time - and by Miyazaki's own reactions to the beginning of the Iraq War. He has been classified as a pacifist, feminist, and traditionalist - all perspectives that inform his characters and their struggles. But the moralistic view of his stories is more universal than partisan. In this film Howl's struggles are treated more as personal than political.While there are lessons to be learned from Howl's demons, Sophie's character growth is equally poignant as she decides to optimistically accepts the challenge of old age. Her quick transformation from young adult to elderly is one most youth would not accept lightly, and Miyazaki helps the viewer to reflect on age and identity as he explores how Sophie deals with instant maturity and physical limitation. She finds she's able to gradually shed the years by embracing life and its challenges rather than complaining about them. Love, energy, and wisdom come as she is forced to accept things she cannot change and address those she can. Life in Howl's mystical mobile home is lived a few steps away from normality. Time and space have no constancy. The resulting mobility, while exciting, has kept Howl and his house mates from facing reality. Sophie breathes some fresh air into the place as she takes responsibility and learns to value the moment and the relationships that surround her. I prefer watching in Japanese with English subtitles. When coupled with the beautiful, melancholy score it completes the cultural journey and give you a truly foreign experience. If you just can't handle reading while watching, or you are enjoying it with kids, turn on the translation. John Lasseter - Miyazaki's championing super fan in the US - and his team at Disney went to significant lengths to make a quality English translation including recording voice-over work by critically acclaimed actors.This film is a gem during which I always sit in constant amazement. The beguiling blend of music, love, magic, and visuals creates an orchestral experience. Just as Miyazaki's character's rarely finish a film in the same form they began it, you'll be closer to internalizing the fact that life is always changing. And maybe you'll see the young person inside the next old face you see.",

Although it is based on a book (which I have not read), Miyazaki really makes the story his own. The world he crafts and the story he weaves are so amazingly detailed and interesting that I was truly spellbound for most of the film. Unfortunately, the ending does not live up to the promise of the film and is somewhat unsatisfying, which is the only reason I could not rate this as a 10. However, it is still worth seeing. As is typical with Miyazaki, he successfully relates the conflict and ambiguity of the world around us in an engaging way, without resorting to the Western ideals of good and evil. His characters really embody the concepts of yin/yang and wabi-sabi. Nothing and no one is completely good or completely evil and nothing is really as it may seem. I think these are concepts that all children (and adults) should be introduced to and I can't think of a better way than through a tale told by Miyazaki.",

I think it's because a lot of them find Howl attractive. I know that's a shallow thing to say, but I see this film get a lot of attention, when it's always seemed like a lesser film in Miyazaki's filmography. At least, to me it seemed that way.I know it seems like I really don't like this movie, but that isn't true. The characters all interact well, and I found the last act of the film to be really touching. It's still beautiful to look at, (particularly the \"walking on air\" scene), and the voice actors all do well. I just think that, like\"Spirited Away,\" this one is just a tad overrated.

This film became a block buster hit in Japan when it came out during Winter break just because of the director's fame. I was greatly disappointed by its corny love story and obvious ending. There were beautiful natural sceneries, as Miyazaki film does, but he stressed too much on romance ever since the ending of Spirited Away. There were repeated scenes from his previous movies, like Flying Castle and especially on Princess Mononoke and seemed a bit repetitious. His theme of flying wizard was probably from his first work of Naussica. What I liked about Miyazaki was not only his art skill, but his way of leaving out the ending for audience to speculate. Well, this movie smacked me right in the face with its obvious ending, and left me greatly disappointed. If he spent on working out a plot a little longer, it could have been better.

The visuals and the music are of course magnificent, I could listen to the soundtrack all day long... There are plenty of interesting, well-developed characters and of course Miyazaki's trademarks like an anti-war theme, flying aircrafts etc. There is a fine balance of action and ''calmer'' parts of the movie, also the line between magical and real is set very good in my opinion... I love how Howl's room is stuffed with so many things and looks so comfortable!^^ Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I like to watch this movie, especially the scenes that take place in large, open scenery like the woods and the mountains, it makes you feel very warm inside. One scene in particular always comes up first though, it's the one where they make and eat breakfast, I dunno why, maybe because the food looks so deliciousXD... Anyways, as a Miyazaki fan I urge you to watch this movie! You'll be taken into a world where not everything is perfect and good, but where friendship (and a little bit of magic;)) can do wonders!",

Then her age changes throughout the movie (which I love) but what causes that change. And all the characters have no backstory at all, like the witches who are they and why are they mad and the little boy what's the deal with him. I also wanted more knowledge about the war like what is that about.I think that the movie have parts missing from the story however I love the scenery and the mindset of the characters. The first half is so good, it is not as rushed as the second half. And the ending is beautiful with all the characters finding their way.

A wizard set in a future world of warring nations who uses magic to make his semi-industrial, semi-medieval castle move about on spindly legs? Brilliant! Whilst being a romance first and foremost, the film still contains elements of the comic and the sinister. Non-speaking characters such as the scarecrow and the dog are almost a given now in Miyazaki's films, whose actions bridge cultural differences when it comes to comedy, and we also see the return of the wrinkly old lady - another trademark of Miyazaki's recent films. The dark, mysterious side of Howl that the viewer learns of gradually through the film counter-balances the comedy well as to produce a film that has real feeling.Billy Crystal really hits the character of Calcifer spot-on in his voice-over, which makes a refreshing change for those of you who are not fans of Japanese films being re-voiced into English.Finally, although the film is a gem, I can't help feeling a little disappointed in the ending. I can't say too much about it, but it did leave me feeling that the genius Miyazaki is could have done better.",

            "content": "Don't fool yourself--Despite sharing a name, the movie is more pastiche then adaptation. I deeply like both Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle. I found their combination to be jarring and distressing. If you've read the book, spare yourself and don't see the movie. I expected to see an animated adaption of the book and instead was treated to the disconcerting experience of seeing familiar characters, lines, and places juxtaposed with little or no reference for the original story. Minor points within the book become key to the plot of the movie, and major events/characters in the book fail to appear at all.Howl's Moving Castle is not an especially deep book. It's a fairy-tale about a girl under a spell, and how she saves a wizard from an evil witch (and from himself). It's half a reversed 'Sleeping Beauty' crossed with a marriage comedy. But the movie plays the romantic theme very strongly, and brings in a theme about the how destructive and pointless war is, which was in no way present in the book. It is almost as if the director became disoriented and wrote the second half of the movie as a pastiche of another of Miyazaki's movies, 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', which develops the same theme very strongly.Watching this movie has really degraded my opinion of Miyazaki. I enjoyed both Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, as well as a variety of Studio Ghibli short films and had a general positive impression of Miyazaki. But as I see more films, I am reminded of H.P. Lovecraft's stories: While Lovecraft wrote well, he only ever wrote one story. Everything he wrote was a variant on that one story. It appears it may be the same for Miyazaki. Each film offers less, because you have, in essence, seen it before.",

I've been an admirer of his art ever since I had seen Kiki's Delivery Service when I was 7 yrs. of age, and his unique style always seems to capture me in the world of the movie. Also, the way that Miyazaki always gives life lessons to each movie without being too obvious is a show of his experience as a director. Miyazaki gives all of his characters such life-like qualities (including the negative qualities), and I'm sure each of them would redefine the meaning of a hero or role model once you've seen his work. I'm sure many reviewers might say \" A 9/10! That's absurdly too high!\" Yet, Miyazaki has a way with weaving stories into brilliant tapestries unlike many of the other animators in his time.",

            "review_title": "A gem!",
            "content": "\"Howl's Moving Castle\" is, in many ways, a modern take on \"Cinderella\". The story revolves around Sophie Hatter, who is continuing in her father's footsteps and keeps a modest hat shop, while her stepmother Fanny lives happily on the income. Sophie's younger sister Lettie, who is widely admired for her beauty and sweet manners, has settled comfortably in a life outside the hat shop and is greatly worried about Sophie's fate. But soon, a witch appears on the scene to transform Sophie, forcing the girl to take matters into her own hands.Like in Cinderella, Sophie visits the castle in disguise and meets its owner; unlike in the fairy tale, however, she does not enter the castle as a beautiful princess. The inhabitants of the castle are confronted with a woman in her nineties, because that is what Sophie's character has been in spite of her young looks. She dances, not with the prince, but with the broom to furiously clean the dingy rooms of the moving castle.Appearances may often deceive, and this film elaborates on that theme with great care. Disguises abound in the story. The fireplace holds more than one secret; the terrifying scarecrow Sophie meets on her way to the castle is waiting for a kiss to reveal its true self. The Witch of the Waste uses spells to appear as the grande dame we (and Sophie) meet her as. Most importantly, the master of the castle himself, wizard Howl, is capable of stealing the hearts of all the young ladies with his dazzling smile, but on the inside, he is quite the opposite of beautiful. Sophie sees through his good looks and recognises him as cowardly and selfish. At the same time, he sees through her curse and recognises the young woman in her. In fact, their encounter is of the \"Beauty and Beast\" type, challenging them to see each other and themselves for what they truly are to find happiness.Sophie's curse, we soon learn, cannot be broken even by the Witch who cast it. As the story progresses, however, Sophie gains insight into herself. At the same time, her visible aspect alternates between ages; this technique of depiction may confuse greatly, as no direct explanation is given. But there is one straightforward scene: Sophie regains her young looks at one point, only to falter and revert to her 90-year-old-self, explaining to a shocked Howl that age is comfortable.When Sophie does find the courage to grow up, she is rewarded with true happiness. This, albeit powerful in itself, is not the only message the film wants to deliver. The country which the moving castle is roaming is at war; wizard Howl, summoned by his king to aid the forces, initially tries to run by assuming various identities. He later reveals his abhorrence of war and soldiers in strong words, although he does eventually join the battles. This aspect could have been fleshed out more; unfortunately, we do not learn why this war was started in the first place, nor do we ever see the enemy. The resolution is that Mme. Suliman and Prince Justin (whose identity may be lost on the audience) simply decide to \"end this silly war\". With so many serious, deep conversations (and battles!) going on earlier, there could have been a stronger impact dealt on the audience, maybe by implementing another scene at the king's palace and thereby also reducing the length of the \"kissing fest\" before the final scene.The clincher, however, is very well done; Sophie is shown with her new family and the castle has gained a new feature. As it soars above the clouds, we cannot help but feel elated with Sophie. All in all, this animation film comes in the disguise of a light fairy tale but has much to offer below its pretty surface to think about. It may be telling that I was compelled to watch it again on the very next day, because it had so much to say within such a short time. If you care enough, do look into the excellent novel the film is based on. The film itself can be very thought-provoking and rewarding, so please do not be deterred by confusion. Enjoy!",

            "review_title": "A Weak Miyazaki Film, But Still A Miyazaki Film",
            "content": "I'm an enormous fan of Hayao Miyazaki. With each and every one of films one can expect lavish animation, an enormous amount of creativity and imagination, and an experience that pulls the viewer into another world. I find in each of his films there is a scene or two that simply puts one's jaw to the floor and leaves this sense of epic satisfaction. All of the above exist in Howl's Moving Castle, as does a certain amount of flaw. This flaw lies in two elements, and unfortunately they're the most important elements in the film, the story and characters. The story takes place in a fictional world of sorcery and magic. A laboring girl named Sophie falls under and aging curse from an envious witch. She ventures, somewhat unwittingly, to the home of the wizard Howl, which is a large castle capable of moving anywhere in the fabric of existence. In short, the story is overwhelmingly complex and contains a lot of separate factors that conform around the leading characters. As you can guess, Howl's Moving Castle suffers from trying to pack too much into one plot. We have multiple character arcs, not a mention of war going on at once. Now that doesn't sound too difficult, it's been accomplished before. But this is Miyazaki film, and things are extremely deep with a lot of subliminal work that there's just not room for. The story comes off as being very choppy as well as rushed. What's worse is, the spaces between the many chunks of story are very small, and could have been resolved with an extra thirty seconds of dialogue and animation. The story also lacks a time lapse, and the viewers are supposed to buy that all happens within a relatively short amount of time, which is fairly difficult with all things considered. I think this is in part due to the fact that Howl's Moving Castle is not original piece unlike most Miyazaki films. This was actually based off of a novel by Diana Jones. And it displays all the flaws one has come to expect of a book to film conversion. Not to mention Diana Jones is a British author and Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, so there may have been a slight amount cultural disconnect. The flaws of the story spill into the flaws with the characters. Now the large cast of characters are very well developed, three dimensional, interesting and entertaining; however they're not very consistent. Sophie's actions constantly contradict either something she previously did or said, or anything a reasonable person would do. Howl is said to be a cruel, heartless womanizer who exploits and tortures women, yet we're never shown him doing so. And the above isn't just a rumor amongst the characters; it's a firm fact, and its existence is one of the main plot points. Not to mention there's one scene where he acts like the complete opposite of his character in the rest of the film. All of this boils into a climax, that while drawn and executed perfectly, is mind-boggling and makes no sense whatsoever. Another thing worth mention is: while watching the film (I preferred to watch it in Japanese, which is my recommendation) the subtitles frequently displayed dialogue in which I couldn't hear anyone talking. Either this is the result of a faulty DVD, or really bad sound mixing, likely the latter. I know it sounds like I'm really bashing the film, but it's just one of those movies where the positives (which there are plenty of) are just hard to put into text. The art direction and the way the story is expressed through the animation are spectacular and the atmosphere it creates is nothing short of magical. The story contains a lot of passion, and its themes of lust, deception and warfare are integrated very well. I found myself very attached to the characters and the scenes are so well crafted, they alone make Howl's Moving Castle worth multiple views. My favorite animated movies, which I also view as the best, are films that succeed at the surface but really strive beneath it. Films such as Princess Mononoke, The Fox and the Hound, and The Secret of NIMH are examples of films that do this perfectly. Howl's Moving Castle gets better and better the deeper the experience goes. The subliminal messages, the emotion and the attachment are absolutely perfect. But it's at the surface where it fails. I really wanted to love Howl's Moving Castle, but the rough story and two-faced characters kept me from doing so. I did however like it, and it's pretty hard not to.",

The attention that Hayao Miyazaki put into Howl and Sophie with their personalities and flaw are very compelling, especially Howl. He is one of my favorite male characters from Miyazaki's work (I also really like Haku from Spirited Away they are both very relatable). Sophie is also one of my favorite female characters from Miyazaki's work as well (I have a huge crush on her, but I pretty much have one on all of the other female characters from Miyazaki's work, except the sisters from My Neighbor Totoro.

Overall, I felt many of the war scenes were over-dramatized and left a lot of questions. There were also a lot of small things throughout that they could have done a better job at explaining. Even after watching the movie so many times I cannot fully explain some scenes and still have questions about the movie.Animation: The animation is absolutely stunning and many of the backgrounds look realistic. I also have to say that I am impressed with how Sophie is animated, and how it is so easy to tell when she is aging/regressing just simply by looking at the animation (her voice also helps). Overall this is the most impressive Miyazaki art I've seen and I really haven't seen much that can top it.Sound: I'll just start off by saying the music in this movie is so beautiful. I love every single background music in this movie, and the only song I don't like so much is the theme with the words that plays at the end. Aside from the beautiful soundtrack, the sounds in the movie are so dead on. Hearing Sophie's bones crack as an old woman is really painful, and as much as I don't like Sophie's voice, her seiyuu does a great job at portraying the character and how she fluctuates between young and old so frequently throughout the movie.Character: The characters in this movie make up for all the lack of closure in the plot. Each character has their good points, even the Witch of the Waste. I personally adore almost all the characters, though I actually like Sophie the least of all. Calcifer, Heen, and Turnip head are such adorable and fun characters to watch (and Heen and Turnip have pretty much no lines in the whole movie). Howl is also another lovable character as well. The characters have such different personalities that you will probably like at least one character or more.Enjoyment: Obviously I enjoy this film a lot. I've watched it so many times! Each time I sit there in awe of the animation and empathize with the characters. It's one of those movies that I love to watch and I have not gotten bored of it yet. I do have to say that towards the end I get slightly bored with the stressed focus on the war, but that only lasts at most 15 minutes.",

Although this movie is close to the standards of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, its plot feels cut off and hard to follow at times. During various instances you are just let off wondering about the logical connections of character actions. The greatest attributes of this film are the contrasting main characters. After Sophie faces her curse, she does so with courage and positive look on life. She is forgiving and sweet. And then we have Howl, who is selfish, disorganized. He thinks that not being perfect looking makes him undesirable and ugly. But other than his obsession with his looks, he is kind and willing to give anyone a chance. The only character, that didn't really have any growth, was the Witch, for which I just couldn't feel any sympathy at any given time. The movie was emotional and several times left me with a tear in my eyes. In the end the movie was great and deserves the spot of being one of the studios best.",

The one thing that is holding this title back from getting a perfect score for me was that it lacks the huge emotional peek at the end when everything comes together. The movie is great and the ending is great without it, but there is room for improvement. I felt that it came to a close much to abruptly.Along with most animated movies the action or emotion always peeks at the very end of the movie. During this particular one, even though everything comes together at the end, the climax came up short of thrilling. I was entertained throughout the whole movie by the mystical world that i was grabbed by. Characters although sometimes confusing, were very well done and left a good impression on me.",

It has the surreal and dreamy feel of Alice In Wonderland, and I couldn't help but be drawn into the story. The characters are well rounded, and the relationships between them are very interesting. The film has an incredible knack of surrounding you with all these events, thoughts and a dream-esqe atmosphere that you want to watch it again and again to relive this strange world.

This film is the best example of it, I think this is easily his worst film to date. I admire the things he attempted to do to change the animation style, but I don't think all of it works, the movement of the castle, for example, I didn't really like.Basic plot: Little girl becomes old woman and moves in with a wizard in a walking castle.I've read the book, and wanted a closer adaptation. Miyazaki's Howl is not the same as the book's though he reproduces one scene from the book that doesn't really fit the Howl of the film. The story changes weren't really for the better, but the film mostly stands on its own feet. The ending doesn't work as unless you've read the book you will be unaware of certain aspects of Sophie's character.For someone who'd read the book, calcifer will be a disappointment I feel. Just too childish in the film. The added war themes are pretty clumsy compared to Porco Rosso, or Mononoko etc. but the message is still positive.I watched the Japanese subtitled version, which has English completely different to the dubbed track! Odd! The dubbed calcifer is better than the Japanese one, but the Japanese track is better in all other respects.This film shouldn't be the first Gibhli one you look into, but if you've liked others give it a try.",

Of course the film does not disappoint all these elements are there. There is a sense that the film has some wider world elements that set it apart from other Miyazaki movies. This mainly comes from the backdrop of an Orwell 1984 type war with seemingly irrelevant sides and aims. This is developing into a common theme in Japanese cinema at the moment, perhaps unsurprisingly considering that is what the rest of the world is talking about. However the Japanese take on it is always a little obvious and is drilled home to such a degree it is less thought provoking. However it is a visually stunning film where the characters and plot are well developed. There are numerous quirky characters to keep younger movie goers entertained, although I haven't seen the dubbed versions so some of this may be lost in translation. All in all a good modern \"Brothers Grimm\" type tale. If you only watch one Miyazaki film watch \"Spirited Away\" if you want to see a few more this isn't a bad place to go next.",

Totoro and Spirited Away were definitely better, but I'm not gonna judge this movie based on this. It was just a little side note.The story I really liked the fact I've never seen another anime or movie with the same plot. I appreciate the fact it is original. But what bothered me was the fact there was too many things going on. For me, it was too many information to take in. And, in my opinion, sometimes the story was all over the place. It was a little bit confusing for just a movie. If it were an anime I would have understood the multitude of information to take in. But just for a movie, it's just too much.The art Well, the art is the thing I enjoy the most when it comes to Miyazaki's work. It's splendid. I can't express in words how much I love it. Even if one of his movies were terrible, I will still watch it just for the art.The sound I really don't know what to say about the sound. The voice acting is great as it is in every anime or movie I know. As far as I can recall. I only give it a 7/10 because the ending song isn't my cup of tea.The characters Well, the characters were all lovely in each unique way. Except Madame Sulliman. I don't really liked her. My favorite one is Calcifer and I kinda liked Turnip Head too. I don't know why. He didn't say much, but I think it's because he reminds me of No Face from Spirited Away. I enjoyed this movie, even if the story was a little off-putting at times. But for me, it's one of those movies I like to watch one time. I don't think I'll watch it again in the near future.",

These days we are all too familiar with the 'Happy Meal' friendly characters brought to life by western animators through the wonders of CGI. However, this Japanese maestro distinctly resists the use of modern technology in favour of classical cel animation, which makes a refreshing change. Bored with her life in a sleepy town, the film's protagonist Sophie is cursed by an evil witch who transforms her into an elderly woman. Sophie escapes her village to a fantastical roaming castle, owned by the mysterious wizard Howl (voiced by Christian Bale). Howl's Moving Castle is a 'love will conquer all' fairytale that sees Sophie battle to reverse her altered state as she slowly falls for Howl's charms. Some of the visuals are quite Gothic and at times resemble the animated sketches used in Monty Python's Flying Circus. The animation is flawless throughout, engulfing the viewer in a truly bizarre world, whilst simultaneously elevating the film's more fragile moments that comment on war, greed and lost youth.",

This fantasy movie rocks the world and the more times you watch it the more you like it and identify the clever hints hidden in dialogue. I Absolutely love the movie's magical world with it's charms and potions. It is only very loosely based on the book, in fact all that's the same is that character names and the moving castle. But for Hayao Miyazaki to actually IMAGINE and Flesh out the castle and the parallel worlds and magic is truly raw talent and skill. His movie should not really be compared to the book at all since they are nearly completely different. This is a must watch movie for all ages! AND if you happen to think your too old then wait till you have children and encourage them to watch this movie, its so rare to find a movie good in every aspect with originality these days and this movie deserves to be past on and remembered as a true classic.",

All I knew about the movie was that it was based on a good book and that it had been created by the maker of Spirited Away. Though I had never read the book, the movie seemed to be well liked, so I sat down and watched. Unfortunately, while the animation was very pretty, the nonsensical nature of the plot and lack of real character development really ruined things for me.The story centers around Sophie, a young girl who is cursed by a which to live in the body of an old woman. Why did the which curse Sophie in particular? Your guess is as good as mine. The movie doesn't offer an explanation -and you'll have to get used to that in a hurry if you want to sit through the rest of the film. As an old woman, Sophie takes shelter in Howl's moving castle, where she meets the wizard Howl, his pet fire spirit calcifur, and his 7-year old (that's my guess anyway) assistant who's name I don't remember. Now at this point, I actually thought that things were shaping up to be an interesting movie. Here we had a magical castle inhabited by wizards and fire spirits, fantastic animation, and a couple of genuinely interesting characters. In particular, at this point I was really starting to empathize with Sophie, who seemed like a very realistic character. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from here. As the so called \"plot\" progressed, the only character development we receive concerning Howl is that he doesn't like war and that he likes to look pretty. As for the witch, she's evil. Bet you didn't see that one coming. But a couple of paper-thin characters aren't the only problem here. Unanswered questions upon unanswered questions plague the story. Why is there a war going on? Why does the witch want to find Howl? Speaking of the witch, developments with her later in the story will leave you scratching your head until you've got a bald spot. Add in some inexplicably magic rings which can apparently travel through time, flying men made of black goo which nobody seems to think are conspicuous and\u0085 well, without giving away spoilers, all I can say is that the last quarter of the movie will probably not make any sense at all to you if you haven't read the book.When I saw this movie, I was watching it with three friends. Two of them had read the book, and one (like me) hadn't. At the end of the film, both I and the friend who hadn't read the book were glad it was finally over with. The touching ending was lost on us simply because we had no idea what caused it. The other two friends didn't think the movie was that bad. I think that's just what it boils down to in the end. If you've read the book, you might enjoy this movie. If not\u0085 don't hold your breath.",

The characters are nice, the idea is nice , there is that GREAT ADVENTURE that makes a movie stand out in a crowd but I guess there isn't a MAIN IDEA, the clearly displayed idea. There were just A LOT OF INTERESTING sequences and quotes and thoughts, but none of them was developed enough. For example there is the interior conflict about beauty as Sophie is not beautiful and Howl is, then there is something about war, something about overcoming your hate and the will for revenge and many many other great concepts but they were not presented and developed clearly enough, as at some points the movie is moving too fast and you just don't get enough time to pay attention to them. Besides, there were also many useless details. So, in conclusion, if you want to make a good movie, the idea is JUST NOT ENOUGH. I guess it's sometimes complicated to get rid of all the details and focus on ONE main idea or maybe two, but that's what really makes a movie great, doesn't it?MAIN CHARACTERISTICS----1hour 58 min (which means LONG! if you do easily get bored, this movie is not for you) ---on the other hand the movie is MOVING FAST, so if you don't really look for a good idea, concept, than you will probably enjoy watching it just for this fact.---THE ANIMATION IS GOOD AND THE CARTOON ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL",

On the DVD version I have there is a feature on the use of CG; it is incredible the lengths they take to match the CG and hand-drawn animation together - well worth watching! Although I prefer to watch films in their original language, the English dub is very good, I particularly liked the casting for Sophie (Emily Mortimer for young Sophie and Jean Simmons for old Sophie), their very precise enunciation suited the character exactly.The film departs substantially from Dianne Wynne Jones' book, but if she doesn't mind (and she doesn't seem to) then it's OK with me too...",

As she gets to know this mysterious man more and more she becomes younger and younger but also has to save Howl from the evil witch who cursed her in the first place.

Miyazaki captures you in with the first few seconds of the film with his beautiful artwork and interesting designs. The storyline, I feel, was very nice and flowed nicely even though I had a few questions (How the little kid ended up with Howl and a few other things) but I set them aside and really enjoyed the movie.The only thing that I really didn't like was Howls voice for some reason.

            "content": "Make it make sense!The art and the animation were marvellous, but that's about the only good thing about this film.Many people pointed out that the plot is very confusing, and I wholeheartedly agree. I think the main problem is that we only get bits and pieces of information about everything. There is not a single plot point that is carried from start to finish.First, an evil witch casts a spell on Sophie, which causes her to have an old body. It is pointed out that a mere human cannot break that spell, and that is literally the only information we get about the spell for the entirety of the film. Sophie becomes younger or less young throughout the film for no apparent reason, but the spell is never actually broken. At the end, Sophie is young, and she seems to stay that way, but her hair is still grey just like when she was old, so the spell is not broken, even at the end of the film.Next, the evil witch is only evil at the beginning, because then the king's witch takes her powers away and leaves her as a helpless old woman. This point is, again, very confusing, because WHY would the king's witch wait until now? And then, for some reason, Sophie takes the evil witch to live with Howl and Michael in the moving castle. After that, the witch's behaviour is so confusing: is she good? Is she bad? Is she senile? We will never know.Next, there's the king's witch. The film wants us to be sort of against her because she wants Howl to obey the king and go to war. But then, Howl's squad takes her dog to live with them??? Even thought they absolutely do NOT want her to find them???Then, there's this plot point that is introduced, where it is said that if Howl turns into a sort of bird demon too often or for too long, he won't be able to come back to his human form. Of course, it is not explained why or how, and it's actually never a real problem in this story. Howl always comes back to his real form with no difficulty.Finally, there's this war plot happening in the background, but we never get to know why, or against who or whatnot. It gets even more confusing because many of the war aircraft that bomb the cities in here actually seem to come from the king's witch, so the king is literally bombing his own country? And that could, of course, be a purposeful aspect, but then it should be discussed more, or it should have consequences. Here, it just seems nonsensical.Oh, and worst plot twist of them all: the scarecrow turns into the prince of the enemy country??? Throughout the film, there is this scarecrow that helps Sophie because she got it out of a bush it was stuck in. At the end of the film, Sophie kisses it for some reason, and it truly turns into a prince???!!! And apparently, it's because he had to be kissed by someone he loved to break his curse??? Yet again, we know nothing about this person, about his curse or about why he loves Sophie.All in all, we just don't know anything about anything. Who is Howl? What is his goal? Who is the king's witch? Why does she decide at the end of the film to put an end to the war? Why not before? What exactly is the link between Howl and Calcifer because I didn't get that either?I would not watch this again.",

In that regard Howl's Moving Castle is no different. I faintly remember seeing this in the cinema when it came out and the feeling of absolute astonishment I experienced.

The adventures of the characters are as warm as the family. Including the cuteness that the Studio made out through the cartoon characters, it is not a doubt for Studio Ghibli. Which makes this anime attractive to follow And there are no dull moments at all Throughout the viewing, we are constantly wondering that Sophie will be able to return her original body or not and issue of Howl and Calcifer, which is another clue in the story.

This is the premise of the animation film Howl's Moving Castle, released in 2004 in Japan, directed by Hayao Miayazaki. It is based on Diana Wynne's book of the same name. It tells Sophie's (voiced by actress Emily Mortimer) story after she is transformed into a crone of 90 years old by the Witch of The Waste (voiced by actress Lauren Bacall) curse. Sophie searches for help with the mysterious wizard Howl (voiced by actor Christian Bale), owner of a moving castle.The movie tells Sophie's adventure in a subtle way and addresses issues gently, like the difficulty of growing up, and putting oneself in the place of other people. Besides, the animation develops the story of friendship and love between people who have crossed paths.Furthermore, the animation (made by Studio Ghibli) gives us a pleasant sensation every minute, creating a heart warming atmosphere. Besides, it presents a beautiful aesthetic, with a carefully selected color palette, applied in an exquisite form. Moreover, the character's outline also helps to create a visual identity memorable that demonstrates the personality of each character. Thus, my favorite character is the flame demon Calcifer (voiced by actor Billy Crystal).Everything about this animation is incredible! And the most impressive thing about this movie is the striking, but, at the same time, delicate and harmonious soundtrack, created by Joe Hisaishi.Finally, I leave here my recommendation of this beautiful animation. It will leave the children enchanted and older people with the memory of a great film. In other words, everyone who watches this movie. In my opinion, this film deserves nine stars!",

She runs away due to the sudden shift in her appearance and is helped by Tulip, a living scarecrow. She finds the moving castle, where she meet a little boy called Markl and a fire demon, Calcifer. She becomes a cleaning lady and knows the real Howl, with many personality faces. He's exhausted from a long fight, promoted by Madame Suliman. The film unfolds with the war that Howl's fought, the journey of Sophie trying to break her curse, and a lot of charming subplots, especially the growing love between Howl and Sophie, that surpasses time and appearance.I really liked the film. For the richness of details, the amazing characters, the beautiful animation, the soundtrack and the script. It is impossible not to love every piece of this movie. All the subplots, the story and the journey of all characters make this film perfect and great to watch many times. If you like romance, adventure, japanese animation and are willing to see a new point of view, I recommend you to watch this masterpiece.",

It is about Sophie, a shy and simple girl, resident of a calm town located in the lands of Ingary. On a regular day, the girl is cursed by the evil Witch of the Waste, who turns her into a 90 year old lady. Now the crone Sophie goes in search of her new destiny, meeting the powerful wizard Howl, owner of a moving castle, who has a bad reputation and surrounded in many secrets. Nevertheless, Sophie is on a journey to break her curse.The film is based on a book named \"Howl's Moving Castle\" which corresponds to the first book of a trilogy written by the British writer Diana Wynne Jones. Following the premise of the book, the movie also doesn't present a clear time range, as any fantasy movie, it shows scenarios of an universe that doesn't necessarily match which our reality.The cast performed their role masterfully in the Japanese dubbing, although the English version is only fine. Howl's voice in Japanese is performed by the singer Takuya Kimura and in English by the actor Christian Bale. Sophie's is dubbed in Japanese by the actress Chieko Baisho. In English, however, she was divided into two roles: the crone Sophie (performed by British actress Jean Simmons), and the young Sophie (performed by the also British actress Emily Mortimer).The atmosphere and art of the movie are simply amazing. I really liked all the characters, but three of them were outstanding: Sophie (as the protagonist), the audience tends to identify with her. Howl is amazing too, and he forms an incredible couple with the protagonist. Calcifer is also a fantastic character, because is able to make us laugh. I think this is a film for those people who enjoy magic, romance, incredible art and a lot of adventures. I really appreciate this movie, although not as much as the book. The movie still has some loose ends which are tied perfectly in the book ties.",

            "content": "Howl's moving castle is the best japanese animation you will watch in your life. It's not for nothing that this film won three prizes. Probably the greatest thing about the film it's the fact it's a fantasy film so everything it's possible.Starts with Sophie, a girl who works in a hat shop. She lived in a city in Japan during the war. Everyone in this city knows there is a \"walking-castle\" and there lives a sorcerer, Howl. When the film starts Sophie has been bewitched, and now she has the appearance of an old woman. She can't believe that's happening and runs away from the city. After a time she met Howl. The castle of Howl is one of the most beautiful sceneries of the film. Have many details. The thing that made this film so beautiful is its absolute color palette. With pastel tones and piano soundtrack the film gives a feeling of comfort for the spectator. The animation doesn't try to be realistic, that's just made the film better. Honestly the film it's\"slow\", but all the scenes have something to see, like beautiful houses or landscapes. The first impression spectator have of Howls is that he is a very kind (curious since he is such a sorcerer) and busy man. At the beginning it's impossible to know what he does to be so busy, but in the middle of the story it's more clear. His evolution throughout the film is interesting. Sophie lived with him the most part of the film, but it's clear he changed after her. After a while the defects of Howl start to appear. He is so vain and dramatic. When his hair color changed he said \"I can't live if I'm not beautiful\". But in the end of the film, he doesn't act like that anymore. The romance of Howl and Sophie it's beautiful to see because they help each other. The movie confirms this because she needs to have her spell broken, and Howl helped her. Even though it was made in the middle of a war, the movie is able to have a happy tone. It's more than a \"children's movie\". The film brings humor and a lot of reflection, it's kinda \"slow\", but this doesn't make the movie worse.",

It tells the story of Sophie, an insecure eighteen-year-old girl, who works in her dad's hat shop even though she doesn't enjoy it that much. She found her life pretty much boring until the day she encountered the infamous sorcerer Howl. People say he is a really powerful sorcerer who steals girls hearts. But he and Sophie had a great time together. The witch of the land, who is in love with Howl, is jealous of Sophie therefore she turns her into an old lady which is a reflection of how Sophie sees herself. We will then follow Sophie in her journey to turn back into a young girl as she becomes more confident. I really enjoyed this movie, it is my comfort film, I have watched it several times! In my opinion it is the best Studio Ghibli film. Everything about it is beautiful : the soundtrack, the animation, the story, the drawings, and the character. My favourite character is Sophie because she is such a relatable character and I love her character development throughout the movie. I also love the love story between Howl and Sophie it is very touching but also funny! There is a hidden meaning to the movie that is so beautiful, I had to watch the movie twice before finding it.

Miyazaki stole my heart once again with a delightful and charming film, this film has effected me on so many levels, because it's dark, funny and crackling with magic, it's unlike anything i've ever seen before, it's amazing. The animation is so wonderful i can't even describe it well enough, the colors, the open landscapes, this movie is so rich and imaginative, it's just stunning and it's a feast for the eyes, i doubt that anyone won't be impressed by it, i was completely drawn to this movie by the charming characters and the beautiful atmosphere that cannot be matched by any other Miyazaki film, even by Spirited Away, which i consider Miyazaki's best work yet.I was very impressed by this movie however i can accept and understand why people sometimes criticize it, it is indeed weak in terms of character and story devolopments, i sensed that at the beginning of the end it felt a little bit rushed, i wanted more, it felt like the magic was fading away so quickly, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment i kept on watching it until the end and i loved it, i loved Howl's character he is my favorite of Miyazaki's characters, he is very different from the other clich\u00e9 male white knight type characters and yet he was very cute and charming character, even as a monster! even if the story grew a little weaker in the middle it still kept my interest, the movie had extremely creative characters and i know that if they were developed just a little bit more the movie would of been a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Howl's moving castle was my favorite movie so far.it is a well-known Japanese classic 2D animation by Studio Ghibli. It is one of the great movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki, adapted from Diana Wynne Jones's novel. It has all his classic Miyazaki style with amazing animation, rich world-building, a great storyline, and character development.An animated fantasy film about a fictional kingdom where there are witches and wizards exist and there was a war between two kingdoms. The story was about Sophie, a young hat maker and the eldest daughter of the family who has taken care of her father's store. She was cursed by a witch who visited her shops, turning her into an elderly woman. She later met Howl and ended up staying with him, getting caught ups in his fighting.Having experienced the film. I have to admit that the animation was amazing as always. A detailed 2D animation and bright color backgrounds are gorgeous. The visual style is also unique and has an interesting concept. It was creating a magical and stunning atmosphere though out the story. We can see how the characters feel and how smooth the animation like the hair and effects in the story, especially magic, and food. It was so detailed and looked really delicious, as expected of Ghibli studio.The story overall was fun, even though, it is a story adapted from a novel but it did not disappoint me at all. This film is so imaginative and delightful. It was well written. However, people who have never read an original novel before might be confused with the film's plot. It took me to watch it two to three times until I could understand the plot and concept of the story. It is pretty hard to notice Sophie's power like how she switches between being behind an elder and a teenage girl. The identity of the scarecrow has few scenes and was not mentioned much in the story, including the story about the cause that create the war between the two kingdoms.The topics that were mentioned the most in the story are probably the characters. The characters are wonderful. It was so well written that each one has his or her own personality and their own character development. Sophie is a shy young girl, working as a milliner in her family's hat shop. She has the ability to make what she says come true without knowing it. The fact that her appearance changes according to her confidence. That is why sometimes we can see her returning to being a young woman during the story. We would see How she becomes younger as she has more self-esteem during the story and how she helps Howl with her power. This was not very well described in the film so many people might be confused.Next, wizard Howl with a nice character design. A handsome wizard who caught and made a contract with a falling star named Calcifer. He is my favorite character. According to the original novel, he has a flamboyant, dramatic, and cowardly personality. He was also kind and generous that he allowed Sophie to live with him and help her. We can see how he change during the story, being more honest with himself and opening up to other.",

I was a fan from about 15 minutes in, very good voice casting, the music score is brilliant, and the lasting appeal was evident when my kids were watching it again the very next morning. The story was very good, kept me anxious to see what happened next. Each character is mysterious enough to get you to want to explore what more there is to them. There is plenty of beautiful scenes where the color and the landscapes pull you in, and for a brief time, engulf you in the splendor of the story. I would recommend this to anyone who is relatively new to anime movies, this one is safe for kids. Mine are 10 and 6 and both loved it. My oldest even requested the Howl's Moving Castle paperback for Christmas this year.",
