I don't know anyone who's seen this show who hasn't loved it. This is one of those shows where you'll have to watch each episode more than once because you'll miss parts from laughing so much. I've seen every episode of every season a few times and it's just as funny rewatching it as it was the first time. The cast (Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito) is perfect. They are all hilarious, as are all the supporting characters. I can't recommend this show enough, do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. I promise that you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Rob McElhenney), and Charlie (Charlie Day) are all the owners of an Irish bar in Philadelphia, and \"Sunny\" essentially follows their awkward lives - each episode revolving around some type of political or social issue such as gun control, abortion, steroids, underage drinking, health care, and the handicapped (just to touch on a few issues already addressed in the show).It begs comparison with \"Arrested Development,\" \"The Office,\" \"Seinfeld\" and \"South Park\" in its broad humor and wit, but it is completely original in its own right. The pilot was filmed on a low budget by a few friends and was picked up by FX after wards, so the show retains its low-budget feel - giving it a gritty, down-to-earth edge.\"Sunny\" does border on the edge of bad taste sometimes (hell, what am I saying - it crosses the line every time) but it contains enough satire and wit to get away with it. For example: in one episode Mac and Dennis decide to pick up girls at an abortion rally. Mac pretends to be pro-life just so he can be around an attractive woman, whom he ends up sleeping with. Later, she tells him she's pregnant. \"You need to get an abortion,\" he says. This type of irony runs throughout every episode.The banter between the characters in the show is what tends to be particularly funny. The actors - although novices - are all great. Charlie Day in particular has me laughing like crazy every episode. And his interaction with Danny DeVito (who's been brought in for season two) is hilarious. Season two is more polished so far in terms of the mechanics of the show - the characters have all been setup now and they know what they're doing - and in that regard it is seeming to get better and better with every episode.You do have to have a very sick sense of humor to like some of this - DeVito's character, Frank, is the father of Dennis and Dee, and his reason for being in the show is that he is getting a divorce and wants to relive his glory days as a youth. He tries to re-ignite a relationship with an old girlfriend of his from high school - but when he finds out she's a grandmother and not interested in doing anything wild, his attention instantly turns to the waitress and he tunes her out. It's cruel, sick and hilarious. DeVito is playing another ruthless character (same as in \"Taxi\" all those years ago) and it works splendidly.Overall this was a delightful blast of fresh air - after seeing so many stale sitcoms, this proved to me that FX really is becoming the new lead in character-driven comedy-dramas (such as the equally superb \"Rescue Me\" which isn't quite as funny, however).My only hope is that \"Sunny\" doesn't become so popular that it attracts controversy and sells out and dumbs down its humor. Right now it's on par with the early episodes of \"South Park\" and \"SNL\" in terms of how irreverent its humor is - and personally, in my opinion, its plots are better than most comedy films I've seen within the last few years.If you want to see something new, different, and funny, check this out. I have a feeling it could either become huge, like the next \"Seinfeld,\" or - more realistically - it will become a cult phenomenon. Either way, I'll be watching.",

            "content": "There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as \"Seinfeld on crack\" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs. One of the best parts of the show is the characters themselves. They come across as shallow douchebags most of the time, because for the most part, they are, but they each have their own distinct personality that mesh so well with the others. Dennis Reynolds is about as close to an everyman that you can get from the gang, and he's a manipulative, insecure, raving sociopath. His sister Dee is almost as depraved but with more self-loathing and less psychopathy. Their father Frank is a rich businessman who traded that life away for living in the slums as a lascivious alcoholic. Specifically, he shares a bed with Charlie, the illiterate, idiot savant wild card of the group. Dennis' roommate Mac is an oblivious closeted homosexual that favors badassery above all else. To put it lightly, they get themselves into some interesting scenarios. Whether they're all together or broken into various group combinations, you can guarantee laughs are to be had.The chemistry between the actors really sells the whole thing. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day are geniuses. Their writing, their acting, it's all so natural and infectious that you can't help but get immersed into any zany idea they come up with just to see how the gang comes out the other side. Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito are just as much necessary pieces to the cast. The humor ranges from uncomfortable to terribly politically incorrect, and that's the beauty of the show. It takes these \"delicate\" topics and shines a light on them that many people are afraid to address. The first season alone deals with racism, abortion, transsexuals, and child molestation. And no matter the topic, they find a way to make it hard-to-breathe hysterical.I can boast about this show for days, but the fact is you either enjoy the humor or you don't. There's a lot of yelling and plenty of curse words, and it may be grating for newcomers to dip their toes into something like this, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. But for those who do and appreciate clever unrestrained comedy, treat yourself to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.Great intro episodes: (#3.9) Sweet Dee Is Dating a Retarded Person - (#2.4) Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom - (#2.3) Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare - (#4.10) Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack - (#4.12) The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Make Over Edition - (#6.3) The Gang Buys a Boat",

I wish I could hangout with anyone as fun as the cast. A little bit can be extreme yet works so well. Easily one of the funniest shows out there, I don't watch comedy enough it's really wholesome.

The entire cast is so incredibly funny it's hard to say who's the best, they are all equally talented and equally hilarious.

It's compared to South Park for a number of reasons, most notably the enthusiasm with which it tackles socially sensitive issues and assaults them with the most extremist brands of political incorrectness --- but whereas South Park always tries to tidy up it's mess and make sure the audience knows the distinction between right and wrong, this show revels in the depravity and insanity of it's sociopathy. And it works amazingly well.Since it's a situational comedy, there's not much to say about it without giving away the goods, but the actors all work better than any cast I've seen in a long time. It really seems like half the show is improvised and that the cast is talented enough to make it work without a hitch. The first few episodes are definitely the weakest, but still stronger than just about any comedy out there.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I have said it before, but one of the joys of summer is watching summer shows , knowing that they aren't being given even the slightest chance of survival. In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", which premiered earlier this month, is not terrible. Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including \"Cheers\" and the recently canceled \"Grounded For Life\". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.What makes \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies. The writers are also the stars and executive producers of the show, which gives them almost complete control. Let's hope the writing staff doesn't change. I'd give \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" 9/10. It's one of the best shows one is ever likely to see on cable.",

I love and enjoy each of the five characters, each bringing their own zany, humorous, pessimistic side to the gang.

            "review_title": "Can sociopaths be considered as funny?",
            "content": "Well TV sociopaths can indeed. In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (\"Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:-Dennis Reynolds: A malignant narcissist in its truest form. Dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. A reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger (if they say no) to get girls in bed with him. He shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister (who he constantly refers to as a bitch). -Mac: Dennis's best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gang's plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. He even benefits from Dennis's system to pick up and seduce girls, because Dennis let's Mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. Mac believes himself a skilled martial artist (Even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life) and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism.-Charlie: Although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the other's in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. He spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue (yes, he huffs glue). Being the most na\u00efve from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isn't above manipulating them either. He is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts.-Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds: Dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. She is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. Although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. She is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved.-Frank Reynolds: An impulsive, violent and eccentric ex-millionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. His likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham (Yes, ham). He is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang.This show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. Is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. These are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words: You will enjoy every minute of it.",

Only eventually it would be just like getting hooked on something as now I'm a faithful viewer of the series it's just like a religion. And who wouldn't be hooked the series it pushes the envelope it's far out funny and crude and rude as it just doesn't give a hoot and all of the characters are risk takers and speak it like it is about the world as I agree with them it's time we come down on this society more as it's became to much of a yes man and politically correct one. And the chemistry between the actors and guest is top notch. As it's a watch for the legendary Danny Devito who shines here as he proves he's not to good to do a cable comedy sitcom after being in many big screen movies it doesn't affect his legendary status.Anyhow it was created by Rob McElhenney(who plays Mac)and many episodes were directed by Fred Savage(\"The Wonder Years\")as it's set in the city of brotherly love Philadelphia, PA. And always the opening sequences get you into the mood well by showing city landmarks from Market Street, the Rocky statue, and Lincoln Financial Field. So you feel that Philly freedom! The plot and storyline aside from just four grown friends having a ball of fun, is centered around Danny Devito who as Frank Reynolds is still in Philadelphia with his two grown kids Dennis(Glenn Howerton)and Dee(Kaitlin Olson)and they hang out with Charlie(Charlie Day)and Mac(Rob McElhenney)who are two grown slacker men who've been friends since childhood. And all four of the grown adults gets their kicks and meetings together at the Irish pub bar they run called \"Paddy's\".And thru the years the series has provided some funny and crazy moments of themes that center around road trips, medical problems, relationship problems, alcohol contests with rival bars, stalking, protest, crazy inventions, illegal immigration, and just down right good old funny fashioned fun with the gang pushing the limits and rules of not only just the law but society also. Overall this series is never boring or dull with it's wacky and crazy far out themes that's what makes it so watchable and likable is that it's different! Really a wonderful series one of the best on TV as it proves with it's comedy and raunchy fun that it's okay to be crude, rude, and outspoken in a crazy and envelope pushing way! Glad to see a show that speaks to society in a blunt and feel good fashion proving not to take life serious as it's okay to have fun your way. So be ready and remember \"It's Always Sunny in Philadlephia\" as it's good and nice to look at the cool and crummy side of life!",

I'm now on episode one of season two, having finished season one which was so good especially those last couple episodes. Absolutely brilliant comedy. Danny DeVitos the icing on the cake, the cast is now complete, it is now whole. The characters, The Gang, are hilarious. They're vile, narcissistic, petty, and really funny. They're all so good that I struggle to even try and choose my favourite here. I was thinking maybe Charlie or Mac, but Dennis is great, Dee is great, and now we have Frank. These guys are way funnier and actually more likeable then those in Friends, the trash that is Everybody Loves Raymond, yes even you Seinfeld as well. Because this is more dark, shallow, offensive and human. Humans are great people but we're also selfish as**holes, are we not? The thing is, I like many out there deal physically and mentally everyday with my own problems and for lack of a better phrase, my own poorly subjected health, so I can relate to many of the daring and absurd and triggering things these dudes and gal are doing in order to get their own way, what they want, basically for them to win. It's typical dark comedy but as of right now I feel it's done right. No laugh track forced fake laughter, subtle dark comedy and subject matter but also aloud in a way that's amusing and hilarious without feeling contrived or stale or recycled, comedy that's both subtle and like an outburst of its own severe knows-no-bounds type, a likeable cast and they're doing morally wrong things but how they do it, and why they do it, is actually shown and not just tossed in as a means of \"we'd better mention something quick and not treat our audience like idiots,\" and isn't relying on bored, unfunny, tiresome, reference-mentioned-every-second like tBBT or something, it actually clearly is more plausible, realistic and bold. The egotistical gang surely outranks the gang of six in Friends, the very very obnoxious loud and unfunny gang of five to eight in tBBT, I'm starting to think they're gonna become my number one. The friends in HIMYM are pretty good gang of mostly funny characters, but this already takes it to new heights for me. I wish I'd started watching this years back, way back when like 2010 or something. But it's all fresh to me, excluding season one, and I've loved it thus far. Usually I enjoy British stuff, The IT Crowd, Father Ted, Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder, The Inbetweeners, Black Books, Mr Bean, and The Office (UK) are all and I genuinely mean this, they're all fantastic. But the US has Curb Your Enthusiasm, My Name is Earl, Friends (I only like seasons 1-5 but it's worth mentioning), HIMYM and this, this masterpiece It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. This show, which I have only seen eight episodes of (but the first 4 episodes as aforementioned I've seen twice each) is just terrific viewing. Excellent, really really great stuff.",

The best example of it is episode 4 from season 2, where they all trying to screw each others mind by using all means necessary. I like it how the show covers this black humor with day to day life. The cast is brilliant and suits perfectly to characters. Mac - semi psychopath with innocent face, Dennis - a bit snobby gang leader, Charlie - the idiot loser capable to the most elaborate schemes, D who tries to be better than the rest of the gang, yet still sinks to their level ever time. Let us not forget Frank , the father of D and Dennis.

            "content": "My hat is off to these folks. This is by far the funniest sitcom I have seen. Obviously, humor is idiosyncratic; not everybody is tickled the same way. But this one works for me. I mean I love Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm, and I love Seinfeld, and MadTV, and loved Upright Citizen's Brigade, Monty Python, Second City, and others, but I have a special feeling for IASIP. I'm not going to go into details about the characters and what I like or don't like. Others here have done that well already and I agree with most. What I want to cite is the extraordinary attention to detail that actually goes into this show which often looks like impromptu mayhem: there is a video which shows how Rob went to pitch a request to Danny Devito to come on board, and Devito agreed------ but he could only schedule filming with the cast for 20 days. So they wrote every screenplay for the entire second season: every change of nuance of character, costuming, makeup, set, other characters in the scenes----ALL of it, some 450 pages of scripts for the entire second season's 10 shows----and filmed in that 20 days with Devito all of his scenes. They did this, and thanked him, and then had to go back and shoot every other continuous scene for each of the shows, all the costuming, and lighting, and character changes and retain consistency for dovetailing into Devito's scenes. It is amazing that they pulled this off so well! It is seamless. You would never suspect that they had pooled their energies so collaboratively, so faultlessly. It is remarkable too that the references to events in preceding shows are also consistently maintained throughout this season, so that the jokes feed off scenarios form earlier shows. They decided to change this format in the third season so that every show stands alone, maybe partly because of an unwillingness to exert as much effort as they had to that second season and to not re-experience that marathon of holding everything together... I don't know. It was a Herculean effort to do that second season.What I do know is that this show works so well! The cast complements one another. They all work as an unselfish ensemble. There is hope for TV humor after all. It is interesting that they went with FX----who offered them freer rein artistically than the other networks----and may not be able to work quite as blue as they could've on HBO. I can only imagine the number of times the F-bomb would be used!! They'd probably devote an entire show to it in which every other word in the dialog would be f_ _ _! Or the sex scenes which would put the ultimate 'X' back into 'sex.'They're that kind of group. They take their humor to a madcap level, misfit psychopaths out to destroy anything that interferes with personal ambitions, mutually colluding and abetting to tear down whenever any of them seems to be on the verge of success while the others aren't. Racist, sexist, misanthropic, misogynistic, narcissistic backstabbing at the highest level....! I love them!",

I'm not saying this series is too good to fail, but I am saying that I don't see this series ending until one of the lead cast members die. And really every character is so perfectly balanced, I don't think there's a better comedy cast that exists. Every character works together to never work together so well it's hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to I'd probably say Dennis, given his hilariously dark and misogynistic tendencies, which is not something I would expect to say about a comedy series.

I came across sunny the first time on IMDb and was really surprised with the rating it had. beforehand the title seemed a little too lame for me to care for, but man, if I'd known what I was missing out on...Sunny is interesting in a many ways, the production doesn't stand out as perfect especially for the first couple of episodes and it's almost like a bunch of good friends just talking nonsense for quite a long time, but then the comedy kicks in, the racial jokes, the waitress, Charlie's illiteracy, Mac's karate moves, Dennis' pride and Dee being ignored over and over again, they all seem to make sense after a while and God, are they funny! The beginnings have always been a favorite point for me when the gang starts talking about nothing and they start screaming and everything.And also let's not forget about Danny Devito and his sick twisted way of treatment of others.So don't miss out on this great little show!",

            "content": "As much as I hate lazy \"its X on Drug\" descriptions for shows, the FX tag line is probably the most accurate I've ever heard. Sunny is packed with brilliant jokes, witty lines, great set-ups and surprising twists, all anchored in a manically dark setting. In a real running time of 20 minutes, the average episode has more laugh out loud moments and darkly intelligent plotting than most sitcoms manage in a season.The whole show has an insane energy, with simple but unique characters dragging you along their genuinely bizarre trains of thought into very odd situations.Arguably the First Season is the weakest but only in comparison. I loved it and was impressed it seemed to get stronger and stronger as it progressed, with Danny DeVito's addition being a god send.This show is also refreshing in that it mainly avoids the fashion for a strong running plot that many modern comedies are using. This means a more old fashioned style of a 'wacky' adventure a week, with the occasional recurring support character. This in my opinion keeps it fresh, where a lot of other 'mature' sitcoms get dragged down by soap opera style baggage build up, Sunny can pick and choose. If proof be needed it has been optioned for a 10th Season despite its relative cult status.Best American Sitcom I've seen in some time, and there's plenty of strong contenders (Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, Community) so I don't say that lightly.",

You might be thinking that you've heard similar plot lines, but this is completely different.The show is politically incorrect, vulgar and hilarious.

            "content": "There are some TV shows where you can just sit down and watch them over and over again and they never get old, shows like Seinfeld, Golden Girls, or I Love Lucy. IASIP has a formula that never tires: take five horrible people, throw them together into wacky situations, and watch the ensuing madness. Much like Married With Children, none of the characters on this show are redeemable, they are all self-centered, envious, selfish egomaniacs constantly trying to outdo each other, and the results are always hilarious. In an age of hypsersensitivity about racism, what other program would dare to show characters in blackface? In what other program would it be hilarious to roll a dead prostitute into the hallway? Would All In The Family have dared to have a character constantly teased about his nascent homosexuality? Drug abuse, alcoholism, mental illness, theft, dead babies, bestiality, islamophobia, inbreeding, all of these things are somehow thrown into this show and filtered through the eyes of characters you would never want to know or have as neighbors in real life. And yet their one endearing trait is that they are constantly trying to be better than they are and, imbued with a cockeyed sense of morality, constantly failing. I find myself alternately laughing at them and pitying them, even as they talk over each other, so self-involved that the viewer rarely gets to see the disgusted reactions of onlookers. Even though this horrible world is normal to these people, bits of humanity shine through here and there, and that's what makes the show watchable. These people are clowns in every sense of the word, clowns that have been reinvented to reflect what contemporary living has done to humanity, and the results are uncomfortable to watch. For example, when Frank is obsessed with not being labeled a pedophile during a children's pageant, he cartoonishly goes out of his way to make sure the audience knows it, never realizing how ghoulish his stage makeup is (it was applied by an undertaker).I realize this is a long review, but there are so many layers to this show, and the characterizations are so carefully constructed, and the writing is so precise, that I'm compelled to point out that the show is still fresh after fourteen years, long after most TV shows suffer from writers burnout. I've been a fan of this show for a long time and I'll probably be watching it on my deathbed, if only to hear Dee say \"Goddamit\" one more time.",

They are dishonest, egotistical, lazy, manipulative and vengeful.

Their tactics often rely on inflicting emotional and sometimes physical and psychological pain on individuals both deserving and undeserving.

            "content": "Network: FX; Genre: Comedy; Content Rating: TV-MA (for strong language, suggested sex, violence and pervasive anti-social content); Perspective: Cult Classic (star range: 1 - 5); Seasons Reviewed: 4 Seasons Who needs enemies with friends like Dennis (Glenn Howerton, \"That 80s Show\"), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day, a real find by the show) and Dennis' sister Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson, TV's most game gal). Created by McElhenney, the premise behind \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is so rail thin that it really doesn't matter. The action revolves around 4 degenerates who own an Irish pub, Paddy's, in the city of brotherly love and through ignorance, arrogance and good old-fashioned greed stumble from one political sacred cow after another and make a mockery of it in the process.This is comedy FX- style. The first sitcom that reflects the edgy, pitch-black, give-them-hell iconoclasm you'd expect from the network that gave us \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"Rescue Me\". This is what happens when you take off the PC shackles and let a show play around with something of more substance than just sex jokes. You get a show playing with abortion, racism, patriotism, Nazism, child molesting and - a first - myspace.com. It isn't the home run that you might expect from the network, but it gets around the bases.One of my biggest pet peeves is a comedy that thinks simply pushing certain hot buttons are inherently funny. \"Sunny\" skirts dangerously close to that kind of edgy-for-the-sake-of-it humor, but it works primarily because the stories are so original and the cast is so fearlessly game.Now for the inevitable. Yes, \"Sunny\" does beg a favorable comparison to \"Seinfeld\" and manages to do so without ripping off \"Seinfeld\". I say that as somebody who thinks \"Seinfeld\" comparisons are thrown around way to frequently. Where other shows pilfered the surface-level appeal of \"Seinfeld\" - the catch phrases, the relationship/sex jokes - this is the first to understand the gutsier mechanics behind the show, pick up the heavier baton and give us grit, grime, characters of real repulsion and a mocking of things we are told to treat with reverence. As \"Seinfeld\" call-backs go, \"Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" finally gets it right - and all inside its own universe. You honestly get the sense that a \"Seinfeld\" call-back isn't what the creators are going for.The Paddy's gang treats each other in the same duplicitous way the New York Four treated each other. Except that we felt like we knew what made Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer tick. They where products of a desensitized culture. \"Sunny\" comes off meaner, more extreme and gleefully senseless. Intentionally or simply because they aren't very well developed, \"Sunny\" keeps us at arms length from its characters. They are defined simply, one-note, with enough differences to create friction between them and back stories developed in throw-away details as the show progresses (think \"South Park\"), but their personalities are boisterous and the performances are appropriately shameless. It also isn't tied to network rules or any affinity for its characters, which lets it go places \"Seinfeld\" wouldn't. Often the show dips into \"Seinfeldian\" story construction. In the most blatant example of this, the metaphorical ending of \"Charlie Wants An Abortion\" recalls an 8th or 9th season \"Seinfeld\" episode. While it is impossible to compete with what is considered by many the best show of all time, it says something that an execution of this caliber hasn't been pulled off successfully since.More off-putting and inaccessible to the average viewer, \"Sunny\" has no straight-man. The characters oscillate in pointing out each other's idiocy, but they do so with their own agendas. Nobody, even Dee, is clean. Howerton, McElhenney, Olsen and particularly Day (whose high-pitched screams of passion for the simplest line crack me every time) throw themselves so head-long into every unflattering thing they do. TV comedy veteran Olsen's Sweet Dee is so beaten down I can't imagine any other Hollywood actress willing to throw away vanity and go for it. Network add-on Danny DeVito quickly hits his stride with the gang in seasons 3 & 4\"Sunny\" also lacks the jockey, set-up/punch line sitcom rhythm we're used to. The laughs come from conversations and the way things are said. It is hard to describe any single bit or why on Earth the show is funny. If you're like me and find a group of immature people screaming at each other hilarious, than you'll pick up the show's inside-joke cult vibe.While all of this doesn't inherently translate into a non-stop laugh riot, \"Sunny\" is sporadically hysterical, which is better than most shows right now, but doesn't always hit the high mark that its endless energy and willingness to leap through the absurd promises. \"The Gang Finds a Dead Guy\" is an example of the show at its best. A loopy half hour of insanity having something to do with old people, picking up a dead man's granddaughter and a Nazi officer's uniform that seems to have no discernible direction and yet somehow fits together nicely. Now reconciled with Danny DeVito, in the third and fourth season the show really hits a stride with several episodes (including the brilliant \"The Gang Gets Whacked\" or \"Who Pooped the Bed\") that fly close to a nihilist's comic Heaven. And that music. That 50s student instructional video music is just perfect.I adore the contained, low-budget, run-and-shoot guerrilla-style look of this show. I adore that there is no relationship drama or \"clever\" story tie-togethers. \"Sunny\" is a TV life-affirming reminder that such originality still exists, even if it comes in a jumbled package of sophomoric humor where all the characters get together and their dialog dissolves into childish screaming bouts. There is a twisted specialness to \"Sunny\" that I can't quite put my finger on. It deserves to be the next cool, cult comedy.* * * * \u00bd / 5",

Moreover, it's charm and longevity (13 series and counting) owes much to great writing and acting. The familiarity of the dysfunctional group of friends and their relationships (OK not that familiar!) and conversely the unfamiliar environs of a bar in Philadelphia make this attractive to me. I've always been intrigued by the US, it's people and our commonalities and differences (I'm UK based). I love this series for that - it often provides an (albeit exaggerated) bird's eye view (via the comedy) of what is acceptable / unacceptable to a US audience and then plums the depths further by pushing the boundaries so that no member of the human race could fail to be revolted / disgusted / saddened (delete as applicable) by the gangs antics! The closest I can get to this in respect of a UK sitcom would be 'Bottom' for the crudity, 'Peep Show' for the cringiness and sometimes the 'League of gentleman' for the characterisation.

I would hate to see it go the way of the Simpsons and just continue on with no heart or relevance any more. I honestly hope it ends soon, and I say that in a positive way.

            "content": "I was resistant at first, the first episode I saw (which was just before season 7 started) was \"Gang hits the road\", I was instantly intrigued. I then binge watched the first 6 seasons in 1 week. Genuinely the funniest, laugh out loud show I've ever seen. I love it.At first I described it as \"if the guys from Seinfeld grew up in south park and were alcoholic scumbags this would be the tale of the exploits\". The show is not only about the mundane aspects of a group of sociopaths and the danger they pose to the world around them, but, in many cases it presents both sides of a topical subject, while being hilarious and not over preachy. And all the while being completely original. And then to me, it became it's own show, no longer taking inspiration from the shows before but creating inspiration for those to come. Crossing lines and doing things that no (american) live action, or probably cartoon, would dare have the balls to do.I use the first season as an example for my point. While utterly hilarious, it is I MO the weakest season. Not because it's bad, but because they hadn't fleshed out their ideas characters, or where the wanted the show to go. IMO that's often the case with first seasons. It's a little too obvious with its influences and with presenting both sides of EXTREMELY controversial subjects. In season 2, they have fun with it and accomplish the same thing with much more subtly which makes it better.I now describe it as scumbag sociopathic comedy. You want to see how far they'll take it, how many felonies they'll commit, how much damage they will cause, and how much hatred they have for Dee because it's just awesome and in a weird way you have to see it to understand that.Arguably(at time of writing this season 10 has just ended) the show has jumped the shark, but that doesn't mean it's not better than 97% of the comedies out there. And more than worth the time, but give it a little time to not be just about a topical subject but about anything.",

It may take another solid season for this show to cultivate a substantial core audience. But it seems FX is willing to stick with it long enough to find out. Even if FX decides to run this show up against the big boys (CBS' \"Without a Trace\") in the fall, Thursdays at 10pm is a perfect time slot. Sunny is gritty and dark at times, but in a harmless and smart kind of way. Kudos, FX...This show is a winner!",

Much to the show's own benefit, the actors,aside from Danny Devito, started as basically nobodies. In fact, the original four were friends before the show, and their chemistry shines through their performances( however this isn't to say that Devito doesn't mesh with the original four ). One of the show's few downsides, however, is that the character's need some getting used to in order to establish their places in the show and understand their sense of humor. On the other hand, this sacrificed time period will result in the best viewer to character connection a person can find in a comedy.I hear tons of people say that IASiP is \"Seinfeld on crack\", but, as accurate a statement as that is, I would much rather say it's what you would see if the brute, crudeness of the Chappelle's Show was juxtaposed with Arrested Development.",

Even the less funny episodes have at least one memorable line that you could repeatedly watch. However, if you are a plot seeking viewer, this show may not be for you, as it, like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, is not a main focus. The characters are hilarious, and rather than balance each other out, they are all related in their actions, and just make the situation worse and worse, until they push to the extremes.

Absolutely hilarious and the show never lets up from there. The most recent season finished up not too long ago. I was concerned about watching it. I thought it might be more Politically Correct and not push the limits like it has done before, but I was shockingly surprised. It's the same old gang and same old comedy.Almost everything about this show is perfect. The writing and characters are one of a kind. Sure, there are a few jokes throughout the series I may not have laughed at but when I mean few, I really mean it. Almost every line and it's delivery is executed perfectly. I was a big fan of The Office and still am but I am a much bigger fan of Its Always Sunny.

I stuck with it though because i could see that there was real talent there in the actors and the writing. The first season was rough but thankfully all of the actors have found their groove. The result is stellar. My favorite sitcoms of all time, in no particular order: King of Queens, Seinfeld, Big Bang Theory, Last Man Standing, The Office, 3rd Rock From the Sun, Angie Tribeca, and Detectorists. Now I'm adding Always Sunny in Philadelphia. One thing all of these shows have in common, besides being laugh out loud funny, is it took the first season for everyone to settle into their roles. An interesting little surprise: Charlie Day can sing!\nAMENDMENT TO MY FIRST REVIEW:\nI have now watched through season 12. The show is still funny and I continue to enjoy watching these characters. HOWEVER, one thing that started to happen is onscreen apologies for jokes about gay people. Apologizing for a joke is a no no in comedy. (Often the best comedy doesn't follow any rules... except no apologies!) It's really weird. A bit of cognitive dissonance perhaps. This show mocks everything, including suicide, priests that molest children, religion, lack of religion, if it exists it's mocked on this show. Yet the only thing they apologize for is gay jokes? Super weird. Mock whatever you want, but don't apologize! And just for clarity: unfortunately my life has been touched by suicide but the attempted suicide scene was hilarious. This show has a knack for making anything funny. But when they apologize it ruins it.",

This enforces the point of the show truly being an original show. This show was uniquely created, straying far from the path of generic and repetitive comedies that are being aired, and aired again on various standard networking channels. As I stated, it took time to get me hooked, only because it was unlike anything I have seen on television, thus I needed more time to adapt to the humor. It's always sunny has great characters that really engulf you in their charismatic, oddly charming, and awkward ways. The humor itself ranges from awkward silly humor, and all the way to dry situational comedic antics. Needless to say, it has a vast supply of fresh material, suiting many comedic influences.The characters are a remarkable sight, the outgoing nature and chemistry between the cast allow for a more authentic situation feel. Although the situations may be extravagant, or off the wall, it still feels like one can relate to the emotions and actions of the characters. The premise of the show itself isn't necessary brand spanking new, but once again, the antics of the characters are so unique it will leave you laughing at the sincerity of the actors expressions and actions.All the characters have their strengths, and I must say again, the sincerity and depth of the situations that the characters are put through are very humorous. Charlie (Charlie Day) being one of the most unique characters, brings a lot to the table. His crazy endeavors, which he frequently pulls the rest of the cast into, are far from normal. He seems like the genuinely misunderstood character because of the incredibly awkward and strange situations he is in. (eg. Rat Bashing, climbing in sewers, crazy ideas, inventions, etc) Dennis and Mac are great characters as well, along with Dee and frank, they all have great chemistry. It is honestly a great, fresh show, and you will have no idea what will happen to 'the gang' in upcoming episodes. The episodes are like a 'free-for-all', as I said, anything can happen to the gang. You can rely on the fact that things will get of hand, and the 'things/situations' will be dealt with in a off-colour way. It really is a fabulous show, and is definitely recommended as a somewhat 'light-hearted comedy'. By this I mean it is the kind of show that really gives you the warming laughter, sometimes hysterical laughter, that you could just click on at any moment, and just have a good time.",

They are always caught up in some messed up issue that is actually very relate-able to the world issues today such as abortion, alcohol and drugs. And the things they do to get out of their mess and the things they say or the ideas they express is brilliant. I don't mean brilliant as in very smart and logical though.They make comments and they do things that make us think wow, people in general are stupid and we do ugly things and that it should stop. The movie is not suitable for viewers below 17 though. The jokes are rude and offensive. There are many disturbing scenes, but still extremely funny. 9/10",

Dennis, Mac, Charlie, and Deee are the new generations version of Jerry, George, Kramer, and Elaine yet much much more funny. This is definitely Seinfeld on crack. I have never laughed so hard at a show. They get it right on every episode. This show is not for anybody who is a tighta$$ or a pricK or you will not like it. Its about a bunch of assholes that run a bar and take advantage of each other at every given opportunity. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a tribute to America. Freedom of Speech. Watch it.

Cementing this fact, was the 5 minute long dance act in the seasons final episode \"Mac Finds His Pride\" . Frank looked misty eyed into the camera and uttered \"I get it\". Well let me tell you...I don't get it. I feel the creators have lost their grasp on what people found funny and great about the show to begin with and there is a clear feeling that they have moved on and are doing other stuff independently from one another. Dennis, one of the strongest characters, if not THE strongest, isn't even in half the episodes. I am so disappointed right now.",

Some have talked about the bad plots,the one-dimensional characters, the yelling over top of each other. Yes, yes, and yes.If you notice, however, there are usually 3 plots per episode carried by groups of two or three main players. Each \"plot\" unfolds within the series of skits that make up each show. In this regard, it's much like 30 Rock with absurd plots, unbelievable characters, etc. I love 30 Rock, too.The characters are like asteroids. Each a simple little bit of inorganic rock that sometime in the past crashed into each other and stuck. Whenever one spirals in, so do they all. And it happens every show - we just never know what THAT is going to look like.As for the screaming - I'm from back east (Pittsburgh, not Philly) where people talk/holler over each other, at high volume, with amazing frequency. It transports me back to the land of Thick Skin. The beauty of this in this show - whether intentional or not - the yelling is a character itself. When it enters a scene, anything or anyone not engaged in the shouting ceases to exist. I find that hilarious, especially when the yelling stops and the characters seem to not notice it even happened. Only the poor bystanders are aware. Very Stoogelike.So that's my two cents. Sophomoric, blue, controversial issues, lacking in social graces, scatological. Whatever. It hits its demographic and some unlikely outliers.",

This is a show where over the twelve current seasons of this show, there has never been an episode that has failed to land a single laugh and that's probably in how layered and well written each script has been for this show. They take time to write each episode which layered upon that we have excellent chemistry from this cast that fully embody each of their respective roles without a missed beat. It's a show that never feels stale and genuinely deserves all the praise it gets. Whilst this is a great comedy and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who was interested, it's not for everyone. When this show is raunchy, it gets very raunchy; when it gets dark, it gets very dark, it's a show that holds no bars. In this way, you could compare it to South Park to some extent and it deserves its status as one of the best comedies of the 21st Century along with it. It's Always Sunny is an incredibly funny and smartly written satire of Sitcoms that has no sign of slowing down.

            "content": "I don't think I've seen a show that just gets consistently better season by season other than this one. From it's excellent cast of characters; abundance of episodes and ability to always increase the bar, It's Always Sunny remains one of the most boundary-pushing, unapologetic TV shows to ever exist. Sunny's no stranger to tackling difficult subject matters, but it's never out to cause offense and somehow feels incredibly inclusive despite it's bigoted, prejudiced cast. Like a twisted version of Friends, if you were to describe this show's characters to someone without them seeing it, they'd no doubt imagine a group of the most loathsome, delusional people you can imagine. But, after 14 seasons, it's impossible not to fall in love with all the characters and their individual, unusual tendencies.The show follows 5 friends who run a bar, there's Mac, played by Rob McElhenney the show's creator, who is a closeted, religious man who's gone through a number of transformations for the show now, going from thin, to fat, to having the physique of a part-time bodybuilder. Then there's Dennis, a manipulative, sociopathic sexual deviant who's more than likely to be a serial killer. Dee is Dennis' twin sister and a constant recipient of ridicule from the other members of the gang (and if I was forced to pick a favourite, it would probably be her.) Then you have Charlie, the bar's illiterate janitor who lives in squalor and enjoys huffing dangerous inhalants. Last, but far from least, is Danny DeVito's now iconic Frank Reynolds - the misogynistic, rich father to Dennis & Dee, for a few seasons anyway. There's also a bevvy of interesting side-characters, Rickety Cricket & the Waitress are probably the most well-known, and for good reason, but my personal favourite is Artemis, who unfortunately doesn't appear in too many episodes.As the show's gone on, the cast have really found their characters and nail down even the little characterisations like the faces they make and their body language. I think Dennis has come the furthest, he's always been vain, but the exploration of his devious side really made the character step up to the heights of the others - he was my least favourite for a while, now I just love them all. The show's definitely become more unrealistic, but it evolves with the times perfectly from the social issues explores down the technology used in the episodes.\"McPoyle vs. Ponderosa: Trial of the Century\" is one of my favourite episodes. Not only does it have a cameo from Guillermo Del Toro, but it brings together so many side-characters and shows you just how badly the gang have messed up their lives. Another favourite is \"The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention,\" which is one of Frank's funniest episodes. \"The Gang broke Dee,\" \"The Gang dances their asses off\" and \"Time's up for the Gang\" are also favourites too name a few more.I don't think any other show out there makes me laugh as much as this, it's the sort of dark humour you don't need to feel bad laughing about, but it's still daring enough to leave you a little shocked. The quotability and references across the internet have cemented this, in my opinion, as a future-classic that I hope will stay on the air forever.",

I wish it was more popular but if that ruins the quality than I don't mind it getting low ratings.I will stand up and say its better than \"The Office.\" \"The Office\" is funny but sometimes the jokes are so dry that I just laugh in my mind and not out loud.So get away from the Office and invest in Always Sunny.

It is however,to those who are not easily offended, just brilliant. The show centers around five people in Philadelphia who own a bar and get themselves into sticky situations as a result of their personalities.The show is funny as it is primarily character-driven, with the characters who are each extremely obnoxious, rude and self-centered in their own way. The characters instantly frustrate and annoy anyone who comes near them, as well as trying to manipulate each other to do things for their own selfish purposes.These interactions with other people are often the funniest part of the show. When people are around them they find themselves essentially shut out of the conversation, as though the cast is in a different dimension, and end up extremely frustrated by the situation they have found themselves in. The dialogue is also extremely good, focusing on the relatively mundane and the crazy simultaneously. My reference to that would be the \"power bottom\" scene where they discuss the positions in a homosexual relationship.The comparison of It's always sunny to another good comedy Seinfeld is apt but It's Always Sunny edges out the juggernaut of comedy on it's characters, as Seinfeld's characters are always at least a little bit likable. You at no stage should find It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's characters likable as they have no shred of human decency. And that is what is quintessentially at the heart of this show and produces the comedy, which was also the case for Seinfeld.It's Always Sunny is one of the great comedies, but not for the easily offended.",

Characters and their motives are very important and without some background their behaviors probably seem like random violent acts with no purpose. The characters aren't one dimensional, and that's a big plus for me.I also like the colors, camerawork and the atmosphere. It's the perfect dark comedy setup; creates a good balance.I like pretty much everything about it, physical comedy, disgusting and shocking parts, parodies, lots of dad issues, trashy behavior. Even though some things are really dark, gross or weird none of them is overkill. This show doesn't depend on the shock factor.Overall, it's number one in my comedy list now. Great writing, aesthetically pleasing, great cast, multi-layered interesting characters, very absurd situations, clever takes on hot topics like sexism and racism. Sometimes a show goes well until a certain point and then starts to crumble. People start leaving, material runs out or something happens with the writers,characters get old or the plot simply dissappears..It's great to see that at the 13th season the gang is rocking it just like it's the first day.I hope that this show goes on forever, or something close to that.",

Remember these are the same guys who made more than two blackface episodes, which were hilarious. Too sad they caved in and gave up on something beautiful.

Your parents and some of your older friends may not get the jokes or the humor behind it, but depending on how old you are, you probably will. Rob, Glenn, and Charlie are all great writers and don't try to hard to make the show funny, it just is. They do go overboard with jokes sometimes, but the more you watch it the more you get that that's just how the \"gang\" is. While watching you can tell a majority of the dialogue is improv, but everyone in the show pulls it off extremely well. The chemistry between the characters is great. I give this show two thumbs up, Roger Ebert style.",

Surprisingly from when I first saw this, I am now HOOKED on this comedy, and to be honest, it is now one of the best comedies out there. I am glad FX stayed with it, it has gotten better with each episode. This is the \"little comedy that could\" and it's fantastic.When this \"It's always sunny in Philadelphia\" started, it had a very rocky comedy start for me. Then when Danny DeVito was added to the gang the next year, it all began to click. This show is hilariously funny and you will just fall in love with the gang and their exploits at Paddy's Pub. The openings of the show are to die for comically-- and yes, I'll admit my favorite so far is the \"Kitten Mittens\" opening. (I spelled it right, you have to see it on the show!) The reaction of the gang is what makes this show comedic gold and sets you up for what's to come.Paddy's Pub in Philadelphia is trying to stay afloat; and its curious how they can do so with the staff they have. But that's exactly what makes it stay afloat. The Gang tackles what is going on around them, and what is happening to them and does so in such a childish-realism that you cannot help but laugh and sometimes cheer them on at the same time. Would you want Dee, Frank, Dennis, Charlie and Mac to be your friends? Well, the truth is, you probably have friends that are just the same as they. And that's what makes it fun.",

What I think people love so much about this show is how the writing manages to incorporate extremely taboo themes (racism, paedophilia, etc) and miraculously turn them into hilarious episodes. There are a lot of laugh out loud moments in the show but what I believe the show excels in is the dry satirical comedy which not everyone can fully apprieciate. If you enjoy a good laugh and aren't easily offended then I can almost guarantee that this show will have your sides splitting.",

Why the people involved in this show aren't big stars is beyond me. What this group reminds me of is a lot like how Ben Stiller got his start. He had his own show which no one watched but it showcased his talent. I can recommend this to everyone except for those old fogies that don't get it. I would even say that most of this will go over anyone younger than 25 as well, but in that good way. This show grows on you more and more & everyone involved is brilliant & some of the best eps are the ones directed by Fred Savage. I could go on and on but go watch these while they're still free on Hulu. This is one of those shows I will buy when they are all done, because these can be watched just like you watch the older \"South Park\", eps. too.",

What happens everyday are outrageously hilarious situations these characters get themselves into, for instance in one episode, two characters try become drug addicts just to be put on welfare. Every episode is extremely original, and it never seems to get old. There are many reasons to laugh at this show. One of them is the joke after joke formula, never trying to hard to be funny. The other thing that makes you laugh at this show is how you can tell this cast loves making this show, and how you can tell they have just as much fun making the show as how much fun the actual show is.If you haven't seen this show, I beg you to give it a shot.

For those of you who have watched It's Always Sunny from the beginning, you will remember the original tag line for the show, \"Seinfeld on Crack,\" ; a spot-on description of this crude yet brilliant series. It fits that description in two key respects; every character in the show is a selfish low- life, (thus the term Seinfeld) and the setting and lifestyle of the characters is an urban, dingy, filthy one, filled with glue-huffing, cat food consumption, beer drinking, anonymous sex.. etc. (thus the term crack). But I hope this seemingly disgusting and crass description of the show does not eschew you from watching it. Quite on the contrary, I hope it encourages you to watch it, because it is funny. Well written and well acted, I never get tired of hearing the five main characters, each one of them victims of a major character flaw, attempt to find their way through conflict and success, and fail every time. Just watch one episode, preferably an early 2nd season one, and I promise you, you will be hooked. Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis, and Frank never fail to make whatever they are going through into some ridiculous circumstance that exudes comedy.",

(The Waiter showing up several times annoyed me)\nI can appreciate them trying new episode formats etc as there have been really successful episodes that spring from those creative ideas (Being Frank, Charlie Work) but this season the new writers didn't know how to properly balance the creativity and there was a lot more misses than hits in this season. Don't get me wrong though as there are a few good episodes this season and the season finale though feeling out of place in regarding to episode ordering is actually a really great touching yet different episode of IASIP.Another big reason I think this season feels so \"off\" is that is obviously needs Dennis as a full-time character in order to continue and I hope that the future seasons will all include Dennis because this show absolutely does not work without him. It bothered me a lot more than I am willing to admit that they had Mac acting like Dennis in the Super Bowl episodes this season. He felt like a stand-in placeholder spouting off Dennis lines at the gang that episode and don't even get me started on all those wasted cast cameos in that episode.PROS: The Gang Escapes, Time's Up For the Gang, The Gang Gets New Wheels, The Gang Solves the Bathroom ProblemCONS: The Gang Makes Paddy's Great Again, The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot, Charlie's Home Alone, The Gang Wins the Big GameMIXED: The Gang Does A Clip Show, Mac Finds His Pride",

            "content": "'It's Always Sunny''s success comes from it's uniquely edgy and different style of comedy. It achieves this through the brilliantly created group dynamic; a group of shockingly self-serving and callous people- to the point of murder of one another is casually dropped into conversation- manage to create brilliant comedy, due to this fact. Each character is developed so that they have their own unique comic selling point (Charlie's uncomprehendingly disturbed psyche or Dennis' psychotic vanity and obsessive need for control or manipulation, for example). Yet as a group the comic value is furthered as it is although, together, they are horrendously dysfunctional but also darkly harmonic at the same time.Although saying all of this, I think the show does begin to show cracks in it's original and edgy surface around season 8 and these cracks definitely become more noticeable throughout season 9. I think the show's commercial success has negative consequences for it's style. This is because I think the show's selling point or reason for success might have been it's fringe edginess which is achieved through the use of a low budget and focus on characterisation and natural dynamic and atmosphere. I think with the extra resources and money the writers may have steered in the wrong direction, which subsequently meant the comedy seemed more forced and the natural dynamic of the group less prevalent.Although, nonetheless, a brilliant comedy well worth a watch. Don't write it off right away though, once accustomed to the characters, the style of comedy hits home.",

It's pretty generic because they back and forth between doing something right and then messing everything.Obviously we see some rehashed episodes but that's TV for you. The Season 6 seems a bit dull to me compared to the other seasons but I am happily downloading Season 7 now.Don't take this for an epic something, it's just a funny show that some may or may not enjoy, for me it's a welcome change compared to other shows.

But this, this is something I haven't seen before. A good comedy show. The characters, Dennis, Dee, Mac and Charlie are all one of a kind, hilarious every episode, hilarious towards each other. They all seem to treat each other like crap, but in the end, are still 4 friends who own Paddy's. Danny DeVito came on to the show as Frank, and I thought he was a great add. He is very funny in this, and has his moments of amazing. With all five of these characters, it makes the show great and unique.This show is not one you usually see, where everyone is cheesy, corny, and has the added in clapping in the background after each joke. This show, you actually laugh while you watch it, and don't have to be told when a joke is said since there is no clapping. If you want to see a good comedy, this is it. I thought for a while Two and A Half Men was hilarious, but then it just kept getting repetitive and boring. Then I discovered this, and was immediately hooked. It's like crack. Every episode is different, and they are all hilarious, and there hasn't been a bad episode yet!",

            "content": "OK, I'm glad that people like the show. I truly am. Any show that people can find some joy in watching is okay by me; even if I'm baffled as to why. With a mind-boggling user-rating of 9.2, this might not seem like the best place to offer a dissenting view; but what the heck, I'm a rebel. There's a quote on the home page that says, \"Seinfeld on crack.\" Surely, they jest. The only thing these two shows have in common is that they were filmed.Now, the main problem for me is that I suppose I've never particularly found crude, uncouth, blatantly moronic characters to be particularly funny (Hence why My Name is Earl never really tickled my funny bone). But the biggest problem I had with It's Always Sunny, was that after watching 1 episode from each season, and 2 from the latest season, was that I found it's so painfully unfunny. But what kept nagging me was WHY did I find it so incredibly unfunny. I mean, I know why I find a lame comedy like 2 1/2 Men so painfully unfunny (a laugh track turned up to 10 for every incredibly predictable, lame joke offered would be my starting point. But I digress). I believe great comedy is made up of certain elements. Among the most brilliant comedies in recent TV history that displayed these elements would be shows like Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Office, and 30 Rock, to name a few. Below is what I think those elements are:1) Top-notch, highly skilled comedians or comic actors in the lead roles.2) Comedic actors who are not only highly-skilled and have perfect timing, but are incredibly interesting to watch (e.g., Jason Alexander, Alec Baldwin, Larry David, Steve Carrell, Michael Richards). It's Always Sunny at least has the great Danny DeVito, but the poor writing wastes his talent. Which leads me to...3) Writing that is so damn clever, with plots lines that tie together so perfectly, and jokes that are so unpredictable that you literally laugh out loud. It's not hard to see why all these shows have been nominated repeatedly for Emmys (along with the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Another perfectly-crafted comedy led by a highly-skilled comedian).4) Characters and subject matter that is instantly relatable. We've all had moments where we felt like George Costanza or Larry David or Liz Lemon or Jerry Seinfeld, or dealt with a Jack Donaghy. As hard as I searched, I couldn't find ANY of these elements in \"It's Always Sunny...\" The writing is insipid and reminds you of those two drunk guys at the end of the bar who are convinced they are hilarious after about 12 beers, with punchlines that fall flat. \"DUDE! Oh my god, remember that time I farted so loud at that frat party that I set off the house alarm? That was SO FUNNY!\"The acting is uneven, with Danny DeVito and Kaitlen Olson doing most of the heavy lifting. Olsen is quite good. As for Rob McElhenney, I give the guy a ton of respect for creating and getting someone to believe in the show enough to buy it, but let's be honest here, the man does not belong in front of a camera. Acting is not his strong suit. Or maybe it's just the poorly written role, but something's gotta give. A show can get away with having characters who are not very bright, provided we care about them. Kramer on Seinfeld may have been an idiot, but he was a lovable idiot, with his heart always in the right place; same goes with the Joey on Friends, or Ted Baxter on the Mary Tyler Moore Show. But the two moronic characters played by McElhenney are Day are so absurdly dumb (as when they throw a box spring, serving as a ladder, out of an empty pool, leaving them stranded; a joke we see a mile away), are so incredibly unlikable that you can't muster the strength to root for them. And yet, they're too boorish and crude to even be fascinated by them.But hey, people seem to dig the show, and that's all that counts. But if you're not a fan of lowbrow comedy, completely lacking in cleverness (as opposed to Family Guy and the Farrelly Brothers movies which are lowbrow, but incredibly clever), this show might not be for you. I'm still trying to square in my head how the same people who recognize the brilliance in shows like Seinfeld and The Daily Show, could also find anything remotely funny here.",

They get into all sorts of zany antics, with very little to no restraint or sense of decency.The stories tend to revolve around one or two main plots, along with some subplots (all four characters tend to have something going on). Eventually all these plots run together, and usually deliver a big-bang of a final punchline to go out on.As for the show itself; the tag-line is pretty accurate (\"It's like Seinfeld on crack\"), it's the darker cousin of Seinfeld. Whereas Seinfeld focused on little issues like \"soft talkers\", 'Philadelphia' focuses on things like \"tea-bagging\" or dating trannies. If you are a fan of both situational, and dark comedy, this is most definitely a show you NEED to see.There are VERY few shows, movies, or stand-up acts that get me to laugh out loud; but 'Philadelphia' seems to get me every time. It's definitely worth a look if you are in the mood for a good laugh.",

The plot lines were all over the place and I couldn't make sense of it. Their crazy antics made me laugh but I was completely lost. And then I experienced it, \"The Nightman Cometh\"...the episode that changed it all for me! I found everything from the \"rape scene\" to the marriage proposal so intriguing that I was determined to watch the entire series and piece this Sunny puzzle together.I did my homework. I bought the Six Pack (Seasons 1-5 & \"A Very Sunny Christmas\"), Season 6 and I even ended up buying the soundtrack. I caught up to it within a few weeks and I am hooked! This is not your typical (boring) cast of characters and the fact that they do not fit the typical (predictable) sitcom mold is what makes it so darn excellent! And to add to the charm of the show, I come to find out that they're all pretty much married to each other in real life! :-) I LOVE this show! They bring a huge smile to my face!

It seems like every episode they are yelling about something, I have to turn the volume down during those scenes. I suspect they thought this was needed to make up for the lack of background laughter as that was still common with other sitcoms when this started. Now that people are used to the opposite, comedy shows that don't have background laughter and often aren't constantly loud, they could also tone down this aspect of the show in my opinion.",

All this was made possible through the above-mentioned excellent writing and the twists that it presented us with during his time in Ireland!Same goes for everyone! Dennis reached new levels of megalomania but also revealed some (hidden until now) emotion. Dee became more confident, Frank more crazy and sentimental at the same time!This season was a delight, so much that i wouldn't blame them if they thought to put an end to it here. It would be the most perfect ending!UNLESS the guys have more in store for us! And why not? They have proved to be resilient and creative and now that they are at their most mature phase of writing and acting, they could deliver more and better things for us!I truly can't wait!",

The first and most significant reason this show should be a mandated watch for everyone is that no other sitcom on television right now is managing to make satirical commentary on our society and the mess of American politics in real time the way Sunny does. They've covered every possible political or social issue you can think of from BOTH SIDES (which very few shows are doing). The characters themselves are despicable ridiculous but so entertaining. The show is by far the funniest show on television right now, makes me actually laugh out loud not just exhale heavily through my nose. I cannot stress how amazing this show is - watch it. Sunny isn't afraid of going \"there\" - wherever that may be. No other modern shows are willing to take the risks in writing or production that Sunny is, and it executes these risks often flawlessly.

The term \"reluctant adult\" is apposite.I am always wary of fashion trends, gender neutral toilets, me to, times up, racism, immigration, border wall, health fads, etc etc. These are fleeting issues of interest that are not best tackled within this format.In the show we had different levels of intellect and character definition, now they seem all sharp, smart mouthed, etc etc. So the script writing has changed in this respect.Lastly the show primarily was driven by a new ridiculous plan in each episode and how this played out, this was the narrative drive, now as a viewer we are cast adrift and it has descended into a talking shop which can become tedious.I am sure this will come back on track when they connect again with their inner childs.",

Danny De Vito as Frank Reynolds will be forever remembered by TV lovers for years to come.

Despite its crassness, its very very clever and sharp and leaves you wanting more. The cast are almost perfect. Narcissism is at the forefront of all the characters minds, they only care about what suits them.

He is the sneakiest by coming up with bizarre plans and his skills don't make clear sometimes. Dennis is apparently the looks. He is a man whore who takes advantage of women by lying and sociopath. He lives with mac and has the biggest ego of being the smartest and being a god. He thinks he's the most attractive man alive. Mac is rooming with Dennis. Mac refers to himself as the brains. His ideas are good in concept but never succeed. He doesn't concern anything unless he's involved in it. His ego is to be a super buff guy and being the greatest martial artist meanwhile he can't fight or he's too cowardly to. His name is Ronald MacDonald. Dee is Dennis's twin sister. She is emotionally beaten by the others about everything. She is a giant bird because she's annoying and ugly.

Having other continued stories that interact with recurring characters also gives the show plenty of material to draw from. For instance, characters like Cricket and the Lawyer, the molester uncle with small hands, and Artemis, etc. The story continues through these character's lives in many ways, while the main group of stars kind of lives or develops in their own bubble, which gives the show both consistency, and a driving story that still continues into the future. Devito is excellent, and these people are just so ignorant and outrageous, ending up in the funniest and most non-PC situations, that you can't help but revel in the stupidity and hilariousness of the dumpster fire these characters create or run into. This show takes TV comedies to the next level, and blows others out of the water. Most sitcoms and TV comedies are very tame, not daring to risk tackling some of the biggest controversial and hot-button topics of the day, but this crew demolishes all of them in a way that just makes me smile. Sometimes, you just shake your head at the stupidity of the characters--especially Mac and Charlie, and then (only slightly more enlightened) Frank or Dennis have to try to remedy the situation, while constantly making fun of Dee, who you would feel sorry for if it wasn't revealed that she is just as much of a jerk-off as the males, if not more shallow. Other shows also push a lot of political propaganda or their brand of morals for left or right wing views; this show makes a lot of good points about all of it, without preaching and acting like an afterschool special sobfest or Ad Council message for kids. It just gives you a brutal, no-holds- barred look at what can happen when wacky, egocentric morons encounter any number of these issues and fall into disaster.",

Charlie Day is my personal favorite, but Danny De Vito's frank is masterful as well. Check out the \"frank in a couch\" clip on Youtube if you have never seen this show... favorite episode was a Christmas episode from a few years ago, that involved biting Santa's ear off, closing down a shopping mall, hundreds of extras, and the two guys responsible for the carnage wander back into the bar as tho nothing has happened.

            "content": "Always Sunny is Quite possibly the greatest shows on television today. One could agree it's comparative to the late great \"Sinfeild\" but much more raunchy and wild. Every episode never fails to amuse me. I absolutely love this show, I've seen literally every episode. In the heart of its 9th season out of most likely 10, It saddens me that this is the final stretch of this wonderful sitcom. One could only hope they seal it off with an Always Sunny Movie. It's more of the gang for all of us to see. The addition of Danny Devito in season two really saved the series. They couldn't of found a better actor for his elderly sex driven character. Such a delusional, diabolical, slightly egotistical and supposedly, an incredibly wealthy former businessman. Decides to share a futon pullout couch with Charlie in essentially, a one room apartment. Frank, who is known to bang a lot of whores. We already know how he's Dennis and Dee's step father. He may or may not be Charles biological father.This show just wouldn't be the same without Charlie Kelly. His Wildcard personality, dyslexia, and lack of illiteracy fits him perfectly. The best aspect of Charlie is his childish, extremely high voice. Essentially make every word he says quotable. He's wonderful musician, as well as a handyman. He's incredibly non intelligent, while he tries to be. Like when he tried to talk bird law with the lawyer. Or when he believed that the trash he burned would heat the bar, and the smoke would according to Charlie. Go up into the sky where it turns into stars. Charlie easily one of my favorites in the gang.Mac would be another one of my favorites. Originally known as Ronald McDonald. He's obsessed of the essence of a man. All throughout the series, he's trying to establish himself as a badass. Mac's karate skills are subpar but he believes there superior to any other. He emphasizes that he's packing on mass, cultivating it. getting stronger and a more powerful of man. But in reality, he's just getting fat. I love how the actual actor, did the weight gain on purpose. Just for the ironic humor it posses. Mac so obsessed with the perfection of a male body, he might be gay. Dennis Reynolds thinks he's just Gods little gift to this earth. Him and Mac are the perfect duo. Two want to be badasses. I just love how these two go rambling on everything, trying to break them down in such a sarcastic way. He's notorious for his Dennis system an acronym of the letters D.E.N.N.I.S. I myself have tried this system and has done wonders for me. Dennis thinks he's indestructible. Nothing can possibly bring this man's confidence down. He does get cruel and cold throughout. Then there's Sweet Dee.. Dennis's twin sister. I really, really don't like Dee. Neither does really anyone else in the gang. She's a skinny ugly, lanky white bitch. A survivor of the Schooliosous back disease. Who wore a horrific back brace in high school. She inherited the nickname the aluminum monster, the name suits her well. The gang also calls her a bird. It makes sense because she actually does look like an evil raven. There is a scene where Mac is washing his hands in the women's bathroom and she's in there, but instead of Dee in the bathroom. She was replaced by a big ostrich. Mac didn't even acknowledge it, just shows us how the gang actually see's her. Also, in the 100th episode. Just a few weeks ago. It was called \"The Gang Saves the Day!\" they were in a convenient sore while it was being robbed, while everyone went through there simulation of how there ego would go about saving the day, Sweet Dee would die in almost every scenario. Dee really is the gangs punching bag and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is such an amazing show, I'm impatiently waiting until they but season 8 on Netflix. I would watch episode after episode, and they do not seem to get old. I've gotten my family hooked on this show, it's simply a classic TV show and should be considered along with the greats.",

They seem to like the type of humor that is on this show. They do have some funny moments, but I can't say that I am amused at the crude, disrespectful and politically incorrect humor through most of the series. Nothing is off limits. Mac even does one show in blackface when they decide to make a movie of Lethal Weapon 6. On the internet they even have an article called The Ten Most Vile Actions of the Paddy's Pub House Gang on \"Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And that was from 4 years ago, so I am sure they can add a lot more to that list. I think what annoys me the most is all the yelling. I don't think I have ever watched a TV series that spends 80% of the time yelling at such a high decibel. The one thing that I am curious about is how they got Danny Devito to be a regular on the show. Since it has lasted 10 seasons, I gather the ratings are good, so it worked out for him having a regular gig. I will never say something is bad, because taste is relative.

It's so well written that even when the characters are being cruel and asinine to a certain portion of the population it never feels as if it's the writers being cruel and even feels as if the writers are actively objecting to the things the characters say and do. The things this show gets away with is just tremendous and it's due to the incredible writing and acting. It never fails to make me laugh even on my 8th time through it. It's a show you can always go back to no matter how many times you've seen it, no matter how many episodes you can recite from memory, no matter how bafoonish the characters behave.

After watching it, I was hooked, I never made plans for Thursday nights just so I could watch the new episodes. There are many things about this show that make it great.

If you make a show with him in it and still make it almost the worst sitcom on television, then you're doing something wrong. The script of this show is just so bad.But the script is not the worst thing about this show, that's the acting.Danny DeVito is good for a few laughs, but the rest of the cast isn't.->Let's start with Charly Day, the most overrated actor of the century. The only thing that guy does is get on my nerves with his overacting and hyperactive behavior. I don't understand how anyone can think that guy is funny. It's like being in the loudest part of a psychiatric hospital and i don't consider being there as funny.->Then you have Glenn Howerton and Kaitlin Olson. They are both equally bad. They're also quite invisible in this show, so there's not too much to say about them.->And then you have the 'mastermind' of this show Rob McElhenney. I have to say, maybe in another show and just as an actor maybe he can be funny ,but in this bad written show (by himself) he's just not good. I first watched 5 seasons of this show because I thought it would be as good as IMDb-reviewers made it out to be, but I was so disappointed that I almost want to cry. Every episode I hoped it would maybe grow and be better, but almost every episode was a big letdown. So don't let all these good reviews misguide you, it'll probably disappoint you as well.",

            "content": "The series starts out pretty great: a group of 4 friends (including a pair of siblings) who work at a bar they own get embroiled in various unusual scenarios related to certain hot-button issues, mostly by their own doing, due to their varied quirks, low inhibitions and questionable sense of morality.As season came after season, hardly anything remains of that solid foundation by the conclusion of Season 9, where I stopped watching (with 5 more seasons ahead of me). The character of Frank, who joins the gang on a permanent basis in Season 2, is too oddball not to take the series in a way more whimsical, less grounded direction. The gang's doings become increasingly more absurd, scattershot, moronic and villianous as time goes on; their characters grow from loveable exaggerations of some people we might know or even be to being the dumbest and most immoral people on the globe. Any sense of consequences is lost.The series loses sight of its focus on hot-buttons issues, ups the dose of gross-out toilet humour and slowly devolves into a live-action Family-Guy-esque. Meanwhile, its attempt at maintaining continuity result both in an immovable status quo (that sinks a lot of episodes but boosts some others that try to mix things up) and in a vast roster of supporting characters, many of whom you'd think are too one-note to reappear or for anyone to care to see them again.That degradation does not have a linear character, as Seasons 5 and 6 harken back to Season 1 (or even 2) every now and then, or try new things that land - but are promptly forgotten. And while good episodes can still be found later on, there's too much muck to rake through.In the end, I've certainly enjoyed a lot of the series, and the acting is brilliant with amazing delivery for more than a few great lines; and a lot of the plots are very imaginative and truly hilarious - at a certain point, the diminishing returns have to be recognised however. The series just doesn't have fuel to last that long even without pulling the engine out on the go - but it's still screeching along, god knows why.My ratings by season:\nS1: 6\nS2: 5\nS3: 4\nS4: 4\nS5: 5\nS6: 6\nS7: 3\nS8: 4\nS9: 3",

The characters are well done,everyone has something interesting to do,pairing is different from episode to episode and seems fresh no matter the formula is the same.Characters don't grow or learn- they're amoral,immature,selfish,and they don't try to be better.That's the point.When you have established characters and formula (gang tries something illegal and selfish and fail) then there's room for humour and nothing else.It's different from other (more popular,why-I don't know) sitcoms where they try to develop characters,introduce new ones,heck,even add a marriage,kids and have some'moral message'.That stuff kills comedy.Sunny reminds me of South Park a little bit,but it's not that extreme(yet).Actors are writers too,I think that's a good reason why Sunny is so good.It looks like they're just having fun and also listen to fans. Phenomenal sense of humour,hilarious characters and situations. Sunny deserves more praise.",

Seinfeld wasn't this funny when it started, and I imagine there's plenty of tasteless subjects that have yet to be bitten into.It would be a shame to lose this show.

Sure, the jokes are funny, but what really propels this show is the believability of the characters. It is hard not to relate them to people that you know.I do, however, feel the need to give a brief warning here. If you are not very well receiving of sarcastic or cynical humor, stay away; if you don't like politically incorrect humor, stay away.

In many ways it reminded me of the first few Seinfelds, where everyone is trying to find their place in the comedy universe. It wasn't until the second season Seinfeld really hit its stride. I have a feeling the same could be said for this show.The first episode was quirky and irreverent, taking on the subject of gays, racism, unrequited love and commerce. The story was held together with a deft touch, and the dialogue was close to what I've heard amongst my friends regarding the subjects above, albeit delivered with less wit and tongue-in-cheek palaver.We can only hope that FX gives this comedy half a chance to succeed and grow. It would be a much welcome addition to the sitcom art that has seen a dearth of quality programs.Peace",

The gay thing in Phila is really been used a lot like from MTV's real world. I was listening to Preston and Steve morning show on WMMR and the creator of the show was on. he says that hes on a short leash with the producers so much of the indoor scenes are done in LA, but all the outdoor scenes from the caf\u00e9s's to Temple are done on location. I hope this show puts Phila on the map (not that it already isn't with the Eagles going to the Super Bowl last season. E-A-G-L-E-S!). Between homosexuality, racism, awkward conversations, drinking, and rude humor between friends, FX has a great show on their line up.

This show has a cult-like following, and it's shows are funny, but it's nowhere near a classic.I got into the show through a Reddit article about the DENNIS system. That was a great episode. It's a perfect episode for the fraternity-bound college male who read books like The Game and went to sites like becomeaplayer.com. I enjoyed that whole heartedly.The recession episode was blatantly spoon-fed, but that was their point. They were bailing us out comically, like the government. The North Korea episode was funny, but bordered between stereotypical and full out 1970's Asian-style racism. 20 year old looking girl with a hybrid Vietnamese-Chinese accent is really a 12 year old North Korean. Ha. Ha. I get it. But in all fairness, Mr. Kim was great. Also, the relationship between the story and North Korean politics were well executed.Most of the episodes border on absurdity and full-out misogyny, which I wouldn't have a problem with if the characters were more than one dimensional. No actor or actress show any motivation for their character beyond caricature. It felt like they were just a bunch of pals bouncing lines off of each other - each of their characters could be summarized in one sentence.The only one who acts really well is Danny De Vito, although he acts like a monster reminiscent of his penguin past. Self depravity can only go so far in comedy.So there were great episodes, funny ones, and forgettable ones. This is the type of show I would play on Hulu while I'm eating dinner, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it. I might buy the dick towel, though.",

Here's the lowdown: This show could probably just as easily be set in New York or any city on the northern East Coast. It's not really about Philly. However, it is taped here and it is evident in the scenery chosen that the writers know the territory. I was worried about this show when I first heard about it. How is it going to depict my city? I thought. I figured there'd be a lot of discrepancies like, oh I don't know, having their dive bar be right in the middle of Old City, where there are no dives and precious few underage drinkers. I thought they might pull a \"Real World\" and try to make us out to be the East Coast's answer to San Francisco. Tonight I saw this show for the first time and none of my fears were realized. The characters are not exactly intricate but they will grow over time if the show is given a chance. The humor works the majority of the time, I do not feel insulted as a Philadelphian even though a few names of places on the show are fake (I understand this is probably some sort of legal issue) and the only way I could see myself making a conscious decision not to watch it is if it gets way too popular (a la Napoleon Dynamite) here in Philthy and everybody thinks they need to quote it every five minutes just because it's pretty funny and it might 'put us on the map.' Overall, if you liked \"Friends\" you'll like this.P.S. why are so many Philadelphians always talking about how great it is when we are 'put on the map.' I mean look at Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod. Great places. You know why? They're not afraid to tell commercialism and tourism to f*%k off! We must keep Philly unmarred by the mark of 'approval' that is the unrelenting, inflation-inducing tourism industry. Most people don't want to visit us, and I for one like it that way. You think I want to see you and your fanny pack and overpriced gift-shop binoculars strutting around when I'm busy struggling with my love/hate relationship with my hometown? No way, mister.

The combined and distinct humors of Charlie, Mac and Dennis as writers, coupled with a very strong and coherent character development aspect, and the ability for the show to come up with new ideas and story lines and (somehow) not feel blatantly stupid and redundant despite the VERY minimalistic main plot... all makes for a very steady foundation that allows for plenty of seasons to be binged through seamlessly.There's a difference between what the first couple of seasons feel like, and what seasons 7 and 8 feel like, and then what the last few seasons feel like... but there's a consistent quality to each episode, and they manage not to repeat themselves or go crazy just to remain relevant at all.The supporting cast is great too: the mothers, Danny Devito, \"sweet\" Dee, and the character \"Cricket\" in particular is brilliant - with the funniest scenes usually involving any of the McPoyle family members (and milk).On a slightly deeper note: the show may come across as too dark at times with its humor, but it seems as one gets up in age to where they're closer to the guys in the show's age, it's just comedy for the sake of comedy so there's definitely a certain cynicism about it all and the moralities drawn from the episodes are quite brutal: people are hopeless and hopelessly unchangeable, bad habits never break and life is tough and unfair so you might as well waste yourself away... but it's all for the laughs in the end.A solid 8/10.",

I figure people that believe Will Ferrell and Seth Rogan are funny would enjoy this because it is the same over and over just on a different day.

I love Charlie, Dee, Dennis, Mac and Frank all equally. It's the same way Seinfeld fans loved Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine all equally. The supporting cast in Sunny are also loved and always bring the \"lols\" the same way Seinfeld had George's parents, Newman etc. Don't get me wrong, two completely different shows, but one thing is undeniable, they are both bloody amazing and Sunny for me, will go down as the greatest television viewing of my short life thus far.",

I'd say that's a fair assessment. The appreciation of the humor of the show is personality-dependent, and I'm one who greatly appreciates it. I will say it took 4 or 5 episodes before I really started to feel the groove. But once I did, its been true love ever since. There is also a lot of great 80s and 90s songs in many of the episodes that's a big plus for me!I didn't start watching until s12e1 and within a week or two had watched every previous show, all out of sequence. In retrospect, that was a great approach. The characters never really changed (with the exception of Danny DeVito after the end of s2). I won't elaborate for any newcomers wishing to form their own opinion.As for recurring characters, SHOCKING change! I first met Rickety Cricket in s6, the 2nd Sunny show I watched. I didn't see his beginning (I think s2e7 The Gang Exploits a Miracle) until watching s6-11 first. My mind was blown! And I think at that point, I truly appreciated the writing of the show!When I try to tell others about an episode, I hear the words and think this sounds terrible...and I suppose the topics are. But the writing and cast are so genius with the delivery, they make taboo subjects hilarious while making you look at your own attitude about the subject matter. As warped as their attitudes can be, there is always one if them that is the voice of reason.After watching all of the episodes several times now, I still laugh out loud watching the mannerisms and facial expressions of the cast in the background that I didn't notice the first watch.The recurring characters are phenomenal as well. Artemis, Cricket, the McPoyles, Waitress, Gail the Snail, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Mac, the attorney, Zee, and the busboy are just some of those characters that add to the depth of the show. There is not one character that doesn't embody the personality to perfectly drive a point home.For those who are looking for a \"cheerful atmosphere\" or \"feel good endings\", this show is NOT for you.If you're looking an honest perspective of real attitudes of mankind, as twisted as they are. You'll probably appreciate the show.Great first watch episodes (IMO):\ns3e9 Sweet Dee is Dating a Retarded Person\ns9e10 The Gang Squashes Their Needs\ns11e5 Mac & Dennis Move to the Suburbs\ns9e1 The Gang Broke Dee\ns4e7 Who Pooped the Bed\nS6e6 Mac's Mom Burns Her House Down\ns8e10 Reynolds v Reynolds: The Cereal DefenseOther great watches:\ns6e8&9 should be watched together and any episode with Lethal Weapon in the titles4e13 Night man Cometh is awesome, but I don't think it can be appropriately appreciated without knowing a little about the characters.I hope this helps any newbies find their own love for this creatively genius show.",

            "content": "This is the only sitcom that's ever been in the same league as \"Seinfeld,\" but they are much more hit-and-miss/erratic (even in their best seasons) than \"Seinfeld\" in its prime. Even after Larry David left, \"Seinfeld\" maintained a consistent standard of (cartoonish) quality. Later seasons of \"It's Always Sunny\" have notably declined a bit, though the show is still worth watching, and it may rebound, sheerly depending on the writing. It's just the old \"be more genius\" problem. Like \"Seinfeld,\" the best episodes of \"Sunny\" fully embraced cartoonishness after briefly flirting with pseudo-realism. Content is much more depraved, \"South Park\"-esque and sociopathy-based, as well as \"alcoholic,\" if that could inform a comedy genre (it does here.) A recurring theme is two characters being so disgusting that they collect and root in filth and garbage, to the point of stuffing open wounds with stray \"trash\" as first aid. And habitually wondering the sewers naked. The writers seemed determined to take the \"vaguely unlikeable/selfish\" characterizations of \"Fawlty Towers,\" \"The Office,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Seinfeld\" to the extreme. These are the most repulsive, vain, immoral, unlikable characters ever depicted in a sitcom, and most of the best plots draw on very strong characterizations along those lines. Like John Cleese said, \"they make you laugh, so you think that you like them.\" Kaitlin Olson certainly portrays the best comic female character since \"Elaine.\" Her selfish efforts to have a surrogate for \"easy money,\" or make her pathetic life into \"Sex in the City\" draw on a petty, braindead femaleness that most dumb sitcoms don't touch. Even \"Sunny\" was going to make her into a scold, at first, until the writers realized how funny and fresh a morally-depraved woman character pursuing her feeble dreams could be. My favorite episodes include \"The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention,\" \"The Gang Solves the Mortgage Crisis,\" \"The Gang Gets Invincible\" and \"Mac and Dennis: Manhunters,\" but your mileage may vary.",

The characters (other than Ruxin) are likable, and all (including Ruxin) are funny. The League has wit, charm, and profanity.Always Sunny is boring. The characters are boring, one-dimensional and irritating. The show is not very creative, and reminds me of Workaholics.

The problem is the show just isn't realistic. The League has characters that seem like people you would know in real life. Always Sunny does not. What is a Ivy League graduate doing running a bar with two morons.People say the show is \"Seinfeld on crack\". The only difference is Seinfeld is funny.",

All characters (The Gang) argue and betray each other in the show, but you can always feel the bond they have and can relate to it. Overall, for new comers looking for a new funny show, you won't be disappointed with this one. Haven't heard of anyone who didn't love it yet.",

Its ability to create and then use inside jokes over and over again is (maybe?) unique to it, and they manage to remain consistently funny. Charlie's continuing \"relationship\" with the forever unnamed waitress remains a particular funny spot.

The characters all bring something unique to the show and they play well to the everyday person. The highlight for me of season 2 has been the episode \"Hundred Dollar Baby\". Any self-respecting movie or TV fan will appreciate the training montage.

The show is fantastic in every way I can think of. It's the dirty secret in the back of your mind on how you wish to live.

Exactly what I did in school with my teacher. What happened to Frank? Billionaire turned man living in squalor with his illegitimate son? Charlie is great, I feel bad for him though.

No reading a book and just listening as so many might do.Season two brought Danny DeVito, and more laughs. He seemed to get them into so much trouble, he causes so much stuff SPOILER!!!!!!!! like getting Charlie crippled, making him turn into The Green Man, and Dee taking \"performance enhancing drugs\". End of spoiler.Season three includes so much nonsense its hard not to laugh at all the trouble they get into, they are truly bad people.

Every time IASIP was on FX I would quickly flip the channel for fear of rotting my brain with some lame and totally-un-funny sitcom.The plan worked fine up until a couple weeks ago when I wasn't paying attention to the info bar at the bottom of the screen, and started watching the most hilarious show I've ever seen.Needless to say, since I had never even seen a a picture of the main cast or watched more then a preview with Danny Devito in it, I was incredibly shocked to find that the show I had been barking laughter to for a half hour had been the dreaded 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' After one episode of season 3, I was completely and utterly hooked. It is honestly the most refreshing and funny show I have ever seen; you cannot help but laugh at the well crafted humor and on-the-fence jokes. It's so great to have a something to look forward to on Thursday Nights! I will recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a great time watching a witty and hilarious show. So go run out and buy the 1-2 Season DVD set and be amazed at the awesome-ness that is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia",

The show's appeal lies in watching the simple, self-centered characters gradually abandon any sense of morality, while the rest of the world just shakes its head in disbelief. The cast consists of virtual unknowns, with the exception of the recent addition of Danny DeVito, who meshes well with the others. The smart writing, great comedic timing of the entire cast, the sarcastic title, and even the theme music make this show a winner. If you like Office-like humor, check out IASIP.",

            "content": "Shows like SouthPark and Family guy are set in a satirical/animated universe. Whatever happens, however cruel it might be, it mostly doesn't make the viewers scream \"How could they do that !!!\" because of the tone.It's not a documentary. It's not reality. It goes without saying that behaving that way in real life is NOT okay.Shows like Seinfeld, Friends, Fraser, Big Bang Theory are set in the real world with some extremely selfish and narcissistic characters. But the actors are charming enough to pull it off and the situations never cross a line.Which brings me to my issue with It's always sunny in Philadelphia: It's is set in the REAL world, with often cruel and incredibly unfunny situations.Example: The gang finds a baby in a dumpster. Dee and Mac decide to keep the baby coz foster homes suck and blah blah. Then they go to a casting director who needs a Latino baby, but the baby Dee and Mac found is Caucasian. It was fine until this point. What comes next is the psychotic part. Dee and Mac take the baby (few months old) to a tanning saloon to put the baby in a tanning bed. When the associate refuses, they try to bully him. They don't leave until he threatens to call the police.I stopped watching here. How is two adults trying to put a months old baby in a tanning bed, in the REAL world, funny ? I am not offended. I just don't understand how this is supposed to be funny. There are other examples where I start watching an episode, think it's okay for a while and then BOOM. Unfunny deranged psychopathy.On top of having unfunny sadistic situations with extremely unlikable characters, all the main cast except Danny DeVito, have horrendous comedic timing and are terrible at acting. They are also the opposite of charming. All three men give the suspiciously-loitering-near-school-districts vibe. Dee looks like a 500 year old witch, over due a virgin blood bath. And for some reason they all look like they smell gross. How they managed to visually convey this is beyond me.Needless to say, this show sucks.",

Hes dead serious. That is an example of what a TV show should be. This show Conforms To NO stereotypical mega political company. Its not just funny, but it shows the truth like it is, without any happy go lucky bull. If your sick of Reality TV and Mainstream horse Sh@T then ITS ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPIA is your only option.

            "content": "Sunny has proved to be an outstandingly original and singularly unforgettable television experience. Though featuring live action characters, Sunny retains a surreal and cartoonish quality to its physical comedy and absurd, albeit original and hilarious story lines thus far limited to animated series such as \"Family Guy\" and \"South Park\".Sunny follows the lives of four career slackers - Charlie, Mac, and siblings Dennis and Dee, along with the second season debut of their father Frank, outstandingly portrayed by veteran Danny DeVito. The gentlemen (used in its loosest possible sense) of the cast, excluding DeVito, are the sick and twisted minds behind the writing and direction of the series.I could offer quips and scenarios from the show until blue in the face but suffice it to say Sunny will eventually get around to offending your ethnic group, religion, or general sensibilities and values. But it will do so in such a singularly hilarious and seldom dramatic way that you won't consider for a moment taking it personally. Sunny is strictly for those of us who appreciate outstanding, yet comically absurd writing. Realistically, our beloved protagonists would be serving 15 to life for the multiple felonies they commit each episode, and their obvious credit ratings would prohibit them from any manner of private property ownership, much less the Irish pub they are the proprietors of in the series.Sunny delivers consistent, cutting-edge humor in each episode. Thusly, you need only give it half an hour. If you haven't been driven to laughter nearly to the point of tears - move on. For those of you like myself that have, sit back and wonder what the hell they could possibly do to top it in the following week. They haven't disappointed to this point.",

Watching these Characters Develop, w/o losing a step, in bringing me to gut wrenching laughter, all of these years, has been a real treat! The Dynamics & Relationships between the Characters are perfectly hilarious & the way they can make episodes, that are inside jokes on other episodes, make this show seem like it can (& should) last forever.

This is a show where absolutely nothing is sacred, there are no taboos, and that will at times make you laugh so hard that it hurts. This is probably not a show for everyone. Anyone easily offended or uneasy with controversial topics might not particularly care for Sunny's brand of humor. But for everyone else, myself included, it is easily one of the funniest and most memorable shows since....well, ever. I have seen every episode of the first 10 seasons (just getting started on season 11) and there hasn't been a single time when I thought that the show was getting stale or that the quality was declining. After 10+ years it has proved to be consistently hilarious. This, in and of itself, is quite amazing since most great comedies run for about 8-9 years, with a peak lasting about 2-3 years and the other years being average. But with Sunny, at least in the first 10 seasons which I have seen so far, it's hard to say where the peak is since there has never been a decline. As many others here have already written, this show can be considered as being Seinfeld on crack. It is a true ensemble cast that feeds and builds off of each other to produce some real comedy magic. Frank, Charlie, Mac, Dennis and Dee are all horribly selfish and deranged people who somehow come across as being sympathetic. You just have to watch one episode and you will be hooked.And another plus....there is no laugh track!",

While the concept is simple, the execution is tremendous. The leads, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, Charlie Day, and Kaitlin Olson are hugely entertaining. The show also dives fearlessly into controversial topics like race and homosexuality and lampoons the common uncertainties and insecurities that come with the territory. This show will appeal to the guy-humor crowd that would go for \"Entourage\" and those who appreciate the uncomfortable social situations of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",

It will make you regurgitate, if you are not American, or you are one of the decent Americans (but the average rating for this show is so telling!).With almost no exception, each episode is a masterclass of bullying, misoginism (I can't recall one episode in which women were not depicted in the most despicable ways), racism, and the most fundamental ways of people being disgusting.Of course, if you are one who enjoys fart jokes, this show is a masterpiece, but if you are in the slightest a decent human being, this moral disaster is unwatchable.Finally, yet important, I know, I know, many (especially Americans) will claim that this is comedy. It's a fictional show meant to make people laugh, not a moral stance, but those would be the racist, misoginistic bullies who think that constantly presenting women as worthless pieces of meat is funny. Of course! What's not funny about that?People! ... and I mean those who still have at least a trace of decency. Yes! Offensive comedy is funny, when done properly! Every single joke can be funny, regardless if it's racist, misoginistic, deprecates men (why isn't there a word for that?!) religious, or whatever else, but there's a HUGE difference between a joke and an ode to these despicable behaviors.Many movies and shows have offensive jokes, but they are either presented as jokes (as in an outrageous contrast to a character's regular behavior), they are accompanied by repercussions (at the very least someone throws a drink in one's face) or belong to negative characters.Despicable!

Not only do I know this episode is going to suck, but I feel like I should buy a \"5 Dollar Foot Long\" with a Coors Light based on the whore-ship the producers negotiated with these companies. I understand making money from businesses who see the show as a marketing opportunity, but I feel as though the creators gladly reached for their ankles upon seeing the zeros on the paycheck.The Miller High Life guy didn't help. Nor did the plot content. Complete disgrace.I loved this show. Based on this season premier, I'd rather watch a boner grow instead of the diarrhea these once-creative writers have to offer.",

            "content": "I never really got It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Having been around people watching it I had seen many random episodes and was not particularly impressed. The absolute depravity really bothered and disturbed me at first, but I eventfully grew to love how this assortment of broken humans have found a family in each other.There is something about how they can find meaning and acceptance together, despite all the blows society has dealt them. How they remain an unshakable family despite their extreme nihilism and egotism. They may still be despicable human beings, but their constructed family makes them better people than they would be otherwise.It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has many similarities to previous classical sitcoms like Friends and Seinfeld. But where Friends and Seinfeld glorifies the modern city life of singles, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia lays bare the deformity of their value system. The show clearly makes fun of nihilistic and egotistical culture; It shows the results of greed, a man who has everything but lives in squalor eating cat food and huffing paint. It shows how the self love of a young man and woman makes it impossible for them to ever find anyone else to love them. It shows how a brave single mother was unable to supply a environment conductive to raising a child. It shows how bare and meaningless a life filled with with nothing but meanness self-fulfillment is. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not The Walton's or Road to Avonlea, but at its core is the family. Charlie, Dennis, Mac, Dee, and Frank are hopelessly broken people without any chance of redemption, but they survive because of the stability of their impromptu family.",

However, I only give 7 out of 10 because I found many minor technical issues, and also the storyline sometimes does not make sense. Also, some the storyline from the newer issue does not connect with the older issue. For example, when Dee wanted to apply jobs at Oldies Rock Cafe, the waitress did not know if she went to high school, but later on, they have bunch of stories when they were in high school together. Another example was when Frank got an accident on Christmas Eve, where the stores were supposedly closed, but he got time to buy Charlie and Mac a robot, before 6 AM on Christmas Day.(???). Also,Charlie was known to be the dirtiest, craziest, weirdest, and vomited when he has to perform/public speaking, but how can he actually create and perform on such a musical? Maybe I was the one who paid too much attention on details, or because I really love this show that I watched them too often. But I feel like that would be better to recognize those details, to make them look more professional. For example, no microphone showing, random setting changes after few seconds of act, etc.But other than that, I really really love this show! I think it is really entertaining and unique! Danny de Vito and Charlie Day really rocked it! Keep it up!",

I love comedy that lets bad people stay bad people and have bad things happen to them lol. it's fun!Over all this show will most likely fade away once they run out of ideas...which may happen at within 3 seasons and become one of the many cult classic that everyone will claim they loved just to show how cool they were...so watch it so you can at least be honest when you say you use to watch it..before it was cool",

What this show lacks is the straight man. These are all deranged, despicable individuals. The closest would have to be Glenn Howerton's character, who is an insecure, self-absorbed, conceited narcissist. There is no comedic balance between the characters, and the jokes are ribald, cheap shots at minorities and the disabled without any good timing.This show is compared to Seinfeld, which is beyond me. Despite their flaws, all the protagonists on Seinfeld are somewhat charming. Elaine's wit, George's cunning, Jerry's sarcasm and Kramer's philosophical rants is what makes these characters so appealing. Mac, Sweet Dee, Dennis and Charlie are just unpleasant morons that lack any real savvy or intelligence in anything other than conning other people with their hair-brained schemes. There is not much difference in any of their persona, which makes it unbelievable, stale and awkward to watch.Empathy is a key ingredient in any comedy, and I cannot relate to any of these characters at all. It's unsettling to watch an idiot like Charlie scream (with such bad overacting on Day's part) when he doesn't have his way or when he wants to get his point across, much like a petulant child throwing a tantrum. Neither is funny and frankly, it gets on my nerves!",

I sometimes got a mild headache. 4) The characters are incredibly stupid and self centered but not in a funny way. This is not like a Peter Griffin from Family Guy way. 5) There are episodes that are original plot-wise but not interesting or funny.and many more.What's to like? It's trashy I guess.

Adding in Nip/Tuck, Rescue Me and Over There, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia makes FX the network to watch. The only downside to the show was that the lead in is that horribly distasteful show Starved. Having Starved air before It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia will probably make this show take an undeserved hit in its ratings.

As a fan from the start, I began to get nervous as a fourth season seemed to be fading into wishes. But with word from the secondary Fox flagship station that the show now has a return date, is to say the least...orgasmic. If you enjoy television, laughing, and joy (often at others expense) than this show is for you. Glenn Howerton, Charlie Day, and Rob McElhenney are exuberant writers as well as actors. Howerton is a fearless comedian who will stop at nothing to make his character simply, the most preposterous on television, with Charlie close on his coat tails (see Serpico episode). Something must be said for Devito's performances. They are truly comic genius. I often wonder if Danny Devito is just that crazy, because he is absolutely brilliant. Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, and the immaturity that only 18-30 year old men can muster have all been blissfully blended to create a superb piece of television. If you haven't seen it, and you are reading this. STOP. right now. And go pick it up on DVD. All of the seasons. Immediately. I hope to see this show last for a few more seasons, and then the guys to team up again and again, in television and film, and show Judd Apatow's crew what comedy can be (smart).",

A family member watches and enjoys it somehow, but it is the only show that I can hear when walking by their room, they've seen Dolby audio worthy movies and I can't hear those movies as clearly as I do this series.The plots are abysmal and all over the place in what happens hoping to squeeze out a laugh by simply depicting a bunch of excrement happening, supposedly meant to be funny, but instead it is just that, excrement. The fact that this is highly rated by many individuals, is the longest running sitcom, and wasn't cancelled after the first episode, is so amazing and mind-boggling it genuinely causes me distress just thinking about it.

The gang is made up of the four main characters known as Dennis, Charlie, Mac, and Dee. In the second season Danny DeVito joins the gang as Frank and the show only gets better. Every member of the gang is a non-sympathetic narcissist who only ever seeks personal gain.",

Charlie day is brilliantly funny as per but for me the introduction of Danny devito was the greatest move ever he plays Frank Reynolds perfectly, I couldn't stop laughing at his antics. Everything from the traditional Irish setting to the wacky characters this series will keep you laughing throughout. Sweet dee did my head in quite alot with her stupid accents and sound effects at first, made me dislike the actress but after watching some of Kaitlin Olson's interviews it just goes to show how well she plays the character as she portrays the annoying twin sister very well and is unlikely this in person. Once I watched one i couldn't stop until I finished all seasons in just over a week. Never normally rate these things but this was so brilliant I felt compelled to share how funny this show is.",
