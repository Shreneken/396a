            "content": "Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.But no wait there is more, this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.It currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Foulest Family Film, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least \"Special\" Special Effects. Starring Jamie Kennedy, Traylor Howard, Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.Full of dire cgi, painfully unfunny \"comedy\", purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.It's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.Seriously, everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its \"Trendy\" to, nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!The Good:Traylor Howard The Bad:Poor cgiBeyond dumbThings I Learnt From This Movie:In movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic, I do it and I get arrested!?How could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny? Shocking!Children being stolen by norse gods isn't even remotely shocking to some parentsOdin is a WWE champion",

            "content": "Jim Carrey is resistant to sequels. We've known this for years. Back when Son of the Mask first came out, Jim had only done one sequel (Ace Ventura) that soured his entire outlook on sequels. Not that he was asked to take part in this in the first place, anyway.\nWhat's really interesting about this movie is the fact that The Mask is a totally different character depending on who wears it... and yet everyone who wears the mask in this movie (including the dog) are just absolutely wrong in their portrayals. The comedy is flat, the acting is laughable, the attempt to redo a Cuban Pete-style musical number was cringe-inducing at the absolute best, and the movie drones on and on and on. In terms of sequels, this is among the worst.",

            "content": "Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie \"Son of the Mask.\" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds \"Cuz I gotta!\" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, \"Good Lord, Why?\" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.First off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question \"WHY?\" The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.",

This is a movie that should not have passed the \"hey, I've got an idea, let's make a sequel\" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said \"hit and run\"! Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me. It is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion.

            "content": "\"The Mask\" took a gory and violent comic book and turned it into a funny and PG-13 comedy. It starred rubber faced Jim Carrey as an introverted bank employee that becomes a wild man with fantastic powers when he puts on the titular mask. He gets the girl, shows that he doesn't need the mask to be successful and roll credits. The movie was very popular, it did what it set out to do like bring a Tex Avery cartoon to life and made a lot of money. To this day it's still considered some of Jim Carrey's best work. So obviously there was a call to make a sequel to this. It bounced around a lot in Hollywood and Jim even turned down a $10 million paycheck because he didn't want to do a sequel to his work.So a couple years later they announced that they were making a sequel starring nobody that was in the original movie. This time instead of the wild and crazy Jim Carrey they instead cast the relatively unfunny Jamie Kennedy. And it's like they took all the likability out of the movie and replaced it with really creepy CGI and jokes that didn't land properly.The story goes that the mask has floated downstream from Edge City to Fringe City and has been found by a dog that looked remarkably like the dog from the original. His owner is played by Jamie Kennedy who's an aspiring cartoonist and a total manchild. Where Jim Carrey was eccentric and charming, this guy is just annoying. Well he puts on the mask, becomes a green faced wild man and wows everybody at the company Halloween party. They even rip off the musical numbers from the original but where they were funny and showed off Jim's abilities this one singular one really doesn't work. Like the dog the makers seem to think that if it worked in the original it will work here. Sadly it doesn't.Up until now there could have been some decent movie to be pulled from this mess but it's called \"Son of the Mask\" for a reason. While wearing said mask he goes home to his wife and she winds up pregnant. The baby somehow has inherited the powers of the mask and shenanigans ensue.The mother has morning sickness but instead of vomit what comes out is bubbles. I guess that's supposed to be funny. And she gets weird cravings. Like for silly string because the baby is silly I guess. Again I guess it's supposed to be funny.The baby is born and now the movie takes a hard left turn into nightmare fuel. The baby is normal except when alone with his father and he suddenly becomes a CGI abomination. You want to talk about the uncanny valley? This kid is an uncanny black hole. He's beyond frightening but I guess he was supposed to be cute and adorable.There's a side quest as Loki, the owner of the mask, is trying to find his mask and it erupts into chaos as he finds the child, the father and mother try to save him, there's a shtick-off where Loki and Jamie fight using wacky tricks and the baby finally chooses his father because he loves him now instead of literally wanting to send him to the insane asylum.Cue the happy ending and the CGI baby winking to the camera as if to say, \"this isn't over\".Thankfully this movie bombed at the box office and a third movie wasn't made and we never saw Jamie Kennedy in movies again.Do not see this. Sure it might entertain kids but there are better movies out there for them.",

            "content": "The original film with Jim Carrey was a clever and hilarious film, with a very sophisticated and dynamic visual style. What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.Let me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clich\u00e9d and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.The special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.All in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The Mask was in my opinion one of the most funniest Jim Carrey films in Carrey's career.It was over the top and downright hilarious. Rumors were going around that he was set to return and do another sequel opposite Cameron Diaz,but of course it wasn't meant to be. So fast forward to 2005 and we finally got a sequel to this film but is it as good as the 1994 version? Lets find out.Jamie Kennedy plays Ted Avery a cartoonist who finds a mask near a river(as in the opening we see Loki at a museum where the mask was kept)and one night Ted decides to put it on for his work party. Of course he and his wife get it on while Ted has the mask on him and his wife is pregnant with a beautiful baby boy. But when the baby is born he of course acts odd since Ted had the mask on him and so his different compare to other kids as his all looney and quirky since his half normal and half mask. So will Loki(Alan Cunnings) find Ted and get the mask back off him.Bottom line this film was so so stupid and awful. The CGI effects were rubbish,the CGI on the baby was just plain stupid,the acting was appalling. I just wanted to give up as I couldn't deal with it anymore.Do yourselves a favour and go find Jim Carrey's version better at least that has better CGI effects and Carrey is miles better than Jamie Kennedy(from Ghost Whisper)who was just terrible.0/10 Piece of crap.Alan Cunnings from The Smurfs and X Men 2 co stars as Loki and the late Bob Hospkins is in it too as Loki's father.And yes folks the guy that voices the tortoise in The Swan Princess Steve Wright is also in this film.",

            "content": "This is one of those Hollywood projects that makes you wonder why they even made the film in the first place. After all, to anyone hearing the plot, they'd know that the film was destined to bomb--yet some lunkheads approved the picture. And, while they saved a huge amount of money by not getting Jim Carey for this sequel, it's obvious that the budget was NOT small when you look at the amazing sets and see the excellent special effects. Yet, oddly, despite all this money being spent, the fundamental story idea was so stupid and the writing so amateurish that it couldn't help but bomb...and thankfully it did...otherwise they might have made more sequels!!! This is a bad film--there is no doubt about this. However, I object to it being on the IMDb Bottom 100 list as it's not THAT bad. Only the very worst of the worst deserve to be on the list--yet I notice such horrendous films as those of Ed Wood, Arch Hall, Al Adamson or William Grefe are not on the list! I guess it's because not as many people have seen these films and many DID see \"Son of the Mask\" due to its huge publicity campaign and massive DVD saturation.In addition, you can't help but admire the special effects as well as the sets. In particular, I loved the sets--which were very surreal and cartoon-like. I can't see giving such a beautiful looking film a 1---it deserves at least another point or two for effects and sets.As for the story, it's just plain stupid and wastes the talents of Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Plus, odd for a comedy, the film hasn't got a single laugh--not even one. In fact, some of the 'jokes' are downright repellent--such as the baby peeing copiously on the father as well as the snot joke--which both managed to be unfunny AND gross.While I could go on to discuss the plot, I won't...as simply put, no one could possibly care. It's dumb and not worth your trouble. An incredibly limp, unfunny and stupid film...with nice sets. Even smaller children will find all this very tedious and boring. Only for bad movie fans who want to marvel at the film's awfulness.",

He becomes the life of the party, When he gets home, he then makes love to his wife, while still wearing the mask. The couple soon realize there gonna have a baby.

Based on this film he is talentless \"actor\" with no charisma. It maybe the film, but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...Then again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.The special effects aren't special. For a \"big budget\" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real, even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.The direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.What annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good, its just bad.While this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. For the promise of what might have been I give this a two, however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid, this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity.",

            "content": "Series note: As this is not a direct, chapter-like continuation of The Mask (1994), one can easily watch either film first.If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks, here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless, the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as, say, Schindler's List (1993) or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Two factors mitigate that lack. One, Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two, Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.Of course, related to point one above, it's not that every film needs to have a paradigm-shattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me, and debatably they have no plots, even if they make many cogent, often philosophical, \"arguments\" about culture.But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same location--the fictional Edge City--as the first Mask (as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books, upon which both films are based). The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City (it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey, Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke). The mask of Loki, the \"God of mischief\" in Norse mythology, comes floating down a stream, to be found by Tim's dog, Otis (in an alliterative reference to Odin, Loki's father, and a pun on Milo and Otis). Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party, which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss, played by comedian Steven Wright, and his wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard). Prior to this, Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise, and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.Meanwhile, we get to meet Loki himself (played by Alan Cumming) in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask (of course) and Odin (an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins) is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate, but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki, and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.Although it sounds complex, perhaps, that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal, and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent, Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fathers-to-be experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmas--and director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughout--hinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts, including the importance of personal assertiveness (carried over from the themes of the first film), the quandaries of dual career families, \"sibling\" rivalry, child development issues, and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.Not that this is primarily a serious film, but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laugh-out-loud comedy, either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism, so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact, I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film, at least to an extent.The production design--including things like the sets, matte paintings, costumes, and the ubiquitous cgi--is simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film, Son of the Mask realizes a \"live action\" cartoon.Tex Avery is again a strong reference (made obvious by Kennedy's character being named \"Tim Avery\" and working as an animator), as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening (1955), and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons (involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate, almost Rube Goldbergian \"elimination contraption\").The funniest aspect of the movie for me, perhaps, was a kind of \"suspended absurdity\", made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home (which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s) still in shambles from the cartoonish events that preceded--the piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs, the giant boxing glove is still engaged, and so on.But the performers have many funny moments, too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carrey-like mannerisms when Tim is The Mask, and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can (of course), these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film, and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask, and entertaining otherwise--he's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny, especially when more surreal.Giving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me, even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically, at least, this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered.",

            "content": "First of all, like a bunch of other people, I loved the original Mask film with Jim Carrey. It was funny, it was cheeky, it was risqu\u00e9, and it was entertaining overall.An then over a decade later, this trainwreck comes to our screens. Literally the only returning cast member from the film is Ben Stein (the therapist from the last film; the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Apart from him, there's no Jim Carrey, no Cameron Diaz, no Richard Jeni (.....oh wait), so most of the appeal of the first film was immediately thrown out the window.Instead we're introduced to Jamie Kennedy, who is a whiny manchild who works in an animation studio, who comes across the mask picked up by his dog (presumably a different Jack Russell Terrier, RIP Milo) He wears the mask and impregnates his girlfriend/wife, apparently giving his child mask powers? It's ridiculous.So Odin and Loki get involved (nope, not from the MCU because that would be awesome) and try to eliminate the child.The child is eventually born, the dog gets jealous and tries to kill it, and Loki goes around creepily as well. OK, apart from some of these scenes having the most horrific and poorly handled CGI I've ever seen, this film really has a problem with which audience it's catering to. The characters are too exaggerated, the visuals are legitimately traumatizing, so the kids won't enjoy it. And the same thing will apply for adults because the acting is horrendous, Jamie Kennedy is a horrible replacement for Jim Carrey, and the script may as well have been written by a six-year-old. Plot holes and red herrings dominate the story, with there literally being no rhyme or reason for this film for existing.This film is desperate to extract any reaction from its audience, and this includes reactions of trauma, horror, anger, boredom and frustration. Avoid this film like the plague.",

We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!\" \"Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!\" And really, that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.Nevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it's massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out \"like me!\" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.Jamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.The plot is so much by the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.Save your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it.

However, when their son Alvey is born, he has mask-like powers from time to time. This is known only to Tim and the Norse God Thor and his son, Loki. Seems Thor wants the mask out of human hands and orders Loki to find it and the magical child. Let the games begin. This is not really horrible entertainment, as one may have heard or expect. The plot zips along nicely and the performers do their jobs well, especially Alan Cumming as Loki. The art direction and special effects are the true highlights, however. The film sports vibrant colors everywhere and the effects are truly amazing. Watch Loki change identities, each one adorable, or watch the baby swing his father, Tim, around when he feels like it. And much more, including a big ending at the car garage. If you liked the first film, you will miss Carrey, no doubt about it. But, give this one a chance.

            "content": "Whoever thought that a sequel to the smash Jim Carrey film The Mask was a good idea should be shot, this was the failed attempt to do it, from Razzie nominated Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs). Basically, ten years after previous events, the Mask has floated down river from the sea of Edge City, and found its way in the hands of aspiring cartoon animator Tim Avery (Razzie nominated Jamie Kennedy). Tim finds out the special powers of the Mask, and goes for a wild Halloween night out with his company, and next morning, Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard), desperate for a baby, finds out she is pregnant. Meanwhile Loki (Razzie nominated Alan Cumming), the God of mischief, has been sent to Earth by his infuriated father Odin (Razzie nominated Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask. When Tim's baby Alvey (twins Liam and Ryan Falconer) is born, he slowly realises that he didn't technically father his child, he did it while wearing the Mask, which explains the baby's extraordinary powers. Dog Otis feels unloved by his owners, and when he puts the Mask on he really gets to express how much he wants the baby out the way, but Alvey is getting the better of him. When Loki eventually finds Tim and the Mask, through Alvey, he makes a deal to give the baby back when he meets him at a certain place, and he becomes attached. In the end, Tim, with the Mask on again, and Loki ask Alvey choose who he really wants to be with, and it is when Tim takes the Mask off that the baby makes the right decision, and Loki and father Odin make up. Also starring The Mask's Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman, Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Peter Flett as Mr. Kemperbee. The special effects I suppose are alright, but the casting is atrocious, the story played out is ridiculous, and it has nowhere near the same inventiveness and humour as the original. It is filled with just too many gross and over-the-top wild moments, and it just looks and feels really cheap, an absolutely awful fantasy comedy sequel. Poor!",

The casting is among the worst you can find in a sequel: Jamie Kennedy was the worst choice for the lead, as he lacks charisma, and the dog and the baby are incredibly frightening.

            "review_title": "Son of the Jim Carrey-less Mask",
            "content": "The story in a nutshell: Dog finds enchanted mask. Pre-Dad puts on mask one night for Halloween party. Turns out the mask gave him superpowers capable of doing anything he wants. Has a baby WHILE he has the mask on, thus giving baby superpowers when he is born. Dog gets jealous, decides to put on mask itself, and becomes super-insane dog. Mom goes away for a week, dad's about to face a big battle between his baby, the dog, and a really crazy god called Loki who wants his mask back.Son of the Mask ends up being a generic, CGI filled, and otherwise throw-away movie, and normally, that would be the end of that. It no longer has Jim Carrey, and has toned down sexual innuendos to cater to kids. Being a parent, I know that young kids will love it, but will you? Here's a little questionnaire to find out:1: Do you like old Bugs Bunny,Roadrunner,Woody Wood Pecker cartoons? 2:If you watched these mayhem-filled cartoons, would you still laugh?3:Do you have kids, or a brother/sister under 12? 4: Do you like watching movies that are carried primarily by CGI effects?If you answered 'no' to any of the above, you might not like the movie. You may even hate it. It is, after all, a real life cartoon. Things don't make complete sense. It's a very poor sequel in comparison. Jaime Kennedy is no Carrey, amid the fact that the Jamie Kennedy Experiment is a funny show. Alan Cumming as the god Loki? I liked him a lot better painted in dark blue as Nightcrawler in X-2. New Line Cinema paid way too much money to get this one made. I don't think they will get the money back.But it's a family friendly film, no naughty words, no nudity. And, hey, when you're at a kids movie, you can't always expect Oscar winning performances. I was laughing my head off at some scenes, including one where the dog draws up a booby-trap plan to get back at the baby, and instead ends up getting caught in the trap itself. Instantly reminded me of Wild E. Coyote, getting his ACME trap to get the Roadrunner, and instead gets caught in it himself. That's the beauty of cartoons, you really don't have to think much, you don't have to ponder, just watch!While I know that this movie will never get a good rating, it doesn't deserve the '1' that everyone is giving it. It's short, at least as good as a hectic cartoon, and every bit as cheesy. I just wish New Line would have spent their money more on the plot or just done another better movie.If your kids really bug you to watch this one, do it on the cheap.5 out of 10. To me, a 5 represents a movie that fails to meet all expectations, may be poorly produced, acted and directed, but may find interest in those that know what to do before watching this movie: films that you remove your brain for.",

This boring film is more directed to kids than the original from 1994, and the proof is that the magic of Jim Carrey movie here has completely disappeared. The director of the 1994 film, Chuck Russell, is conspicuously absent, and his position is usurped here by Lawrence Guterman, the same man over the helm in the intolerable \"Cats & Dogs\". The script was original, could be polished a lot, the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL, it apparently beat Star Wars I, or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well, one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy. Loki have good costumes, good makeup, good actor, perfect in appearance and look, but the rest of the story is a mess. The role of Odin rests with a veteran, who shows only pure rage and no expression. The baby and the dog play a supposed humor role:1. The dog's jealousy towards the baby; Is so original that it is a shame that it was ruined by the type of movie that turned out to be.2. The baby is the product of an error, and his computer image is as false as the charisma of the film.But some scenes of these two entities are memorable, it's a shame that they have been utterly overshadowed by this failed commercial sequel attempt. One of the worst movies of 2005.P.D. For all the reviewers that said that this movie is good because is targeted to kids, or praise Mr. Guterman because he directed a comedy with cats; go watch the animated TV series \"Kid vs. Kat\" (no pun intended) instead. This cartoon show is more funny than SotM, and also beats this monstrosity.",

            "review_title": "Even \"M.A.S.K.\" was better, never mind \"The Mask.\"",
            "content": "The satirical movie website Dateline Hollywood joked that \"Son of the Mask\" was all a practical joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.\" If only. And if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece.\"The Mask\" was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling Jim Carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea, plus you'd have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.\" But no... though to be fair, having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, however, there's nothing there in return, except a steady stream of admittedly decent FX by the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improving on the \"Ally McBeal\" dancing baby and their own \"Baby's Day Out,\" with the Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as \"Siamese Popes\"), naming his character after Tex Avery, and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.The trouble is that last approach doesn't really work, partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, \"Duck Amuck\" and especially \"One Froggy Evening\" show up how weak this movie is in comparison. Plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norse god Loki - is far from the apple of Odin's eye... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin, even after \"Super Mario Bros.,\" is beyond me), and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of the son of the Mask) doesn't get much to do; giving HER the Mask might have helped the movie.Further points are lost for throwing away Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the \"green guy\" as an animated TV series - \"The Mask\" did become an animated TV series in real life, and was a far better follow up than this sequel. The fact that this actually opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything... what with this and \"Blade: Trinity,\" New Line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from \"Two Guys And A Girl.\" What next, \"The Butterfly Effect 2\" with Nathan Fillion?Somebody stop this.",

(The singing frog for example). Loki was hilarious and the baby effects well done, and Otis the Dog a stand-out (the shot where he gives up what he's doing to get the bone is a gem) Overall, some of the effects were overly-laboured, such as the urinating and exorcism vomit scenes.

The dog has creepy imagery written all over him. And I wonder why they chose Jamie Kennedy to play the lead role. Seriously, I would approach Robin Williams, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and Dave Coulier before approaching him. I have a hard time eating when I think about this movie. It gives me a bad taste in the mouth. You know you made a bad movie when the poster leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Why is Bob Hoskins in this? Was he missing the days of Roger Rabbit or something?

Jamie Kennedy has got what it takes for natural, charming, comedic acting. Natalie Traylor was more vivacious and cute in this movie than she has been since she took over the sidekick role in the \"Monk\" TV series. The dialogue has some pretty zippy stuff in it, and the plotting is competent and a good springboard for the hot visual effects.The only negative thing I can say about the production itself was that the voice of the masked Tim was surprisingly subdued. It needed to be much more out there, distinctive and penetrating, even annoying, but definitely more audible and spooky that what we got.Still, this is a great movie for kids from 5 to 15. Surprisingly, it totally tanked at the box office (in Hollywood terms -- it lost big money, though it grossed $17 million). This must have been because it was not marketed for kids. In fact, I don't remember much marketing at all on this movie, which is strange for a flick that cost almost a hundred million dollars to make. But it's too good a movie not to have legs with the nippers in the years to come, if someone will just tell them about it. As we move steadily into the era of DVD importance in viewing habits, greater revenues for initially neglected movies like this one will start to materialize.

The underlying theme of the importance of the bond between fathers and sons was well done without ever getting slushy. The 'gloopy' bits quite honestly compared with some of the gross-out material presented these days on children's cartoon channels was extremely mild and never revolting.The sets were beautiful, and the CGI was absolutely fine. This film had a good pacey storyline, amusing sympathetic characters and plenty of laugh out loud moments.I can see why Carrey fans wouldn't like it, but as I am not a Carrey fan and prefer a balanced film with an ensemble of good acting and a share out of amusing lines, rather than a one man ego trip with a back up of lacklustre characters none of whom can steal the star's thunder - I enjoyed this film.Alan Cummings was a joy and it is nice to watch an actor of his calibre doing what he does best, entertaining and interacting with the other cast members to produce a great film.I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have a fun time when watching a film and who enjoys surreal wacky stuff.If you like 'Fairly Odd Parents' 'My Parents are Aliens' 'Tom and Jerry' and 'Coneheads' you will probably enjoy this.",

Avid cartoonist Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy, Malibu's Most Wanted, Scream Trilogy) suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son Alvey (Ryan and Liam Falconer) as his wife goes to New York for a week on business. It soon becomes known that Alvey has \"powers\" of the mask of Loki (Alan Cumming, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, X2). Now, Loki wants his powers and mask back... Based on the fact that little-known director Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs, Headless!) had directed this film, I definitely did not expect such work. This film was well put together and could attract many audiences. The acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. Kennedy and Cumming portrayed their characters well, which was highly expected from the experience they have. Appearances from Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle) and Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) really accentuated the film. Transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. Noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely, considering the director's lack of high profile experience, but it did astonish me. As always, with the good comes the bad. The film contained minor \"hokey\" elements that I wasn't lured toward. Although I felt this way, the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. I'll denounce this upon age difference. Son of the Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language. I must admit it was a little harshly rated. This PG kisses the borderline of PG-13 at times. The raw and risqu\u00e9 humor and language was periodically unnecessary. A nice additive of the movie was the special effects, which were essential. Kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. At times, he had to breathe only through a straw. The effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers. If you are searching for a collective laugh, Son of the Mask may be a film to invest in seeing. Watching the original Mask (Jim Carrey) would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. However, this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences, so mind that. Otherwise, for some good, clean fun, Son of the Mask may be right up your alley.",

            "content": "A baby literally bouncing off the walls, a game of \"Super Twister,\" and watching Ben Stein's face separate from his head all mixed into one movie will only bring one thing... the Son of the Mask.Avid cartoonist Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy, Malibu's Most Wanted, Scream Trilogy) suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son Alvey (Ryan and Liam Falconer) as his wife goes to New York for a week on business. It soon becomes known that Alvey has \"powers\" of the mask of Loki (Alan Cumming, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, X2). Now, Loki wants his powers and mask back...Based on the fact that little-known director Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs, Headless!) had directed this film, I definitely did not expect such work. This film was well put together and could attract many audiences.The acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. Kennedy and Cumming portrayed their characters well, which was highly expected from the experience they have. Appearances from Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle) and Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) really accentuated the film. Transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. Noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely, considering the director's lack of high profile experience, but it did astonish me.As always, with the good comes the bad. The film contained minor \"hokey\" elements that I wasn't lured toward. Although I felt this way, the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. I'll denounce this upon age difference.Son of the Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language. I must admit it was a little harshly rated. This PG kisses the borderline of PG-13 at times. The raw and risqu\u00e9 humor and language was periodically unnecessary.A nice additive of the movie was the special effects, which were essential. Kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. At times, he had to breathe only through a straw. The effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers.If you are searching for a collective laugh, Son of the Mask may be a film to invest in seeing. Watching the original Mask (Jim Carrey) would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. However, this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences, so mind that. Otherwise, for some good, clean fun, Son of the Mask may be right up your alley.",

It bothered me in the original mask that the freaking thing was made by Loki and they didn't explore that aspect; giving it a feel that it lacked something. Yet in this \"sequel\" they snagged it and that gave the film an original view. Furthermore, Alan Cummings did a terrific job in his role as the god of mischief. Plus there were some jokes that you'd know if you were a Greek/Roman history fan.Moreover, the film showed value in the importance of family without being too preachy.

            "content": "The Story: Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedey) is a struggling cartoonist who has a run-in with the infamous Mask which leads to him and his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard) having a bouncing baby boy (Ryan and Liam Falconer) who can, in fact, bounce via his inheritance of the Mask's amazing powers. Meanwhile, Loki (Alan Cumming), Norse god of mischief, has been charged by papa Odin (Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask before it can cause any more trouble on Earth.Wacky hijinks ensue.The Good: HILARIOUS! There were several several laugh out loud points in this movie. There was the great possibility that this would be one of those movies where the only funny parts were shown in the previews (baby Alvey Avery saying \"Mother\" in a deep voice still makes me crack up just thinking about it), but such was fortunately not the case here. This movie took the flavor of all the old cartoons I and a few generations before me watched growing up - like the Flintstones and Looney Tunes, both of which are cameoed in the film - and ran headlong with it. Virtually every joke was pulled straight from the cartoon old school, which was just as it should be.The acting is, for the most part, superb. Cumming does a great job playing the crazified Loki, and Hoskins is a convincing grumpy old man-god (go figure, ha ha). The gem of the film, however, is the main man himself, Jamie Kennedey. His tour as the frizzed out, completely at the end of his rope father is played to the hilt, and it's great fun to watch him gradually go crazy as his son happily drives him there.With one exception (which I'll elaborate on in a moment), the special effects are also spectacular. The Cats & Dogs crew may not be on the top of the visual effects heap in Hollywood, but for this movie, they don't really have to be. It actually helps that you can tell that the characters are animated when they're doing crazy things, because they're supposed to be doing things that only animated characters can do. If some super-snazzy ILM-like group had come in and made everything up super-realistic, THAT I would have complained about.The Bad: Now, Mr. Kennedey was great and awesome and wonderful as Tim Avery, but . . . well, as soon as the Mask was slapped onto him, something bad went wrong. It's almost as if the people applying the latex to his face did it incorrectly, and it kept him with almost the exact same facial expression the whole time. It's a big detraction when his face bends and contorts better when he's supposed to be a regular guy than it does when he's supposed to be a cartoon character.While this is a good movie, I think it's sadly before its time. Son of the Mask really feels less like a direct sequel and more like the end of a trilogy. I believe New Line would have done a good deal better if they'd made a different Mask movie in between this one and the first one.Finally, there's a short period where Loki loses his powers. I won't go into the details, since I don't wanna be a spoiler, but the duration of this powerlessness is disappointingly short, and not much was really done with it. Which is a shame, since there were several different things that they COULD have done with it . . . ah, well.The Deal: Overall, I thought this was a very satisfying movie. Sure, it isn't complete brilliance or movie genius or whatever. It isn't going to win any awards or change anyone's life. It's just a series of quick, side-splitting laughs strung together with funny animations. But that's all it really NEEDS to be!So just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride, neh?",

I remember when this film was promoted and how insane it was anyone would want to have their name associated with it. We end Channel Awesome Month with one of the worst films ever reviewed by the Nostalgia Critic. This movie features Loki searching for his mask that a guy named Tim and his dog find and use.He has sex with his wife (a family picture!) and has a son that inherits all the powers of the mask. I had seen the Critic's review so many times (if only because it was the first one that referenced \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\") that I was familiar with most of the material. There's still stupid scenes he didn't really talk about. Loki tries to search for his mask through various disguises including a plumber with his butt crack. Why exactly wasn't Loki searching for the mask in the first movie? If Odin knew there was a baby born from the mask, how did he not know where he was?The only actor or character from the first movie to appear is Ben Stein. I would honestly watch his stupid anti-evolution documentary over this. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen with the baby looking hideous in most shots. Loki only appeared briefly in \"Avengers: Infinity War\", but that was still a much better representation of him. As we end Channel Awesome Month, we start next with Sequel Month! If Doug and Rob Walker refuse to address the controversy surrounding their website, than that's their problem. 1/2*",

            "content": "How does this happen? The original Jim Carrey classic \"The Mask\"- one of the films that launched his career in the 90's, was a silly, well-made and highly stylized comedic film. It was great fun and still holds up fairly well nearly 20 years after its release.11 years after the first film's release, New Line unleashed this stand- alone sequel, \"Son of the Mask.\" I knew I was in for a bad film from the previews, but I had no idea it would be this dreadful.Everything about this film is pretty much sup-par. From uneven direction (some scenes in the beginning are beautifully shot, but it quickly degenerates into uneven-at-best), to an awful script, to effects that are just eerie to look at (particularly the CGI baby effects which fall into the dreaded \"Uncanny Valley\"), to mixed performances and bad makeup effects. This film has a lot at its disposal, and it does everything wrong with its abundant resources.Jamie Kennedy (who I actually don't hate at all, he's funny in moderation) plays Tim Avery, a struggling cartoonist working a dead-end job as a suited mascot tour-guide at the animation studio where he works. He is married to the lovely Tonya (Traylor Howard), who wants a baby. (Although Tonya is little more in this film than a caricature of the concept of a woman's Biological Clock) One day, his dog Otis finds the ancient mask of Loki from the first film and brings it home. In a bind for his work's Halloween party, Tim puts the mask on, turning into a dumbed-down version of the Mask character from the first film. (Which consists of a creepy-looking prosthetic green mask and plastic-looking hairpiece, and Kennedy trying his hardest to do a Jim Carrey impression)He is the hit of the party (although I have no clue why, he's just creepy and weird) and inspires the head of the company (Steven Wright) to create a cartoon based on the character with Tim. On that night, Tonya also got pregnant while Tim was wearing the mask, and after a dreadfully unfunny montage where Tonya goes through exaggerated signs of pregnancy, a baby named Alvey is born, who has all of the powers of the mask, causing various mayhem. Otis the dog also gets the mask on several times, to cash in on the goofy sequence from the first film where Milo wears it for about 30 seconds. While this nonsense is going on, Loki (the dreadfully under-utilized and talented Alan Cumming), god of Mischief and creator of the mask, is sent to recover it by his father Thor. (Bob Hoskins wasted in a glorified cameo)I guess I should explain what about this film does work, and there area a few bits and pieces I liked, hence I gave this a 2 out of 10, and not a 1 out of 10. For starters, the first few minutes are fairly well done and have a slight taste of the creativity of the original. Also, there are a few moments, here and there, that are pretty funny in a way that calls back to classic Warner Bros. cartoons. And some of the effects not concerning the baby are nice.But asides from that, this really is a trainwreck of the highest magnitude. Everything about the production feels like a let-down, and its clear no thought went into this and it was a mere cash-in on the original.I give \"Son of the Mask\" an extremely poor 2 out of 10. Avoid it.",

Dreadful acting by Kennedy whose presence is about the same as replacing Lassie with a stuffed toy. Cumming has made some bad career choices but has also found success in worthy projects. This is not one of them. Traylor Howaqrd and Bob Hoskins are also scorching their careers with this dog show. Hopkins is famous for his great performance in the far superior Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

            "content": "\"The Mask\", starring Jim Carrey, was an absolute success when it was released in 1994, and I would say well deservingly. Not exactly a classic in my book, but a good movie nonetheless. \"Son of the Mask\", a sequel to the 1994 blockbuster, came nearly eleven years later, featuring a different set of characters and a different cast, but still the same mask. Unfortunately, this didn't work out so well. Unlike the 1994 original, this one flopped, even won a Razzie Award, and was nominated for a bunch of others! Since this sequel is in the bottom 100, it's generally considered atrocious, and I can't exactly say I'm with the majority on this one, but can still describe the film as pretty much worthless.Loki, the Norse night god of mischief, has been sent by his father, Odin, to find Loki's mask, which will not be easy, as he will find more than one replica of this mask. During his search, his real mask is found by a dog named Otis, owned by an aspiring cartoonist named Tim Avery. Otis brings the mask to his owner, so it is now in the hands of this aspiring cartoonist, though he is obviously unaware of its powers at first! After this, Tim soon becomes a father, with a newborn son named Alvey, who is born with the powers of Loki! While Tim's wife, Tonya, is out on a business trip, he finds that looking after Alvey on his own as he tries to fulfill his ambition is very difficult as he gradually learns the extent of his son's powers! Meanwhile, Loki has been informed by Odin that a baby has been born with his powers, and he will find the mask if he finds this baby. Since the Norse night god of mischief is so determined to get it, Tim could be headed for even more trouble! Why can't I vote 1/10 for this movie like the majority of others? Well, I just wasn't absolutely revolted by it. My biggest problem with the movie is that it simply isn't funny. I'll admit, I did smile a couple times (I think that includes the part where Alvey has just been influenced by TV and starts singing \"Ragtime Gal\", but the gags involving the baby and his TV imitations wear thin VERY fast, and I definitely smiled at the part where Loki slaps Odin) and came close to it at other times, but for the most part, I didn't even find it remotely amusing. We have some lame fart and bowel movement jokes, but an upside is that they tend to keep the gross-out gags brief. Another one of these gags is one where Loki turns a woman's head into a giant nose, and she sneezes, blowing out a ton of snot on the ground. Once again, lame, but once again, they kept it brief. So, while these gags do make the film worse, they would have sunk it even more if they put more of them in and/or made them longer and more graphic. Now, don't get me wrong, I am NOT defending \"Son of the Mask\", I'm just saying why I don't think it's as bad as apparently most people who have seen it do. Overall, I found the movie boring, and some of the gags put a confused look on my face, which may include some of the ones I've mentioned, as well as Otis hopelessly trying to get rid of Alvey while wearing the mask, which involves a lot of slapstick, but they didn't pull it off.For a long time, I have been aware of the fact that Jim Carrey played the starring role of Stanley Ipkiss in the 1994 blockbuster, but in this sequel, I didn't recognize anybody, other than Kal Penn (I had only seen him in the dreadful \"Epic Movie\", which I see has a slightly higher rating here, though I think it's significantly worse), and Ben Stein (he was in the \"The Mask\", and I also saw him in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", another funny movie). After watching this \"Mask\" sequel, I have learned that Loki was played by Alan Cumming (hadn't memorized his name yet), who I had seen in the short \"Blind Date\" episode of \"Mr. Bean\" and in \"X2\", both good roles, though I didn't know it was the same actor in both of them. However, regardless of how familiar I am with the cast members, none of them are any match for Jim Carrey and the comic talent he showed in \"The Mask\". When Tim Avery (played by Jamie Kennedy) has the Mask on, he is definitely similar to Stanley Ipkiss with it on, but one difference is that he is not funny. The cast as a whole is certainly nothing to rave about, and that's not the only problem with the movie, due to other things I've pointed out. So, while I don't hate this film with a passion, I do not recommend it, and won't say it didn't deserve its Razzie!",

I watched this film with my three boys all of which are under ten years of age. My boys laughed non-stop throughout the entire film and thoroughly enjoyed it. They could care less if it had too many cgi effects or if some of the jokes were juvenile in nature. This movie gave them exactly what they look for in a comedy. It is a fun film with loads of slapstick comedy, crazy antics, and lots of physical humor. Jamie Kennedy did a great job appealing to what the younger viewers want to see such as, over the top acting, exaggerated facial expressions, and an overall zany performance. If you take the movie for what it is, which is a silly comedy that provides cheap laughs and a fun atmosphere, than it is a total success. I would recommend this movie to anyone with young kids that is looking for a fun film to watch with the family.",

The movie would have sucked with him in it. the story did not require Stanley to return. It was about how the mask itself changes the lives of a family, instead of just one loser. I am not defending this movie, saying it was great or even good. It was just fun. I have to admit I did laugh in some scenes, and the special effects were pretty good also. I think the reason most people are complaining about this movie is because it didn't continue the story from the original. Well has anyone ever heard of a SPIN OFF? A NEW CHAPTER? Do we bag Frasier because the cast from cheers aren't back? Do we hate Joey because the cast of Friends isn't back. Back on topic...Son of the Mask is a Live action cartoon. When the funny scenes hit, they actually work. And while the movie makes no sense, or has no actual believable scenes, it is an interesting creation and FUN TO WATCH!",

            "content": "Boy did this film have obstacles to overcome.First of all, feel sorry for the rights-owners of the original MASK. After a brilliant breakout film (MASK 1 remains one of my all-time faves, have seen it 9 times, with EXTRAORDINARY performing by Carrey and Hollywood's first look at a young, pre-enhanced, Cameron Diaz) they could not have helped but noticed that the star of their film (whose career they helped launch) was now at the top of the A list and asking a $20 million minimum.Ouch.So they did what any self-respecting Hollywood producer would do -- in other words they did WHATEVER IT TOOK to do a sequel without Carrey and make sure it was bankable.So let's be clear: Jamie Kennedy is a solid and reliable lead, and Taylor Howard is charismatic to a fault and carries her role in fine fettle.But then you have the elephants in the room -- a lot of fans simply could not fathom why Carrey was missing, and took it out on the film.And a lot of viewers could not believe that the script involved a mother getting pregnant while the husband was wearing the \"MASK\" and found that off-putting.So, bottom line, by the time the final cut was out, this film had more enemies than friends.If you can get by all the above (and remember that the hit TV series GRIMM uses baby-making as its main sub-theme, discussed in my reviews) then the final product is actually well directed, technically adroit, and a lot of fun.I have seen it four times and it holds up pretty well, especially once you get to part where the baby is born (after the first 30 mins) Will it ever come even close to Mask 1? No.But the reviewers, I think, down-rated it for all the wrong reasons.",

            "content": "The Mask was a brilliant, creative, comedic movie from 1994. It was a fun film all around that was hilarious and launched Jim Carrey's career. Because it was such a big hit, there was a sequel being talked about for years and a lot of hope for one. 11 years later though, Hollywood decides to ditch that idea and decides to put this disgrace of a movie out in theaters.Son of the Mask takes place 10 years after the events of the first movie and centers around a cartoonist named Tim Avery(Jamie Kennedy)(A parody of Tex Avery? Are they serious?) and how he has to raise a son who possess the powers of The Mask after the cartoonist wears it and inadvertently gets his wife, Tonya Avery(Traylor Howard), pregnant. All the while Loki(Alan Cumming), God of Mischief, is sent by his father, Odin,(Bob Hoskins) to retrieve The Mask or else be banished forever.The first thing wrong with this movie, aside from the really bad storyline, is how practically none of the original actors from the first film come back. There's no Jim Carrey at all in this flick to help liven it up. In fact the only actor they got back was Ben Stein, who even then is barely in the movie at all. And the actors in this movie not only do a bad job, but everyone in this film looks and almost sounds embarrassed to be in a film like this. The next big problem is how this movie goes overboard with its CGI effects and imagery. I mean they really go overboard with it and it looks really poorly done. The animation for these CGI effects look really cheap and stiff. Not to mention the imagery in this film is very disturbing and pretty frightening. I mean we have babies growing fangs, the baby turning his head into a balloon, contorting his face into cartoon images that look disturbing, and of course how creepy The Mask looks on both Tim Avery and his dog. This is a family film? These images most likely will give kids nightmares for weeks. Speaking of which, why is the baby so determined to get his dad in an asylum? It's never explained why the baby hates his dad, much less why the baby later likes his dad. And another thing this movie sorely relies on is how the dog and Alvey fight over for Tim's attention. They seem to drag these scenes on forever and make it a highlight of the film when in reality it already makes it longer than what it should be. the only somewhat decent thing is that at least they explain why the dog wants to get rid of the baby so he can be the center of attention again. So after many useless subplots like the baby and the dog fighting, we finally reach the showdown where Alvey must choose which dad is best. Yeah, apparently Loki kidnaps Alvey and he likes the kid for some reason never explained. So Alvey chooses his real dad, Odin comes by to scold Loki, but somehow, Tim manages to help patch things up with Odin and Loki and they take The Mask back home. So the film ends with Tim making his new cartoon and the baby giving a wink to the audience.This film is not only God awful in many ways, but it's a complete disgrace to the first film. The first one wasn't certainly perfect, but it was a fun film for everyone of all ages. This movie though, will not appeal to anyone at all. Kids won't like it because of the scary imagery and adults won't like it due to the bad humor, convoluted plot, and how this movie has virtually nothing to do with The Mask.There are only two good things I can say about this film. One, I never paid any money to see this film since I saw it on TV. Why I didn't change the channel, I still don't know. Two, Bob Hoskins is the only actor trying his best in this film and was pretty good as Odin. But really, I can't recommend this film to anyone at all. Even if you aren't a fan of The Mask, you would be far better off with that movie than with this one. If you ever come across this movie on a DVD rack or on TV, then stay as far away as possible from this film. Stick to The Mask instead, it will give you more laughs than this disgrace of a sequel ever will.",

The star of the show should have been the Mask effects here, since this time you don't have an actor half as skilled as Jim Carrey at making you invest your emotions in the main character. You can tell the producers are itching to get 'wacky' and put their money up on screen too, but before they can do that they disappointingly decided that what was necessary first was to write lame domesticated scenes in an attempt to bullishly hammer home a sickly sappy wholesome moral. I didn't care about Kennedy or Howard; nor did I want to watch their dog monopolise the Mask for what felt like an eternity, turning a mildly amusing 'bit' from the first film into an entire and crushingly leaden subplot for the second...Once Loki got on the trail of the baby, it improved just enough for me to think it bearable. I liked the idea of a folklore-d foot-soldier taking charge of an innocent baby (it put me in mind of the immeasurably superior \"Labyrinth\", whether intentionally or not) and the movie references were fun at first, I guess (\"Ransom\", for example). Overall, though, it's difficult to deny that this is a poorly-conceived sequel that wastes its opportunities by stalling for far too long and never knowing what best to do with the powers of the Mask when the time is felt ultimately right.",

That said, there are a few bright spots. The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be. The CGI baby effects are not great, but I imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks, they could have been better!Moose, the dog from \"Frasier,\" phoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, which we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute-as-a-button, as you'd expect, and Jamie Kennedy stunk, as you'd expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he ain't.The writing and direction were, if anything, worse than Kennedy's performance. I semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that I wish someone would quote accurately for the \"Memorable Quotes\" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume being the \"crappiest crap in Craptown,\" it was a second-grade joke, but sort of funny in context.Over all, since there's nothing lower than a \"one,\" I give this film a \"one.\"",

The real deal was the dog who wears the mask more than Tim Avery(Kennedy). And this dog is more mischievous than Milo. He'll do anything for attention. As for Tim, he is so preoccupied, he lets everything whizzes by him. Including that Norse god Loki(Alan Cumming). One question comes to mind, \"Where is Thor?\" That would be another show. This movie is good, but it lacks the hit making chemistry that \"The Mask\" has. Though it has Ben Stein from the first one, It was funny from the robbery scene where Loki dealt with the security guards when he said \"Thanks for dropping by\". A real knee slapper there!

In the second Jim Carrey-less sequel to be screened in theaters during the 2000s, Son of the Mask, which came out 11 years after The Mask, passes the disguise with sinister powers over to Jamie Kennedy. After using the mask for a Halloween party, he keeps it on as he makes love to his wife. As a result, she gives birth to a son who carries the powers of the Mask. So on top of the crummy writing, terrible acting, weird production design, and unflattering cinematography, it also contains the most horrific and rotten CGI effects ever put to film. Son of the Mask is the sorriest excuse for a Jim Carrey-less sequel. At least Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd was a prequel set in their high school years, and at least it had a redeemable factor in the form of an explicit Bob Saget rant. This movie doesn't have anything salvageable at all. The overall lesson is to always practice safe sex.

Jamie Kennedy has a dash of annoying in his DNA. He has no charm. He compensates with brash annoying wacky comedy. Personally I don't find him funny at all which fits this movie perfectly. The animation looks ugly. The general look is bad kids TV. It's a Road Runner cartoon without the fun. The fact that the original is so great only makes this an even bigger failure.",

If there were never a first Mask movie, critics could have reviewed the movie from a different viewpoint making way for reviews about the actual movie, not the fact that Jim Carrey isn't in it. Not to mention all the reviews are comparing it to the Jim Carrey movie, which it isn't anything like or really trying to be. Despite what \"everybody\" says, I don't think it would have worked plot-wise if Jim Carrey was in a sequel. He didn't want the mask in the end of the first film. It got him into a lot of bad situations, why would he wouldn't want to wear it again? There was no more story to tell from that perspective. They needed to start out with a fresh story, and that's what they did, and the concept really wasn't that bad.Although it was an interesting effort, I don't think Alan Cumming's role really wasn't necessary, considering it's a mythical god playing a villain. I also would have liked to see Tim's character wear the mask more, there was a dry spell in the middle of the movie when it got too drawn out following the baby when it wasn't doing anything except being cute.I'm a huge fan of the first Mask movie, as well as the original Mask comics and I see the object of just the Mask itself for what it is and what it does for its wearer. The Loki Mask itself bringing out the characters inner-most self and is the whole object of the Mask movies. If you don't like or understand that concept, you probably won't like this movie.",

The dog-wearing-the-mask bit was already done in the first film, and the dancing baby singing 1940s swing tunes is an idea that would have been laughed off by the makers of \"Ally McBeal\".Did the makers of this movie actually think that a scene where a baby attacks his father with squirting urine would make people laugh?

I really only went cause it was the premiere, free, and I took my cousin who really wanted to see it.That said, I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. It was well above what I had expected. It's definitely a family movie aimed at the younger crowd but it was fairly entertaining most of the way through.Jamie Kennedy is no Jim Carrey as the Mask but these scenes are few and he's good otherwise. The baby is cute, the dog, disturbing, but it's Alan Cumming's Loki who really steals the show. The movie is worth seeing for him alone.Without giving anything away, the movie has it's share of laughs, flows well enough, and is definitely intended as a family movie.So there you have my early review.My 9 yr old cousin put it his way; \"If I had as many arms as an octopus, I'd have all eight thumbs up. ... But I liked the first one better.\"",

Jim Carrey was hilarious and awesome in the film, and the film's success signified a sequel in the works, and it would be eleven years before it was released, and when its release came, it was an ugly sight.In \"Son of the Mask\", Loki (Alan Cumming) is enraged. He has to get his ultimate weapon, The Mask, back to his father Odin (Bob Hoskins), for it has fallen into the hands of Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) who has created a child while wearing the mask, who is powerful than ever. Can Tim get his baby to relax his hyperactivity and return the Mask to Loki in time or will Loki have to destroy them both to appease his father?\"Son of the Mask\", with Jamie Kennedy, Alan Cumming, Traylor Howard, Steven Wright and Bob Hoskins, is not only one of the worst \"family flicks\" ever made, it is indeed one of the worst sequels ever made. The plot makes no sense, the premise is painfully stupid, the comedy is unfunny, the CGI is overly scary, the baby is annoying, the film is CLEARLY not suitable for children. At all!",

The first Mask movie was not really a good movie, but it was watchable, mind you, I never really liked the Mask cartoon so my view might be a bit skewed. See, the first film had two things that this one did not. First, it had Jim Carrey in the lead role, who is able to act out in a way similar to the mask character, which gives the character a certain amount of verisimilitude. Secondly, it has a plot, there is a clear progression forwards where there are actual stakes for the characters. Also, the setting is a lot darker than in Son of the Mask which makes the character stand out more against the background. Son of the Mask however, has no plot, there is stuff going on but the story doesn't move forward. The setting is this garish, cartoonish world where none of the masks shenanigans has any consequence. It really is just a cartoon with one over the top gag after another. The original had very little potential for a sequel, and yet they still tried to make a follow up by pouring a bucket load of animated effects on a weak script. It didn't work, the only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because it didn't make me all that angry.",

            "content": "The first Mask was great, it was funny, creative and was just an overall great movie. The sequel however I can easily call the worst film of all time. Not only is it completely devoid of effort or creativity, but even if it the cast and crew tried it would still suck.My first gripe with the film lies in the story; its boring, inconsistent and most of all, just not funny. The \"Story\" has to do with the Green Loki trying to recover his mask, which has the ability to grant incredible power to whoever wheres it, and apparently some looser finds it and puts it on, has sex with his wife, and the resulting baby that's born has the powers of the mask. Thats it, however the movie can't even keep this consistent. we are constantly dragged back and forth between Loki and the father doing really stupid stunts all acted HORRIBLY. Now I know what you're thinking, \"How could Jim Carrey act bad?\" well here's the thing; Jim Carrey is nowhere to be seen in this film. That's right, its another sequel to a Jim Carrey film without Jim Carrey, and the result is a steaming pile of crap.The acting like I said is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a film. Its all over the top, unconvincing and just goofy, but not the good goofy. The jokes are beyond horrible, they're all forced, too obvious and just plain painful. There IS a subplot abut the dog trying to kill the baby, but it's all just an attempt to grab onto the fame of Looney Toones, and you can probably guess how bad that is.I would keep going, but just TALKING about this film is just painful. the story is crap, the acting is crap, the jokes are crap, and the effects are also crap. The bottom line is, Son of the Mask manages to hit the absolute lowest any film can POSSIBLE go, at least that's what I think.",

And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was awesome in Scream, but now this film! Also, this film takes a SMO-CAN film and turns it into this goofy kids film that not even kids will like. This film also consists of very rude humor. Like the nose woman. She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes white stuff spews out of her nose. There is also an Exorcist parody. Yes, a kid film has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults would like it. Quite frankly, it made the film even more cheesier and crude.Here's the basic, stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the amazing Loki mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. When Tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers, cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyote ripoff. Then Loki takes the baby with amazing powers and Tim and Loki have a really cheesy animated fight. Tim's wearing the mask. It all ends happy. Too bad this movie is horrible.

That's one thing this sequel does really well. The manic behavior of whoever wears the mask is still hilarious and wild.And of course a highlight is seeing some of the cartoons I enjoyed as a child and seeing them copied by the genius baby. These scenes are great! No, Tonya, Tim won't make Avery dumb by planting him in front of the TV. The baby is in fact a prodigy who is highly intelligent and very talented. These scenes are amazingly done and quite hilarious.Then of course there are the fights between Otis the dog and Baby Avery and between Loki and Tim. With the mask, Otis becomes a scientific genius who builds and falls victim to a Rube Goldberg style series of gags, worthy of those great old animated shorts. The animation and the disastrous consequences are, once again, quite well done. I could never have fully enjoyed this movie without recording it and using the rewind and slow motion features.The encounter between Loki and Tim is similar, with wild chases and lots of amazing visual effects.Loki is quite a character too, and his attempts to find the baby are, like so much else, hilarious. He makes others' lives miserable.Jamie Kennedy is easy to like as Tim, and the poor man doesn't know what he's doing, but he seems capable enough as an animator. His problem is convincing his superiors to let him do more than wear a turtle costume for tours. And the poor man thinks he's going crazy; these scenes weren't quite as enjoyable for me as others, but until he realizes what's going on, it's quite crazy.Traylor Howard is cute and intelligent at the same time. I know her from \"Monk\" but would probably have liked her anyway. Ben Stein does his usual good job.Bob Hoskins gives an enjoyable over-the-top performance as the head of the Norse deities and Loki's frustrated father.As good as most of this movie is, it does seem to be missing something. Jamie Kennedy is good enough but no one is Jim Carrey. With the mask, he seems very much like Carrey, but without it, he's just Jamie Kennedy.If I have anything to criticize, it is that I despised the original Woody Woodpecker, though I mostly saw the updated version of him as a child. But I'm not here looking to criticize. Maybe it's not cutting edge, but it makes me happy.",

Not even a three year old would like this. This film is loaded with stupid jokes, gross out scenes, horrible CGI, bad acting, and who was the makeup genius on this film? When Jim Carey put the mask on he was a lot cooler than Jamie Kennedy's mask persona. When Jamie puts on the mask, he looks like a rejected Joker toy made for the Batman franchise. I dare give this film a one even though it begs for a zero, but I must admit I enjoyed one scene in this wreckage, even though the film was tragic. I liked Ben Steins sequence at the start of the film in the museum explaining to people who brought the mask to life and what not. And from there the film rolls down hill like a boulder.

            "content": "I know a lot of people don't like sequels. Some say they endanger the first film by maybe disgracing it, others say they're just a cash in. Sometimes filmmakers get it right (Terminator 2: Judgement Day) but other times, they get it wrong. Son of the Mask is a great example of an instance when they do just that. Son of the Mask has to be one of the worst sequels of all time and even though the first Mask film was no classic, it had its moments and I truly mean that. What Son of the Mask is, is nothing more than a nasty to look at, nasty to watch, mess of bad and unfunny jokes mixed in with horrible music and nasty to look at visuals.From the off, Son of the Mask begins its terrible decent into celluloid waste. It messes around, very dangerously, with the original Mask film's premise. We are told that Loki: the Nordic God of mischief, created the mask in question and banished it himself to Earth for people to find, fool around with and create mischief of their own. It's Loki's job in this film to find it, by rule of Odin, so that he can get back into Valhalla or wherever. This immediately goes against the first film as we were told Loki was, in fact, BANISHED from his heaven and imprisoned inside this mask that was then placed on the earth; hopefully for no one to ever find. Thus, destroying the equilibrium. This is the first mistake the film makes of many and if you can't even get your equilibriums right, you're in big trouble.First of all; the characters. Loki in this film is evil. He is genuinely evil and it spoils the image that was created in the first film when he was a mischievous, funny, maybe misunderstood God. In Son of the Mask, he acts as the villain of the piece and that is very disorientating, especially if you've seen the first film and I had a big problem with this. Then we move onto the supposed hero. The hero is Tim Avery (Kennedy) a comic book artist who lacks big inspiration. The fact he has one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard in a film and acts like a twelve year old throughout is enough to utterly repel you from any sort of feeling or relation towards him. These are bad principals for a hero to have. Thirdly, when we actually see our hero wear the mask; its not only a let down as so much as a shockingly unfunny and downright embarrassing series of events that I've ever witnessed in a film.The scene in question is the company he works for and their large function they're having. There's no build up like their was in the first film, there's no motivation to even wear the mask and our hero's position in Son of the Mask isn't as desperate as Ipkiss' was in the first film. Anyway, once the mask goes on; we're treated to an absolutely hideous display of camera work including close ups of the ugly Mask character's face, fast editing as we struggle to grasp what it is we're seeing, music so bad you have to cover your ears and dance numbers so cringe-worthingly bad that it hurts to watch.Then comes the plot. The plot is straight forward enough as I've explained. Loki's trying to find his mask that he supposedly created. What happens is Loki spends so much time going from house to house trying to find his Mask that I, personally, began to stop caring. Each visit was just an excuse to 'do something funny' and with jokes so blatantly aimed at children; it was difficult to watch. Another thing is the pointless, 'in there for laughs' subplot that opens up. This involves the baby that's born that is given the powers of the mask. Halfway through the child seems it fit to copy various cartoons on the TV to try and get their father (who's the hero) condemned to a mental institute. This is bad enough as the writers aren't even using their own initiative to create material. To counteract this, the family's dog attempts to defy the baby. Although maybe funny the first time this quickly plays out into utter farce and serves no bearing on the rest of the film; it's just a pointless mess of jokes and gags that makes you feel like you're watching an episode of Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote. During this, for some reason the father doesn't actually think of perhaps filming the baby or something like that rather than pick him up and run to the neighbour's house; thus trying to convince them the baby can sing and dance. Oh look, it's stopped: what a surprise.Plot holes? You bet. Loki has his powers taken away from him and is made mortal during a scrap in an alley way; yet survives the baby's counterattack of having two rubbish skips crush him. He's, literally, just been made mortal yet survives being crushed. Another instance is nearer the end when Avery's Mask character does battle with Loki over the child. Loki states 'Stop! We are evenly matched!' Well, of course you are! The guy's wearing your mask; he has your powers. It took them about ten minutes to figure that out(!) I also really feel that although the acting talent it has on display, if they'd have known it was going to be anything like how it was, they would've kept well away. With these things and a few hundred plot holes heaped on top, Son of the Mask can easily be labelled as one of the worst films ever made; in fact it makes 'The Mask' look like a masterpiece.",

Loki (Alan Cumming) is sent to find it. We open with a scene in a museum where droll docent Dr. Neuman (Ben Stein) is explaining to everyone how Loki's mask can give the wearer power, when Loki himself shows up. But it turns out this mask is just a good Asian-made replica, so Loki's hunt is on.The central family here is the Avery family, aspiring cartoonist Tim (Jamie Kennedy) and his wife Tonya (cute Traylor Howard, looking much younger than her 38 years) who desperately wants to start a family, but Tim isn't ready yet.SPOILERS FOLLOW. One night Tim has to find something to wear to a work-related costume party, so quickly grabs the old mask that the family dog had brought home from a nearby creek. When he put the mask on, he became a different person, was the life of the party, and when he got home to his wife apparently made unbridled, passionate love. Because she immediately became pregnant. Nine months later baby Alvey (played by twins) was born. But as a son of Loki, sort of, he was not your ordinary baby, able at an early age to say words and do strange things with his body parts. Somehow Loki figures out his \"mask baby\" was born on a certain date, gets the list of newborns, and one by one tries to find his.Much of the movie contains so much silliness that it is worthless to describe, much of it when mom was out of town on business for a week. Suffice to say, in the end baby Alvey helps mom and dad get the upper hand on Loki, and Tim becomes the very successful author and illustrator of a popular animated TV show, about the antics of a family's dog and baby (modeled after his own).",

Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor at most times. At some times, it is even laughable. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor in here. He is funny when he is supposed to be, but some of his lines are god awful.Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he is possessed by the mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. Also, the scenes that he is in are so unfunny, that they are almost unbearable. I am sure they could have cut him out, and it wouldn't affect the movie at all.Overall, you can live without seeing this. It is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. They definitely could have gone without making the sequel, but it is a decent effort. 4/10",

            "content": "I just finished this movie and my cheeks hurt from the grinning. Son of the Mask expands on the story of Jim Carrey classic The Mask in a whole different way. A baby is conceived while the father is wearing the titular mask and 9 months later unto the world is born a nightmare child with cartoon god-like powers. On top of this, the pet dog, now jealous of the baby getting all the attention, has gotten its paws on the mask and become a green-faced, revenge-seeking cartoon mutt.Meanwhile, Loki, the fabled God of mischief (mentioned in the original movie, not featured), has been instructed by his father Odin to retrieve his mask due to the havoc it caused in the first film. Loki is the essence of the Mask and thus can also turn green and do the Jim Carrey routine, coming to a total of four equally bizarre Mask-like characters, though obviously none living up to Jim Carrey.The father, and hero of the movie is played by Jamie Kennedy, the funny chap who was the film buff in the Scream movies (\"Did you put her liver in the mailbox? Because I read that the killer put her liver in the mailbox...\"), and he does a good job. Upon donning the mask he becomes the plastic-haired, catsuit-clad, cheesy game show host type (nice to see more different takes on what the mask does to different people) who is amusing though feels a little unnatural compared to the his acting in \"Dad form\".Plenty of great CG just like the original, some spectacular visuals and designs, and for a movie so different to it's predecessor and so much more family friendly, it certainly does a good job of recreating the original atmosphere with nice lighting and settings.So, would I recommend it? If you're a hardcore fan of The Mask in the form of comic book, movie or even cartoon, probably not, because it's not what you will want from a sequel. For slightly more open-minded people looking for some fun and a few smiles of nostalgia from nods to the original, totally. It's a side-splitter, particularly for kids.There's no obligation to have seen the original; it works as a film on it's own as well as a sequel, so don't worry if you want to entertain your very young kids but don't want to expose them to some of the more \"PG\" humour of the original. Then perhaps they can check the original out when they're a few years older.Underrated and great fun. It may not be the \"Revenge of the Mask\" movie we were promised all those years ago and it's not a masterpiece by any means (what sequel is?) but it's really nice to see a clever and creative sequel/followup to a film whose chances as a franchise we all thought were dead.",

Actually, that's exactly what I am saying: no Jim = no hilarity, no falling off your chair funny, no uniqueness. However, if you decide to have a movie that knows its limitations (and the loss of its major attraction), then the sequel isn't half that bad. Writing could have been better (a lot of information is given for granted, so you have to fill in using your own brain), but overall the plot holds together. Acting is not bad, and Jamie Kennedy is trying his best. I think he tries to follow Jim, and sometimes he succeeds. The final conclusion: this movie is NOT as bad as it could have been.",

It lasts about 98 minutes, and its pace is frenetic and boring at the same time. Way too much juvenile humor. Since there's so little dialogue, the actors are left floundering. The original was no masterpiece, but it had some endearing moments; specially towards the beginning. Here, there's an elaborate explanation about the origin of the Mask by the god Loki, and then it's forgotten and never fully explained as to why it's a big deal for him to get his mask back.",

The actors didn't have any direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc... but really why should we expose children to this type of film?

The first Alan Cumming as Loki, the god of mischief, was very unique and I actually thought there was some funny material there. I enjoyed his antics alright. The second is Ben Stein. I've always found Ben Stein to be pretty funny and his brief appearance here in the opening made the film look more promising than it ended up being. The last thing is Jamie Kennedy. Although I've criticized his comedy in the past, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for him. While he doesn't do as good a job as Jim Carrey in the film before, he is very charismatic and seems to put more effort into making his material work, so I give plus points for effort. However, this film is terrible. The special effects have no charm and no mystery. We aren't left sitting in the seats wondering how they pulled off one special effect or another. We all can tell that it's just a bunch of CGI images. And that's the least of this film's problems. What really bothered me was the baby. The baby was creepy and did very wrong and horrible things that babies shouldn't do. Things only went from bad to worse when the dog got a hold of the mask. There was this horrific and psychotically freaky subplot in which the dog tries to kill the baby for no reason. What the hell?! This was some scary stuff.

The story is just a mix up, rushed due to their over emphasis on the effects, which don't turn out to be that special either.But even though I hate it, I still couldn't look away for most parts. So here's a word of warning: Once you see this, run!!! Rating: 1/2 out of 5.",

The dog Otis is so cute!! What can you say bad about this movie? It has all the elements of a kid flick. GO SEE IT!!! its fun! I saw it at the Grove in Los Angeles and I was invited to the Premier and the after party, which was 100% kid land! From the bumping music to the wonderful food it was for kids. What else for a kid type movie? Jamie Kennedy give the most cute and comical expressions. There is a part in the movie where you can tell Jamie Kennedy does his own thing, its the fish mouth. Go see it, its a feel good movie hugs.",

I also saw the \"Son of the Mask\" and seemed to enjoy watching this as well. Some would say I'm sappy but I did think it cute. I did feel this was setup for a totally different age group than the first. I was surprised at first but feel I was at least open minded not like some of the comments here. \"And no I am not a writer, producer, or anything else attached to this movie.\" I liked the setup for Loki, and how the mask got here was explained very well. Ben Stein played his part so well that it made for a great beginning. They did lose me for a while in the intro of the beloved dog and the baby, this I thought was weak. The party sequence was good up until the western part which dragged. I thought that sometimes the director got lost because there where times when the story skipped a beat. I loved Loki as a character. The dog and baby was great laughs. The father could have been a stronger character than it was. All in all it seemed to me to be setup to explain how the mask got here, and if you didn't go in with a mind set first. I think you would have a great time with this movie. I have friends out side of this country that say the movie is much funnier than the one in the states. That there where parts cut out of this movie for the rating. I LIKED IT. THE STORY WAS CUTE.

Another thing that really annoyed about this movie is the scene where the mask character dances. In the original movie this scene is hilarious. This movie tries to recreate that and fails miserably.

So when I heard they were making a sequel, I was very excited, but also wary( Movie sequels have a history of disappointing me). So on the Night it came out, I rushed over to the nearest theater, bought a ticket, and got ready for a night full of excitement. boy, was I disappointed! The plot is about Norse god Loki trying to get the mask back, or else his father, Odin will take away his powers(or something like that) Anyway, Some Cartoonist who doesn't want to become a father finds the mask, and takes it to a costume party. If you liked the CGI antics of the first film, Sorry to disappoint: The Party scene is one of the few times when someone even uses the mask, and it's not that great. Soon the cartoonist(still wearing the mask) goes home, and apparently he forgot about his reluctance to become a father, because... well, you know what I mean. Soon a baby is born(with super powers from the mask), and he and the dog (did I mention they have a dog too?) are competing for attention. Meanwhile Loki tries to find the baby for a reason too stupid to write. This is pretty much what the rest of the movie is about. I am not making this up. eventually, Loki loses his powers because he couldn't find the baby, but gets his powers back for an hour and finds the baby, which he uses as black mail for the mask. the cartoonist puts on his mask in an attempt to defeat Loki, But realizes they are equally matched. then Odin appears and is mad at Loki and is about to Banish him, When Cartoonist tells Odin that nothing's more important then family. Again, I am not making this up. He gives Loki the mask, And everyone goes home. Roll credits. this movie was so Unoriginal and badly written it relied on several Looney Tune Plots, Including \"One Froggy Evening\"(the one where this one guy finds a singing frog, But whenever he shows it to people, the frog just sits there, doing nothing) Avoid this movie at all costs. You will want your hour and 20 minuted back. I sure did.",

The bad guy wanted to kill the baby and the residents are not paying any attention to that and just walk past them like they don't even care!

He sort of destroyed him and his entire kingdom because he hated him to the point of death. You don't visit Hel, queen of the underworld to be ordered around to find some ridiculous mask, especially when you're willing to kill Odin's son on top of everything else.There's a hundred more points surely, but I don't have the time.

Kennedy has a JackRusselTerrier dog, just like Stanley Ipkiss has Milo, and both females are blonde. That's pretty much it, but w/e.

            "content": "CARTOON SPECIAL EFFECTS ANTICS RULE film review by Fred Topel Son of the Mask very smartly sets itself up as a different movie entirely from its predecessor. Instead of a superhero story, this is about what would happen if one fathered a child while under the spell of the mask. It's a fun, cute family movie that totally works on its own. People have this lofty memory of The Mask. Nobody seems to remember what a slow paced movie it was. Yeah, the scenes of Jim Carrey in greenface with cartoon effects were great, but there were only four of them. In between, there were long stretches of clich\u00e9 plot about a repressed shy guy, a mean gangster and his hot girlfriend. There may be no Jim Carrey quality human antics in Son of the Mask, but it's much faster paced. You don't even get a chance to breathe. Jamie Kennedy is not playing Jim Carrey. When he puts on the mask, it's a much calmer type of green guy. He still has a few tricks, but he's not bouncing off the walls. He's more laid back. And he only wears it twice. He's really playing father, and the bulk of the movie is his heightened reactions to the kooky kid. He may overdo it and the fisheye lenses may be too much, but for a kids movie it's not offensive. He's just being a clown. Once the mask baby is born, it's nonstop chaos for poor father Tim Avery (Kennedy). Scenes of the baby and the mask-wearing dog enacting classic cartoon bits are brilliant. Some direct references to classic cartoons nail them perfectly, and original stuff maintains a consistent tone. The effects here are great. There's no hint of blur in all of the live action cartoonery. And of course, everything has to be bigger. The eyes don't just bug out, they go all the way across the room. To some extent, they try too hard sometimes (eyes bugging out a few feet is funnier than all the way across the room), but it all looks solid. The story of a playful man-boy learning responsibility may be as clich\u00e9 as the good guy/bad guy story of the original, but it works better because of the relentless pace of all the mask-y stunts. You don't have time to think about the schmaltziness. Besides, the real story is simply the baby trying to drive Dad crazy, which is a very pure comedy premise. The idea of Loki and Odin's relationship playing out simultaneously to Tim and his son is clever and Alan Cumming sure knows how to sell special effects comedy. Connections to the original film include a return to Edge City, Ben Stein reprising his cameo and a snippet of the \"Cuban Pete\" song. They're nice nods to the original film, but really Son of the Mask could exist on its own. There are people who hate this movie with a passion and I just don't understand the point. If you don't like the jokes and think it's stupid, fine, but it's still just a harmless kid's movie. It doesn't have any offensive values or inappropriate tone or incompetent aspects. It services its audiences respectfully, it's not too dumb for kids because of all the classic cartoon references and it's well done.",

It is, without question, undoubtedly worse than 1994's 'The Mask' in every conceivable way though.Jamie Kennedy's version of this Dark Horse Comics character is truly dreadful, especially visually, though thankfully the film doesn't actually give that much air time to Kennedy as The Mask; like, he's there but it's predominantly the dog and the son that get much of the screen time alongside Alan Cumming's Loki - to slightly better effect too, the way the kid is animated kinda nearly works... it doesn't, but almost.Ryan Reynolds, according to Kennedy himself, possibly wanted this role. It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way, or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past. Oh, wait!4/10 is probably generous on my part, though there are far worse films out there that actually annoy me - 'Son of the Mask' honestly doesn't.

            "content": "It is common, especially for Hollywood, to churn out a sequel that is not as good as its original blockbuster. Watch the very weak Men in Black 2 to understand this completely in contrast to its witty sci-fi comedy of an original. However, after viewing such a flawed fantasy, I recommend this is how low you can go to make a horrible sequel! Choppy editing. The camera work was poor! You name a flaw in film-making and realise how many you can find in this doomed project. This is a visual guide how not to make film, unless of course you are a studio executive, who couldn't care less that such a film is bad, but a money-making venture for its franchise. As you cannot tell, I think this is how such a poor sequel was introduced.So, what did I hate about this film? Was it the fact that they tried to be more creative than its predecessor? Yes, by the bowl full! In the original they at least had someone who gave an \"animated performance\" to the main character, who pulls all sorts of codes and convention from the world of Hollywood animation. I am talking of no one but some Canadian comedian known as Jim Carrey, in a role I thought was suitable for his brand of goofy talents. However, viewing the Son of the Mask, they fail to impress me with such antics that I could not stand any more, and cringed for every time such an antic was performed.Was another reason the fact got anything to do with the plot of a struggling animator wanting his idea to become a show? Through that perspective, I guess not. But this sub-plot failed to make such a focus on the narrative of this film, instead they went to re-invent the antics that made The Mask entertaining, that I couldn't even care less about this animation-orientated sub-plot. Also, the fact is the film focuses on Poki trying to get that Mask back to his father was the main narrative. In fact, because of that narrative, the filmmakers, who I do not want to hear about unless they make something really worth watching, the excuse to proceed such badly-timed antics.While on the subject of the main narrative, I will have a moan about costumes; that god's outfit looked so cheap and nasty that I think an amateur drama society could make a better job than that piece of ghastly clothing.Also, while we are on the subject of the god, I found some dialogue either poorly written or badly acted. It was hard to tell. So I will blame both such a script that relied on the clich\u00e9s of a family film to make the film have some continuity. Although from viewing this, I wished the writers had writer's block and go on to write something else. I will also put blame on some of the actors and actresses. Actually, I won't blame them; performing such rubbish deserves recognition, which will unfortunately be a Razzie Award. Well, the actor that played the god was terrible and so unknowingly, that I wish someone with much better acting training had the role. But I hope Brian Blessed will have turned down that role at such a sight of a poor project.There you go. I have survived watching such rubbish, and hopefully go on and have a better life, and hopefully forgetting that such a flawed film even existed. But they do say, with bad films, that it is so bad it's good. That will never apply to this pointless sequel to The Mask.",

Loki's infuriated father, Odin, orders Loki to take back what's his, one way or another. The film stars Jamie Kennedy. He did a very poor job playing the role of Tim Avery. In the first film, The Mask, the protagonist was Stanley Ipkiss, played by the hilarious Jim Carrey and with this one, Tim Avery was the protagonist. I don't get that. Why not use Jim Carrey again? He's far better than Jamie. The director, Lawrence Guterman ruined a great movie with this crap follow up! Then there's Tim's wife Tonya, who also did a bad job acting, but hey, she did a better job than Jamie.This movie is terrible, and no one should have to see it.

Although his characters can sometimes be excessive and theatrical, carrey gives us a much better performance in his movie than Jamie kennedy.Kennedy takes some time to warm up to his character, never staying far from a mild/average acting skill, thus, never really making a connection with the audience.Now, Bob Hoskins steals the show, as far as i'm concerned. Quite good as ODIN, father of the gods.Surprisingly, from my point of view, what could be the highlight of the show, the FX/digitally animated scenes/action between the dog and the baby that gives the name to the movie - the son of the mask - and all the other digital animations in the movie, are what actually spoils it. Some parts are all too excessive and boring , showing some abuse in the use of CGI effects. Or the lack of imagination and plagiarism ( as when the dog, that looks rather like ipkiss's dog, puts on and changes into the mask, like in the previous movie).Alan Cumming is pleasant , sometimes a bit annoying in his matrix stile wearing.All in all, if i were to choose, i would go for a whole digitally animated movie like the breakthrough one's these days, and far better. That would certainly be a better choice, probably a winning one. This is not the case though, a mild movie dangerously in the border of average and bad, but still, manages not to fall down completely. 5 out 10",

There is absolutely no sign of the gag-fest of the original Mask, which rightly put Carrey into mainstream cinema. Jamie Kennedy as main character has no charisma whatsoever and simply looks depressed when he becomes the Mask. Cumming (Loki) just looks a poof throughout.The ending is nothing that anyone with the IQ of the average 3 year old can figure out. Instead, the real story is the battle between Cumming and Kennedy to bore as many people as possible, both on and off the screen. Carrey grinned like a maniac as the Mask; Kennedy just gimmaces. Just look at the expression on everybody's faces in his vicinity both as Avery and as the Mask. Utter boredom. Cumming has the best part (not that there's much competition - he should have played Avery) but in his opening scene he simply uses his mighty powers of boredom to outwit his foe. His magnum opus for boredom takes place in a busy street in broad daylight where he's flexing his mighty computer-generated powers and is ignored by everyone.Good bits? Well, I gave this two stars as I think this movie is unique in that most of the budget went on the splendid spangily cheery props and scenery than on the cheap, bland and wooden actors. But despite all the flashy effects, I imagine that anybody watching this dull-fest masquerading as entertainment to the end will be left feeling depressed, thoroughly miserable, heartless, soul-less and sickly-green with nausea.

So when an unexpected bundle of joy comes along, he gets more than he bargained for... oh god. Cheesy premise, yes, but is it watchable? There are only two reasons this movie was made. One: Money. (duh.) Two: an exercise in animation techniques and physical effects. Like those straight-to-tape Disney sequels, this movie strikes me as \"practise\" for animators and animation techniques. That said, the different animations and computer graphics throughout the movie are very good and are amalgamated with the live action fairly well. However, besides that and the surprising heartfelt 'message' near the end of the movie, the good stuff pretty much ends there.Jim Carrey MADE the original movie. Now Jamie Kennedy has shown his versatility behind a disguise on 'The Jamie Kennedy Experiment', yet he seemed really restricted and NON-wild in his subpar prosthetics. Sadly, even a decent performance from super talented Alan Cumming couldn't really help a script that really seems to go all over the place. Add to all this a CG animated baby that \"doesn't quite look right\" and you have yet another shallow attempt to cash in on a surprisingly profitable original.Is \"Son Of The Mask\" worth watching for the average viewer? I don't think so. Is this harmless family viewing? Mostly.

After this, chaos ensues.Like I said, I haven't seen this in 13 years, but I still remember how much I hated it.The movie is for kids, but it's boring. It was not entertaining in any way, I was constantly waiting for something interesting to happen.Most of the jokes don't land either. In one scene, The Mask makes the infant pee in 3 different directions. Isn't that funny- a pee joke?Actually, ONE funny joke happens later due to it. When the villain, played by Alan Cumming, tells the father to give him The Mask, the genuinely confused Dad asks: \"What mask?... Oh! That's why he can pee like that!\" The villian is revolted by that comment.That's the only worthwhile part of the movie, so there you go. 140 other people have given this a 1/10, and they are not wrong.

It's definitely not deserving of a 2.2/10.Let me get this clear: Jim Carrey was my favourite thing in the original The Mask. He was very funny, and I loved the movie because of his comedic skills. This film, of course, isn't as great because Jim Carrey is in it, and because the jokes are a bit too crude for people's taste, so I can semi-understand if this got mixed reviews, but the reviews are horrendous...Christ. We'll start off with the pros first. Some of the humour in this was quite good. I liked the fast-motion jokes they used in this, which they used in the original. You know, when he puts on the mask, and he goes fast? Yeah, the filmmakers of this understood the humour of this joke, and they used it in their original, unique way. I enjoyed the slapstick humour in this, which I won't give away, and I especially enjoyed Otis, who was a constant gag throughout the film that was very funny. The pacing in this is way too fast, unfortunately, but I suppose it just matches with the humour in this film.It knows it's audience, and it knows what it's doing. The film knows that it's a crude, tasteless comedy, which is why I think this film's underrated. It knows how to pull off a gag at the right time, and none of the jokes ever seem to be forced when you watch this. So, there's another pro.Now for the cons.I absolutely hated the CGI in this. It was horrendous, cringe worthy, and annoying. I can see where the hate for the CGI comes from, it was horrible, I felt repulsed watching the CGI. The gags involving potty humour weren't funny. I know how I said that it was just meant to be a crude, tasteless comedy, but I think this went a bit too far with the potty humour. It was way too crude for my taste, and I can clearly agree that the potty humour was too much, and it made me lose my appetite a bit. I had to pause the film for a few minutes so I could vomit.The original The Mask felt to be the better experience. When I watched this, I enjoyed some moments, and laughed, but in The Mask, I think it felt more coherent and normal, rather than jumpy and energetic like this one. The original The Mask also had Jim Carrey, which I think really boosted the original from this one. If your going to watch this, expecting it to be as good as the original, don't watch it.Overall, I think it was a bad film, but it was nowhere as bad as critics are saying. You may like it if you can stomach crude humour, but if you can't, I don't think you will. 4.8/10.",

David/Michael is the most painfully stupid person and someone put a camera on him. There's a feeling you get from his antics called \"douche- chill.

But the actual film Son of the Mask delivers that feeling just for the fact that it was made. The beginning masked character pales horridly to the already tragically instructed performance by Jim Carrey (they basically hired an astronaut to to drive a taxi). With the sequel, however, they hired a grouchy obnoxious taxi driver to chauffeur foreign dignitaries. From there it just gets worse",

At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you'll have to actively search for them.For the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler, but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father, this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he responded \"Convicted felons,\" apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.But just making a bad movie is not a sin, or Hell would be overflowing. What makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. To put things in perspective, the day after we watched Son of the Mask, my son and I watched \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture), and was brought in for $7 million. That's right. Just one-tenth of the amount of money spent on Son of the Mask. This, then is the sin -- to flush good money down the sewer, when it could have been better used in making watchable movies, or feeding starving children, or for that matter, almost any other purpose.

Add in Ben Stein, Bob Hoskins, Kal Penn, and a refreshing supporting role by Steven Wright and you can see how much screen time was wasted on drawn-out cartoonish action sequences and digital manipulations of the baby's three expressions.Taking into account the director's previous work on \"Cats and Dogs\" and \"Antz,\" it is easy to see the source of the neglect: human characters (and actors) seem to take a back seat to novelty leads under Guterman's direction.Several segments were entirely over-descriptive of the plot/upcoming action to even be considered subtle foreshadowing, including a gratuitous 2-minute synopsis of a classic cartoon. Rather than innovative media sampling and dynamic background asides, certain parts just come off as cinematic laziness.There's nothing wrong with a little toilet humor, especially in a kid's movie; however some of the bodily fluid scenes would probably be considered profane by the FCC.The special effects were pretty seamless and elaborated on the conventions established by the first film, but for the most part served as lengthy breaks from plot advancement and character development. They certainly got the right FX house, because ILM has plenty of experience in this field! Alan Cummings played a dynamic and likable villain, and Traylor Howard a generic, but hot, Gen-Xer mom.Overall, the movie had its moments, but missed the boat by ignoring a talented and capable cast and dumbing down the humor to the point of being patronizing even to children.

The screenplay was crap, the acting was crap, the so-called special effects were a ridiculous attempt to recreate some of the funnier scenes of the original but completely failed on all levels.Ed Wood was probably the worst director of all time, and his film \" Plan 9 from Outer Space \" is reputed to be the worst film of all time.

For the adult audience, the sets are garish, the acting is amateurish, the plot is a cute idea but never fully fleshed out, the mythological references are shallow, the character development is weak and inconsistent and the characters are difficult to care about.To give an idea of this film, if you were to blend \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" and the \"It's a good life\" segment of \"Twilight Zone: the movie,\" and throw in a pinch of writing styles from any of the nickelodeon sitcom line-up, you'd get a reasonable notion of this film.This is one to let your young kids watch if you don't mind that it has absolutely no beneficial qualities other than it's pre-juvenile entertainment value and does resort to the occasional booger-level slapstick. If you want your kids to get something useful, educational, or spiritually strengthening out of their medium, look somewhere else.Quite simply put, if you're old enough to remember \"The Mask\" fondly and want more of that which it had to offer... THIS IS NOT IT. This is a movie with NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE for ANYONE but young children and parents who enjoy watching shallow mindless children's' movies with their kids, like me. It does not offer the depth of ANYTHING that could be considered classic and I anticipate that it be forgotten very quickly.Overall, It's not a BAD BAD movie... It's just not a GOOD movie. My kid's had a good time.***Spoiler*** Steven Wright is in this film and doesn't have even one single funny thing to say. This is just wrong.",

You know what really ticked me off; that these independent actors Jamie Kennedy and Rebecca Massey look very similar to Jim Cerrey and Cameron Diaz. And it's even the same dog and I believe has the same name.But I don't if anyone else knows about this but this movie received one award and seven nominations. Yah, do you know what they were? It won the Razzie award for worst remake/sequel. And was nominated for the Razzie award for worst actor, director, picture, screen couple, screenplay, and two supporting actors. That made me laugh my ass off.But anyway, don't see this movie. It's terrible. Go see The Mask, which is much better.",

At the end, the only thing hurting was my head because I was trying so hard to make something funny out of the vast majority of the ridiculous (in a bad way) jokes. The title of this article refers to the fact that every time I braced myself and smiled, certain that a big funny joke was coming, they let off a stinky that left me feeling like Loki on the receiving end of the \"stink like a skunk\" joke during the boxing match.

And if you think Jamie Kennedy doing the Mask was bad, look no further than Bob Hoskins character, Odin. Every time he enters he is yelling...what is up with that? The whole Odin/Loki gods stuff is such a stupid angle.Jamie Kennedy and the mask: What made the original Mask movie great was Jim Carrey. Not only did Carrey act the Mask better, his \"Mask\" was dressed much more appropriate. The Mask character was modeled after the Wolf character in Tex Avery's cartoons. Jim Carrey portrayed that character almost perfect, with the clothing, the voice, the actions...everything. Mind I note Jim Carrey's face is much thinner and therefore works better in mimicking the wolf character. Jamie Kennedy has a fat face, is dressed in horrible clothing, wears this UGLY red wig, and worst of all, his voice over on the mask is horrible...not to mention his acting as \"Tim Avery\". The Mask here is more like...a cartoon version of Mo Collins (from MadTV) doing that character who never finishes her sentences and continues to go higher and higher with her voice. It is horrible. There is little, if any, evidence of the Son of the Mask resembling Tex Avery's creations. Jamie Kennedy's performance, alone, makes this movie very hard to watch.",

Let me start by saying this- if you value your life, keep the hell away from this movie. I only just survived, and even then I had to saw off one of my arms. Want more proof as to how stupefyingly horrible this dreck is? It's on the IMDb Bottom 100, and quite honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.Plan 9 From Outer Space is widely regarded to be the worst film of all time- and one of the funniest. Why? Because that's how bad it it. The aliens are guys in gorilla suits with fish bowls one their heads. The graves used in the graveyard seen are cardboard, and wobble whenever the wind blows. The aliens use human desks and pens. And the U.F.O.s are hubcaps being dangled around on visible strings. Why do I mention this? It's very simple: in ten years time, Son of the Mask will be considered the Plan 9 of our generation. The already bad effects will look terrible.The only likable character is, surprisingly, Loki.

What follows is visual gag on top of visual gag and to be honest, they just aren't funny. Why? Quite simply, there is no timing. Imagine a stand up comedian reeling off jokes without taking a breath and you will soon find it boring. It would help if there was a plot or a little tension thrown in but I think more emphasis was given to set design. And to think of all the hours spent on the visuals. It really is a crying shame but I am being convinced more everyday that the art of film-making is being replaced by bright colours that bounce around the screen.

The story was not perfect, but we can't forget it was a comedy and the kind of film din't require anything extremely good. But it was a success. Jim Carrey, an excellent comedian, and revealed to be a great dancer too. The effects, the characters, the environment, everything was pretty good and made it a very good movie. Almost everybody associates Jim Carrey to the Mask ans vise-versa.Son of the mask is a disaster... and awful disaster. Everybody knows that making a second movie after a great success is risky and almost every time, is not so good as the first one. In this case the \"not so good\" could be a compliment, as Son Of The Mask revealed to be the worst movie i ever seen. But why? So here it goes: 1\u00ba - The characters are bad. they're personality is horrible, complete loosers (not like Stanley Hipkiss, not even close.). 2\u00ba - The actors are the worst i have ever seen. Come on people... making a second mask movie without Jim Carrey ??? or without any actor with the same status as Jim?? I mean, professionals! These guys can'0t even act as ordinary people in they's day-to-day lives... When I saw this Jamie Kennedy as the mask.... Jesus.... i couldn't believe... it was SO INCREDIBLY BAD!!! The make up, the posture, the face, everything.... the guy doesn't even move any muscle in his face... I can't believe they destroyed The Mask this way... people, put this in your mind: there will never be any Mask like Jim Carrey. Or even close! 3\u00ba The story is incredibly bad... when people watch a movie, there is supposed to be a connection between the watcher and the movie. there has got to be something interesting, something funny, something that makes you see the movie until the end. And actually like the movie. You don't have any connection to this movie. You star to watch and you wonder when it is over, 'cause it's so bad, you want to stop watching it! 4\u00ba Don't have the skill, don't mess. This title completely destroyed the mask, the funny the mask was. After a decade, people still watch the original The Mask starring Jim Carrey, and they still laugh an enjoy the movie as if it was the first time it was seen. With this disgusting sequel i'm afraid The Mask looses it's beauty in comedy and it's magic.So, my advice is: if you liked very much The Mask, don't you dare to watch this Son Of The Mask thing, 'cause you're gonna get disappointed and very sad about what they've done with the original title. If you loved The Mask, forget that Son Of The Mask has ever been made. But actually, my advice is: EVERYONE -> DON'T WATCH THIS, DON'T RENT IT, DON'T BUY IT. IT'S SSSSSOOOOOOOOOO BBBBAAAAAADDDDDD!!!!!I even saw someone's review saying that this Son Of The Mask is a great movie for kids... please... children are not \"stupid beings\". Can't they have good content, on what they see, anymore ? But that also has another point... The Mask was not supposed to be ONLY for kids... The original Mask was a movie for everyone!! AND IT WAS GOOD. I'm not just complaining, i mean, Son Of The Mask is an interesting title, i actually lead me to watch it. but please.... why use these title in such an awful movie?? why not a GOOD sequel???I'm sorry Lawrence Guterman, but you could have done MUCH better. I know it's a cheap movie to direct... but the result is the worst thing i've ever seen, and i'm not the only one.And by the way, to all actors of this movie, specially to Jamie Kennedy: go to acting school, or go there again. learn something there and come back to the movie business. And learn, as well, what is true comedy. Learn with Jim.And if any director is thinking about making another movie about The Mask... please.... choose experts, choose great actors, great comedians, great effects, great music, and great story. otherwise... don't mess anymore, don't destroy The Mask anymore.",

When I left the cinema i had my answer...it did live up to the original and even improved on it.The acting in this film is top notch along with the witty script and great lightning effects. Its a shame this didn't come out a couple of months earlier to compete for best film, best actor and best director in the Oscars.But not to worry, maybe this is a good thing as it will make it more art-house and it will grow a cult following. I give this a 10 out of 10 on all levels and advise people to see it.",

I should also say \"No Jim Carrey?, NO GOOD!\" I loved The Mask (1994), but this movie hasn't got the \"spark\" that the first movie had.This movie is about a cartoonist called Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) who found the mask that Stan Ipkiss threw away. At first he said \"This is the crappiest piece of crap in crap-town\" which is more than what I can say for this movie! He went to a Halloween pray as the mask, he tried it on and POOF!, he turns green! (I loved the mask's song \"I cant take my eyes off you\" at the party though.) He went home as the mask and had Intercourse with his wife (NO! It was not shown, it skipped to the aftermath, so don't think your gonna get any good stuff!). She became late (Not for work, Duh!) and gave birth to a baby boy, who was not as he seemed. Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard AKA worst name ever!) left him alone with Alvey (Ryan Folchner (Spelling?)), their son. Tim feared Alvey because he saw that he was a God of Mischief. And the family's Jelous Dog, Odtis (A Dog!) wore the mask and Tried to kill Alvey using the ways the Cyote uses against the Roadrunner, but fails every time. The real trouble comes when Loki (Alan Cumming), creator of the mask and his Dad, Odin (Bob Hoskins) comes looking for the mask. The Grand Finale comes when Loki Kidnapps Alvey and begins a showdown, Loki vs. The Mask. Wanna know what happens to Alvey and the mask, No? Of course not! My advice is don't waste 3.50 renting out the movie, you might as well throw your money down the drain. If you buy this movie, may I suggest to take your shotgun or your Pick-axe to it, it will do you good! :) Overall: Awful! 1/10, Pity I could not give it 0/10! :(",

But, if boredom is killing you, you are left with no movies to watch, then you can watch the tom and jerry in this movie. Small kids might like this movie. Kids aged more than 6 might find hard time watching this movie.Tim Arvey did his job very decently... He doesn't look comic. He tries to be one but fails utterly.The story line is vague sometimes... The director seems to have lots of different conflicting ideas in taking the movie.The movie ends with the Loki and his father going back to their kingdom... That very scene is awful with the so-called GODs getting upset upon their mistake.The worst part is... to scare hell out of you, Loki's dad comes out of nowhere; shouts at Loki goes back just to remind the viewer that the movie is still intact and running around the story.I rate 3!",

            "content": "I knew before I popped this into my DVD player that I was getting myself into a heck of a predicament. But I never expected Son of the Mask to be this horrible. As a sequel to the box-office hit The Mask, Son of the Mask tries to make the movie zanier than the first (and succeeds) but does a horrible job at it. I mean, how do you have a Mask sequel without Jim Carrey? Honestly! Jamie Kennedy plays Tim Avery, a struggling worker at a place called Imagine, a kiddy fun place. And when I say struggling, I mean struggling! He's the mascot and has been the mascot for months now. He wants his promotion, but just can't get it. That is, until he puts on the mask at his works Halloween party. Now, his cartoonist skills are put to work by making a cartoon about this green freak. But Kennedy's acting skills were not put to the test. Now, I'm not saying that Kennedy is a bad actor, not at all. He's actually a great actor! But, like I said, they weren't put to the test in this kiddy flick. This goes for all of the actors in the film including Kal Penn, Ben Stein, and Traylor Howard (Cumming excluded. He's just a bad actor in my view.) That's just the beginning of all of the bad elements that we must endure in this 88 minute pile of crap! Next, I'd like to point out the zaniness. I know this was supposed to, and is, a zany film. But they took it overboard in my opinion. I'm mostly talking about all of the scenes in the movie. But the two worst were ones involving the baby Alvey and the dog Odin (which, at times, were included in the scene together, making us endure more pain.) Let's start with baby Alvey. The thing I didn't like about him was he was the son of the mask, literally. When he was conceived, his daddy must of still been wearing the mask, giving baby Alvey all of the mask's crazy powers. And that didn't go well with me. First off, his powers were just plain stupid. Like singing and hopping around like that stupid Warner Bros. frog does, and trying to make his dad go insane all at the age of one. Just plain ridiculous. Now, onto Odis the dog. Awe, poor sweet Odis is now being ignored by the Avery's because of baby Alvey. What to do, what to do? Why not put on the mask and try to put Alvey in grave danger? Bingo, there's an idea for you. Except, next time, don't actually use it. That's all I've got to say on that subject.Onto Alan Cummings. Yep, this guy gets a whole paragraph of his own and I get to insult his acting abilities the whole time. Just something about this guy doesn't really click. Maybe it's because the only roles he takes are wacky and out-of-this-world characters such as Loki, his character in the movie. See, the problem I have with Cummings (besides his last name) is that he badly needs acting school. He shows no emotion and always looks like he's reading off of cue cards in mostly all of his films (Spy Kids aside.) Can't you actually put any effort into your characters? And don't go blaming your characters Cummings, you're the one who's accepting these wacky roles. If you want to be remembered as a great actor, star in something worthwhile for once, not these kiddy movie roles that'll get you nowhere. So, all that I have left to say about Mr. Cummings is that his acting is exactly what his character's name says: low-in-key.The score didn't please me either in this film. They took the original score from The Mask and inserted some wacky tones into it. I loved The Mask's score, so you can imagine how mad I was when I heard the \"remix\" of it. This could've been the only thing really going for them, but they decided to blow it up with a little beat of their own. Despicable, just plain despicable! The set design was nice, if you like props that look like they were pulled out of a Dr. Suess book. Dudes, the movie was supposed to be wacky, not the set. I was hoping for a normal set with a little bit of something here and there. It's what everybody's doing. Oh, but not Son of the Mask. No, they need to make their whole movie a wackfest! I almost puked while looking at all that sickening color placed onto the screen.But, since I'm a nice guy, I will go out and say that the directing was good. We had some very nice camera angles that had me drooling like a dog on a wet, hot summer day! I also dug the often close-ups. I say often because they knew when and when not to do a close-up. Unlike some movies out there today, Son of the Mask accomplishes the close-up clich\u00e9. Yet, none of these sweet directing could save this pile of steaming cow dung! So, as the end credits rolled, and as I cheered that I can finally get back to my life (as much of a life that I do have, that is) only one last fact came to my mind: don't ever, ever watch a sequel to a 10-year old box-office hit that went from PG-13 to PG, with no sight of the original actors, and nothing to do with the original flick. Trust me, you'll thank me later.0 out of 5 stars",

If there was ever a movie where million dollar CGI were wasted on purpose due to a wretched plot outline, this would be that movie. I'm sure there will be others, but for now, we're stuck with this. SON OF THE MASK is another Jim Carrey pre-sequel (DUMB AND DUMBERER in 2003) but to my knowledge, at least that movie had a Jim Carrey lookalike. How Jamie Kennedy got this role is a hardcore mystery, and a mystery like this is best left alone to keep his websites full of happy fans. This film is a dreadful, putrid, obsolete cinematic failure with a story that's as entertaining as watching a multi-colored ice cube melt in the hand of a burn victim. The Bottom line? Jamie Kennedy plays Tim, an animator that discovers the mask from his dog Otis. He wears it and while under the so called 'curse' of the mask, he impregnates his wife. So, we get a baby with special super human powers. Later on, and I'm just guessing the numbers, we sit through a $1'000'000 CGI trick of Otis transforming into a cartoon dog after putting on the mask. Otis has a grudge against the baby due to the fact that Tim and his wife enjoy his presence more. So, we sit through a similar 1950's cartoon scheme of Otis and the baby blowing each other up, using both good old fashion explosive and inflation techniques. This, I'm also guessing, is $500'000. But by this point of the movie, you've probably already left the theater, and I cant say I blame you. I'm not against crude animation on principle, and this is just me, I've always wanted to be a cartoon Dragon that becomes inflated to the size of a planet as a means of making someone smile, giggle, or even become aroused out of my frustration and size, but when cartoon characters are made miserable on purpose because of a poorly written script, it makes me think of how many dollars I saved by watching this movie online. It's offensively bad to the eyes and ears of classic American cartoon craver's. Consider a scene near the end of the movie that involves a rip-off of THE EXORCIST where the baby vomits gallons of green goo onto the dashboard as a means of freaking out his dad. By this point of the film, I'm betting that you're at home on the RAZZIE@ website voting for worst picture.",

All of the effort went into the well-done visuals and about four cents went into the script and dumbed-down situations. So, the lame story drags poor Kennedy and Cumming down with it, too. See no evil by avoiding this",

            "content": "Let me start by stating that I am a big fan of the original Mask with Jim Carrey. I watched this movie because I purchased it as part of a double feature DVD for $5. And I must say with all seriousness, that I was absolutely dumbfounded by what I saw. It was, unquestionably, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life! I literally watched the whole movie, because I refused to believe that I had completely wasted my time spent watching it. I was absolutely convinced that there had to be at least one somewhat funny part in the movie. However, I was dead wrong. Jamie Kennedy's attempts at comedy in that movie were so awkward and uncomforting that I literally cringed throughout the whole thing. I probably felt similar to how a child feels when they are about to be molested by a pedophile. Unfortunately for me (the viewer), however, I did not have free candy or a nice ride in a white van to brag about. My innocence was stolen that day.After watching the movie, two thoughts have stuck in my head regarding the film.First off, I did not know that Hollywood actually made movies this bad. It seems that there should be some standard that all movies are required to meet. This was so bad, it didn't even seem real.Secondly, as the movie went on, I found myself developing a profound hatred for Jamie Kennedy. It's been about two years since I viewed it, and I still feel that he needs to have his ass kicked for the part he played in it. What he has done to the world of Arts of Humanities is comparable to 1st-Degree Manslaughter.I urge you to not watch this movie unless you are dedicated to being a part of history--as you can then say that you have watched the worst movie of all time. However, if you do decide to watch it for the hell of it, you run the risk of becoming less of a person.",

Yes, he likes to do mischief, but he also has done many good deeds in the Norse Mythology - He is after all the companion of Tor, one of the main Gods. It get's even worse.

Otis was also interesting, but he had a tendency to scream like a human at times, severely detracting from the humor. And Alvey. Annoying to NO end. He did so many things that no baby should ever even be depicted doing in stick figure comics, let alone digital rendering. Not to mention, the writers gave us cheap jokes, which were also given bad delivery by the actors. Also, the writers forgot something like time scale. It was impossible to know when each camera cut was from the last. Was it 4 seconds? Was it 3 months? We'll never know! Not to mention, when is this blasted movie set? 1950 or 2000? they have digital cinema and motion capture, but no cartoon censors.

The animation is poor, and so is the acting. Even Jamie Kennedy is a stupid actor. I don't even know what the executives were thinking of when making this movie. I guess it was the money. That annoys me a lot, when people care about making money more than the quality of the movie. Take Lord of the Rings for example.

Son of the Mask would have been a good movie if it wasn't a sequel, its a Kids Movie, the first was an adults.The movie went over board with effects that was the trade mark of the first. The main problem about this one is that not only did the effects look unreal at points, usually when the mask is put on and off, but they were almost unneeded, in the first the effects are more used for the point of making the actor quick and usually dresses him into weird clothing later to be introduced as a new character \"the cowboy\", in the Son of the Mash the effects where used as the jokes. The movie made a lot of mistakes including the mask working during the day and tried to re-capture the magic of the first one by including music and exact scenes from the mask.Finally comments: The film wasn't appealing to many as it was a kid film, nothing made it eye catching like the first, personally I would have liked to have scene a spin off starring Milo as the mask instead of making a sequel.

What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.\n\nLet me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clich\u00e9d and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.\n\nThe special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.\n\nAll in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Sadly, Kennedy is either unwilling or unable to deliver a similar  energy. The plot is childish and uninspired, as is the acting.

The first film implies that it only works at night but the dog gets to remain with it for as long as he wants. The movie is also downright bizarre, and not in a good way. Basically, after watching the Michigan J Frog cartoon where the frog pretends to be a normal frog when the guy who caught him singing tries to show it to other people, Kennedy's baby decides to mess with him using the Mask's powers to get him committed largely for his own amusement.

The comedy of the film is dreadful, but if they went for horror instead, this could have worked (Especially with scenes of violence, like Jamie Kennedy's character strangling his wife and slamming her head against the floor). It could have been a great psychological horror film, but alas, it's instead a dreadful comedy aimed at children (Though it feels rather inappropriate for children).",

            "content": "I kind of enjoyed it. Sort of.\nI mean, I like it a lot more looking back then I did initially when I watched it.\n\nI think what I like about it, is it's dark humour and the fact it tries to be it's own story without *gasp* Jim Carrey. Which honestly, I feel like The Mask is a story that needs a different protagonist if you're going to make a sequel. Seriously, why have a mask that can give anybody super powers if you're only going to have one guy ever use it.\n\nThat being said, they should have gotten someone actually funny using the mask. Like, maybe someone who's an actually comedian? I don't know.\n\nThe baby and dog plot could have been explained a little better. Like how can a baby be born of a mask? I mean, I get the whole it was worn while they had sex, but I don't know, it seems to be a weird power it suddenly has. Also, how come the baby is so smart and psychotic? Is just cause he has mask power ? It kind of makes sense (especially if you read the comics) but again, you can't just throw that at an audience and expect them to accept that (or still like the baby character).\n\nAlso, that dog is way too smart. I know Milo from the first movie was crazy smart but the dog is like way too aware of everything (and why did Tim make him his own room, that's just crazy devotion to your dog there).\n\nI don't know if I like Loki's inclusion or not. On the one hand he's kind of funny and Loki makes sense in this universe cause we established in the last film he made the mask. On the other hand he's a weak villain and you might not like Loki, god of mischief, to portrayed by essentially a teenage brat that never grew up (though, I guess that's what the Marvel universe's Loki is like too *sting*)\n\nI think the plot is okay if not meandering at the beginning, but the first Mask meandered too and nobody thought ill of it. While we're comparing the two, they both had pretty weak villains (though Loki is arguably more interesting than Dorian).\n\nAnd before anybody gets all riled up, I'm not saying this is as good as the Mask. It's not. If I were to give them grades I would give this movie a C and The Mask a B+. The Mask is by far the better film though I think if it didn't have Jim Carrey, the script would fail (much like how Iron Man would have failed if not for Robert Downey Junior).\n\nHowever Son of the Mask, has no saving grace. The story doesn't really take off until the second half, and if you're not the type to like dark humour (like me) you're going to hate it. That's why I give this a three star, because it's something I like a guilty pleasure but I don't think it's one of those things that really warrants anything above average.\n\nThere's a lot left to say but I think the gist is gotten. The last thing I will say is that visually it's a mess. There are some okay visuals there (though again, if you don't like creepy imagery, you're going to hate it) but there's a lot of it that feels and looks extremely cheap. It also lacks a lot of creativity that the mask had. Half of the stuff I've seen here I've seen elsewhere in other movies.\nAnd that's where The Mask really does shine above this because it's not just creative but the effects really hold the test of time.  So as a sequel to that movie it fails, but if you look at it alone, it's alright.",

Then let's take away every single good performance and everything worthwhile, add copious amounts of unnecessary mythology and plastic hair and crappy CGI and then you've got Son of the Mask\n\nLet's start of simple. Our main hero, The Mask, is no longer portrayed by the likeable Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) but the somewhat annoying and not at all exciting Tim Avery. (Jamie Kennedy) Now, I like Kennedy in his previous work, but this, it's just not the same, the way he portrays The Mask is not at all how it has ever been before, Comic, Movie, TV, or video games, it's this weird mash up of a wax Conan O'Brian and the Burger King guy, with a terrible Elvis like voice. Our once likeable lead starts off with a terrible dance number, putting the song \"You're just to good to be true\" Into Dance, country and other terrible versions all while using a zoom lens basically the entire time.\n\nThe Mask then has sex with Tim Avery's wife, and then she has a baby which is not truly Avery's, but the Mask's, or Loki's or whatever. The next hour or so is basically close up shots of Avery being scared while a sometimes real sometimes terrible CGI baby tries to put him into a mental hospital for what seems to be for no reason. The baby may feel that he's not his real dad, and that the mask is or something I don't know, but then he ends up randomly changing his mind and deciding he loves him at the end.\n\nAlso, while Avery is not wearing the mask (Which is the majority of the film, what's even the point) the dog is, which is a terrible re-hash of a joke from the first where the dog found the mask and started hurting BAD GUYS, and in this one, the dog tries to kill THE BABY. Why? Well this theory is a little more clear as the dog feels like he isn't getting enough attention but still, this movie relies way too much on it's bad CGI as that's really all the 2nd act is, that and Loki (Alan Cumming) running around looking for his mask wearing unsettling costumes.\n\nThat's another thing. This movie is quite unsettling to children. A dog's eyeballs literally pop out and for about 10 seconds the dog has empty eye sockets. A man's face is taken off his body. A baby's face randomly changes into a scarier one, the movie's inappropriate for kids, and the first films audience is 13 and higher and wouldn't be interested, so who's the audience? No one. No one wants this film. It just needs to go join the other terrible sequel corner. The plot has potential but it's taken no where because they want to entertain us with bombastic frantic absolutely unnecessary CGI effects and some reaaaally bad acting at times. (See Steven Wright) Possibly if they stuck with the premise but maybe had, hmm, a better script, Jim Carrey, any funny scene, less Norse shit, and better CGI, it might have been a good film, but... unfortunately, it isn't. at all. But I do give it credit for making me at least smile like, once. That's it. That's the half a star.",

Son of the Mask is the perfect example of terribly unnecessary sequel. \r\n\r\nThe original, which starred Jim Carrey and began the career of Cameron Diaz, was lightyears ahead of this tripe. A wholly bizarre cluster of colour and the shameful theme of idiotic-parent trying to control toddler, which don't work in the slightest.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming, in his typical role of blumbering oaf, is this time the unconvincing villian. In a more general tone to account for all of his movies, weirdo-on-a-mission, he is trying to find his mask which fell onto Earth and is known to confide special powers.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy is the idiot father in this story, and Traylor Howard (\"Razzie Award for her role in Son of the Mask, please!\"), of the hopeless sitcom 'Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place', unnecessarily fills the shoes of the mother of the mischevious baby, wincingly-named Albie. Both are incompetent in their roles, and it was very hard to watch.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are a fan of sla-dash animation, dull characters, unfunny action and terrible acting, this could just become your favourite movie ever. For us sane people, this film belongs in the 'forget it' pile.",

Everything that was great about the first one has been thrown in the bin.\n\nThe CGI baby is so creepy, you'll have nightmares for weeks. The FX are awful. They had a budget of 80 mil and they could do any better. The first one was made with 18 mil and the FX in that one looked great.\n\nEvery scene feels the need to be silly, unlike the original where the silly scenes only happened when Stanley put on the mask.\n\nIt's also disgusting, if you're into urine, vomit and snot jokes, this is up your street.\n\nThe whole plot where the dog is trying to kill the baby is just............. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FILMMAKERS?\n\nThe main character only puts the mask on twice and the make up looks awful. Plastic hair, really? In the first one, when Dorian and Milo put the mask on, they had their own, although howcome Stanley didn't have hair when he had the mask on? Hmm?\n\nAlso, thank you filmmakers for messing up Norse mythology. Loki is a night god and what is he doing walking around in the daytime? Remember in the first movie it says the mask only works at night because Loki is a night god. DUH! \n\nLoki is also not the son of Odin. They got that from Marvel's Thor. And also, if Odin knew that a child had been born from the mask, WHY COULDN'T HE TELL LOKI WHERE THE MASK WAS INSTEAD OF LOKI GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE LOOKING FOR IT? This film makes me so angry!\n\nSo, is there anything I like? Two things; Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Bob said that Super Mario Bros was the worst film he'd done. I think he better take that back. Best not to mention this film to either of them if you meet them. Or any of the cast for that matter.\n\nWe waited 11 years for a sequel to the Mask and this is what we get? Rent the original, read the comics or watch the cartoon instead.\n\nSOMEBODY STOP THE DVD PLAYER!",

I can't tell if the director of photography was an inexperienced hack or trying to break crazy, new ground, but either way, what they did here doesn't work. Your eyes are constantly wandering to the wrong parts of frames, you're constantly expecting things to happen that don't and so forth - all because it's badly shot.\r\nStill, aspects of the story are interesting. Loki coming to Earth to retrieve the mask for instance is quite a nice idea for a sequel. It's a shame that they threw in a load of crap about a baby. But even then, it's not like the Loki stuff is good. It's handled in a horribly cheesey way and isn't very funny. \r\n\r\nUltimately, this film slots right in with the list of other crappy Jim-Carrey-less sequels such as 'Evan Almighty', 'Ace Ventura Jr' and 'Dumb and Dumberer'.\r\n\r\n3/10",

Loki, whom is the God rejected by all, must go to Earth and find where is the mask. As the film progresses Tim gets in possession of the mask and finally has the right to stand up for himself. Accidentally he gets his wife pregnant while having the mask, now a baby was born with the powers of the mask. Now Tim must find a way to solve his new problems before chaos erupts.\r\nThis movie fails on all levels of a movie. This movie should have been called Epic Fail! Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing! The acting of the protagonists is really dull and boring. I mean Jamie Kennedy is no Jim Carrey! There can be no one that will replace Jim's character. How dare they make a sequel without him! The dialogue is really cheesy and platonic. The dialogue is so bad and terrible that will make you stop watching this movie. I seriously wanted to stop watching this fiasco and it's a miracle that I watched the entire movie. For example this stupid joke of \"Who's the fish?\" It was really dull, pathetic and annoying that I wish that both them will sleep with the fishes. Seriously this movie is not funny at all! The plot is illogical that insults your intelligence. If you are a god and you want a mask, why don't you do some magic to get it back. Nope they act like complete dull humans looking for it like if they were some stooges. None of the scenes of this movie were good; everything in this movie was a complete disaster! The pace of this movie was a complete fiasco because it was going too fast and fails from outside logic. Visual-effects just can't replace a story, it can't happen and it will never happen because people will feel alienated with it! It just proves that you can't make a successful movie with making everything look cartoony; it didn't make me feel animated. \r\nWhat I like about the film? Absolutely nothing! I hate this movie. It was just awful. The premise was interesting because we get to see something new; I think it was interesting to see a baby born with the powers of the mask. This sequel fails on all levels from the first movie. It was missing the cleverness, the fun, and witty dialogue from the first movie. The problem with this movie is a gross-out comedy, even it supposed to be a \"family\" film, the only thing that this movie does is make you vomit like the baby did in the movie. The film was unnecessary, nihilistic, gross and utterly boring! The only thing good about this movie is that it had a proper ending! \r\nI hate sequels and Son of the Mask contains all the reasons why I hate sequels. The film is a complete and utter failure because there is no humor in this movie, it is just so freaking bad that makes you want to hit somebody! The film was directed by Lawrence Guterman and I want you to remember the man that ruined the film! He also has directed pointless movies that don't deserve to be called comedy like Cats and Dogs. This film can't be said anything positive about it.  \r\nI can't believe I will say this but don't watch this movie! That's the only recommendation I can give you for this movie. Believe me I am saving from watching one of the worst films of all time! If you loved the first movie then you are going to hate this movie because it insults all the things that were on the previous movie, this movie just destroys everything good about the first film. If you like gross-out comedies than perhaps you will like this movie...perhaps.",

I know, strange.  And boy I was glad that I didn't see this. I enentually saw it on Cartoon Network (right TV channel to air this film on) and felt stupid throughout the entire broadcast. The jokes are not funny, the story is too simple-minded, and the effects were horrid. The first \"Mask\" movie was good because if Jim Carrey was spinning his legs around like a Looney Tune character, his face would not be computer-generated. But here, if the little baby is doing cartoony things, they horridly make his face all CGI. I am sorry for all those who were victims of the film's terribleness. Is that even a word? This movie is only to be seen by mental patients.",

II Rating: 4 stars out of 5 stars\r\n\r\nMovie review written by Hector Fernando Andrade JR. II\r\n\r\nOn Feburary 18, 2005 my mom, my little brother, my paraprofessional from Elementary School, her son and I went to his movie theather called Cinema 6 for the first time to see The Son Of The Mask to cellabrate my paraprofessional son's 14 brithday. \r\n\r\nThe Son Of The Mask is sadily The Golden Raspberry Award winning action comedy movie sequel to The Mask, based on the series of horror comic books called The Mask created by Mike Richardson, Randy Stradley, Mike Badger, John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke and published by Dark Horse Comics. The Son Of The Mask was directed by Lawrence Guterman, produced by Kent Alterman, Tobey Emmerich, Sean Gorman, Erica Huggins, Stephen Jones, Scott Kroopf, Beau Marks, Mike Richardson, Tom Tataranowicz, Michele Weiss, New Line Cinema, Riddar Pictures and Dark Horse Entertainment, written by Lance Khazei and released to the movie theathers in the United States on Friday Feburary 18, 2005. The Son Of The Mask stars Jamie Kennedy as Tim Avery also known as The Mask, Alan Cumming as the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief, Traylor Howard as Tonya Avery, Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer as Alvey Avery, Kal Penn as Jorge, Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Bob Hoskins as Odin The Mythologcall King Of Norse Mythology.\r\n\r\nSo my mom, my little brother, my paraprofessional, her son and I went to the movie theather and paid and got our five movie tickets and our Popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and we went into the movie theather and sat down in our seats with our Popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and watched The Son Of The Mask.\r\n\r\nStory: Not long after the release of The Mask, it was announced in Nintendo Power that Jim Carrey would be returning as Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask in a sequel called The Mask II. The magazine held a contest where the first prize winner would be awarded a walk-on role in the film. Director Charles Russell, who helmed the original film, expressed his interest in The Mask II in his 1996 DVD commentary he was hoping Jim Carrey would reprize his role as Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask, along with Amy Yasbeck, who played newspaper reporter for \"Ask Peggy\" and The Eveing Star and The Tribune reporter Peggy Brandt in The Mask. Russell decided to cut scenes when Peggy dies and leave the character open for the sequel but due to Jim Carrey declining to reprise his role of Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask, the project never came to fruition, Charles backed out. Many actors were considered for a new Mask role but Charles wanted Jim Carrey and decided not to return and the concept for the sequel was completely changed. The screenplay of The Son Of The Mask was written by Lance Khazei, based on an original screenplay that he wrote titled Baby Formula. Baby Formula was never intended to be a sequel to the Mask nor was it originally intended to be a familly movie. Baby Formula has been described as having been inspired by Rosemary's Baby and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and originally intended for a more adult audience but then Lance changed his mind and decided to make Baby Formula a movie sequel to The Mask called The Son Of The Mask with a new story, a new set of chracters and a new setting. The story of The Son Of The Mask in a small summary goes like this: 7 years after the adventures that Stanley Ipkiss had with the mask, on a rain and thunderstorm night Dr. Aurthur Neuman (played by Ben Stein) is giving a tour of the hall of Norse Mythology at The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge City. A man dressed in hiding Black comes in to view the hall. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning the creation of the mask he tries to get it but Dr. Newman sees him and tells him not to touch the mask display, and when Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's imprisonment, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief (played by Alan Cumming), who has come down to Earth from Asgard to get his mask back. The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry god. Loki takes his mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask's stand and fakliy shoots some security guards and puts them into a hole before storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage. The next day in a town called Fridge City, Tim Avery (played by Jamie Kennedy), an aspiring cartoonist at an animation company, is feeling reluctant to become a father. He has a beautiful wife named Tonya Avery (played by Traylor Howard), and a best friend, Jorge (played by Kal Penn), who is very shy around women. Tim has a close relationship with his dog Otis (played by Bear the dog), who finds an ancient mask in a faroff creek and brings it to his owner's house. Tim puts on the mask for a Halloween party, transforming into a party animal that is similar to the mask character from the first film. At the party, Tim ogles a young woman named Sillva, (played by Victoria Thaine), eagerly confronts her, and uses his powers to have her stripped down to a skimpy costume and into Jorge's arms. When the company party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his mask powers to perform a remix of Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, therefore making the party a success, and giving Tim's boss Daniel Moss (played by Steven Wright) the idea for a new cartoon show. Tim returns to his house and, while still wearing the mask, has a sexual intercourse with his wife, conceiving a baby. 9 months latter It is Tuesday July 27, 2004 baby Alvey Avery (played by Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer) is born and he has the same powers as Loki. Meanwhile, under the command of by his father Odin (played by Bob Hoskins) Loki is trying to find the child born from the mask, since if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Later, Tonya goes on a business trip to the city of New York City, leaving Tim with baby Alvey. Tim, who has been promoted at work, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is disrupted by baby Alvey. In order to get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch television, while watching a Michigan J. Frog cartoon, baby Alvey devilishly obtains the idea to mess with his father's head by using his mask powers to make no one else believe him. Meanwhile, Otis the dog, who has been feeling neglected by Tim, dons the mask by accident and becomes a crazed animal version of himself, who wishes to get rid of Alvey to get his close relationship with Tim back. So baby Alvey and Otis the dog undergo a spectacular battle that turns the household upside down but the really big trouble begins when Loki finds out that Alvey the mask-born baby, and confronts Tim for the mask back and he will do whatever it takes to get his mask back from Tim, Alvey and Otis. I thought that the story of The Son Of The Mask was delightfully told.\r\n\r\nActing: The Son of The Mask is the first movie I have seen with Jamie Kennedy and the fifth movie I have seen with Alan Cumming and the first movie I have seen with Bob Hoskins, Traylor Howard, Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer, Bear the dog, Kal Penn, Steven Wright and the second movie we have seen with Ben Stein.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy plays the role of Tim Avery also known as The Mask who is an aspiring cartoonist from Fringe City who is feeling incredibly nervous and reluctant to becoming a dad. He is the protagonist of the film. He lives with his beautiful wife Tonya and his dog Otis. His dog finds a mask that he puts on for a Halloween party becoming a crazed cartoonish version of himself.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming plays the role of the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief who is the Norse night god of darkness and mischief. He vists The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge Cityhoping to find his mask that his father Odin has ordered him to find. After finding a baby was born from the mask, he takes a hospital list of babies born on July 27th to find the mask-born baby.\r\n\r\nBob Hoskins plays the role of Odin The Mythologcall King Of Norse Mythology who is Loki's father and orders him to find his mask on earth. After finding out there was a baby born from the mask, he orders Loki to find that baby as if he does, he'll find the mask.\r\n\r\nTraylor Howard plays the role of Tonya Avery who is Tim Avery's beautiful wife who wishes to have a baby although Tim doesn't. She remains oblivious of Alvey's mask abilities.\r\n\r\nLiam Falconer and Ryan Falconer both play the role of Alvey Avery who is the infant son of Tim and Tonya. He inherited the Mask's abilities.\r\n\r\nBear the dog plays the role of Otis the dog who is Tim's loyal pet dog. He shares a close relationship with Tim and even has his own dog room in Tim and Tonya's house. Later on, Otis thinks Tim is neglecting him so he puts on the mask and tries to get rid of Alvey, therefore getting all the attention again. He tries but fails several times.\r\n\r\nKal Penn plays the role of Jorge who is Tim's best friend at the animation company. Jorge is quite shy around women, but The Mask makes Jorge get over this by stripping down a women into a skimpy suit and into hs arms that pleases him. He works on the same floor as Tim and also wishes to become an animator, but doesn't bother to ask as he knows his chances are very slim.\r\n\r\nSteven Wright plays the role of Daniel Moss who is the head of Tim's animation company. Tim suggests his ideas to Daniel but refuses until he sees Tim wearing the mask at the company party which makes him want to promote Tim.\r\n\r\nBen Stein reprizes his role as Dr. Arthur Neuman who is a doctor and an expert on masks which Stanley Ipkiss consulted in The Mask who told Stanley that the object is a depiction of Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief. In The Son Of The Mask he's giving a tour of The hall of Norse Mythology at The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge City. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning the creation of the mask he tries to get it but Dr. Newman sees him and tells him not to touch the mask display, and when Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's imprisonment, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief, who has come down to Earth from Asgard to get his mask back. The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry mythologcall god. Loki takes his mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask's stand and fakliy shoots some security guards and puts them into a hole before storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage and the rest of the charming cast and all the acting from all the actors in The Son Of The Mask is fun and stylish.\r\n\r\nDirection: The Son Of The Mask is the second movie my mom, my little brother and I have seen that was directed by Lawrence Guterman. Director Lawrence Guterman direction as the director of The Son Of The Mask is creative and spectacular.\r\n\r\nVisuals: The special effects and visual effects of The Son Of The Mask were once again created and added by the special effects and the visual effects animators experts at Industrial Light & Magic. The special effects and the visual effects in The Son Of The Mask are terrific and amazing. Movie composer Randy Elderman creates some wonderful and charming music and I really liked the message in The Son Of The Mask which is \"Tim learning how to be a good father and inproving his reationship with his infant son\". What a sweet and heartwarming message.\r\n\r\nOverall: As it truns out my mom, my little brother and I all liked The Son Of The Mask, my paraprofessional from Elementary School and her 14 year old teenage son thought The Son Of The Mask was a corny comedy movie. I thought The Son Of The Mask was a fantastic, delightful, very funny and entertaning comedy movie sequel. So if fans of The Mask give The Son Of The Mask a chance and accept all the diffennces that The Son Of The Mask has from The Mask I think they will like The Son Of The Mask as well. The Son Of The Mask is the number 1 comedy movie sequel of the early spring time of 2005 and the year of 2005. The Son Of The Mask is a B+ memorable 4 stars excellent  comedy movie sequel. I give The Son Of The Mask two thumbs up and the score of 82 out of 100 and I hope you enjoy The Son Of The Mask.\r\n\r\n\"The Son Of The Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language and The Son Of The Mask is 1 hour and 26 mintutes long\".\r\n\r\nMy movie review of The Son Of The Mask is being dedicated to the memory of Jance Kaskin. Jance Kaskin was one of the excectives at New Line Cinema who movie screenplay writter Lance Khazel pitiched the story of The Son Of The Mask to and she just imedatily got it and then she sadily died and passed away mid screen during The Son Of The Mask. May Jance Kaskin rest in peace and thank you and God bless you Jance Kaskin.",

Well....you would get a very bad movie. Son of the mask is WORSE!!!!!\r\n\r\nI have no idea why I checked this film out, even though I got it for free there was nothing positive I can take out of this experience. The first Mask has always been a classic and good entertainment. One of my favorite Jim Carrey films but Son of The Mask makes the first one look like Gone with the Wind in comparison.\r\n\r\nThis movie is painful, stupid, boring and of course unfunny on every level. But all those words aren't enough to express my feeling about this train wreck. I started feeling bad for the director and started wondering about the humor he possesses.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy looked like he enjoyed himself making this film. J.K is a funny guy but his selection of comedies worries me very much. It's also very sad to see names like Bob Hoskins, Alan Cumming, Kal Penn and Steven Wright on this film. I hope they got paid well for there parts because they didn't get any praise for it.\r\n\r\nThe V.E are okay and they try to be in style with cartoons but otherwise they suck. The little kid is sometimes so fake that he looks like something Polar Express denied from their films. I don't want to put more of my time analyzing this film so I am just going to sum it up.\r\n\r\n1/10 - IT SUCKS!",

        {
            "content": "Son Of The Mask is a film nobody wanted, which perhaps explains why it's so eager to please. All director Lawrence Guterman wants is to make you laugh (and if possible, forgive him), but he tries too hard. His film strains so badly to be zany and funny that it comes across merely as flailing, hysterical desperation. This film needs a slap.\r\n\r\nSo, after the events of the original Mask film - we don't know how much time has passed, although presumably not a lot - the troublesome mask ends up in the possession of Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy), an immature animator with a broody young wife and a dog for a best friend. He goes to a Halloween work party, and of course, puts on the mask. The resulting transformation of Jamie Kennedy into Jamie Kennedy acting-like-a-smug-moron is an amazing mixture of misjudged, annoying and utterly unfunny. Avery/Mask performs a horrifying rap rendition of Can't Take My Eyes Off You, that I lamentably can't scrape out of my memories. He somehow impresses everyone to the extent that his boss, an animation mogul, gives him that show he's been dreaming of, provided it features the green character at the party. (What, the hideously unfunny and irritating green character?) Avery/Mask rushes home and sleeps with his wife, with the mask still on, and she gets pregnant. How lovely.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Loki (Alan Cumming), the Norse God whose mask it is, is on Earth trying to get his mask back. This means a lot of scenes of the apparently certifiable Alan Cumming adopting bad costumes and even worse accents while he checks to see if any newborn babies have Mask powers. These scenes are annoying, of course, but nothing compared to what's going on back at the Avery household.\r\n\r\nPoor Tim has been left alone with the baby, Alvy, who hates his Dad and wants to drive him insane. He does this by bursting into song and performing general CGI shenanigans. (He's inspired by that old cartoon with the singing frog, which is in Son Of The Mask just long enough to make us wish we were watching back-to-back Looney Tunes instead.) I was stunned to see Industrial Light & Magic credited at the end, because the special effects here, along with everywhere else in the film, look shoddy and unfinished. But the baby in particular is an awe-inspiringly awful creation, almost as misjudged and horrible to behold as Avery/Mask. Unsettling to look at, unfunny to watch, it's a case of writer and director making as much noise and movement as possible to distract from the absence of jokes. What were they thinking? When Tim's dog gets the mask - which, ignoring the logic of Film #1, stays on during the day-time - both dog and baby start trying to kill each other. These scenes at least have a near Looney Tunes rhythm about them, and there are several genuinely amusing little comedy footnotes here. I think of them as joke shrapnel.\r\n\r\nWith direction like this, however, you may miss them. Guterman has the camera constantly zooming and swooping around, obviously trying to make all of this as Zany And Funny as possible. It's wretchedly unpleasant to look at - seriously, how often do we need to see up Jamie Kennedy's nostrils? - and it's part of the film's big problem. In The Mask, Jim Carrey's green-faced demon is funny because he's juxtaposed against a normal(ish) world. The contrast of cartoon comedy and noiry crime is what makes it work. Here, however, everyone and everything seems to have some sort of hysterical cartoon logic, and it sucks the humour out of each cartoony sequence. By the end, four characters have used superpowers. The thrill has very much gone by then. It's just too much.\r\n\r\nAt least there's some kind of emotional story going on here. Tim is coming to terms with being a father, Alvy is coming to terms with having a father, and Loki is trying to get attention from Odin, who much prefers his other sons. In theory, this is good stuff. But the characters are written and acted so badly, I don't care about any of them. I hope Tim sells that thing to a laboratory and then gets a real job, and I couldn't give two hoots if Odin reduces his own nauseating offspring to charcoal.\r\n\r\nAside from the aforementioned joke shrapnel, there's nothing to recommend. Kennedy has played likeable and funny characters before, so why does he miss the mark so badly here? Cumming struggles with his American accent, as does Bob Hoskins (bafflingly cast as Odin), and his scenes suffer from just not being as funny as the filmmakers think. The actors, in general, look like they want to get out of here. (And who can blame them?) The plot is loose and forgetful, the jokes either bodily function or CGI-based, and the whole thing seems to have no grasp whatsoever of what's funny. Son Of The Mask is often repulsive, always annoying, and of course, it's totally pointless, since it's a sequel that makes no substantial link to its predecessor. The only honest-to-God good bits are the old cartoons characters sometimes watch. In comparison to that pitch-perfect short about the singing frog, Son Of The Mask could have been written and acted by drunken five-year-olds. \r\n\r\nIt's the kind of cinematic nightmare that sinks careers. The equivalent of poking yourself in the eyes for ninety minutes, I can think of no reason for you to watch this, other than the fact that, by the law of averages, even worse films probably exist in the world.",

And maybe because I had \"still lower\" expectations after reading the imdb ratings (its rated the 46th worst movie according to ratings).. \nI don't even know why I started watching the movie.. It was a disaster alrite.. Even the baby wasn't cute, and that's new! The acting sucked and sucked so much that I thought 'll get sucked into the screen.. Seemed to me the main guy (whatever his freaking name is), might not even have acted in a school drama, well at least wouldn't have been worthy of acting in one.. The story was horribly written, the FX was awful.. I can't absolutely actually give u any positives.. Initially I thought 'd somehow watch it completely, but I think I ended up finishing the movie in about 50 mins.. \nTrust me, you got better things to do in life..",

There's one scene where Jamie Kennedy enters the VIP-type club, and the guy asks for ID, he takes out an IV. And the voice was not the one I heard from the commercial where I heard Jamie's almost normal voice, where in the movie - its chessy and very fake. The scene after that, I watched numbingly and thought to myself, \"was the director wasted during this scene?\". I sat throught the whole movie because I like movies in general, plus I paid for it, this, honestly was a waste of time when I think about. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, exect those who like experiments. Thumbs way down.",

Son of the Mask is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the worst sequels of the decade. This movie may just mock Jim Carrey's absence and it nearly failed every minute of it. I love the original Mask where Carrey plays a talkable Frank Sinatra or Don Corleone-like character that likes to have fun and cause so much trouble. That was one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies of all time. I certainly don't know and don't care who casts a sequel to The Mask. Jamie Kennedy, he's a great actor from the Scream movies and Malibu's Most Wanted as a white rapper that sorta look like Eminem. But playing the lead role in Son of The Mask just made a terrible example of how stupid a director should be putting this from a good-old fashion PG-13 movie for adults to bringing a family-friendly kiddie version that is still unwatchable. Maybe it's time for a reboot. Maybe it's about time we need Jim Carrey to bring back the Mask, the type of role that made him a comedic megastar just like Ace Ventura and so on.",

What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.Let me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clich\u00e9d and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.The special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.All in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Even by thoseThe law of diminishing returns dictates that sequels to bad movies are the worst movies of all, because the producers are not only working to rebottle the original non-magic, they're inevitably doomed to come up short. Even by those standards, Son Of The Mask is more handicapped than most, since 1994's The Mask was a vehicle tailored to the specific talents of rubber-faced fartsmith Jim Carrey, who's wisely keeping his distance. But as with Dumb And Dumberer, another sequel to a Carrey hit minus its principal cast, New Line owns the property and has retooled it for the thumb-sucking set, so parents are advised to bust out the emergency Ritalin. It's hard to believe that beings as young and delicate as children are the target audience for such a frantic, retina-searing assault on the senses, but as pure visceral experience, Son Of The Mask borders on the experimental.\r Ally McBeal fans may want to stick around, though, because their beloved creepy computer-animated dancing baby is back, even in the ultrasound. The spawn of the title comes about when lowly cartoonist Jamie Kennedy discovers the fabled mask in his back yard and wears it to an office Hollywood party, where he turns into a whirling mass of runaway egotism and lame improvisation. The wild night ends with him impregnating his baby-crazed wife Traylor Howard, but the child really belongs to Loki, the Norse god of mischief, who wants his mask back and will stop at nothing to get it. Played by Alan Cumming, who could stand to cool off on the wacky shtick, Loki dons various unfunny disguises in pursuit of the baby while Kennedy tries to play father to an infant whose special qualities include speaking in a lucid adult voice, bouncing off the ceiling, and spraying a geyser of urine into Dad's face.\r Though his roots in sketch comedy (TV's The Jamie Kennedy Experiment) make him a natural C-list successor to Carrey, Kennedy mostly occupies the sidelines while his scrappy mutt Otis and the Elasti-baby chase each other around the house. The Scooby-Doo movies are a lesson on the perils of CGI pooches, but nothing is more chilling than a computer-enhanced infant enunciating, sprinting, or doing the Electric Slide. (The worst moment is when the baby first converts from a flesh-and-blood child to a CGI puppet\u2014it's as if his humanity has been cruelly stolen.) No doubt extensive market research shows that there's an audience out there for movies like Son Of The Mask, but it's too depressing to speculate who that might be.",

It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way, or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past.
