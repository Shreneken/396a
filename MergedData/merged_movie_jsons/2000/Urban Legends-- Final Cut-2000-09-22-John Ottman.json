            "content": "\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a sequel to the 1998 slasher movie \"Urban Legend\". The sequel concerns a group of college coeds, primarily lead by aspiring film director Amy Mayfield. Amy is trying to direct a horror film for her latest project, and is striving to be awarded the Hitchock Award from her school. She introduces the idea of a horror film based on urban legends, but after the crew of filmmakers begin to shoot their project, cast and crew members begin to disappear one by one. The more of the film that is shot, the more students begin to die. Who is responsible for the killing? Could it be Travis' twin brother Trevor? Or could it be someone else? Who knows? Who cares?The original \"Urban Legend\" wasn't Oscar worthy but it had a semi-original story, some horror clich\u00e9s tossed in. But for the most part, it was a decent slasher film. This follow-up is nowhere near the first film. The story was somewhat weak, and it was as clich\u00e9d as could be - bumps in the dark, eerie shadows, a misrepresenting interlude, and a killer who can appear out of thin air. The ending wasn't as shocking as the filmmakers were expecting it to be, and the little sequence before the credits roll tied this film to the original, but for what purpose? Reese, the female campus security cop from the original, returns in this film as the a new security guard on this campus, and does give a few laughs with her \"Foxy Brown\" imitations. The Amy character, our leading woman, does make some smart moves in the film, but all of the others make dumb decisions that cost them their lives. The scene that stood out the most of the whole film was the infamous \"kidney\" scene, which was actually pretty well constructed and was disgusting enough. Overall, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" isn't anything great. The story wasn't anything we haven't seen before, it's your basic \"find out who the killer is\" horror movie. It serves well as a gory slasher flick, but there is nothing new that it has to offer and very little surprises at all. Put all that aside, fans of the first movie may want to check this out. But, while the original wasn't great, I can confidently say it was better than the sequel. 5/10.",

            "content": "I'm just a sucker for a slasher! No matter how bad they are I usually enjoy them all even \"Halloween: Resurrection\" was quite entertaining in my book, although not needed one bit! \"Urban Legends\" was another slasher I enjoyed and although I know it's nothing special, it's certainly no \"Scream\", \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" tries to enter the \"Scream\" franchise but just simply doesn't have the same balls \"Scream\" has.Nevertheless it was entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable! It starts out a little bit like Wes Craven's \"New Nightmare\" being set on a film set, (also like \"Scream 3\"). If you have seen \"Urban Legends\" then you basically have seen \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" because it's more of the same stalk and slash, only this time not all the kills are off-screen! (That really annoyed me in the first one!) It follows the same formula on the set of a top film college. Everyones trying to win the \"Hitcock prize\" by making low-budget crap and a Kirsten Dunst look-a-like (the real one was too expensive) is going to make a film about a killer basing his murders on urban legends (de ja vu!) Only the film comes to life and someone is killing off her crew.That's the basic plot, it's simple and everyone can follow it. This is the type of film girls would watch after \"Twilight\" on a sleepover thinking its a really adult, extreme horror film after being mildly scared by \"Twilight\". That means that for the rest of us, the scares are minimal and the action is just enjoyable instead of heart-stopping! However, what I did like was the way it used humour.It was really funny in some places and the black security guard was a hoot baby! So you can't say that this film wasn't fun. What was also fantastic was the ending! I thought I was being very clever in sussing out who the killer was but it took me completely by surprise! \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a wannabee \"Scream\" for a more miniature audience (i.e. 12+) it tries to be clever and sometimes it is but it is fun throughout and never dull. Just don't expect an out-of-this-world slasher because you simply aren't going to get it. If you're not expecting much then give it a try. I really enjoyed it.",

            "review_title": "Yes! Finally some quality cinema from the teen slasher genre! You see, it seems that someone has taken their love of scary movies one step too \u0096 HEY!!",
            "content": "(spoilers) In a time when teenage slasher mystery thrillers are in tremendous overabundance, the sequel to the fairly entertaining Urban Legend is fortunately not a complete failure. I watched Urban Legends: Final Cut with very low expectations, which were the result of having heard that the movie was terrible, as well as my growing belief that a quality film in this genre, especially a sequel, will probably never be created again. The magic of the movies can only go so far. However, I was surprised to find that this particular sequel did have its redeeming values, despite the fact that it has the same old Scooby Doo ending, with the killer finally revealing himself and basically saying that he would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those pesky kids. The film starts off on the set of a cheesy movie, which seems to take place during a drunken college party on an AIRPLANE (hence, `cheesy' movie). Luckily, this is revealed to be a movie within a movie, so it didn't really take away from the film as a whole, but Urban Legends: Final Cut definitely had its share of stupidity. The security guard, for example, who we remember from the first film, sure didn't seem to have learned anything from her past experiences. Not only do we find her dancing to Pam Grier films while HORROR movies are being made (the perfect setting for a murder to take place) but she also does she not believe the girl when she tells her that she saw a murder. And don't even get me started on the killer. Until the killer is revealed at the end, he is exactly the same as the now-boring killers in countless other rip-off films \u0096 everything from I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago to all of the Scream films, all of which `borrowed' this idea from John Carpenter's horror classic, Halloween. Seeing how Halloween was released about 23 years ago and has been ripped off in record numbers, I think that it's about time to come up with some different kind of villain. 007 movies always have these cool bad guys, but the teen thriller genre always recycles the now boring \u0091guy in the mask' routine. \nI didn't hate Urban Legends: Final Cut because there really were a few scenes in the film that actually worked. For example, the scene when all of the students were watching the rushes and they saw the blonde girl's murder was actually pretty effective, in my opinion. Also, the scene with the bathtub full of ice worked pretty well, despite its lack of originality. But despite the unoriginal bathtub, the removed kidney was also pretty good, and this even evokes a painful reaction from the audience as the killer yanks her back in through the window by grabbing onto the freshly sewn wound through which the kidney was removed. OUCH.There was a lot of cheesy stuff in this movie, besides the tired inclusion of the mysterious killer. Much of the garbage is dumbly thrown into the dialogue in a number of wildly idiotic and clich\u00e9d lines \u0096 `This is my baby, baby.' `I won't let anything happen to you. I'll be there.' But the story was actually pretty good, at least some of it was. The twin brother for example, keeps the audience guessing more than the killer does, because by this point, anything else will command more interest than the old who's-the-killer mystery. It turns out that he was telling the truth, but for much of the film after his introduction, it is never really certain whether the twin was really a twin, or if he was the same guy, in which case he would probably be the killer. The end of the film is punctuated by a very welcome cameo from Rebecca Gayheart, who should have played a substantial role in this film, given the way that the original film ended. This obviously wasn't done because everyone would know right away who the killer was, but there seems to be a rough transition between the two films because of this. All in all, Urban Legends: Final Cut is worth the time, but it is still not as good as the original, which was also not even that great. But don't be put off by low expectations, it's not THAT bad.",

            "content": "A lot of people seem to hate this flick URBAN LEGENDS:FINAL CUT, but I don't. It's an interesting, solid sequel to the original URBAN LEGEND, a nifty whodunit/slasher/horror flick w/ the twist of the killer dispatching his victims based on urban legends. Interestingly, this 'sequel' really has no connection to the first except for the re-appearance of one of the characters from the original who survived the killings. This might be where this sequel partially screws up. There is a contingent that believes the original flick was really just an urban legend wrapped within an urban legend as the ending might imply. By having one of the characters from the first one in this one, it makes it seem as though the stuff in the first one really did happen making it just a standard horror flick.In any event, FINAL CUT is very watchable IMHO. The main thing it has going for it is the tip of the hat to Alfred Hitchcock in it's tone, presentation, and references. The film is set at a film institute where students aspire to be filmmakers (directors, writers, actors, editors, camera operators, etc.) and the prize they are all trying to win is the aptly named 'Hitchcock Award'. The front-running student is Travis Stark (played by Matthew Davis), but upon getting a grade of C on his final project, he apparently commits suicide thinking his career as a filmmaker will never get off the ground.The lead character is Amy Mayfield (fresh, young Jennifer Morrison), whose father was a famous filmmaker. Amy has a lot to live up to and feels the weight of her dad's fame. She is a very likable, identifiable character which I found refreshing. She really keeps you involved. Similar to the first film, all these killings are occurring, but only Amy believes they are happening. EVERYONE else seems to have a logical explanation for it, as in the first one. But this sequel, to me, does good job of combining those Hitchcock elements of involving the audience in the story as well as the fear of the unknown; there's actually a scene in the film where a bunch of students are watching film of a girl die, not realizing that she was really being murdered; this scene is really good. Then there are the direct homages to Hitchcock w/ scenes reminiscent of some of his most famous films (THE BIRDS, VERTIGO, PSYCHO, etc.).I also really like Amy's film crew and group of friends, who are very funny and engaging. They include Graham (Joey Lawrence), Vanessa (Eva Mendes), Toby (Anson Mount), Stan (Anthony Anderson), Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), and Simon (Marco Hoffschneider). They all seem like a tight-knit group and the acting in this film is much better than in many such type films. Not the greatest horror flick, but not even close to the worst. I recommend it.",

            "content": "Amy is in her second year of her film studies course at Alpine University and is still wondering about what her student film should be about. She decides to make a short horror film where a killer offs his victims in the style of urban myths. Despite the fact that a major Hollywood had been done on this subject less than two years before, her teachers give her the go ahead, compare her to Hitchcock and her friends are all enthusiastic. However as she attempts to shoot her various scenes, somebody is really killing people in that style and hiding their bodies; but can Amy stay alive long enough to convince other people that it's really happening? Given that the first film just gave up on its connections to urban myths I suppose I should at least praise this film for having a script that works out how to keep the material at least semi-related to the title/concept. However that is pretty much the only praise I will give to it because it is just a standard slasher movie \u0096 they all have a hook (a gimmick or, in the case of \"I know What You Did etc\", literally a hook), sexy girls, buff boys, red herrings and lots of gore. So if that is all you want then this average film should just about do you. The plot isn't much cop and it is pretty much a case of counting the cast members alive to work out how long is left, but it is passable for this sort of film. Of course it is only OK if you ignore what it could have done. It could have said so much and taken a sly look at violence in movies; for example the bit where they watch a film of a girl getting killed and enjoy it; that could have been a clever question to the audience but it didn't do anything of the sort. Of course what I did like were some clever in-jokes and confused film realities that served to provide another level to distract me from the poor main \u0096 this is occasionally subtle but also works when it is blunt (ie Gayheart's cameo).Some of the stuff is actually quite thrilling and the film has a good atmosphere considering it is just a slasher movie. It does have some good ideas as well and I did thing the Mexican standoff at the end was a nice touch. The cast are par for the course at best. Morrison is a typically bland blonde and didn't do anything special with her lead role \u0096 she isn't awful but she is nothing special. The rest of the cast just go through the motions, acting suspicious, scared or sexy as required \u0096 the sight of Anderson terrified me but happily he had little time, however it is simply cruel to cast Eva Mendes as a flirtatious lesbian but then only give her a small amount of screen time! Overall this is a standard slasher movie but it works better than the original film because it actually sticks to the concept as well as having some nice self-awareness and film within a film sort of stuff that is distracting from what is really a red-herring laden, twisty plot that could have come from any slasher film. The cast are pretty average but some of it is quite exciting if you get into it and, while it is an average film in a generally poor genre, it is not a bad film.",

            "content": "URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSSeveral film students at an isolated university campus are targeted by a serial killer who patterns his/her crimes after various urban legends.John Ottman's unnecessary sequel is a disastrous jumble of humor and horror which isn't nearly as funny or frightening as the filmmakers might have hoped, and the visual references to various classic movies (most notably the VERTIGO-inspired climax) seem entirely superfluous. Most of the murders are routine, except for a grisly decapitation inspired by a similar sequence in Dario Argento's INFERNO (1980), but the rest of the movie adheres strictly to formula, as a masked killer strives to frame weak-willed heroine Jennifer Morrison for a series of brutal crimes. Only two of the characters from the original URBAN LEGEND (1998) have been retained: Loretta Devine as the campus security guard whose aspirations toward COFFY-style bravery are finally realized during a climactic confrontation with the killer, when he/she makes the mistake of trying to punch her out (Devine retaliates with the best line of dialogue in the entire movie!), and Rebecca Gayheart in an unbilled cameo which should raise a smile amongst devotees of the original film.The supporting cast is handsome but interchangeable, including Matthew Davis (TIGERLAND) as Morrison's potential love interest, Jessica Cauffiel (VALENTINE) as a dizzy would-be actress whose final sequence resembles one of the more famous set-pieces from PEEPING TOM (1959), Eva Mendes (ONCE UPON A TIME IN Mexico) as a statuesque lesbian beauty whose fondness for Morrison lands her in a whole heap of trouble, and Hart Bochner (APARTMENT ZERO, SUPERGIRL) as an unlikely college professor. Production values are polished, but the movie amounts to little more than an uninspired rehash, and represents an inauspicious debut for former composer/editor Ottman (THE USUAL SUSPECTS).

Other killings are very unoriginal and lame (killing with knife, electricity and so on). There are many suspects, everyone has their own reason for killing. Or at least they all look suspicious. BUT the true killer is shown only a few minutes in the movie- he is a mad professor with idiotic reasons for killing. Now when I think about it, the whole story can be filmed in 5 minutes. The characters aren't related and the events aren't related. A girl shoots a movie, her friends are killed, a twin brother shows up and the killer is beated.This movie made me very angry.

            "content": "Spoilers herein.We've had four slasher films in a year which use the plot device of a film within a film. Three are ordinary: `Cut,' `Scream 3,' and `Urban Legend: Final Cut.' One, the recent `Hamlet,' is different. This comment covers the three traditional slashers.Each of the three slashers uses the inside film as a device for a relatively sophisticated distance for humor: they try to scare using established formulae, but at the same time poking fun at the genre, the watchers and the scares themselves.Cut, Urban and Hamlet are by first-time directors: and incidentally the characters are film students. The lead in Urban is made up to look like Julia Stiles, the Ophelia in Hamlet. The lead in Cut is made up to look like Courtney Cox of Scream. Scream has the highest production values, Urban the lowest.Cut is the deepest self-referencially: the monster is brought into the real world by the film -- the magic is in the viewing, which makes the audience cocreators of horror. The monster is destroyed when the film is. Plus, Cut has Molly Ringwald playing Bette Midler. She probably knows she's being made fun of as a bag that once was fun, just like the genre.Urban is the most schoolish in the number of films it references cinematically. Lots of Hitchcock here, some too blatant to be honorable. It makes the most fun of the actors: the bogus film within is really bad and the film crew are bozos; but the `real' film is worth killing for, sort of a `D.O.A' plot.Scream has the dumbest story; Urban and Scream have scooby-doo plot ends: the bad guy in the costume really is just a bad guy in a costume and we get the detective-story-like explanation.Scream uses the film within poorly. It is just a place of work: the only clever device is that each `real' character has a pretend one. But this isn't used at all except for a brief shadowing of Gale Weathers. Wes Craven knows better. He used this same notion in the last Nightmare movie where he played himself writing the film. Pretty good actually.Urban uses the film within only by reference (along with all of the other films that are referenced). Instead, the use has more to do with the making of the film and the trappings of filmmaking -- except for the end where the film within merges with the `real' action.Cut uses the film within more creatively. By placing the real people in the action of the old film, thus bringing the killer of the old film to them.None of this stuff is scary any more. When you go, you go for fun. If you were only going to see only one of these 3 films, you should make it Cut.",

            "content": "\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is about as good or as bad as you'd expect it to be. A sequel to 1998's teen-slasher flick, \"Urban Legend,\" your enjoyment of this film is hinged solely on how you view the original. Personally, I felt the first movie was kind of flat and dull. Some interesting elements, but overall, not the best of the late 90's slasher craze. Enter \"Final Cut.\" This film, on the other hand, is a solid little slasher with a similar mindset to that of the 80's slasher era. It hardly has the smarmy, self-referential winks to the camera that it's peers in \"Scream\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" had and despite some flaws, is a fun way to burn a couple of hours.Directed by John Ottman \u0096 who is primarily known for his work as a composer \u0096 and featuring a surprisingly extensive cast that includes Hart Bochner, Eva Mendes, Anthony Anderson and Joseph \"Whoa!\" Lawrence, this legend revolves around a film school where students are competing for a prestigious award. The Hitchcock award, to be exact. When innocent Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) decides to make a movie loosely based on the events of the first film, her crew finds themselves slowly being picked off one by one by a killer sporting perhaps some of the most ridiculous garbs yet: a fencing mask and a black rubber slicker. As in the first, he uses a few classic urban legends to accommodate his dirty deeds, but like most villains in sequels, he gets lazy and some of his kills are just straight-forward and messy.Surprisingly grisly and gory (especially in the case of the first victim, who had no relevance to the rest of the film to begin with), \"Final Cut\" is more cheap fun than anything. Although Ottman puts on a good show, his references to Hitchcock himself hardly mean that there is any genuine suspense to be found here. Instead, like the movies it subtly pays homage to \u0096 such as \"Friday The 13th\" and \"My Bloody Valentine\" \u0096 this little sequel is simply a fun, down and dirty little romp that forgets it's a sequel and goes for the gusto. It's not an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination, but far less pretentious than other films of it's era, and certainly a mind-numbing good time for genre fans who aren't afraid to slum it a little bit with fare such as this. Fun to sit down with a beer and a pizza, nothing worth taking too seriously, and certainly better than the first flick.",

Jennifer Morrison plays the main protagonist who teams up with a student played by Matthew Davis to solve the murders. Loretta Devine returns as Reese, the security guard at the university. Other students are played by Jessica Cauffiel, Eva Mendes, Anthony Anderson, Michael Bacall, Marco Hofschneider, Joey Lawrence and Anson Mount. Hart Bochner is on hand as a professor.While this is the sequel to 1998's \"Urban Legend,\" Reese is the only character that returns (with another surprise re-appearance). Like the first film, this one takes place at a NE university and involves a killer who imitates various urban legends. The big difference is the focus on a group of film school students and their endeavors competing for a coveted film award that would open doors for future Hollywood success. This is the only movie I've seen that deals with film school and I found it interesting and even informative. Whereas this angle is original and the cast is good, the story's only fairly engaging. It's rarely horrifying and sometimes downright cartoony, although thankfully not as bad as the first film in this regard. The slasher's costume this time isn't a hooded parka, but rather a fencer's mask and hooded cloak (rolling my eyes).The cast is highlighted by the attractive Jennifer Morrison, who's just as good as Alicia Witt in the first movie and arguably better. Jessica Cauffiel is another highlight, but her role's too short. Unfortunately, Eva Mendes' obnoxious lesbian character detracts (Eva is fine but her character, as written, is unattractive, although she becomes less obnoxious as the story progresses). Almost the entire film takes place on an isolated university campus, shot at Trent University in Peterborough, Canada, NE of Toronto, which is where some scenes in the first film where shot. The exception is a long carnival sequence in the second act shot at a Toronto amusement park.I've watched \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" three times now and my appreciation has increased with each viewing. While the climax is cartoonish and overlong, like the first movie, the picture's worthwhile for the Scooby Doo-ish elements and the film school angle, plus the quality cast, particularly Jennifer Morrison and Marco Hofschneider.The film runs 97 minutes.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",

And no, the director or writer surely didn't want this scene to be a \"homage\" of sorts to FINAL EXAM. No one saw FINAL EXAM. So if URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT needed to rip-off a scene from FINAL EXAM, which was a rip-off of HALLOWEEN, well, imagine how BAD this movie is!!!!",

            "content": "As a former film student the setting for the film had some appeal. Film students after the coveted Hitchcock Award strive to make the film that will secure them a spot in Hollywood, just like the honored alumni before them. Unfortunately the power of greed has someone taking out the competition.It begins with an obvious film-within-a-film clich\u00e9 to introduce us to all the principal characters/victims of the film.  The cast, a slew of nobodies, lacks any true depth and continually stumbles through forced 21st dialogue. The only recognizable face, Joey Lawrence of Blossom fame, has matured in looks but not so much in talent.  In fact, the most entertaining parts of the film are when the killer `urbanizes' his victims making the viewer happy to see them go.The entire story is weak and too many standard horror movie conventions are tossed into the mix.  Bumps in the dark, shadows in the background and masked characters that appear out of nowhere are tired repeats of films in our past.  As expected, every character is given a reason to be the killer until the very next scene when they are exonerated because another character seems more deserving.With many veiled references to Alfred Hitchcock's films, the filmmakers may have thought they were honoring the great director but in reality the idea is so poorly done that they only come across as cheap rip-offs.  Stair climbing in a tower ala Vertigo and a weak wheelchair scene ala Rear Window are two that come to mind.The whole scary movie genre was given life by Scream and now it ought to be put out of its misery with one swift swing of the ax.2 1/2 out of 5",

One of the things it does well is that it really features a lot of suspenseful work at times as this makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a- movie trick to nice effect, since it features enough to make hard to distinguish one from the other including it's wonderful opening sequence that takes a while before realizing after the fact it's been faked, a sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies only for a strange cut-shot to play where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened where all but one thinking it to be shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and a later scene where a murder done during the recording of a scream- test loud enough to drown out the victim's own being great scenes. Even going away from that formula, there's some rather fun stalking here from the bathroom chase featuring the woman trying to escape from the killer out into the alleyway or a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool while an attack at a carnival ride hidden by the darkness and fog comes off rather nice as well. The final confrontation in the movie-set graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast with the true revelation and the different twists featured throughout make for a nice time here. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills, which along with the mask worn are the film's rather good parts. This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing has a lot of ways for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and a sex scene.",

            "content": "Urban Legends: Final Cut starts off on the right note just like the original. It doesn't have horror classic written all over it like the first one did when it began but it still starts off above average. However just like the orignal once the film begins to progress it slowly turns into another crappy slasher film.The premise uses the whole movie within a movie tie in that is quite frankly getting a bit tired. Our new heroine is trying to win the prestigious Hitchcock Award for her new film which is about a serial killer who kills his victims based on Urban Legends. however once murders begin to happen on the set it becomes much harder to seperate fact from fiction.What i Liked:The heroine in this film is far more engaging than the one from the first film. She gives an honest performance and despite a tepid script she holds her own.Very interesting to see Joey...no i mean Joseph Lawrence in this film. I joked about him being in it when i first heard about it but he was actually kinda good. In fact i wish he could've been in it more because he provides some pretty funny moments in the film.i liked how it wasn't just a slasher film. During certain moments it played like a thriller and for at least the majority of the film the whodunit aspect is quite engaging.i liked the use of seperating fact from fiction. That was a bit interesting. The scene where thry begin to watch Amy's reel and the killer switches it to the death he filmed was pretty intense.What i didn't Like:Where in the hell were the urban legend deaths. We got one and that was it. The one they has was pretty good but the film is called urban legend you would tihnk they would utilize that.The last half of the film is even more ludicrious than the one in the first film. i found my self dumbfounded that they actually were allowed to produce the last half of this film. what a disappointed.You can tell that we're running out of costumes for the killer to wear. The fencing mask and black apparel might seem frightening to some but all i kept thinking was the killer looks like a giant micro-phone.The acting, with the exception of two people, is so painfully bad. My two year old brother could even act circles around these people.This might not say much but at least this sequelis better than something like I Still Know What you did Last Summer. It barely sinks below the level of the original and i guess that says something. It's no film masterpiece but i tihnk fans of the first film may enjoy it.5/10",

The smart script by Scott Derrickson and Paul Harris Beckman offers several cool red herrings and affectionate homages to various 80's slasher flicks. The capable acting by the sturdy cast keeps this movie buzzing: Matthew Davis as nice guy Travis and his loyal twin brother Trevor, Hart Bochner as the friendly Professor Solomon, Joey Lawrence as the smarmy Graham Manning, Anson Mount as the arrogant and abusive Toby, Eva Mendes as brash lesbian Vanessa Valdeon, Jessica Cauffiel as ditsy actress Sandra, Anthony Anderson as the happy-go-lucky Stan, Michael Bacall as the jocular Dirk, and Marco Hofschneider as charming cinematographer Simon. Loretta Devine makes a welcome return from the original as sassy security guard Reese. Brian Pearson's glossy widescreen cinematography provides a neat polished look.

            "content": "What was John Ottman thinking when he made this film? Did he actually believe this would be a good movie? This is nothing but your stereotypical slasher film (AGAIN), where another masked killer is off killing college students. I'm tired of these kinds of films. It's the same thing all the time, either with high school students or college students. Hollywood needs to come up with some original stuff for a change.Anyway back to the movie. It starts off on a set of a film in the making and the cast gets introduced into the picture. The killing really doesn't start 'till about 15 or so minutes into the film. The plot itself is so stupid because the only reason they can explain why the person is killing people off is because of some Hitchcock award. What the heck? It's not like if I don't win some award that I'm gonna start killing people off.Another thing that kinda makes no sense is that there's only one cop in the whole college campus. I mean are we to believe that this is some super cop that needs no partner? A modern day superman? I would think that after the first two deaths or so that they'd get enough sense to bring in another officer, but nooooooo. So many plot holes, so little time to bash them.Also, what's with all these stupid masks that's been in these slasher films recently? First we get a ghostface (the best by far), then an oversized raincoat, then a giant snowjacket, and then there's this fencing mask. I'm sure there's more, but that's all I can think of right now. I mean if a killer really wanted to conceal his identity that he'd kill the people off then get the heck out of the city, but no he chooses to hang around until someone figures him out. I'd like to see one slasher where the guy wears some sort of wicked facepaint instead of a stupid jacket or a ridicules mask.Well anyway, the only thing really bad about this film is what's the most important of all, and that's the plot. It was just too overdone and predictable. There weren't even any good scares. I wouldn't be surprised if they made another sequel to this though. Maybe this time the killer will be someone's half brother or great uncle or maybe even the neighborhood kid who constantly stairs out the window.  Geez.",

            "content": "Urban Legends: Final Cut is set in the Alpine University film school in Los Angeles where student Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) is about to make a film in a bid to win the much coveted Hitchcock award, she rounds a few friends up & begins production on a slasher film about a killer who uses urban legends to dispatch his victims. At first things go alright but that changes when Amy discovers a security tape that shows her DP Simon (Marco Hofschneider) have his head bashed in with one of his own camera lens, unfortunately the tape disappears & no-one will believe her when she says she's next on the killers hit list...This Canadian American co-production was co-edited, co-scored & directed by John Ottman & despite it's bad reputation I will both freely & proudly admit that I really rather liked Urban Legends: Final Cut as one of the better recent slashers out there. The script by Paul Harris Boardman & Scott Derrickson is actually quite cheeky, quite bright & manages to just about distinguish itself enough from the original Urban Legends (1998), it moves along at a really good pace & it certainly never became boring neither did it drag. At heart it's basically a teenage slasher much in the same vein as Scream (1996) & it's imitators but I think there's enough here in Urban Legends: Final Cut to entertain in it's own right & it ended up being a lot better than I had expected, the character's & dialogue are much better than usual, I liked the way the story is based around a film school & there are a few nice ideas here like the Peeping Tom (1960) style murder of Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel) as the killer films her death from his point-of-view & the Twilight Zone (1982) homage at the very start. Then there's the Hitchcock award, I like to think that the name was knowingly picked to deliberately poke a bit of fun at the film itself. Then there's the outlandish ending which I thought was great & showed a knowing sense of humour, on the negative side the kills could have been a bit gorier, I could have done without the fat comic relief cop & the final twist at the end is a bit too silly to be taken seriously.Director Ottman does a good job here & the film looks pretty stylish with some cool lighting & cinematography, again much better than I was expecting. It's not really scary & I suppose it could just as easily be classed as a thriller as opposed to horror as it's a bit light in the gore department, there's a great kill where a woman wakes up to discover she has had her kidney removed & in her attempts to escape gets her head cut off with a broken window pane guillotine style. Unfortunately that's where it stops & the rest of the kills are rather tame & unimaginative & upon further investigation it seems that that decapitation sequence was shot months after the rest of the film had finished shooting as it was felt there needed to be another murder & it also explains why no-one ever mentions this murder or the character who gets murdered.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 I thought Urban Legends: Final Cut looked good, had decent special effects & good production values throughout. The acting was OK although that fat cop was annoying...Urban Legends: Final Cut turned out much, much better than I had anticipated & I'd even go as far as saying I rather liked it for what it was. It seems to have a lot of bad press so maybe I'm just mad but I reckon you could do a lot worse than this, I really do... Followed by a further sequel the straight-to-video Urban Legends: Bloody Mary (2005).",

Are you satisfied that my sanity is running low on gas due to poisoning pop-culture?Anyways...Meet Amy Mayfield; a pretty intelligent film-student at university. She's struggling to complete a thesis project that is based on urban legends. Years ago, an urban legend of the campus said that students were being killed off so that someone could win the \"Hitchcock prize\", a extremely prestigious reward that basically guarantees the winner of directing in Hollywood. From what she can guess, Amy has a good shot at receiving it. When her film crew begins to die from \"accidents\" and her friend Travis takes his life when he gets a terrible grade on his film project, Amy is on the hunt for the killer. However, Travis' identical twin brother Trevor, (oh dear lord) tells her that he diddn't take his life. He was murdered. It's now up to Amy and well, only Amy to find out who the killer is before she becomes an urban legend too.OK first off. Trevor is a HORRIBLE body guard. In the film, he told Amy that he wouldn't let anything happen to her. But whenever poor Amy gets into trouble like being chased through a theme park ride, or finding her friends horribly mutilated and electrocuted, or being locked up in a closet with decaying bodys, Trevor's excuse is \"Sorry\". Sorry? For crying out loud, Trevor! If I was Amy, I'd give him the biggest slap on the face he'd ever have in his life.Second: The acting. Okay, okay, I know I'm being harsh here for a horror film but the acting was flat out God-awful. There were times when I thought it was a joke, especially the final fight scenes. Never mind university projects. The acting looks like it came from a High School project.What bugs me the most is that only one of the students dies from an urban legend that I've heard of and believe me, I've heard them all. She dies from a nasty decapitation after she wakes up in a tub of ice and realizes one of her kidney is missing. Judging from the movie this actress was in, I'm surprised it wasn't her brain.Urban Legends is a classic hit-and-miss film. There are many jumps and mysteries, but not a single surprise.",

In place of Freddy Krueger himself Robert Englund we have Hart Bochner, who played that cocaine sniffing conductor of immense enmity Ellis in Die Hard. In place of Tara Reid we have a then unknown (but undeniably attractive) Eva Mendes (playing a lesbian of course). And in place of Alicia Witt we have Jennifer Morrison (who has played a Doctor on House since 2005). A decade later that's a good trade, but it wasn't in 2000 when this was made. And in place of a University campus, we have a film school.The story: film student Amy Mayfield goes to one of her lecturers with a great idea for a film: she wants to make a movie based on Urban Legends. No sooner has she started filming than everyone involved in the movie starts to get killed off. Adding to Amy's anxiety is the appearance of Travis Stark, twin brother of the recently deceased Trevor Stark, who is determined to prove that his brother didn't kill himself? Could the solution to both their problems be linked? Will they need to jump into bed together to find the answer? All these questions are answered by film's end. Sadly, for most of the audience, all these questions are answered before they've really been asked.The acting: isn't horrendous. THat's about all I can say. Mendes and Davis (who plays the Trevor/ Travis twin) are awkward in some scenes. Bochner and Morrison are actually pretty decent. Everyone else does what they are paid to do. On a side note, I never want to see Jessica Caulfiell in a movie again. Her worst scenes in this come in the first few minutes where she is purposely putting in a poor performance, but her voice and mannerisms. My goodness.The kills: the kills aren't bad to be honest. The kills and their reveals are a big strength of the movie and the main reason I think it's a little under rated. The resolution is nice, but most of what comes after hurts much of what came before.Overall: i'd say this is an average movie. Not good, not terrible. Enjoyable if in the right mood and certainly not offensive. Can't see where all the negativity comes from really.",

The film is carried by Morrison's gratifying performance, alongside Loretta Davis bringing comic relief to the film. Where the film succeeds is in its classiness as a horror picture, and director John Ottman has proven that he can successfully cross over from being, not only a gifted composer but also a respectable filmmaker. The film embraces the horror genre wholeheartedly and giving us a nail-biting, heart-jolting experience. Where I found the film fell short is the fact it's very keen on keeping the film (mostly) bloodless and a lot of the deaths happen off-screen or cut away just as it happens, although I think the film would've benefitted from more gore and brutality. Which is not something I would normally say. The end of the film wraps up reminiscent of an episode of \"Scooby-Doo\" with a nice nod to the original courtesy of Rebecca Gayheart. It's a fun watch.",

I was pleasantly surprised.The whole execution of the plot and the action seems to be a great deal more light-hearted and realistic. The photography and the setting looks very good on the big screen and the lead heroine is easy on the eye. She's way more talented and attractive than other scream queens. Not that I want to typecast her.The identity of the bad guy was a mystery all the way thru for me and the way John Ottman makes us point the finger at a number of different characters was done whole lot better and way more subtler than Wes Craven. And none of the characters were annoying or irritating as they normally are in this sub-genre. The humor was also spot-on. There wasn't much I didn't laugh at that I was supposed to and it didn't spoil the intense atmosphere. A certain joke in the mine was good enough for me annoy people with my loud laughing.They way the film was self-aware and in-jokey without becoming a parody was WAY more convincing and pleasing than any of the Scream movies. And the film students who refer to other movies and movie making was the kind of gimmick Scream 2 and Scream 3 could have benefited from if it were done properly.The presence of Joey Laurence just made a good movie even better. If you liked or hated the first I seriously do recommend this sequel to you as it way superior. The only gripe would be the lack of Chris Young's original score.",

I love watching horror movies, but I knew this wasn't going to be a \"horror\" movie, but rather a \"slasher flick\", and there is a difference between the two.  I saw the trailers and TV spots for the film and they looked decent, so I decided to pay the 6 bucks and watch it, well actually 12 since my girlfriend was with me.While watching the movie, I was wondering if it was 8:00 p.m. in a movie theater watching a slasher flick, or if it was Noon in my house watching a Soap Opera...The premise of the one guy getting his head blown off and his twin brother comes back secretly......come on, these screenwriters are not even trying!!!  Why not show the guy get his head blown off?  Why the twin brother?  Why make a sequel?  Why even call it Urban Legends?!I have to admit, watching the girl in the bath tub full of ice was a good \"Urban Legend killing\", but then afterwards all of the killings have NOTHING to do with urban legends.  Did they decide to have the sequel with the characters just making a movie ABOUT urban legends, but not have the actual movie about urban legends?  I would have rather watched the movie that the film student characters were making rather than Urban Legends: Final Cut!  This is just another victim of sequels being rushed.  And anyone who rates this over a 3 must not be watching very many movies.....Even my girlfriend, whose taste in movies are not wonderful, thought this movie was horrible!",

            "content": "The opening sequence of Urban Legend's final cut is a far cry from the first film. It begins a little clich\u00e9 and begins to turn goofy, real quickly. Luckily enough it is meant to be filmed this way, otherwise, my first impressions were leaning heavily towards a very negative, comedy vibe.Urban Legend Final Cut is a solid development compared to the first film. Its story makes a lot more sense, and the pieces come together nicely by the end of the story.The acting was also a huge improvement. I remember Jennifer Morission from House, so it was great to think that this was one of her first Hollywood feature films.Watching this movie as a young teenager, I can still recall the first murder scene of the kidney scene with the bathtub of ice. And how it haunted me for years. Watching it as an adult it is still extremely sadistic, and twisted and I can see why it had such a negative, and tormenting effect on me as a child.However, it is successful in trying to show something brutally new and creative. It makes you gasp, and cringe, and is right on the edge with its blood, and gore without pushing the boundaries too far.Seeing Brenda at the end of the film was a nice Easter Egg for fans of the first, and I enjoy it when sequels bring back old cast members because it makes you feel some nostalgia. Not to mention you can already relate to the characters, which adds layers of depth to the story.Urban Legend Final Cut is a movie that has its moments and makes them count such as the haunted tunnel ride, and of course that ruthless first murder scene.However, that's as brutal as this film gets, and it does have a lot more cheesy moments than the first installment.Overall I must say even though it walks the same path as the Scream franchise. This is a great addition to the slasher genre, and this is a unique movie to have in your horror collection to revisit in many years.7/10.",

            "content": "Many reviewers have failed to mention that this time, the killer does not seem to have a weapon of choice. He just uses whatever's around. I liked Urban Legends because John Ottman, the director, seems to take the material more seriously. For instance, the scene where the killer sneaks up behind the German-French whatever cinematographer, we're wondering how that's possible for the guy not to notice, but then Amy looks at a video tape and we see how. IT's brilliant.Ottman and the screenwriters don't really expect us to believe what we've seen before, so they actually make most of these attacks believable and surprisingly unexpected. Of course, the only flaw in the film is the killer's identity. The motive was there, but I pretty much knew it was them from watching the trailer to the movie. Too bad I was right.The good things about this film are definitely the performances. Jennifer Morrison is surprisingly likeable as Amy Mayfield and definitely a strong and interesting character. At the end, i was expecting a switcharoo with one of the characters' actual identity, but he turns out to be who he says he is. And the last scene in the movie is absolutely brilliant.The script is above par, the performances are good, but the costume for the killer is off. I felt like the killer would be saying to his victims, \"slow down, i can't breathe in this thing.\" It seems so restricting of movement, and the killer seems so detached from the movie considering he wasn't involved in the opening attack. And the deaths aren't too interesting either.All in all, UL2 is just as fun as UL, but is actually more clever and has many more plot twists than its predecessor, and the heroine is actually stronger than Natalie Simon, the hero from the first. SHe was too winy, but not Amy. This is above average, and I may see it again.",

            "review_title": "Entirely predictable slasher sequel isn't a patch on the first",
            "content": "The sheer boringness of this movie hits me as I sit here and type out the lame, predictable plot. It's yet another predictable slasher fest which bears almost no resemblance to the first film, aside from a recurring character. Only one of the murders seems to actually have been based on an urban legend as well, so the ideas here are pretty loosely tied to the title. It seems to me that the recent frenzy for slasher films is on a downward spiral, what with this and the apparently awful SCREAM 3. Thankfully, I can't see much future in the genre as it now appears that all creativity and original ideas are completely dead... or so I hope. I just know that in all likelihood I'll be proved wrong.Starting off with an amusing reversal of the audience's expectations which I didn't see coming, we immediately meet a group of supremely untalented actors and actresses who do their best to be either funny/weird or generally menacing, in order that they become one of the film's many red herrings. Fans of mystery cinema would be well to give this film a wide berth, as the whodunit aspect is overplayed as always and it's one of those films where the killer turns out to be a minor character with absolutely LUDICROUS motivation. The ending, where the killer explains their reasons for doing what they do, had people groaning audibly in the cinema I was in as it was just so trite. And so it goes on.Aside from the group of nobody actors, where the acting skills range from passable to diabolical, and the clich\u00e9d plot and music, there's not really a lot else going on. Aside from one notable moment it's relatively gore-free too, although each of the different murders that occurs is particularly brutal in its own way, with characters getting bludgeoned repeatedly (with loud thunks on the soundtrack each time), painfully slashed with a straight-razor, or getting fried in electrics. Predictably the preferred method of weapon in the finale is the gun, which is another boring cop out.There are a heck of a lot of influences in this film to catch. The sole notable gore scene seems to have the same kind of style and progression as the deaths did in FINAL DESTINATION, while in a post-BLAIR WITCH PROJECT world the film manages to drag in some running around in the woods too. I have to admit that the producers did experiment with a lot of different effects, from having the characters watching a real-life snuff movie in the film while being blissfully unaware of what they're watching (a quite good moment, I have to admit) to an underground ghost train ride which has the potential of being quite good but is ruined by chopping editing and laughable action.This time the killer is predictably masked, with a fencing mask of all things. This may be the only original touch in the whole movie, the only thing that hasn't been done before. The characters are all severely grating and annoying, with some horrendous dialogue at some moments, where the script writers seem to be trying to make things as cheesy as they possibly can. I'm just sick and tired of these films with self-referential teens going on about previous films, with lots of in-jokes and \"we're so clever\" movie referencing. Just give it a rest.The film's highlight, and sole reason to watch, occurs at the beginning so at least you won't have long to wait before switching off. It's a murder scene based on the urban legend of waking up in a bath full of ice and missing your kidney. This has absolutely no connection to any of the characters or events in the rest of the film, but hey, it's pretty cool so I'll forgive them for that.",

            "content": "I came of age as a horror fan in the era of Scream knockoffs, so I have a real affection for the '90s slasher movie, even though I understand that by and large they were not very good. Urban Legends: Final Cut (yes, there are plural legends in the title this time; go big or go home) is not really an exception in that it's not good but in the best way.Since the original film exploited the college campus milieu, the sequel develops this one step further by settings its story at a film school. And not just any film school, but a wannabe filmmaker's wet dream of film school. I studied film at a liberal arts college and I'll go ahead and tell you that you don't get access to realistic airplane interiors worthy of a mid-budget Hollywood film. Student films are shot in dorm rooms, city alleys, or (if you're lucky) your dad's office building after hours. Also, so far as I know, there's no student award so prestigious it guarantees you a successful career in the industry; I mean, even directors of Oscar-nominated shorts are lucky to get a project funded a decade later.Anyway, the screenwriters take the opportunity to satirize liberal arts students, and do so with little imagination. Basically there's an acting student who is bad at acting and everybody else is just horny. If they wanted to poke fun at the pretentiousness of bearded dudes in their early 20s they would have had no shortage of material, but the characters in Final Cut are the same as any you'll find in a movie of this type, except every so often one of them quotes Fellini or something. Again, if you want verisimilitude, just have a bunch of stoners cut together unrelated images and justify it as an \"experimental\" film. I can't tell you how many \"experimental\" films I sat through in class. But everybody at the unnamed prestigious art school wants to make horror movies, apparently, with three-act structures and everything.Final Cut is a sloppy movie. None of it really makes sense, character motivations least of all. And be prepared for fake-outs galore--it was only a dream, it was only a movie, it was only a friend sneaking up and jumping at you. As with the first movie, the killer's plans only come off due to luck. At one point a victim successfully calls 911 on their cell phone but the dispatcher immediately dismisses her as a prankster. If you grew up on Fear Street books, this kind of stupidity is catnip.Final Notes (or Cuts, if you will):\n-The best part of the movie is the epilogue going into the credits. I wish we had gotten a sequel just to see how this relationship played out.\n-As with all '90s slashers, the production is so slick none of the violence really winds up being all that upsetting. The only legitimately creepy moment is in the relation of an urban legend, about a carnival's all-too-real \"haunted tunnel\" ride.\n-I give the filmmakers props for exploring the horror potential of a fencing mask to hide the killer's identity. Writing my own slasher novel in the late '90s, I myself settled on a motorcycle helmet.",

            "content": "John Ottman has proved that he is a skillful film-maker with Urban Legends: Final Cut. This film is better than the 1998 film Urban Legend. Jennifer Morrison turns in a wonderful performance as the heroin Amy Mayfield, a film student at Alpine University. I love this film! And no, I don't have an IQ of 3.4. Final Cut was written BEFORE Scream 3, but Dimension Films were in such a rush and went with whatever script Ehren Kruger threw at them. Final Cut is entertaining and shocking. This film does have some lame lines, I know that now, but it's not as bad as I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Why does everyone knock and ridicule Joey Lawrence? Just because he starred in Blossom does not mean he is a bad actor. I thought he turned in a decent performance in this film and so what if he is credited here as Joseph! I thought a fencing mask and a long black coat as the killer's costume was a very clever and well thought out idea. Some think that it is lame, but hey, it's a hell of a lot better than a woolly-hooded jacket. The killer was very freaky and reminded me of Mr. Ghostface from the 'Scream' trilogy. Some of the death sequences in Urban Legends does look a little fake, in particular Simon's death, but so what. You cant have it all! Reese, Amy and Vanessa are my favorite characters. I love Reese and am so glad that Loretta Devine decided to return. She was great in the first film, she's even better in this one.  John Ottman did a great job on this film, a great job. His direction, score and editing make this an entertaining ride into terror. Some scenes are genuinly frightening (the mine tunnel scene, ice bath-tub sequence) while others crack me up thanks to Ms. Devine! I actually thought that this was funnier than Scream, but Scream is a better movie. This is my fourth favorite teen thriller. Just behind the three Scream films.\nAnd in closing, this is not a perfect film (I think it is, but it clearly is not). But it is nowhere near as bad a 'critics' make it out to be. So until a user comment can truly prove to me that this film sucks, I will always love this creative, shockingly entertaining film. Keep up the good work John Ottman, a great underrated director who I look forward to seeing more of in the future.10/10(I am aware that I have already submitted a review on this film, but I felt I should write another one, now that I know the film better.

In \"Urban Legends\", the actors of a movie are killed one by one on the set by diverse methods of urban legends. We have plenty of gore and some memorable death scenes; being the decap of a girl the highlight of the movie. But who is behind the murders and why? Join the unfortunate actors in a survival Horror situation and find out what's the mystery behind the movie...The acting is good overall and I'm glad that most of these young actors act naturally and don't follow a standard. Sure, there are a lot of clich\u00e8s but it's a Slasher from the new millennium, so you can't ask for much.Anyways, I would recommend you to watch this movie only if it airs on cable or regular t.v.

            "content": "\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is the in-name-only sequel to \"Urban Legend\". It's just the same setup as the first one, a killer in a costume ends up killing college students, BUT, instead of the killer basing his murders on urban legends, he/she ends up doing the killing on a film set based on a story of urban legends. Not the same, which is good that it didn't copy the original movie's concept and went in a different direction.\nThe plot has a killer in a fencing mask and a black slicker (even worse than the parka! He/she looks like a walking microphone) knocking off students on a film set about urban legends at Alpine University. The film is being done by student Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) after hearing a story of the original murders by security guard Reese (Loretta Divine reprising her role from UL), who was fired from Pendleton after not agreeing to cover up the killings. That is the main jist of the plot.The acting is ok, there are many unknowns here, I didn't hear of any of them except for Hart Bochner (who was in \"Terror Train\" with Jamie Lee Curtis), Loretta Divine and Joey Lawrence. Jennifer Morrison is actually a strong lead and she isn't as wooden as Alicia Witt was, and the rest of the cast was ok, but the blonde girl who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag was hysterical!The murders were not exceptionally creative, except for the first one, that was just so gross it actually made me cringe. The killer was a surprise and there were some good chase scenes spread out. There was also a great cameo at the end which turned out to be the best part in the whole movie! Anyway, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a good flick, not that scary, but more suspenseful with some scares. Let's hope they'll put out a third UL film and make it a trilogy.",

Jennifer Morrison, a very likable actress, did a credible job as did the always divine Loretta Divine and it is always great to see Hart Bochner. Matthew Davis came off as comatose. There was one wonderful bit using prop guns and some good scenes of student film set-ups and effects done on the cheap. But overall, it was a not very long film that seemed longer than it should have; also, part of the plot resolution was more or less given away because of the casting (a common problem, but one more often observed on primetime TV).",

Also, I feel that the humour is far better in Urban Legends: Final Cut. I didn't like all the dirty sex jokes in the original. Urban Legends: Final Cut has some lame lines, but very few. Or at least what I can remember. So ignore the bad reviews and go and hire this movie. When it comes to horror movies/sequels, they only have to be entertaining to make me love them, some reviewers say that this film is a drag, I don't think so. I cant wait to see this flick again.

The acting is all fairly solid with a few up and coming faces that have managed to stick around for a while (Jennifer Morrison, Anthony Anderson, and Eva Mendes) and the entire film has a slight giallo feel more than a traditional slasher feel with its emphasis on the mystery and sleuthing. There's even a ridiculous twist involving a twin brother that feels like it came right out of a dime store Italian thriller.Loretta Devine shows back up as the only major returning cast member from the original film and, while she could have phoned it in, she manages to turn in an alive and enthusiastic performance that shouldn't be missed.Urban Legends: Final Cut might not be the scariest, goriest, or most surprising movie ever made, but there's more than enough to make it worthy of recommending.",

This is my second time commenting on Urban Legends, but I just hate the film so much I have to comment on it again. This film left so many questions in my head, like who would want the laborious task of making this film.First off lets start with the acting. Who in the blue hell are these people, and what are they doing in a horror movie? These people couldn't act nor run properly for that matter. I wouldn't trust these people to do my dishes because they probably couldn't do that right either.Next stop, the murders themselves. To be painfully honest, the first murder was adequate. But what happened after that. Using a f***ing wooden spoon would have brightened up the rest of the murders and made them more interesting. Using electricity and bludgeoning someone with a camera lenses is not horror movie material, no matter what you've been smoking. Someone obviously said yes to the scriptwriter to many times. The Good Lord gave you balls, people, it wouldn't hurt to use them once in a while.And now, my favourite. The patented killer costume. Jason (if he were dead) must be rolling in his grave. When I first saw the killers costume, I laughed till I cried. And then I felt sorry for the poor b****rd. What were they thinking of, giving the killer a fencing mask and a frock was ridiculous. They may as well have given him a priest collar to round it off. I've seen scarier looks on pimples. I suppose the biggest problem with the costume was that the fencing mask looked too tight against the slicker and didn't look scary at all. The killers motive was the worst I've ever heard.I think the films biggest flaw was that it didn't seem like a horror movie. Urban Legend may not have been great but at least it felt like a horror. The movie lacked everything and that's why I give it 1 out of 10.",

Straight to video \"Final Cut\" uses the same concept on a serial killer (donning a fencing mask) on campus using urban legends to dispatch students, but using a film within a film structure. However it lays it out in such a banal manner, still quite nasty delivering the shocks and twisty in its reveals. But it's moronic and generic as can be. At the time of its release the cast was virtually unknown with some just starting off, but now being quite well known. Loretta Devine (somewhat comic relief) is one of two to return from the original in a very unbelievable manner, while Rebecca Gayheart has a neat little reference to her original character. Jennifer Morrison is acceptable in the heroine role, with the likes of Mathew Davis, Eva Mendes, Anthony Anderson, Joseph Lawrence and Hart Bochner (who horror fans might remember in the 80s slasher \"Terror Train\"). The script really does like to throw about many movie references, which is never too distracting (\"Digital sucks. Latex rules.\") But it doesn't hide how contrived and silly it turns out to be. Not as clever as it thinks, when trying to blur the lines between reality and fantasy and the stalk and slash elements are very run-of- the-mill with little to no tension sustained.

However, the people who were murdered were either in the cast or just a crew member.Like Morrison, most of the cast are relatively not well-known with the exceptions of Joesph Lawrence, Hart Bochner, and Loretta Devine, who continues her role of Reese, the enjoyable Pam Grier-worshiping cop from the first movie.  Matthew Davis (\"Tigerland\") is excellent here as portraying twin brothers.The film does mark the directing debut of composer-editor John Ottman whose credits include Bryan Singer's first two films (the classic \"The Usual Suspects\" and th unknown \"Apt Pupil\").  I wonder if Ottman must have studied \"The Usual Suspects\" and lightly applied that film's unconvential and clever view onto this film.

Turkeys such as \"Scream 3\" and the Aussie slasher \"Cut\" regretfully proved already that this structure really doesn't work in horror films and, instead of creating suspense, the false scares really get on your nerves and unnecessarily prolong the dire film. Set a couple of yours after the murderous events in the first film, security guard Reese Wilson \u0096 now working at Alpine University \u0096 advises a talented female film student to revolve her final study project on a series of Urban Legend murders. Naturally, Amy Mayfield's cast and crew quickly starts getting bumped off for real. Crap movie with predictable twists and miserable red herrings, stereotypical characters and intolerably bloodless murder scenes. Ironically enough, the script repeatedly refers to classic horror titles and even mentions a prestigious Alfred Hitchcock Award for promising young filmmakers. There's absolutely nothing classic about the \"Urban Legend\" franchise. Lead actress Jennifer Morrison deserves far better roles than this, as well as several more great performances that are wasted in the supportive cast, such as Eva Mendes, Hart Bochner and Anthony Anderson.

            "content": "I was bored one day and was in the mood for a cheesie cut-em-up slasher flick, so I rented Urban Legend: Final Cut.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover how well it was done.  The movie centers around a film school and a cut throat (pardon the pun) competition for a prestigious award (\"The Hitchcock\").  One film student decides to make her film about a serial killer who bases his victims on Urban Legends, just like the plot of the first movie.  Eventually, an actual serial killer starts cutting down student after student, and the young film maker (Amy) is not sure what to do.  That's the basic plot, without giving anything away, though I'm sure other comments have told every plot detail without a care for the people reading them who don't want the end ruined.  Suffice it to say, it's an unexpected ending.     What I liked most about this movie was that it didn't try to be a sequel in the classical sense.  It used a similar theme, but did not incorporate any characters from the original Urban Legend, except for the Pam Grier fan of a security guard Reese.  Having a small link between the two films, but not making it a huge theme was a wise decision.  Most likely, none of the actors wanted to return for another installment and truthfully, a traditional sequel would have fallen even flatter than the first one since there were not really any decent urban legends left to use.  Another good quality is that it blurred the line between reality and fantasy, in true Hitchcock tradition.  Most likely, the writer and director were huge fans of Mr. Hitchcock and wanted to follow in his footsteps, even to the point of using the theme of his old television show for the end credits.  Even though they failed to capture the power that a Hitchcock film does, few films have ever come close to developing a Hitchcockian feel successfully.  But I digress...  The final good point I'll mention is the use of murders that look like accidents, which keep the police out of play.  Usually a simple 911 call would put a stop to any slashing that occurs in traditional horror films, and the whole \"it happened on a stormy night so no cops were available\" thing is just lame and unimaginative.     The film's weaknesses, on the other hand, were also evident.  (Slight spoilers ahead...)  The use of a minor character for real killer, while heightening the unpredictability of the film, usually just annoys the seasoned movie buff as in this case.  The killer's motives were an interesting and unexpected idea, but somewhat confusing and out of context for the movie.  Also, the whole \"kidney removal in the bathtub of ice\" sequence was stupid and just plain gross.  Finally the use of twins in the horror genre usually fails to keep a plot engrossing and gave the film a soap opera feel.  Bad choice.     All in all, however, I think the movie was well executed and certainly worth a look-see.  The final cameo of Rebecca Gayheart was a nice touch, and the use of tiny details that seem like filler at the time but come back to alter the course of the movie was a good idea.  Usually I can pick out the ones I know will be coming back into the plot, but one detail in particular I did not notice.  I decent flick, though it won't win any awards, but surely worth a rent.",

In this genre there are bad movie (total ripoffs, really really bad acting and necessity for total suspension of disbelief), then there are the groundbreaking movies which are instant classics, then there are movies like this.  Nothing original, but not horrible.  It has a couple of original twists although nothing trully remarkable.The one thing that did annoy me about this movie is how blatant the false leads for the killer are.  In my opinion a \"horror\" movie should have some totally nutzo killer (with or without superhuman ability), while a suspence movie should have a normal killer (slightly off balance obviously) but someone who you can figure out is the killer.  In this movie you can't figure it out since all the clues are blatant false trails.  That is the real complaint about this movie.Oh, and keep your eyes open for Rebecca Gayheart (although you will only understand if you saw the original Urban Legends), and no this isn't a spoiler for who the killer is.",

            "content": "URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT / (2000) *1/2 (out of four)I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during the creating of \"Urban Legends: Final Cut,\" the sequel to the 1998 slasher movie about a mad man running around a campus terrorizing teens by bringing scary urban legends to life. This film, directed by John Ottman, is about making a slasher movie based on the concept of the original, which triggers a domino effect in which a serial killer once again terrorizes campus teens. As a fly, I would have listened to the reasons of why the producers did not want to make a simple documentary of the original campy romp instead of recreating this tired story for the one-hundredth time.Instead of a synopsis of the story everyone already knows and has seen various times, I will simply explain the characters and the roles they play, since guessing the identity of the killer is the only reason people see this kind of movie anyway. There is Amy Mayfield, a film student working hard on finishing her final product for Professor Solomon (Hart Bochner). Trevor (Matthew Davis) who is the twin brother of a suicided student, Travis. There is the ditsy actress, Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), the lesbian boom operator, Vanessa (Eva Mendes), the quiet production assistant, Kevin (Derek Aasland) and other miscellaneous film students, including the arrogant Graham (Joseph Lawernce), and Toby (Anson Mount), as well as the movies comic relief, Dirk (Michael Bacall) and Stan (Marco Hofscineider).This retread around, the slasher sequences have no tension or suspense, mostly because the scenes feel so recycled and familiar and the characters are so clich\u00e9 and worse yet, the movie takes itself seriously, and has little fun with its plot-at least the \"Scream\" knew it was campy and had a lot of fun. The murderer had no distinct killing techniques or memorable traits, leaving him as forgettable and disposable material. This movie is mainly another excuse to make a production with copious amounts of blood, gore, and senseless violence.\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" has a potentially effective style to it and has a few scenes that are kind of entertaining to watch, like a sequence in at an amusement park ride. The movie is not very well written or directed. There is no development or introduction of the characters.  They have no distinct personalities; we never even care enough to learn their names. As for the killer's identity, I never cared enough to guess. And as usual, the slasher could be anyone-it matters not. All we need is a justification, regardless of how desperate and unbelievable, that explains his (or her, I do not want to give anything away) motives and the movie's target audience, which has to be unintelligent teens looking to see their own age group mutilated by a psychopathic killer, will be pleased.As bad as \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is, I have seen worse productions this year. \"The Perfect Storm\" became lost in its own special effects and attempts to justify human emotions; \"Supernova\" was riddled with horrible performances and a complicated plot concept that made no sense; \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" and \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" go without saying;  and Jackie Chan's \"Legend of The Drunken Master,\" was the only movie of the year where fist fights replace any kind of story. However this film has been made countless times, and this time around, I will have no mercy for it; the film will be placed on my worst of the year list.",

But if you expect this to continue to develop with survivors from the first one ... well don't.While this has some interesting casting choices (and good ones at that), it does not reach the level the first one had. Its tongue in cheek vibe might also not be everyones cup of tea.And onto the spoilers we go. Right from the start you get one of those scenes that I hate in movies. Not because it is a movie within a movie. Not even because it would have to be quite the elite film school to have equipment like that laying around. But because it makes no sense whatsoever. And yes I know most of the movie does not make sense. But showing us a final cut of a scene ... and then pretending it was a rehearsal or one take I reckon ... its beyond obnoxious. And then they go ahead and do the same for the second ending of the movie. You know the one after they dispose of the killer - sort of. Because he is back for the third ending. Something this movie shares with its predecessor that also had 3 endings. At least the third ending here seemed to be promising another sequel with an interesting storyline ... that never materialized. And even though I disliked quite a few things, I do think the movie has some merits to say the least. But you'll be the judge ... just hopefully not the executioner/teacher - pun maybe intended.",

Then again, any movie that has shout outs to Peeping Tom, Black Christmas and a killer who looks like he walked out of a giallo is going to win me over.Reese Wilson - yes, the security guard from the first movie - tells Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison, TV's House) about the murders that happened at the last school she worked for. This inspires her to create a movie all about a serial killer inspired by urban legends, which is ironic, as one of her classmates is soon killed after her organs are harvested. She wakes up in a bathtub of ice and is chased by the killer before being decapitated by a window. And here you thought I was making up the Argento influence. To top that off, there's a scene where everyone thinks they're watching the film when they are all watching a real murder, a nice subversion that is classic giallo.To top that off, at the end of the thrill ride of murder in this one, the close ties it in quite well with the first movie.

But the question is, how daft is it all going to get before the end credits roll?Well, the answer is 'extremely daft'\u2014Final Cut runs the gamut from mildly dumb to absolutely ridiculous over the course of 97 minutes; but the good news is that the cast and crew of the film seem to be quite aware how utterly absurd their material is, and play things accordingly.So even though the film dares to feature such clich\u00e9d plot elements as an omnipresent masked killer with a preposterous motive (this one opts for a fencing mask for no discernible reason), identical twins (always a winner in a horror film), a feisty black female security guard who saves the day (again!... Loretta Devine reprises her role from the first film), a heroine who is unable to convince others of the danger she is in, and comedy relief in the form of a pair of crazy special effects geeks, at least viewers can rest assured that none of it is meant to be be taken too seriously and revel in its sheer cheesiness.With tongue-in-cheek performances all round, umpteen movie references for film fans to spot, a couple of hokey in-jokes, and even one genuinely inspired moment at the end of the film featuring a Mexican stand off in which no-one is sure if the gun they are holding is real or a prop, time passes fairly painlessly and the film should prove pretty entertaining to fans of slashers (a genre which, let's face it, rarely produces works of genius). My only real gripes are that the gore level could have done with being much higher\u2014the only genuinely gruesome kill being a nifty decapitation near the start of the film\u2014and the absence of a gratuitous shower scene with a buxom babe (or two).",

            "content": "In the wake of Wes Craven's phenomenally successful SCREAM there was an army of cash-in clones that emerged and, sad to say, I was one of those who went and watched a slew of them at the multiplexes. This revisit dredged up all those bad memories of disappointments. Director John Ottman(..who seems to be a jack-of-all-trades, but he wisely decided to compose music instead) and writer Paul Harris Boardman set the film within the trappings of college film-making referencing movies and having characters running around sets getting killed by a masked psycho wearing all black(..I think that's a fencing mask he was wearing, not sure what that was for, but oh well). URBAN LEGENDS:FINAL CUT follows the formula of characters stalked one-by-one, all members of Amy Mayfield's(Jennifer Morrison) crew. There's a link, of course, and it's a irksome twist which leaves a sour taste. It's hard enough sitting through lamely executed death sequences which lack any potency whatsoever, but to endure the final climactic revelation(..which deals with Amy's deceased Documentarian father, *yawn*)just adds an extra kick to the groin.Good news is Morrison would move on to the popular television show HOUSE, and has blossomed into a lovely woman, and good actress. She's not bad as the lead, but her character is a direct model to the established Neve Campbell final girl which would populate the resurgent post-1996 contemporary slasher for years to come. Amy is often alone and fleeing from a determined pursuer, narrowly escaping. There are red herrings in the form of Trevor Stark(Matthew Davis, who was in EVERYTHING at this point and time), the twin brother of a slain talented college filmmaker, and Toby(Anson Mount), a Director of Photography who so desires to win the prestigious Hitchcock award that he walks out on Amy out of contempt for her \"intruding into his genre\". Trevor solidifies himself as the worst protector ever in a slasher as Amy can never depend on him to be there for her when she's being chased by the maniac(..it's obviously designed to cast doubt on Trevor). Amy's film-making project is to film a series of Urban Legends, a horror movie consisting of grisly vignettes but her crew are getting killed, not showing up to the set the next day. Soon she is the target until the typical ending featuring the room of suspects, a killer's identity uncovered and the scramble for a weapon. Hart Bochner(Terror Train)is a hip bit of casting as a film school scholar, Professor Solomon, and Loretta Devine returns from the first film as a college security guard, Reese Wilson(..such a welcome presence in a movie that doesn't deserve such a vibrant personality). Joey Lawrence even stops by as Graham, a student with a wealthy father who has connections into the industry..this would be one of MANY clunkers for \"Joseph\" after BLOSSOM. Eva Mendes has a thankless role as a lesbian assistant to Amy, Vanessa..far from the sultry tasty dish she'd soon become. The opening kill-scene packs a punch(..concerning an actress who is drugged, finding herself in a ratty apartment buried under ice, her kidney removed, attempting to escape, her stitched womb pried open by the killer before using a broken window glass to behead her)but the subsequent murders leave much to be desired. Other recognizable faces include Anthony Anderson as a make-up effects wiz and Jessica Cauffiel as a really terrible actress, who couldn't even scream effectively. Rebecca Gayheart(..the psycho from the first film)has a cameo at the end as a special wink to URBAN LEGENDS. Very similar to SCREAM 3, and certainly not as entertaining or clever. Unfortunately, an even worse sequel(..how could that be possible?)would come much later, BLOODY MARY.",

Too bad he has only two scenes. And I could have lived without Loretta Devine's black female security guard--she's a stereotype from the word \"go\". Matthew Davis is even worse but he does have a surprising nude scene. Third, the killings aren't too bloody (with the exception of the first death). The first hour was pretty interesting and well-done. Then the movie got stupid...REAL stupid...and boring...and clich\u00e9d. People do and say stupid things, the climatic confrontation goes on forever and there are astounding leaps of logic (figure out how the killer manages to hide all the bodies in the same place). The only good thing was the identity of the killer in this one makes sense...the original one it didn't. Also the urban legends have very little to do with the plot. They just seem thrown in for the hell of it. There is a cute little joke at the very end that will amuse viewers of the first film. Still, that's hardly a recommendation. So, it starts off well but ends up being just another dumb slasher flick. One good thing: the title says \"the final cut\". Hopefully that means no more sequels!",

The DVD region 4 has english/spanish/portuguese subtitles and english/spanish/portuguese audio track.Movie Review:Urban Legends: Final Cut was a great follow up of 1998's slasher hit Urban Legend, but I consider this sequel as an spin-off because the movie has only 1 returning character; Reese the security guard who is a Pam Grier fan; and no one of the main characters of the first returns in this one but there's a BIG SURPRISE at the very ending of the movie that UL fans loved. The new cast did a great job on making this movie more fun than the first one, and the movie had far more suspense than the first (well, the first film's suspense was EXTREME and this one is a bit less extreme). I recommend to any UL fans to buy the DVD.P.S.: this DVD edition is almost the same as Region 1.DVD: 4/5. Movie: 8/10.",

Laughable performances by Jennifer Morrison, Matthew Davis, Hart Bochner, Eva Mendes, and Anthony Anderson. This will not likely be a career highlight for any of them.

Winning @ WhereLegendsRule.cjb.net Sequels that surpass their predecessors are a rarity in the movie business. To quote Randy of other slasher flick Scream 2, \"by definition alone they are inferior movies.\" But does the same apply for non-sequel sequels? Apparently not, for Urban Legends: Final Cut (UL2) is a truly remarkable film, let alone sequel.UL2 has a very sophisticated edge which gives the movie a far more adult feel, and John Ottman's direction is on par with the veterans of the genre as he demonstrates a great knowledge of both how to create good scares/jumps, and also how to make the images on screen look good without being too crowded. In truth, the entire movie reeks of visual style, and the settings are beautifully shot. For a low-budget film, it definitely doesn't look it.All of the cast members are a joy, including Jennifer Morrison - who brings the heroine Amy to life on the screen - and the viewer can't help but like her from the start. There is something very fresh and original (in truth, this can be said about the entire movie) in her performance, and when paired up with Matt Davis the film becomes something very special. Additional cast like Jessica Chauffiel (whose bubbly energy fills all her scenes with a gritty humour), Joseph Lawrence (who is under-used, but makes a good red herring) and Anthony Anderson & Michael Bacall (who play Dirk and Stan respectively, and are hilarious with their geeky one-liners) are all nice departures from the cliched bit-parts of most Horrors. Another nice addition is Eva Mendes, as Amy's best friend, who strays from the typical \"heroine's timid field-mouse best friend\" cliche as a loud-mouthed lesbian. It's a shame that she didn't have more screen time (although, granted, for a movie of this genre she gets her fair share), as the scenes that she is a part of are all filled with some nice banter between characters.Director Ottman's subtle score is another bonus, as the combination of his already-spread composer wings and unique visual penache create something that is genuinely creepy the entire way through. The combination of quiet, music-less moments and loud crescendos give the film an off-beat ambience.The killer's costume itself (a fencing mask doubled with a long trench coat) is very different to most outfits, and added little touches - like the killer's breathe steaming through the mask, and electric sparks rebounding off the metal - give our weapon-weilding maniac a very human-yet-sterile feel, which is immediately unsettling.Despite many viewer's criticisms that no urban legend deaths (save the first) were involved in the film, this is not true - how could this movie be called Urban Legends unless it had that concept? All deaths cleverly used legends that most of us have heard of (although perhaps not many have heard the 'Tunnel of Terror' story...), and there is a gritty realism to them. Most use only sound alone rather than graphic detail in order for the audience to use their imagination (what's in the mind is always far scarier than what we see on-screen), and for once the motive behind the deaths isn't hugely ambiguous! The 'Kidney Heist' has to be one of the best horror movie scenes in recent memory - kudos to Ottman!There are some brilliant scenes to be found in UL2. The first and second death are both some of the scariest moments ever put onto film - again, Kudos to Ottman for his clever direction and editing! - and a scene in which the killer plays the keys on a piano Amy is hiding under was extremely unsettling, and for some reason really gets under your skin. As well as these more action-based scenes, there are some very nice character moments, including the moment that Amy discovers Trevor in the bell tower, and the first time Amy meets Reese. The climax is excellently-worked, and provides a memorable ending to the film.I recently purchased the DVD, and after watching the deleted scenes footage, it was a shame that some of the more emotional scenes were not kept in the final print. A scene which demonstrates first Amy's writer's block (before encountering Reese), and then her guilt at straying from documentaries gives an often-ignored insight into her character, and could have done a lot more to let the audience see what makes her tick. I can understand that for the younger audience who are only interested in seeing blood and guts, the deletion of these scenes would have been no problem, but for the more mature audience we would definitely have liked to have seen these scenes involved. A director's cut someday please, John?Other than this quibble (which probably only affects the DVD-viewing audience of this movie) Urban Legends: Final Cut is an atmospheric, character-fuelled movie that cleverly mixes Hitchcock-ian-style mystery with scary scenes that will have your skin crawling. Congratulations to John Ottman for a masterful movie debut, and let's hope we see more from you in the future!",

The storyline for this had tremendous potential. The movie even starts with a bang with a fantastic kill sequence. Almost every kill in this is very good and contains a solid mix of creativity and gore. Unfortunately the plot and character reactions weren't very good. It's too bad because the cast isn't bad their characters are just poorly written. This really had the potential to be better than the first film, which wouldn't be hard, but comes up a little short due to poor writing and execution.

            "content": "After seeing the first \"Urban Legends\" movie, I wondered if it would be possible to do better, or even repeat the dose, without the second film being invariably disastrous. The answer is no.In this film, Amy Mayfield, a young film student, has to make a short film as an end-of-course work. She decides to make a film in which a murderer kills his victims by recreating famous urban legends. Everything is going well until people really start to die, at the hands of a mysterious murderer.Well, what we have here is the same recipe used in the first film. The difference is that, as we have already seen it, it does not surprise us. It's just another horror movie for teenagers, with a plot so weak that it's not even worth talking about it. It will shatter at the first pull as if it were a rotten rag. The cast is very weak, almost amateur. Jennifer Morrison, the lead actress, does nothing particularly good. She just does what has to be done. There are, however, some moments where it seems that the film makes some little veiled criticisms, but quickly leaves that aside. The ending is perhaps the best part of the film.Despite being, in general, a frankly bad and forgettable film, it was a step forward in the career of many of those involved. Actresses like Eva Mendes, Matthew Davis or Jennifer Morrison had, shortly after, the opportunity to do more serious work: Mendes, for example, will have the opportunity to appear in \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" and Davis will cost to establish himself but, after years of small appearances, he will finally did it with \"Vampire Diaries\". Even the director, John Ottman, will discover that he is a terrible director but has a knack for other things in cinema, as music. So, I think this film fulfilled an objective and served a purpose, although perhaps many of those involved hide it on the bottom shelf of their filmography.",

            "content": "It's a sort-of sequel to the minor 1998 hit ''Urban Legend,'' also about a serial killer working a college campus where the students are really dumb when it comes to figuring out why their peers keep disappearing amid buckets o' blood. ''Final Cut'' is intense. A decapitation during which a dog is fed the victim's entrails is only the start of a killing spree with a high hemoglobin count. Predictably, just one student, perky Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison), is even remotely aware of strange goings- on as she works on her own film about a serial killer. As in all dopey horror movies, things squeak and bump alarmingly; there are mysterious power shutdowns, a full moon behind a veil of wind-swept clouds and shadowy forms that lurk and occasionally leap. The heroine stupidly ventures alone into the night to check out suspicious noises or suggestions of strange events. The killer is seemingly everywhere and tends to pop up wearing a fencer's mask of mesh, as one by one the student body on the isolated campus shrinks. The idea for viewers is to try to not see the illogic in any of it as they crane for the next bloodbath. A finale exposes the killer in a theme park mine-train attraction. Fellow students are played by relative unknowns: Eva Mendes as a brash lesbian, Jessica Cauffiel as a screechy wannabe actress, Marco Hofschneider as an arrogant European cinematographer and Hart Bochner as the devoted professor. Matthew Davis plays the handsome stud who seems to suddenly have a twin brother after he dies in the tower of a campus building. One minute Amy beds down with the brother, and the next she has a nightmare that he's about to rub her out with a dagger while they make love. Not safe sex, so to speak. Overall:Superbly executed, Urban Legends: Final Cut is a gripping ride into terror, embracing the horror genre wholeheartedly and giving us a nail-biting, heart-jolting experience. John Ottman stamps it decisively as his own with assured, confident direction, slick editing and a magnificent, large orchestral score that pounds along with our hearts. A different experience to Jamie Blanks' first Urban Legend.",

And that first kill, added at the last minute, so it has at least one decent death scene. Jacinda Barrett is most definitely the underrated scream queen, for this sequel. The new cast, unlike the first installment, don't really stand out and none of these characters leave an impression. Even the twin brother twist, can't change our minds about that. True, the actors are all pretty famous now, but it makes you wonder if the movie was made solely to showcase these \u00ab up and coming \u00bb talents. Loretta Devine and another actor from the original movie, are here to bridge the gap between both stories. And were my personal highlights. This, and the cheerfulness make it more meta than expected. It criticism of movie business, though, is going nowhere, and the script could've done without. Script that was meant to be a \u00ab remake \u00bb of the first movie events, on its first draft. Or simply one of the many legends surrounding the killer's taste for destruction. So why didn't they just go there?

Matthew Davis plays a potential love interest, first as Travis who presumably shot himself, then the same guy plays his twin brother Trevor - sort of confusing that is.I see Anthony Anderson in this movie - yet played the pervert cop Perkins in Scream 4.Also, the blonde Sandra - her actress, Jessica Cauffiel, I've seen her in classic movie: Valentine, released following year (directed the predecessor movie's director: Jamie Blanks) as party Lily, responded to nerdy boy Jeremy Melton with \"Ewww!\" which foreshadows the box of chocolates with squirming maggots filling she takes bite of, then killer's game of archery which resulted with her going over a balcony railing and plummeting into a dumpster. In this movie, she is again as another actress named Sandra also about to leave for Los Angeles, there's the great heightening suspenseful theme and flashy red lights when she looks for her car keys in the empty studio before getting slashed to death while killer records it.Overall, this movie is slightly average, I guess it's better than supernatural sequel (Bloody Mary), yet it certainly doesn't beat/not of my favourites unlike, the 1998 movie!",

Except that this film isn't attempting satire, it's taking itself seriously, utilizing every expired 80-s horror cliche imaginable:-Girl walks into dark empty room/girl walks backward into dark, empty corner/girl runs into dark, spooky, woods....instead of running to that nice, brightly lit building. Duh.If \"Scream\" succeeded at anything, it was at pointing out how completely absurd these type of plot contrivances are. Apparently, the lazy writers of \"UL-Final Cut\" learned nothing.

Apparently a good 30 second terrified rattling of the doorknob was all it needed...<groan>And the mother-of-all-horror-cliches...-Girl runs from killer, panting and heaving, in an exhausting attempt to ditch her stalker...killer pursues at a comfortable cruising speed of 3 baby steps per minute.

The deaths in this scene were super boring and featured perhaps the worst use of latex since the sleestaks in Land of the Lost.Watching this, I couldn't help but to think that I had a better time having that abcess drained...The first \"U-L\" used up all the interesting Urban Legends and so all you get here is some lame Scream 3 rip-off about murders on a film set. If only life imitated art , we would have been spared this pointless mess.There is absolutely no redeemable quality to this waste, even for the most avid fans of the genre.

The first film had potential, but fell short, being an above average Scream clone. Its sequel, featuring only 2 characters from the original, one in a tiny cameo follows the students of a film course when a number of murders begin. The murders follow vaguely the Urban Legends which one student is basing her thesis on. When a friend supposedly kills himself, then his mysterious twin brother appears, the film maker and her friend's brother try to drive out the killer who they believe is someone on her course.There are twists, but they are few and not surprising, there is little originality, but i've never been one to expect every film to be original, and criticise one for lacking any. There are some fine performances, mainly from Amy, the direction is average for this genre, there are very few shocks and a few laughs, but nothing to stand out. However, if you are a fan of slasher movies, or horror movies in general it is worth watching as you will want to find out who the killer is. Therefore if it is on TV, and you have nothing else to do, watch it, but don't go out to rent or buy. Unless you love it. Some of the film references are quite obscure if you are not a big film fan, and there are a few interesting moments involving the viewer's participation in violent movies- The students watching the death of a friend on screen, thinking it is part of the movie, is probably the film's best moment.",

Amy Mayfield(Jenny Morrison)decides to do her thesis film on \"urban legends\", having gotten the idea from returning rent-a-cop diva from UL1, Reese(Loretta Devine). However, of course, everyone involved in this project soon turns up dead in some fairly creative ways. This time around the urban legends include the tub of ice and the kidney, a murder during a \"screaming session\", and the Tunnel of Terror in which the dead bodies turn out to be real. Actually, I have never heard of any of these legends before, except for the kidney one which was mentioned in the previous film. Not that this is a bad thing. I think that the writers of UL2 decided to create a couple of their own, but most of the deaths in this movie are just basic kills and aren't presented in urban legend style. The entire film basically ignores the 'urban legend' aspect and focuses more on the 'film within a film' tactic. That's fine, I guess, but there is also some \"bad writing\" because at the end of the film nearly five characters show up(whom we have probably forgotten)and this is evidence that whoever wrote the script had no idea of what to do with all these characters, who, in my opinion, were all pretty pointless. Still the revealing of the killer at the end was a surprise and he/she even had a fairly convincing motive. But, overall, the only thing that Urban Legends:Final Cut has going for it is the fact that it features a then-unknown Eva Mendes, who has a pretty cool chase scene with the killer(which ends in a total mess, sadly). This film had a lot going for it, but ultimately failed to deliver. Unfortunately, or fortunately if you are a fan of 90's slashers, these films could probably go on forever given that there are countless urban legends that were not featured in either of the UL films.4/10 for a decent plot and the stunning Eva Mendes(who plays a lesbian). Deducted a point for the retarded fencing mask that the killer wears. When is fencing featured in this film? Never. So what's up with that?",

I have no idea why this movie was even considered to be a sequel, it had absolutely nothing to do with the first Urban Legends movie which was a thousand times better then this one. One of the good things in this movie though is that it wasn't really predictable and it was somewhat entertaining. The acting was alright, nothing special. My biggest problem with this movie besides that it had nothing to do with the first one is that there was a big lack of character development. The audience practically finds out nothing about the characters and their past. I don't know if that was put in the movie purposely to make the characters look mysterious or something but to me it just seemed like a bad plot.

It was excruciating to sit through balderdash like \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", \"The Way of the Gun\", and now this piece of garbage. The first \"Urban Legends\" movie was pretty terrible and didn't merit a sequel, but here is one anyway. What's even more bizarre is that this sequel has nothing to do with the first one. In fact, the urban legend aspect of this movie kind of gets in the way of it's plot, concerning a string of killings at a film school. There was enough material with the film school killings to make a crappy slasher movie, and the writers really have to bend over backwards to accommodate the urban legends into the story. Not much effort is made to connect this movie to the first one: Only one character from the original returns, a minor supporting one at that. This is yet another stand-alone movie made worse by forcing it into a series. (See also: \"Hellraiser: Inferno\", \"Shock Treatment\", \"Return of the Living Dead part 3\", all those Italian \"Zombie\" 'sequels')This movie is terrible. From the terrible opening scene to the terrible final scene, the operative word here is terrible. Some sequences are confusing, others just unbelievable. There is no gore to recommend except for one decapitation. Nothing clever happens, and the back-story is overly convoluted. The writers seem to assume that everyone in the audience is familiar with the goings-on of film schools, and don't need to explain how the students relate to each other. There are so many different student films mentioned and so many different characters that all look alike that it's not hard to get lost, and it's certainly not worth the effort to pay attention. The killer's motive is unbelievably impracticable and flimsy.I did learn, however, that student thesis films have an average budget of twenty million dollars, with sets and effects that rival any major studio production. I also learned that you can go to the most prestigious film school in America and make a cheesy, unoriginal horror film as your thesis film.  The one thing I did like about this movie was how it revealed one of the film school's teachers as a frustrated hack. This is pretty much true about all communications teachers.It should be mentioned that Joey Lawrence is in this movie, and he never says \"Woah!\" Why didn't he star in a movie at the peak of his career, a la Richard Grieco?

Lol) Other than that this might as well have been a completely  different film, it's good though. I have to give it that.  Amy Mayfield, a student at Alpine University has yet to finish her  Thesis Film. She has no idea what to write about, until one night when  Reese, a Security Guard at Alpine sees Amy walking to the library, late  at night in the snow. Letting her in the car, Reese tells her of a  story about eight students being murdered by Urban Legends at Pendleton  University. Amy knows the story, and knows it fake, but Reese, knows  otherwise. Amy takes Reese's idea, and begins to make her film. Until  one by one her Crew and Cast become Urban Legends, and Amy is next on  the list, unless she can stop the Killer, and find out why he/she is  doing this.  I thought this film was pretty bad the first time i saw it, i guess i  was expecting something from those teens at the end of the First One to  have some part in this, and have Rebecca be the Killer again...but that  didn't happen. What we got was something completely different but very  good at the same time. I saw it for a second time and almost became  attached to the film, i thought it got better each time i watched it.  All i can remember is seeing the preview one night when i was about 12,  i was home alone, and i was watching this preview for Urban Legends 2,  and i thought it looked like the scariest thing in the world (I was  12!) and one day i decided to buy it when it came out on video. Like i  said i didn't like it, but now I've changed my opinion.  This movie has gore, scares, and everything else you could ask for in a  Teen Slasher. The acting is good, although some of them were unknown to  me, they did pretty well. The gore is pretty high level, especially one  girl, i wont mention her name, but she gets it the worse. She is  drugged, gets her kidney taken out, has her wound reopened (By the  Killer's Hands) grabs onto Barbed Wire and then is decapitated, that  death alone, made everything else i usually see in my beloved Teen  Slashers seem weak. And i must admit, when the Killer jumped out at her  in the Jacket Room of the club, i jumped half a mile.  If you don't worry about it being part of Urban Legend, then it's good,  at least the Killers Motive is a lot better than Rebecca's from the  first, although similar in a way. This is one of those movies, you  watch with a bunch of friends, it's a good movie and if your into Gore  and scares and stuff this is for you.  I Give Urban Legends: Final Cut 9/10 If they had only kept Eva Mendes  alive until the end, it would have rocked! I mean she could have taken  Joeseph Lawrence's part, what is he doing in a Non-Disney movie  anyway?!",

It did have some good moments: a hillside chase is pretty exciting, as well as the sequence inside the carnival mine ride attraction. Jennifer Morrison and Matthew Davis are surprisingly good. I hate most of Hollywood's current breed of young actors, but I have to admit these two were pretty good. And director John Ottman's score is very good, the first of his scores I've heard that I liked. At times, it doesn't even sound like a horror score. Some tracks rival Danny Elfman's powerful music in BATMAN. And surprisingly, the gore factor is pretty tame. A lot of people die, but most of the kills are very bloodless, with the exception of the first kill of the movie, which is so over the top it's out-of-place among the other kills, and the whole scenes feels thrown in just to please the gore fans. The killer's motive is the most laughable excuse for a killing spree I've ever heard of. I won't say who the killer is, and while the identity of the person was a surprise, his explanation for his actions is so ridiculous it damages the film. Oddly enough, the killer's murders are supposed to be based on urban legends (just like in the first film), but only the first kill appears to be based on anything like that. The others are just standard stalk-and-stab kills, no different from any horror horror films. I've enjoyed several of the SCREAM-influenced horror films that have come out since that film, and while it's not the absolute worst horror film I've seen, it's far from being among even the \"decent\" ones. Watch it on TV if you see it, but don't bother renting it.",

There was nothing memorable about it, and I watched it in a completely idle mind, not taking it even remotely seriously. It was probably not the worst murder mystery ever taken, but definitely not amongst the best.

This movie takes place sometime after the first one at a new school, Alpine University, where one film student is awarded the \"Hitchcock\" award each year, which apparently is a gateway to Hollywood success.  Several students are competing and one has the idea to make a movie based around an urban legends killer.  Soon students start dropping dead around the set of the film, and it is up to one of them to find out who the killer is.  The urban legend idea, which worked so well in the first film is wasted here because only two deaths really work around that idea, and you will never guess who the killer is because that person only appears in about 10 minutes of the film before the ending.  The acting here is poor, the plot is confusing and at most times makes no sense.  The characters themselves are even worse because their lines could be changed randomly among each other and it would make difference, so underdeveloped are they. The one bright spot is Devine who makes a heck of a lot from the small amount of screen time she is given.  The rest of the movie simply is not worth seeing, rent the original instead.",

I also knew that as common knowledge goes, sequels rarely surpass the originals, neither equal them, are rather worse. But anyway, this final cut ended up being even worse than we all expected. If we have to point the finger of blame to anyone, we can't point it to a single person alone since the blame belongs to almost everyone involved: the plot is a real mess, capable of lines that an elementary school kid couldn't even imagine the characters are so poor and under developed that makes us wonder if they are Jar Jar relatives. The directing is very far from being even mediocre, we fell that they casted the most unexperienced kids they could find, and also the director didn't help them as well \u0096 speaking of unxperiences... among all of these headless people crew or cast only two of them rise above the rest. Needles is to say that they deserved to be in adiffernt movie: Jenniffer Morrison and Matthew Davis \u0096 their characters are all typos but both of them make the audience realize they are doing the movie for the money and popularity, rather from its quality that eventually is null. Surprise, surprise the killer is not expected at all, but at this point we don't even care, after all the idiocies we watched during the movie, the killer could have also been a dog \u0096 we wouldn't care anyway, and voil\u00e1 there's the same twist for the last movie in the end of this one.

Despite some very basic horror scenes, typical of this genre, UL2 is definitely more of a thriller than an outright stalk-n-slash horror.In fact this movie pays homage to many movies, even the \"Alien\" series. A more cynical person might view this as being a process of \"ripping off\" but it is quite obvious that it is not, as it never goes that far, keeping - rather - the homages very subtle.All in all, not a bad movie at all. Worth watching on DVD, as it contains - among others - a very funny gag reel, some interesting deleted scenes, and a reasonably impressive director's commentary.Recommended.I STILL KNOW WHAT U DID LAST SUMMER - with subtlety, style, and intelligence. But definitely no way near the quality and brilliance of, for example, SCREAM (1996) and HALLOWEEN (1978).",

While it manages to echo the entire trilogy, it also meshes together tons of elements and scenes that have been employed with either great or marginal success in other films.The opening totally copies Final Destination, the premise is a bastardized version of the Scream trilogy, and there is one sequence that manages to rip off Blair Witch and Friday the 13th in a single transition.  Maybe first-time director John Ottman thought these would come across as homages to other successful horror flicks - or maybe the writers were simply lazy and wanted to capitalize on the success of the others.And so, the movie plods along, as predictable as watching the Zapruder film. The cast of young faces all seem to be trying their best as they stumble through scenes that lack any freshness, and Joey Lawrence (here credited Joseph Lawrence, as if he is attempting to step away from the pall that will forever be cast on him from \"Blossom\") shows us what a lack of talent he truly possesses.3 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Urban Legend\" was a wretched, mundane, stupid nightmare of gory deaths with a pointless story that attempted to cash in on \"Scream's\" success. I'm not surprised they greenlit a sequel, and my only thought was there was no way, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut.\" could be better. It's for sure, not worse. \"Final Cut\" represents slasher clich\u00e9s on a physical level, and this sequel attempts to improve on the original with a better plot involving a film school and a killer in a fencing mask for appeal. Ultimately it comes down to the same repeated story with an ending that is the same idea as before, and the girl has to figure out why. Director John Ottman will probably never direct again after this fails at the box office.It's about a film student, Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison), who is in the process of writing a film thesis and decides to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the style of urban legends. When the students start dying, based on urban legends, Amy realizes there is a killer on the loose, and she must figure out who it is and why the killer is after her.These movies are getting exhausting, and I am tired of them. For some reason, I thought this sequel was going to be different because the killer wears a fencing mask on the poster art, but no, they had the gull to make the same movie to get more cash. The Urban Legends concept gets used once again to more sustain; it's more graphic this time. It fails to establish its story and any of its characters opting for mayhem instead. Mayhem it only delivers when one girl wakes up in a bathtub full of ice and to find a kidney removed, and after she tries to escape, she gets her head cut off in the process, and a dog eats the organ when the killer opens the window and throws it to the animal. How nice!This scene bothered me because it goes to show the stupidity of the screenwriters. The girl gets kidnapped, and she wakes up to find her kidney sitting on a table. She looks down a hallway, and the killer is slicing what looks like meat. She slips and falls, trying to get out of the bathtub and the killer springs to life after her. Why was the killer randomly standing in a room slicing, I guess, pieces of meat? When you find out who the killer is, he is simply a professor with a severely stupid motive. So why is an ordinary man who is pissed off, standing in a room cutting meat - waiting for the girl to awaken? The whole scene plays out in some laughable makeshift house of horrors that she is in, but I didn't by it.So why is this happening again? Amy gets a ride home in a police car when she is wandering around the school by none of than the pitiful cop from the first movie, Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine). She makes a return explaining how she got the job at the film school, and it's bogus. Reese tells Amy about \"several murders that happened on the previous campus,\" and this inspires Amy to make a film about a serial killer murdering people based on Urban Legends for her thesis film. Shortly after, Amy gets attacked, and Reese tells her she does not believe her. You would think the previous murder spree would have made her smarter and wiser, but no. Am I supposed to think she ends up in another murder spree by accident on a campus setting? I guess it's just luck or a lousy screenwriter.Most of the movie revolves around Amy, making her film with her friends. They all contribute to in various ways by the end, and I thought this was interesting, but when the whole movie is useless, it makes it kind of hard to care about anything, it has to offer even if a few things are interesting. What's not entertaining is the fabled dream sequence getting used. There is a subplot involving a character named Travis Stark played by Matthew Davis, and he has a twin named Trevor, how smart, also play by Matthew Davis. After a sequence involving a carnival ride where Amy is shooting her movie, and her two idiot friends get electrocuted, she gets confronted by Trevor, and they end up having sex only for her to wake up because it was a dream. After seeing this, I checked out of the movie.I'm not sure what they were going for with this. It feels like the script was supposed to be something else entirely and a different film until someone said, \"write an Urban Legend in the story and let's retitle it as a sequel to \"Urban Legend.\" All the people who got killed have something to do with someone's film, and the killer reveals himself with a lazy-to-write severe garbage motive that is shameful because you see this is purely a cash grab with no effort put into it. They even have the nerve to reference the late great \"Sir Alfred Hitchcock.\" Even more strange, someone returns from the previous movie at the end, and it's not really possible, but then again, this was a cliche garbage movie to begin with, so who cares?",

Like I said, ULFC is not scary, neither is it \"jumpy\", like \"Scream\" is (and when I say \"Scream\", I refer to the first one). It is filled with annoying characters with annoying voices who scream annoyingly at annoying dark nothingness. How fun! The acting is also so mediocre, it's hard not to wonder where these people come from, and if the casting director is really blind.Firstly, the guy who played the lead actress' boyfriend. He cannot act. At all. He wore an annoying blank face throughout the movie! If there's anything I remember about the film, it's his unability to act. The only memorable person is Loretta Devine, for reasons I can't recall. This film is so utterly horrid that I can't even remember most of the cast members, even while looking at the list on its main details page. Also, the murderer's motive was really weak, and he wasn't in the movie enough without that annoying mask to remind you that he exists.

Will they ever win?Apparently so, as listed among the film are a literal myriad of all the tales we've heard happened to a friend of a friend, and even the 'one' we've heard about this film being a tad silly can be justified somewhat by this film.Urban Legends: Final Cut is a movie that cannot really be taken seriously seeing is though it's post \"we actually care about horror movies\". Because of this, no one was really completely scared about what was going on within the film at any one point, which is by no means a fault of the movie, just by us, the de-sensitised viewers.As a stand-alone film I actually enjoyed ULFC. It had it's own little situations occurring, it's own character structure and it's own way to have a completely irrelevant killer (or 'ers' for those who haven't seen it and think that there may be some sort of plot that makes two killers possible...I digress)Knowing that ULFC was not a direct sequel to Urban Legends, all you die hard fans out there will be listening out and jumping to possible link conclusions for the film, and sadly will be let down.Only Reese, the delightful security guard, has anything to do with the first, but all you die hard fans will laugh manically when a visitor from the very end of the first Urban Legend returns for an 'in-joke' cameo at the very end of this one. Just to see this particular cameo will make the entire film more fun.There are times when you could be genuinely scared in this film, say, if it was released before 1998. There are even moments where spooky music makes an appearance just because a tree is in the background, which makes you get scared, but then it's the end of the scene and you forget about it. Sections like that frequent this film and only two of about thirty are actually frightening, if you could call them that.Oh, plot revelations. If any genre were tainted with the most ludicrous of plot revelations, the Horror genre wins hands down. Not since the repetition of the same killer in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has the horror genre been subjected to such stupidly pointless killer identification.I'm sorry, but surely if they wanted a point to the film they could have made someone remotely relevant to the rest of the characters the killer.Don't read this next bit if you don't want the pointless ending to be wrecked;But why that stupid useless teacher? The end of this film must have been written on a cocktail napkin, as it isn't very plot thickening or thought provoking. More like annoying. Why not make it Joey Lawrence's character? That would have made more sense (movie and motive wise).Why not make it an amusing ending? Like, Joey's character could have blamed years of working on Blossom or with his brothers, for his killing everyone at the film school. That would have been more impressive than the selected mental teacher tact ULFC chose to take.But because of the irrelevant ending, sometimes copied situations between killer and heroinne ( Scoring Room scene was very very remeniscent of Scream 2's Gale Sound Rec scene )and even the omnipresent sinister music when male characters say things like \"trust me\", mark this film as a last hurrah to the teen slasher genre. And I'm sad to say, it's about time.So, overall, Urban Legends: Final Cut is a fun movie in it's own right. It's suspenseful, at some point's original, moving, confusing ( what with that whole make up a twin brother scheme ) and generally well done. It is just a pity that everyone is so over the teen slasher genre and just find themselves viewing it because it's got one rating below 18+Before you go see it, if you haven't already, watch Urban Legend just so you can get the joke at the end of the second one, and watch how eerily similar the two films are in the typical 'horror movie' structure and the way certain parts are filmed and you won't be as scared as, say, your 3 year old cousin when you take them to go see it.Go see Urban Legends: Final Cut and enjoy what could possibly be the very last of the teeny-bopper horror movie films for a long while yet.",

Also other urban legends that were used are: people filming their victim's death, a body tied into the bell, the 'kidney' and the midnight scream.The acting is great, the direction of John Ottman is great, the scares are better than the first and the twists were like a \"Scooby Doo\"-ish episode.Overall, it's a great sequel to a great film. Final Veredict: 8/10.",

Just stay away from Urban Legends: Final Cut.  It is an unbearable barrage of horror movie cliches and fake scares.  The film starts out with an obvious movie-in-a-movie fake scare, and moves on to obvious \"it's only a bird\" and \"it's only a harmless supporting character wearing a funny mask\" fake scares.  We all know when a fake scare is coming, so why does Hollywood keep giving them to us?  And of course the movie provides absolutely no clues to the killer's identity so he has to go through a long speech to explain his motive, and in this film the killer's motives go beyond ridiculous to being simply and unthinkably stupid.  Worst of all, they include many references to Alfred Hitchcock (the name of the award, a Vertigo-ish spiral staircase, the music on the end credits).  I imagine Hitch would be seriously p****d to be associated with a movie like this if he were still alive.  If any of the filmmakers actually intended this as an homage, they should have at least displayed a little of the skillful restraint that made Big Al such a genius.  All I can say is that Urban Legends: Final Cut is an absolute failure of a movie.",

The Kidney Heist and The Midnght Scream are really well done. Jennifer Morrison is a great heroine and there's a good amount of humour in this, especially concerning Sandra's lack of acting skills (\" That girl's acting would be rigid in a porno film\") As a fan of the first one I was very happy with this.

The original had the added theme of urban legends to aid dimension to the killer. This movie attempts to follow this lead but in a completely unique setting with different characters. It falls short because it tried to do too many secondary things well and failed to have the primary tools for horror success: compelling and relatable characters, a solid core story with a satisfying twist/ending and interesting horror-themed demises. Watching this movie a solid decade after it was released, I was surprised by the cast, particularly Jennifer Morrison. She does a fair job, but she's always had the sharp side to her, that's why I didn't think I'd see her in an emotional role in a horror movie. Aside from her, all other characters are secondary, and the ending is very lackluster. The story seemed to focus more on theme than actual content as it set up the setting well, but failed to actually dig into it. And finally, the actual deaths were also disappointing and failed to build much suspense. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to all except the horror fans who love all kinds of suspense thrillers.",

The opening sequence takes place on an aeroplane with a killer flight attendant but we find out that it is all fake and all a film set. Now the original film had an opening with something more gripping and then continued to thrill, but this film seems to take a long time to get going which is annoying because the director tries to build character which unfortunately just doesn't happen.The characters are very predictable and at times very annoying and irritating and at some points you as a viewer just want to fast forward to a less annoying part of the film. At times i felt really annoyed with the film because the pacing was really out of tune and it just felt like a totally totally different film to the first.The killer does what a typical killer does picks off the teens in very interesting ways but this killer didn't seem to have any bright ideas or bring anything new to the table. Also the killer seemed to appear when convenient for story purposes which is just plain old daft! And the ending and the killers motive is one of the worst i've ever heard and i found it rather stupid.The film did have some strong points however, in terms of location and the look of the film both add to the atmosphere of the picture but these two things alone cannot make a brilliant film. The direction is very poor from first timer John Ottman who also composed music and edited the film. My advise would be to stick to scoring music because this guy cannot direct! Overall the film cannot touch the original because of this films lack of judgment to come up with any real plot and any real characterization thats worth even bothering with. I suggest you only watch this film only if you are any sort of hack and slash buff because you people probably wont be disappointed.**** out of **********",

Anthony Anderson is not a good actor he shouldn't be in this, he adds allot to the humorous side of things like in all his roles. I didn't like the final girl so much in this one and the only character i really liked was Eva Mendez's character, and Reese who is returning from the first film. I also liked the movie film school vibe , although it feels a bit copied off scream 3 . Another thing is that the opening was awful , it kind off opens in a film within a film type of way. Some characters are just plain dumb . Also this film doesn't revolve around urban legends as much as the first oneSo on the positive side for me, we do get one great kill involving the kidney heist urban legend. Thats the only great and suspenseful kill in the entire movie, we get Eva Mendez . Reese from the first movie returns. And the ending with Brenda from the original was absolutely terrific, and redeems the film in many ways bit on the negative side, too much wacky humour, bad Anthony Anderson, not much about urban legends, dumb characters, awful opening.Again I don't hate it, I will watch it again but it does not reach the heights of the original and they should have made something more mysterious and serious ( the film isn't a comedy horror , bit the humour doesn't fit here and I would say its half serious).\nAs a fan of the original check it out but don't watch with too high of expectations.",

Final Cut takes zero advantage of that potential, however. The whole urban legend thing seems almost shoe horned in to another movie. The killer's motive is actually interesting, and had the execution made a bit of sense could have made an interesting movie away from this franchise. But this is an Urban Legend movie so the fact that we don't get some really classic urban legend kills is inexcusable. There is one cool scene involving ice nd a bathtub that really worked, though. The real problem with the movie is that it's just not trying. None of the characters aim beyond formulaic, and the film requires that they all be stupid beyond belief to keep the story going. And when a movie depends on such stupidity from its characters AND its audience to reach its finale, it's clear that whoever made it just didn't seem the need to put much effort in it.

The killer obviously wears the outfit & fencing mask to disguise his/her identity (I won't spoil the thrilling surprise of who the killer is, even though the red herrings are so abundant it could have been anybody).  Okay, the disguise is fine, the masked killer is a fine old slasher tradition and the fencing gear is a new costume. Here's the funny part:  at two different points, the killer puts another disguise ON TOP OF the fencing disguise.  Once the killer puts a monster mask OVER the fencing mask.  Another time the killer dresses up like a miner, donning a cowboy-type felt hat ON TOP OF the fencing mask.  Huh?  I guess the fencing gear was for the audience, so we didn't get confused and think that there were two or more killers.

For one thing, this defeats the purpose of having much more elaborate death scenes (one of the rules of a sequel, as told by Randy in Scream 2)  And also, most of the deaths are not noticeable enough, due to flickering lights, and the constant moving of an amateur using a camera.  And you'll also notice that there are almost no \"urban legends\" depicted in this film.  And did anyone care to notice that Reese said \"8 students\"?  In Urban Legend only 5 students were killed, not including the Dean, and Wexler who aren't students.  But if they were counted that would add up to 7.  But anyway, this film uses no time for a story that you can hang on to.  Also, this movie uses to much time making us laugh than scaring us.  And finally, the killer has a really stupid motive.  Now lets get to the good part.  Jennifer Morrison seems to be a very promising young actress who I hope to see playing more sweet girls.  Also, I love the killers choice of costume, considering that it's very original.  And the rest of the casts costuming is also good.  The sound as expected was amazing, and gave you some jumps.  The set was marvelous, as was the cinematography.  And there is a surprise at the end.  But I won't give any clues.  Fans of Urban Legend may be pleased, if they can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie!",

This time murders are occurring at Alpine University, where students are studying film-making. Amy Mayfield is doing her thesis films based on urban legends, and the cast and crew to her film end up becoming victims to murders where the killer makes urban legends come true. Amy investigates the situation and must find out who the killer is before she becomes a murdered victim. This film was nothing original, slightly predictable and when I watched it, all I wanted it to do was end. But speaking of the ending, fans of the original Urban Legend will be pleased by the quick cameo of Rebecca Gayheart, one of the actresses in the first film. In conclusion, this film is definitely not a worthy nor necessary sequel.",

I mean, yeah, sure, there were a lot of plot holes, but it built a good atmosphere and I, for one, am fascinated by urban legends, cryptids, Alien abduction and so forth, and this sequel looked like it had potential. I was young, and I liked this movie, and I also thought the killer's mask thing looked kinda cool. But now I'm older, and I realize how un-fun this movie is. nothing like the first film! I few things were nice, like Loretta devine, the ending, and the sci-fi nerds, but the kills didn't do it for me. I was let down by this sequel. I have also just realized how stupid the killer looks. what is he even wearing? It looks awful, nowhere near as scary as the killer's design for the first film, just a creepy fleece hood. it could be anybody. but how many people would own something like this? Also, the motive is outrageous. horrible. the first solution was quick, clever, and I almost sympathized with the killer for a few moments. But this has no shocks. I felt the first one was constantly strong, if not the best, though, but this one is just too slow. It trudges on at a snails pace. the legends they chose for this one, don't work. in the first, they wear well known, like the backseat killer or dog in the microwave. but here, the one about screams at midnight? It's just stupid at heart. Then,, of course, what are the films good points? well, while there being very few, it is this: the opening on the plane. It is just very laughable, but in a good way, unlike the rest of this garbage. I'm frustrated now. as well, the girl getting killed with the broken window, the kidney and the dog...Ridiculous, just ridiculous. and that sums up this film for me. A cheap scare fest with very little plot, annoying characters who get it early on so thank god! minimal gore. I disown it from the Urban Legends time line. i've heard that while bloody Mary isn't as bad, it's still pretty awful, but I haven't seen it yet, so, until that review, i hate this movie, altogether.",

            "content": "Rating; 5 out of 10. Urban Legends: Final Cut is basically a collaboration of the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer films, except it lacks what they had.Though this film is considered a non-sequel, as it has basically a whole new cast compared to the first Urban Legends along with a different storyline - it still isn't as original as it could have been. Regardless of the fact that it lacked it's own personality, it is probably one of the better non-sequel's in the horror genre, because it does relate somewhat back to the first film. Returning character Reese adds a little bit of the original to this films atmosphere which creates a sense of direction.While watching this film I really had to question who the killer was, which was difficult as they had so many characters in this film that I had a hard time putting a name to a face. That was a positive aspect about this film, as it had a Scream 3 like atmosphere where the killer is revealed only in the last 10 minutes, and any guess towards the likes of the killer would most likely be false. Though the way they displayed the killer was almost like Scream 3, too much of this movie was like Scream 3. A movie inside a movie? Been there, done that. Still though, this film isn't necessarily copying as the script was written before Scream 3 was ever released. I like the concept of a movie within a movie, but Scream had already claimed that aspect back in 1996 and the original Urban Legends didn't make enough impact to have a sequel use that concept.The acting in this film wasn't that good as well. There were too many \"dumb blonde\" like characters in this film. Jennifer Morrison who played the lead role as Amy Mayfield wasn't too bad, though she reminded me of Julia Stiles too much and I personally haven't been able to stomach Stiles since that annoying 10 Things I Hate About You movie. Amy's trusty sidekicks seemed like they were thrown together as well and that's a problem when there are too many filler characters and not enough depth. Characterism was a major issue in this film as unlike Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, you didn't get to know or like your characters enough to care whether they were getting killed or not. They didn't seem like real people with real problems so does it really matter if someone slices them up? No.In comparison to the first Urban Legends I think this one would stand better by itself. If they had cut the Urban Legends cliche from this film it would've made a better slasher flick. The film really only killed one person by using an Urban Legend. By connecting this film to the original it only made me think I was gonna be seeing a continuation of a story that interested me.Where do the gems in this film lie? The final scene, after you find out who the killer is, and right before the credits play. I was prepared to give this film a 2 out of 10 rating until I saw that scene. I think it's the only thing about this film that left me wanting more. It was original, and it was clever. It is the only thing that kind of shocked me, everything else I expected. I'm definently glad they added this scene to the film.In conclusion, I would see this film for the heck of it. It's not a complete waste of time, but it's not the best film ever either. If you liked the first film at all see this one, or even if you didn't, this one might make you like the first one more.",

The movie within a movie killings was already done in SCREAM #, and much better I might add.  And the killer in UL 2 is very predictably, although the motive is not.

The murder based on the screamfest legend being the most obvious (not to mention sickening) example of the lot, not to mention the implausibility of all the crap that happens afterwards, the security guard gives CCTV footage (possible murder evidence) a student she met just a day ago, why did she say she got fired again?And now for the...cough-cough...'acting', there's a girl in the movie who's supposed to be a bad actress, but seeing as the actress who plays her is a waste of space anyway, her portrayal looks like a bad attempt at a puppet show (that's not sarcasm, see for yourself).

Scenes that don't have anything to do with any major storyline are plentiful, and make up an estimated 85% of the 94 minutes that this movie wastes in any moviegoer's life. Actually, let me clarify something. The fact that there are numerous scenes that have nothing to do with any plot is explained very easily. THERE IS NO PLOT. I can't even say that there are major plot holes; for this movie was too bad to even have plot holes. You can't have holes in the plot, when there is no plot to butcher! What we get in Final Cut is a bunch of young people running around a campus making movies, when a few start to drop dead by the hand of an unknown psycho. Final Cut dares to associate itself, through various blatant hints dropped very NOT subtly throughout the film, with Hitchcock's classic horror pictures. Let me clarify something here. Hitchcock was a genius because his films actually scared people. A hero, throughout one of his films, would slowly gather clues to put together the puzzle that made everything come together in the end. Through it all, the audience would be in suspense, enjoying the fright and the mystery, soaking a twisted story up into their minds. Final Cut was nothing like a classic Hitchcock. We weren't scared for the main characters, because there was no character development to make us CARE about these college kids. We were not given clues that were gathered by a hero throughout the picture, slowly putting the pieces of the puzzle together. Final Cut meanders aimlessly for 90 minutes, with many a pointless scene, until it tries to cram killer, motive, and plot into the LAST 4 FREAKING MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. ARGH! It's c**p! Completely and thoroughly, there is absolutely nothing to save this movie from the horror of itself. (Not even the charm and humor of Anthony Anderson, who should fire his agent after a sound beating)",

I was a big fan of the first movie and was hoping very much that this wouldn't suck, which it did. . . a lot.  Near the end, the killer just starts randomly offing people just to get the body count up.  After about halfway through the movie, they just seemed to abandon the idea of URBAN LEGENDS being the focus of the killings.  When the killer is revealed everyone in the theater just thought \"ok- so what\"  The end of the first movie was at least SOMEWHAT interesting, this time the killer's motive just makes no real sense.  Then they throw on a surprise cameo at the end and the closing credits actually play the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS theme music. They should have quit while they were ahead and just not even bothered with this film.  Don't waste your time.",

It gives teen slasher movies a bad name and it gives sequels an even worse name.As cliche as these movies are becoming, at least, once in a while, they will come up with a unique idea.  Urban Legend (the first one) was one such movie.  The idea of a killer slashing people using different urban legends was a good idea.  It was even comical at times.  Throughout that movie, they used urban legends that were well known to everyone.  The audience could say, \"Hey, I've heard of that one.\"  Even the pop rocks and soda one got a good laugh out of everyone.I don't think I'd ever heard of any of the \"urban legends\" that were used in the sequel, except for the kidneys and ice bath one.  OK, maybe there is some book that has them all listed.  But I've never heard of the dog licking the girls hand to let her know everything is alright, or the screaming at midnight while a coed is murdered.  Where did those come from?The only saving points for this movie were some of the gruesome scenes, namely the girl's head getting chopped off and the dog eating her kidney, or the rats crawling in and out of the girl's throat.There were many parts of this movie that were just lame, especially the security guard and her \"wannabe Foxy Brown\" antics.

Hell, for that matter, I didn't even expect it to be all that good (same goes for its predecessor).  I rented it because I'm an urban legend junkie and I was interested in seeing which ULs they chose for the second movie.  The first movie wasn't great, but they did an excellent job of incorporating many of the various legends into it.Having gotten that out of the way, let me tell you why this movie sucked. If I happen to spoil this for anyone, well, you're the lucky one.  Wish someone had for me.To begin with, all of the characters were 1 dimensional (no, I won't even give them credit for being 2 dimensional).  There was absolutely nothing memorable about anyone.  I spent an hour and a half with the people, and the only name I can remember is Amy, and that's because someone mentioned her in their comments before.  Otherwise, they were all pretty forgettable, and thankfully so.Consistency is a big thing too (gods, I want to make so many comments here). If you're going to kill people using  a particular theme, don't kill your first 2 or 3 based on your theme and then just start killing the rest through boring, traditional means.  I mean, my gosh, there are enough ULs out there dealing with death that he could've killed all his victims based on one!  Let's not do a half-assed job....And on top of all of that, it wasn't even particularly scary!  I watched it on a Friday night at about midnight, by myself, in a house in the middle of no where that reminds me of the opening scene of the original SCREAM, and this movie didn't do *anything* for me.  No suspense, no thrills, no...nothing!  There wasn't even that much gore to make up for it! Personally, I thought there was *a lot* more in the first.And lastly, what the hell did the writer's do to come up with the identity of the killer?  I imagine them putting the names of all the characters in a hat, and the 10 stupidest reasons someone could have for killing a bunch of film students in another hat, and drawing a piece of paper out of both of them and putting it together (damn, I wish they had drawn the one with \"saw the sequel to URBAN LEGEND and went psycho\" out of the second hat....).  I'm all for making the killer as unpredictable as possible, but come on, asses aren't for pulling plot devices from.So, in closing, I really, really, *really* hated this movie.  Really.  I think they should've let the film students make it; they could've done a better job!",

            "content": "Presumably the director of `Urban Legends: Final Cut' is a John Carpenter fan, in that John Ottman is one of a select group of Hollywood directors that also compose their own soundtracks. The parallels don't end there, Ottman counts the soundtrack to `Halloween H2O' amongst his earlier work, so perhaps it is fitting that his first venture into director's chair should be a horror film.Of course things have moved on since Carpenter's heyday and so when I say `horror' film I do of course mean postmodern teen slasher movie. If we are going to be fussy then perhaps we could argue that Carpenter is a film director who also does soundtracks, whilst Ottman is clearly a fine composer.`Urban Legends: Final Cut' is the semi-sequel to the moderately successful 1998 film `Urban Legends' in which all-American college kids are butchered in an amusing fashion. Or so I should imagine being that I didn't watch the film. Thankfully, the sequel has expanded upon the original film's template by cleverly moving the action to a different American campus and slaughtering a different cast of attractive, but vaguely stupid, students\nThankfully the genius doesn't end there; in order to give the film it's ironic postmodern slant, our victims are all taking a film course. So is this the horror that film connoisseurs have been waiting for? Well, no, it's simply a poor excuse for a script so hackneyed to be pardoned for going hand-held in the woods.Unfortunately, the director decides to jettison the film's one original premise, that of murders committed in the style of the titular urban legends after one (admittedly gruesome) slaying. What the audience is left with is photo-fit bunch of totally unengaging Stepford students, played a cast of unknowns who, I am guessing, gained their previous acting experience as extras in `Dawson's Creek.' `Urban Legends: Final Cut' can best be described as Dawson's mates meet Scooby Doo, but without the benefit of a talking dog. So who will these meddling kids unmask the killer as - Is it?a) Simon, the dark and intense Russian? b) Travis or his secret twin, Trevor (yes Trevor)? c) Gram, the rich, spoiled movie brat? d) Mullet boy? e) Somebody else.?Well I didn't care and neither will you, the plot is significantly less suspenseful than the average episode of Buffy because you are actively willing all the characters to die (slowly.) The simple fact is that even the most avid `Fortean Times' reader knows that urban myths are basically bollocks, but as the movie's tagline reminds us `Legends Never Die.' While you may have to concede there is some truth to that statement there are always exceptions, and I am afraid to say this is one legend that is destined to die young.I hate to be totally negative about any film and on purely academic level, as a first time director, it is only fair to say John Ottman has proved himself competent. The movie looks fine and the acting, though hammy at times, is perfectly acceptable. However, the one true fault lies with the script. The writer seems to have confused the post modern with the derivative, admittedly there has always been a degree of self-parody in the recent reinvention of the slasher film. However, the recent release of `Scary Movie' spoofed the spoof to such an extent that we will unlikely be able to view this subgenre (semi) seriously again - even as a product of postmodernism.The only moment of abject terror I experienced during the course of the entire film took place when the lights went up as the final credits ended. I looked around an empty theatre only to realise the rest of the audience had fled. The only other human being in the room was a despondent looking PR woman from Columbia pictures, she smiled hopefully. I broke eye contact and as I headed rapidly towards the exit a standard horror movie mantra ran through my mind `Remember, never look back.'",

However, none of them in my opinion have been sucessful at it.  Even \"Scream\" 2 and 3 were not as good as the original.So I can't really explain why I even went to see this film, especially since I didn't even like the first \"Urban Legends\"  I guess it was because I was hoping I would be suprised and finally get to see the first good horror movie since the original \"Scream.\"  Needless to say I was very disapointed. It was predictable, boring, and just a waste of my time and money.However, I think my biggest complaint was that this movie was completly unoriginal.  The whole movie within a movie concept has been done before. So it made me think I was watching \"Scream 3\", only with different characters, and a different mask for the killer.  Even the death scenes were dumb.  I mean there is a difference between scary and just plain gory. Guess which one this one is?So in conclusion, if anyone reads this take this as a warning.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Unless you money to burn and nothing better to do.",

I've never seen a movie where so many doors slammed suddenly shut for no reason.Perhaps another level is added to the story by watching the original, but somehow I really doubt it. Scream 3 covered the idea of horror in the world of movies, and although that wasn't the greatest movie by quite a long way, it shines out as horror gold when compared to this.

I think that some of the characters from the original should have been included in this movie as well, besides Reese, who could have had a much more important role.  Since she survived the Pendleton University killings, why was she so doubtful about the Alpine University killings? Also, the way that the characters were killed?  I believe there was only one urban legend, and that one was given away in the previews!  True, there were discussions of urban legends (hello, the kids are filming movies about urban legends, what do you expect), but regular stabbing and strangling and shooting doesn't qualify.  The motives of the killer were completely random. However, the very very last scene in the movie was excellent and almost made the whole thing worth it.If you want to watch this movie, watch the original first.  It's much better and actually has a coherent plot and some scary moments.  But, if you must watch the sequel, I give it a 3/10.",

It is almost entirely predictable as well as unoriginal. As a result there's no suspense in it. Not even the most horrifying scenes, if there are even any, are of genuine drama. And the stars give very ordinary performances. And as if to add insult to injury, John Ottman seemingly does a very ordinary job as director, nothing at all like Hitchcock or Wes Craven.

The scene with the german shephard was cool.  I laughed my a** of when the Tom Savini wannabe said f*** George Lucas.  The security guard from the original also provided some humor(Her obsession with Pam Grier is expanded upon).

It's definitely better than I Still Remember What You Did Last Summer, and I liked it better than the first Urban Legend, too. I'd even say it's better than Scream 3.\n\nThe Scream movies get love for all the pop culture references and commentary, dialogue about the \"rules\" of horror films, extended sequences of Carpenter's Halloween being watched by characters, etc, and I Know What You Did Last Summer also plays to the urban legend thing.\n\nBut Urban Legends: Final Cut both directly addresses and also applies the elements that make great films. I don't hear people talking about mise-en-scene in a Wes Craven movie. I really loved the framing and the camera work in UL: Final Cut. It has great lighting and mood. And I love Jennifer Morrison, so that helps too. It also had a few kills that were more clever, I thought, than anything in the Scream or Last Summer franchises.\n\nI have a strong suspicion that the subtitle was NOT the choice of the director. It just doesn't fit with the impression I get from the filmwork, and I can easily believe a dumb shit studio executive slapped it on there because they thought it was \"edgy\".

Unfortunately, there is next to zero tension in this Scream rip-off and thanks largely to a highly predictable climax in which Roger Ebert's Theory on the Economy of Characters is a factor.   We know who the killer is from the start, and the red herrings provided just serve to make this lame thriller feel even longer.",

The acting was average at best, the twin aspect of the movie is silly and completely unnecessary, the movie tries so hard to establish one of the characters as the obvious killer, that it's obviously not him and the characters were so stupid that it became infuriating.

The answer is no.In this film, Amy Mayfield, a young film student, has to make a short film as an end-of-course work. She decides to make a film in which a murderer kills his victims by recreating famous urban legends. Everything is going well until people really start to die, at the hands of a mysterious murderer.Well, what we have here is the same recipe used in the first film. The difference is that, as we have already seen it, it does not surprise us. It's just another horror movie for teenagers, with a plot so weak that it's not even worth talking about it. It will shatter at the first pull as if it were a rotten rag. The cast is very weak, almost amateur. Jennifer Morrison, the lead actress, does nothing particularly good. She just does what has to be done. There are, however, some moments where it seems that the film makes some little veiled criticisms, but quickly leaves that aside. The ending is perhaps the best part of the film.Despite being, in general, a frankly bad and forgettable film, it was a step forward in the career of many of those involved. Actresses like Eva Mendes, Matthew Davis or Jennifer Morrison had, shortly after, the opportunity to do more serious work: Mendes, for example, will have the opportunity to appear in \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" and Davis will cost to establish himself but, after years of small appearances, he will finally did it with \"Vampire Diaries\". Even the director, John Ottman, will discover that he is a terrible director but has a knack for other things in cinema, as music. So, I think this film fulfilled an objective and served a purpose, although perhaps many of those involved hide it on the bottom shelf of their filmography.",
