            "content": "\"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" follows a group of fanatics obsessed with the Blair Witch legend in the aftermath of the film's first release. Among them are a mentally-unstable local; a husband-and-wife team of graduate students studying the Blair Witch; a self-proclaimed Wiccan; and a depressive goth. The five camp out in the ruins of Rustin Parr's home, where the Blair Witch tapes were \"found,\" and experience a mental blackout in which they each fail to recount several hours of the night. In a daze and confusion, they retreat to the group leader's warehouse- turned-home, where their individual psychological breakdowns lead them to a disturbing truth.I'm just going to say it outright: I love this film. It was, and continues to be met with hostility from fans of the original, which still quite frankly baffles me. It's not nearly as terrifying as the original film, but it is ingenious in its own way. Rather than approach a sequel with a rehash of the first film's material, co-writer/director Joe Berlinger offers something different: a narrative within a world in which \"The Blair Witch Project\" was real footage\u2014 a world inhabited by characters who range from unabashed believers to academic skeptics, to people who simply \"thought the movie was cool.\"With a common interest, they set out into the woods to find some evidence\u2014but all goes awry when one of the women suffers a premonitory miscarriage, and they are forced to retreat to the leader's home, which is where the film becomes a full-blooded psychological thriller. What is real, and what isn't? Where is the Blair Witch? Outside, lurking in the forest? Possessing one of the characters? Is she even there at all?These are the kinds of questions the script toys with, and the result is wildly engaging. The performances are top-notch, and the film is peppered with disturbing scenes and images, and some ghoulish scenarios. The score lends an oppressive tone to the movie, and it is steeped in an atmosphere of complete unease that grows more and more pervasive as the five characters bear witness to the inexplicable. The film plays its cards well and is careful in its subtlety, which leads to a downbeat and twisted conclusion.Overall, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" has been harshly criticized by fans who it seems haven't taken the time to try and understand what it's attempting to do. It is not a rehash of the original film, and it never aims to be. The approach taken is commendable and rather brilliant, and it manages to establish an ever-increasing sense of oppressiveness that grows on the audience, which is the real catch here in my opinion\u2014it is genuinely unnerving to watch, and that's something rare these days. 8/10.",

Yes, it's pretty dumb and no where near what the original was, but what I liked is that the people in the film are aware of the existence of The Blair Witch Project, and in the beginning it even has some nice clips from real reviews. I was entertained throughout this whole film, and enjoyed the twists and turns, even though, yes, they are pretty ludicrous. The overall plot is suspenseful and mysterious, and why would anyone expect the same thing as the original? I can see why as a sequel it would not work, but as a stand-alone horror film, I thought it got the job done well. Oh well, I guess I am easy to please...",

            "review_title": "wan sequel to a true original",
            "content": "In all the print that has been devoted to the original `Blair Witch Project,' most of the discussion has been centered around the remarkable advertising strategy that managed to parley a quirky, low budget independent film into a multimillion-dollar box office success story.   Of far greater interest actually is the arc the film traveled in terms of its critical and audience reception.  Actually, this phenomenon can be easily charted by scrolling through the reviews of the film found on either imdb.com or amazon.com.  If you look first at the earliest evaluations of the film - when it was still an unknown entity riding the film festival circuit - you will note the almost universally rapturous response the movie received from viewers caught off guard by the originality of its concept and the uniqueness of its execution.  However, if you continue to scroll through the reviews with the passage of time, you will notice a rather extraordinary development that occurs.   At about the time the film officially opens to immense media scrutiny and unprecedented box office success, the reviews suddenly undergo an amazing change in tone.  Due to the buildup of expectations resulting from the above elements, viewers begin to tear the film apart, mercilessly declaring it to be cheapjack, annoying, hopelessly overrated and totally lacking in terror or suspense.  Rarely have I ever seen such a violent backlash against any film (though just try to find someone who will admit to liking `Titanic' nowadays - one begins to wonder just who were all those people who collectively managed to fork over all that cash to the tune of $600,000,000 in the United States and Canada alone).  In many ways, though `The Blair Witch Project' may have made a ton of money (it is easily the most profitable film ever made), it may ultimately have been a pyrrhic victory for its makers since an audience that feels it has been `ripped off' once is not one who will be favorably inclined towards your next project.Perhaps this helps to explain the dismal box office performance of the sequel, awkwardly entitled `Book of Shadows: Blair Witch Project 2.'  As one who actually liked the original film (and, yes, I saw it long after the initial media hype had died down), I can't say that I expected much from this newest addition to the franchise.  The first film was such a unique work stylistically that, even less than most films, it definitely did not cry out for replication.  Actually, this new film starts off rather well, choosing to acknowledge the reality of not only the original project but also the media ballyhoo and frenzy that attended it.  The film cleverly lampoons the cottage industry that sprang up around the first film, catering to tourists who descended in droves on the once-peaceful town of Burkittsville, Maryland, where the original fictional `documentary' was set. Taking over the reins from the first film's creators, writer Dick Beebe and writer/director Joe Berlinger create a scenario in which a group of fans, obsessed with the original film, embark on a `Blair Witch' tour that, naturally, turns out to be more than they bargained for.  By eschewing fancy special effects of any kind and hewing closely to the `reality' conferred by its documentary style approach, the original film managed to convey a real sense of mounting terror as the people involved became more and more terrified and confused by what was happening to them.  The makers of the sequel attempt to create essentially the same impact here but with far less effectiveness.  Part of the problem is that the demands made on a big budget studio production are obviously worlds apart from those made on a small independent film in which experimentation and imagination are often allowed - and even, at times, encouraged - to flourish.  As a result, the makers of the new film violate the very less-is-more credo that made the original film work in the first place.  Thus, as these new characters begin to spiral down into confusion, terror and madness, we are offered a plethora of quick cut glimpses of demons, ghosts, flashbacks etc. that are more distracting than terrifying.  We could believe what was happening to the characters in the original film because the single-camera technique made it all seem so plausible and real.  This film just feels like the typical stock horror film, filled with fancy techniques but little of the stuff that true nightmares are made of.  More often than not, the viewer feels more like laughing at the silliness of the proceedings than gasping.  Eventually, even the dialogue seems to be providing an almost subconscious running commentary on the film itself as the characters yell out at various points such pearls of wisdom as `This is too weird' and `This makes no sense.'The story does a nice job at the end showing how what is captured on film or tape may not necessarily correlate with the facts of history.  And, I guess, we are also encouraged to read the film in two ways - as both a genuine horror story in which the Blair Witch is somehow exercising her supernatural powers or as a study of mass psychosis playing havoc with a group of emotionally off-kilter people.  Yet, in the long run, `Book of Shadows' just doesn't seem worth the effort.  Any way you slice it, a horror film that doesn't horrify has failed to live up to its calling.  Stick with the original model this time around.",

            "content": "Rewatched Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows last night for the first time in like 20 years. I remember liking it when I was a kid, but was kind of shocked at how much I enjoyed it.I definitely think this is an unfairly maligned film and don't quite understand the hate or the 4.0 imdb user rating.Don't get me wrong, it's far from a masterpiece, but at least Book of Shadows tried to do something different with the Blair Witch lore. A solid attempt was made to preserve and integrate all the faux \"history\" into the story. Yes, there are plot holes, and some ridiculous scenes, but overall the cast and acting are above average for a horror film, and I thought it did adequately carry a fair bit of suspense throughout.Having seen both recently, I think Book of Shadows is a far superior film to 2016's \"Blair Witch\", which I thought was a pretty shallow rehash of the original with no original ideas or even the most minimal attempt to expand upon the given mythology.",

            "review_title": "Unfairly Panned, Misunderstood, Little Horror Gem",
            "content": "An incredibly misunderstood horror film, Book of Shadows is a taut, suspenseful, and well acted psychological thriller- that doesn't rely on gimmicks or cliches (old or new) to entertain and fright its audience. To start with the flaws of this film, the thing that sticks out most to me is the editing. Things don't seem to have a clear map of how they are being told at times, which was mainly due to studio interference unfortunately, as they thought it would appeal better to audiences. Instead, the film loses its charm and suspense a bit in the process, which is a flaw even the director himself has recognized, and was deeply irritated the studio forced upon his film. The music in the film also seems kinda out of place, also do to the studio involvement I am guessing, to appeal to target audiences I suppose, but seriously, trashy grunge rock does not belong in a Blair Witch movie. As for the positive things about this film, here are my thoughts. This film is certainly not a disaster, as it was claimed back when it was released, and still is often enough now. This film is very well thought out, very complex, and it kept me entertained all throughout. It feels a lot more down to earth than the previous film, not showy, or forced in any sort of way. Its story is unnerving, and its performances are very well done, especially lead actor Jeffrey Donovan. I was truly invested in what was happening on screen, I was never bored, in total, I liked it better than the original. It also has an interesting social commentary component to it as well, as well as many twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the very end. In the end, I enjoyed the hell out of this film, and i'm not afraid to admit it. It's a shame the film doesn't receive the credit it deserves, as well as the studio interference it clearly didn't need. Hear me out on this one, give it a try sometime.\nMy Rating: 8.5/10",

            "content": "It's disappointing to see that this film has been hit with such a low rating, because I for one thought it was a pretty good flick.I was curious to see how the makers of the original film would go about creating the sequel, and I had the idea that they'd just totally cash in on BWP and make a movie solely about the Blair Witch with fancy special effects and lots of blood and guts, requiring the viewer to simply kick back and not think.  You know, like so many other Hollywood movies these days that milk a concept for all it's worth at the expense of the story.  Thankfully, the makers didn't take this route.  Book of Shadows doesn't rely on blood and gore, nor special effects.  There is little in the way of jump-in-your-seat-frights, if any, but that's not a bad thing.  It contains a pretty decent story, which at times, is quite chilling.  The acting was fairly good as well, except the guy who played the sheriff.  I felt he went just a little over the top..If you haven't seen it, and are wary about it, take a chance and do so.  Not exactly a 'sequel' in the traditional sense and more of a stand alone film (though I recommend seeing the first film beforehand), you can't go wrong. Good movie!",

I tried very quickly of everyone saying how beautiful that particular emperor's clothes were.The second film is actually much better, although most people, having slavishly (and inexplicably) dedicated themselves to the rambling and decidedly un-scary first film, will not be willing to choke this one down. It's more of a mainstream horror film, meaning it has a plot and some vague sense of thematics.It is the theme which most people missed that I found the most interesting. The camera in this film turns on itself, and shows that once something has been filmed, it takes on a life of its own apart from the realm of what we call fact or fiction.  I'm reminded of Robert Wisdom who said in Todd Solondz's generally superior _Storytelling_ that \"once you put it on paper, it all becomes fiction.\"  It's the same concept here, with film.  A story which may or may not be true, turning itself inside out so many times that neither the audience nor the characters know for sure what the truth is anymore.  It's a cautionary message and a reprimand which seems to have generally gone unheeded.I'll probably see this again.",

I don't even know where else they could have gone with it that would have been praised by the fans.What we have here is a completely underrated movie. I get that people didn't understand it, that it's confusing, but I think that was the point. The filmmakers wanted to you to feel like the main cast. Another great thing is that it MESSES with your mind in ways that few movies can. To top it off the score to this movie is atmospheric nightmare-ish that really brings out the creepy factor in this film.Just go in with an open mind. Don't think about it being a Blair Witch sequel, think of it as a mind bender. It leaves you with questions, and people don't like that, but that just means you can have your own theory as to what happened. Very few movies allow this, and the few movies that do don't do it as well as this one.I love this movie and I hope one day they will release it on Blu-Ray.",

            "review_title": "Wanting as a film, perfect as a sequel!",
            "content": "In an article titled \"Telling the Untold Stories of The Blair Witch Project\", the writer thoroughly explains how, following the absolutely incredible success of TBWP, the small independent studio which has come together for the sake of producing the film was bought by Artisan (which produced the sequel). The original creators told Artisan to give the hype (both praise and backlashes) time to die down before releasing a sequel, for which they had many profound ideas. However, Artisan weren't there for the story, for the sake of creativity or to continue the groundbreaking original creation. They were there for the money. They bought out the rights for the franchise in order to ride it out and milk it dry, and that meant striking at the iron while it's still hot from all the buzz around the original film. That meant a sequel, stat.The aforementioned article refers to Book of Shadows as an \"atrocious\" film which has completely buried the franchise, snuffing out the flame of what had the potential of becoming a supernatural Horror masterpiece. It even compared it to Batman & Robin, a symbol of bad cinema. I'm here to tell you otherwise. Not because I'm some juvenile rebel or a pathetic edge-lord saying bad=good for the sake or controversy, but because I truly and honestly feel Book of Shadows got a raw deal. I am here to say it was the perfect sequel to TBWP.First - the setting. Thousands making the journey, indeed the pilgrimage, to the black hills woods where the original film was shot, or rather - where allegedly the footage made by the original missing students was found. The small town has become a tourist attraction, and everybody has an opinion. Some enjoy the extra attention. Some want to be left alone and feel invaded. And some like to live out the good ol' fashioned American dream and make some money by offering tourist attractions. That's how four tourists (again, with names identical to the actual cast for the whole authenticity effect) find themselves on a commercial tour. That's how things start going wrong.The choice of stereotypical characters is very reminiscent of classic slashers. One \"Wiccan\" who never misses an opportunity to state how offended she is by how witches are perceived as evil beings when they're actually \"daughters of nature\"; one Goth poser claiming to be a psychic; a romantic couple made out of one believer (perception creates reality) and one sceptic (group delusion and mass hysteria); and the tour manager, a stoner with a past of mental illnesses. However, each character is developed beautifully, in a manner which offers excellent service to the plot. By the end, anyone paying attention will have been able to point out exactly why each character type was chosen for the film.Finally, what really makes Book of Shadows great is that it truly feels like a fan-art film made for a cult classic, even though it came out just one year after the original. I watched TBWP yesterday, and Book of Shadows made me feel it's been ages. The narrative driving the plot presents the entire phenomenon as ridiculous, mocking those na\u00efve and indeed pathetic enough to fall for the publicity stunt of the original film, all the while showing blunt and harsh scenes which create a lot more than reasonable doubt regarding the involvement of a supernatural force. The ending, of course, is the final spectacular step and is an excellent conclusion, combing a plot twist with a tragic outcome.Now, yes, the entire film is too much of a franchise blowing its own horn and ascending itself into the status of a cult classic. That's vanity bordering narcissism. But don't forget these are different creators and a different studio, so they're basically paying homage to the original creators. Yes, they're doing so in order to build the foundations for their own future success, but still, it feels honest and innocent in the film itself.Book of shadows isn't TBWP. It isn't supposed to be. It isn't a cinematic breakthrough, it isn't the invention of a new genre, and it isn't an act of genius. But it is the PERFECT sequel to TBWP, and I hope at least some of you can recognize that and enjoy this amazing film without letting the critics control you into hating it. As a cinematic creation - a 6/10; as a specific sequel to TBWP - a solid 10/10; that would make it an 8/10 in average, so I added one more point on account of my personal experience and pleasure. Atrocious? No. This is how you make a sequel to a masterpiece. Buried the franchise? Sadly, yes, for over a decade, but in my humble opinion - for every single wrong reason in the book.",

One such group books onto a `Blair Witch Hunt' tour to camp in the woods and see the sights. When they awake the next morning to find their camera equipment smashed, 5 hours unaccounted for and their film hidden in the same spot as the film from the original movie they are unsure what happened.  However as they replay the video tape they notice some very weird things.Undeterred by bad reviews I decided to watch this film on television the other night.  Initially I was impressed by the idea, instead of following the original movie, the sequel twists the idea of the original as a documentary and presents it as a film but then uses the film to present another story that is `in the real world'.  Conceptually this was quite clever and I was drawn in by it.  Sadly this didn't last very long and it wasn't long before it became quite an ordinary film that wasn't creepy in any way and was actually quite dull.The plot is interesting \u0096 interesting enough to keep me watching anyway. The twists are the end are meant to be horrifying and perhaps surprising but by then all they got out of me was an `oh' of vague interest.  For most of the film it is noisy chat and fake surprises and creepy goings-on.  They didn't work as the film felt very trashy and uninvolving.  The gore and flashed edits of violence were supposed to keep us guessing I think but they only served to numb me to the film, as did the occasional dream/fantasy sequence.  It was a shame as it was a clever idea and had some good bits in it but the delivery let it down.The direction is very plain and doesn't manage to build an air of suspense anywhere near as well as in the original, resulting in a rather boring series of scenes punctuated by `scares' that don't work.  The cast don't really help either, they don't come across as real people and it is hard to care for such as self important group of people who are walking stereotypes \u0096 the goth, the witch, the college boy etc.  At least in the original we got to see them break down and become more afraid during the film \u0096 here they could be the cast from any teen horror movie.As you may have guessed I'm not a big fan of teen slasher movies but Blair Witch was much more than that and traded on atmosphere \u0096 that was it's strength.  By throwing in gore from the very start and having tonnes of little imagined scenes of horror, Book of Shadows loses that strength and becomes a movie that lives and dies on it's ability to scare.  Sadly the originally good idea doesn't scare and remains `interesting' and nothing more.  It is a shame that they had to make this film as it won't satisfy those who like their horror creepy or those who like it bloody.",

            "content": "BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2 / (2000) * (out of four)\"The Blair Witch Project\" was a one of a kind hit; it had original ideas and a story about three filmmakers who become lost in a local wooded area while filming a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch. That was one of the best movies of last year, and now \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" is clearly one of this year's worst. It is completely contradictory to the original, contains not a single character we care about, and is recycled from about every other horror film released within the past five years. After comparing the two movies I am disturbed.\"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" (the title is meaningless) has not one strand of decent plot impression. There is just scene after scene detailing an assortment of unfocused misfits on a field trip to see the related sights and settings of where events in \"The Blair Witch Project\" took place. There is Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) the leader, an ex-patient at a mental hospital, Stephen (Stephen Turner) who is writing a book on the \"Blair Witch\" phenomenon, in the company of his girlfriend, Tristen (Tristen Skylar), who is pregnant but is hoping for a miscarriage. Also among them is Kim (Kim Director) a Goth, and Erica (Erica Leerhsen) another practicing Wicca who wants the Blair Witch to be her mentor. These characters smoke a seemingly endless amount of pot, apparently engage in ritualistic sex, had have strange experiences when they wake up the day after they set camp having no recollection of what happened the night before.There is such a struggle for good storyline the filmmakers provide the characters with excessively blunt dialogue to reveal important information and plot points. However, to get anything out of the writing, one would have to care about the characters, and the movie provides no reason anywhere for us to concern ourselves with any of the characters. There is no development or introduction, nor does the film contain any motive or reason. This is unfortunate because the only thing holding the movie together is the mystery of what occurred during the five hours the group cannot remember. How are we to concerned ourselves with the inactive conflict if we do not care about any of the characters?Perhaps the biggest flaw with \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" (and there are many) is the fact that it is never scary or suspenseful. I was somewhat curious about what happened to the characters during those mysterious five hours, but there is no clarification. Some of the scenes have potential to involve us with horrific material, but never on the recognizable level of the original \"Blair Witch Project.\" The film often builds tension, but forgets, or does not know how to relieve it. The sequences that do attempt to answer our disputes are cluttered and distraught, although they do contain disgusting, disturbing, and violent nightmare imagery. What really bothers me with movies these days is how so many provide inquisitive, thought-provoking questions but never the long-awaited answers. A specific scene in the movie has one of the characters ask what is happening. I think just about everyone in the audience had the same question on their mind\u0085the movie has no answers.",

            "content": "Movies that do not walk you through it and leave some interpretation are great in my book. Blair Witch 2 is one of those movies. The ending had me confused at first and then I thought about it. As I see it there are 2 different possibilities. There's the idea that what you saw the characters do is actually what happened and then the Blair Witch doctored the tapes and killed those people. I find this idea a little hard to believe because the whole thing with messing with the tapes is strange but it is the Blair Witch after all. The other idea is that they blacked out or were seeing things different when the crimes happened. Like when Kim had that confrontation with the clerk Peggy. What she thought happened was she got p****d at Peggy stormed out while leaving the cash. But what the tapes revealed was that she cut Peggy's throat. So Kim thought she didn't kill Peggy but I think she did. I believe the second theory because in the beginning Jeff says that film lies but video always tells the truth, we saw the film but the video cameras were the video. I even listened to the commentary track and the director even says himself that there are many possibilities. Whew! Enough explanation of the ending (hope I didn't ruin it). They movie is kind of ironic in the fact that it is making a big deal about the commotion of the first movie and that it was in fact not true. Lots of dream shots and other things to freak you out. I highly recommend seeing this. Plus the music rocks (like that sweet credits tune)",

This was steady and I am like holy crap I can see what is happening. So what it was a sequel. It was still better than the first.As for bad acting, BWP first one was bad. Girl holding a camera under her nose showing snot coming out for about 15 minutes saying she is scared and hearing noises in the woods and crying is not scary. It is something you send to funniest home videos. What was that 5 minute black out screen in the first one? To hear other people go WTH in the dark? That was stupid too. Then you say the first BWP surpasses this one.Now we know who falls for dumb movies. I seen it once of the first one, and that is more than enough times for it. I should of not went to it. I regret going to it. This one I could see so many time and be happy afterwords. What the heck is scary about just F words every sentence like in the first BWP. All that and you thought it was scary. F*ck this and F*ck that is nothing to be scared about. I say it all the time and it is not anything to be scared about. That was the only reason that movie got a rated R rating.Besides the F words it would of been PG. This one had blood and gore, the first one did not. I still any day prefer this over the first one. I would not even have it left in area of my stocked movie of the first BWP. This Book of Shadows would be in my stock. Burn the first one I say.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.I admit that I was late to the Blair Witch party. The problem was that no one told me I would encounter intelligent ideas here. And that's in large part because few people who see these films get the ideas behind them. I've talked out the first film in the appropriate place. This film is multidimensionally self-referential.The first intelligent about it is that it is not a sequel of the first film, but a sequel of the phenomenon of the first film: that event where viewers were titilated with the notion that it was fact not fiction: that the drama on film represented real events. That first film played with the difference between film and video technologies but did not develop it (sorry for the pun). Here, that difference becomes the fulcrum for all the mystical happenings. The 35 mm `film' part of the movie is the element that is haunted, not any person or place. The video is `true.'This idea was recently seen in `Cut,' where the film itself is the beast, manipulating the people who make it who incidentally are the people in it. A more intelligent, involved expression of this was `Shadow of the Vampire.' What makes `Book,' interesting is how it merges this central device with two others. (This makes it interesting in spite of the childish references to horror films, the trite script and the immature acting.)The first of these is the technique of `framing' a narrative. (`Moulin Rouge' is the champion here, where it is a stage play, within which it is an aria, within which is a novel, within which it is an absynthe vision and on and on.) Here, we have the original book. `Shadows' was an early term for film, a term still used in some schools. The screenplay is a book about movies and related ideas. Within that we have the movie that starts on screen. Within that, we have another book, one about the first Blair Witch movie. At each step of the way, we can believe if we want that everything that follows is a result of artifice of the framing device. So the what we see is being manipulated by the author of the Book of Shadows, and he (she?) creates a lesser goddess who manipulates in a slightly smaller universe.But wait! The traditional framing is one-dimensional: everything fits within the bigger frame like Russian dolls. But here we have parallel master frames: You could choose to start with the crazy tour leader, who is having a grand hallucination while in the looneybin, leading to the `broom' factory (get it?), or maybe it starts like `the Interview' with the sheriff's creation of the truth (he does say that he had the video edited). Or maybe it starts with telepathic control of the goth girl. In fact, we have three outer frames that overlap. You gets to choose which one is the path that the film takes to haunt itself. There also is a serial stepping through realms like was masterfully done with `Ninth Gate.' This starts in the central section where the players/suspects are all together at the factory and they begin reviewing the tapes. So we have the coffin rock deal, the sex vision, the execution vision, the owl eating vision, and so on. These are the nine gates, clearly copied from Polanski. So our three hapless heros advance through stages of awareness and action until they see that their world is one composed entirely of false narrative, like `Dark City,' or the more complex `eXistenZ.'Ideas like this are too precious to waste on untalented producers and viewers. Apparently we have both in this case.",

            "review_title": "Interesting Premise Plagued by Studio Interference",
            "content": "To start this off, my sister and I got this DVD pretty early into it coming out. We both really liked The Blair Witch Project and when we heard there was a sequel, we were excited. We both liked it for different reasons from the original. I've seen this movie a handful of times throughout the year. I could see that it falls short of the original, but has some interesting aspects for sure. The synopsis is a group of tourists arrive in Burkittsville, Maryland after seeing The Blair Witch Project to explore the mythology and phenomenon, only to come face to face with their own neuroses and possibly the witch herself.We start by being shown different television programs giving a feel of how much of an impact the original had. This film establishing that the mythology of the Blair Witch is real, but admits that the film was just a film. We also see that Burkittsville has become a tourist attraction and the residents, despite wanting it or not, have capitalized on it. We meet one such resident of Jeffrey Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan).He makes tiki-men from sticks from the Black Hills, sells dirt from the Rustin Parr ruins as well as t-shirts, coffee mugs and things to this effect. He states that he didn't get to see the film when it opened, because he was in the hospital. There's hesitation to what he says and we see why. Jeff was in a mental hospital.He also runs a tour of the woods where the Blair Witch was filmed. This is actually his inaugural tour group, but his website is a bit misleading about it. The group he's taking out is made up of Stephen Ryan Parker (Stephen Baker Turner), Tristen Ryler (Tristine Skyler) and Erica Geerson (Erica Leerhsen). Stephen and Tristen are a couple that are writing a book about the Blair Witch and whether it was history or hysteria. She is also pregnant. We learn later that she doesn't really want to seem to want to keep it where Stephen does. Erica is a witch of the Wiccan faith and wants the Blair Witch to guide her.They stop at the cemetery to pick up the last member of the group, a gothic woman named Kim Diamond (Kim Director). The movie subtle introduces she might have a touch of psychic abilities. They stop off at a gas station to get beer and food. It should also be pointed out that we get brief flashes of things that we will see much later on as well. We also learn that a crime was committed at some point with Jeff, Stephen and Kim being accused of committing it.Jeff brings a bunch of equipment out with them. He sets up a bunch of cameras and has camping gear. They are going to spend the night in the Rustin Parr ruins. The first odd thing is that there is a giant tree in the middle of the ruins, which wouldn't make sense, since the house was built in the 1800s and the tree is much older than that. It would have been built around it. No one aside from Jeff finds this odd though.The group parties pretty hard. They have a lot of beer and marijuana. They are having a good time until another tour group shows up. An argument ensues with the other group claiming they have permit to shoot footage there. Jeff calls them on the validity of this. To avoid a fight, Stephen thinks quickly and tells them they saw something at Coffin Rock. The other group leaves.The group continues to party to the point of blacking out. They wake up the next morning to find all of the cameras have been smashed and all of the work that Tristen and Stephen has been destroyed. Jeff believes it was the other group, but then accuses Kim, because she claims to see where the tapes are. They are exactly where The Blair Witch Project tapes were found. They leave the woods when Tristen is bleeding.It turns out that she had a miscarriage. Everyone goes back to Jeff's so he can watch the tapes and figure out what happened. Things continue to get weirder and weirder where people start to see a little girl, they have strange markings on themselves and people black out for periods of time, not knowing what they did. The tapes are also not showing what happened to them during their blackout and the large tree is not there.There's where I want to leave this and I will say again, this is an interesting sequel to The Blair Witch Project. This one is more of a traditional horror film, unlike its predecessor that is of course, found footage. I've always been under the impression, if this would have had any other name, it would be better. I can see now that isn't necessarily the case as the Blair Witch aspects are really ingrained.Where I want to shift this first is hiring Joe Berlinger to write/director this film. He is a documentary filmmaker with doing the Paradise Lost docs are being his most famous for me. The infamous aspect is that studio interference took the product me made and added stuff to make it more traditional. Many are wanting his cut of the movie and it would be interesting to see for sure.What I do really like here is the idea that what is on film lies and perception is really what we make of our reality. I feel this helps bridge what we get in The Blair Witch Project to Blair Witch. I love that this movie has hidden messages in it. We see things play out and then we get to see what the truth of it all through the tapes that are played. There isn't necessarily anything supernatural here, but it could be argued for. What I really like though is this correlates to the research that Stephen and Tristen are doing with is this supernatural or hysteria causing people to do what happened.The real driving force here is the acting, but I don't think it is great across the board. I really like Donovan in the role that he's playing. He just comes off as this wild and crazy guy. We don't really even need the scenes of him in the mental hospital as that just feels like overkill. Skyler is solid in the role she has. I'm not a fan of Stephen, but I think that Turner plays the role very well. Leerhsen we get to see nude so that's nice and she did fine for what was needed. I do like Director for sure as well as Lanny Flaherty as Sheriff Cravens. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.Next would be the effects. This movie is really playing a lot with things might not be real. To really play this up we get flashes of scenes and it isn't until the reveal that we get a better look. There is a bit of CGI, but to be honest, it was used pretty creepy for me. The practical effects are good and I think that the cinematography was well done also. I don't really have any complaints there.The last thing would be the soundtrack. I think this is something else that Berlinger wasn't a fan of. It does feature a lot of 'neu-metal' that was popular at the time. Not really the music I was listening to, but it does tickle a bit of nostalgia. It does seem to fit for what they needed as well. The movie also uses sounds well in making characters think something and then realize it isn't real as well.Now with that said, this movie isn't as bad as some people claim, but I do think we have some missed opportunities as well. The playing with perception here to what they think happened and to what really did is interesting. The acting I think for the most part is pretty solid across the board. This movie is shot very well and I think the effects we got were good. The soundtrack isn't necessarily my thing, but I do still think it fits for what is needed. As I've said, I've seen it a bunch of times. I can see its flaws and I think it is above average, but falling pretty short of being good.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10",

Then have all the so-called actors yell and scream a lot to show how really deep they are.But the grand prize goes to Jeffrey Donovan, who is so bad that even John Waters wouldn't cast him if they happened to run into each other somewhere on the streets of Baltimore. And if he did, he would have had the sense to play this crap for high camp, because playing it seriously only succeeds in producing a banal, juvenile and completely unimaginative dung heap.What amazes me most is the bombastic and pretentious commentary track on the DVD.

The way they lead into this film showing the fallout from the first movie, even real TV celebrity reviews of the movie, was nicely done. The way they go around Burkittsville, interviewing townsfolk who are still a little miffed by all of the unwanted pub and fascination with their quaint little town is a bit humorous, or the ones that are glad for all of the attention, especially the ones who have figured out ways to cash in on it, by selling sticks and rocks in the shape of the 'Constantine Cross' that was the infamous calling card of the witch in the first movie.Was the movie scary? Yeah, it's pretty creepy how all of these poor souls just keep finding out horrible things they did and have no memory whatsoever of any of it. This, of course, leads to a slow descent into madness and paranoia and accusations as things become more and more unraveled at the seems.

The movie is certainly less suspenseful but offers a little more gore and shock value coppled with a lot of really good heavy metal music.  I liked the movie and it actually reminded me more of the \"Tales from the Crypt\" shows than the \"The Blair Witch Project\".

Viewers have now latched onto found footage as a style, but at the time following the release of the first film the idea was simply seen as a gimmick to get people to pay to watch a movie with zero budget.

With the out of the way town of Burkillsville being flooded with tourists to get a glimpse of the Blair witch who's supposed to be hiding in the Black Hills outside of town a group of collage students go on a fact finding mission to do a documentary on the Witch and all the rumors surrounding her. It's early in the movie that we see that this fact finding mission went terribly wrong with the entire group ether in custody by the local Sheriff Cravens,Lenny Flahety, or dead. What exactly happened is told in flashback by the surviving students that makes up almost all of the time in the movie.The actors who play the students who for some strange reason use their actual first names in the characters that they play in the film-Jeffery Erica Kim and Steven-are also being held for a number murders in the Black Hill area! Including the Satanic ritual like and brutal killing and dismembering of five foreign tourists at the infamous Coffin Rock. That's where back in the 1880's five prospectors were found murdered and dismembered the exact same way. What we have in the movie is a number of lost hours that the students can't explain when all this murdering happened. It's in the video tape they they took that the secret of what really happened to the students and those killed in the movie is finally revealed. An the revelations on those tapes when their played back at Shariff Cravens office are truly shocking especially to those, the students,on them! ****MAJOR SPOILERS**** A lot better the the original \"Blair Witch Porject\" but still not all that earth shaking \"Blair Witch II\" keeps you guessing just what's going on in the film in that everyone in it seems to be suffering from, like victims kidnapped by aliens from outer space, lost time syndrome. You never quite know what's going on is real or imaginary until the movie is finally over. It's then that you and the students, or those still alive, find out that they were in fact victims of the Blair Witch not in any harm she did to them but made them do themselves. As well as those unfortunate enough to come in contact with them!P.S The movie on both video tape and DVD disk has a special section explaining a number of incidents that supposed to have hidden meaning to what was really going on in it. The explanations are so confusing and senseless that by the time you end up seeing them you end up being even more confused in just how confusing they are and have nothing at all to do with the story!",

Director is stunning in Blair Witch II and demonstrates how amazingly gifted in a role that is difficult to forget. Her work here will haunt you long after the motion picture has ended, incredibly memorable for the unique look and talent she brings to this otherwise forgettable piece. In several scenes it is hard to catch one's breath as she acts purely with her fantastic eyes, expressing emotions few actors ever can. The pure horror she feels seems to come from the depths of her soul, so realistically powerful that it is nothing less than astounding. This motion picture has one element in it that overwhelms the viewer and which makes it essential viewing: the presence of one of the finest thespian artists of our time in the person of Ms. Kim Director.",

            "content": "How does one set out to produce a sequel to probably the biggest mainstream Hollywood gatecrasher in history? For Artisan, the answer is that you don't. Not really.Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, while attempting to extend the Blair Witch mythology, maneuvering it into the treacherous franchise waters, is instead an excursion into the hysteria surrounding the first film.\nFRANCHISE THIS!The Blair Witch Project made silver screen history by parlaying what was, by Hollywood standards, a no budget production, into a phenomenon. But when this inevitable sequel was pushed through production, a much more polished but just as murky film was the result.For BW2, Joe Berlinger -- best known for the documentary, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (and Paradise Lost 2) -- was brought on board, subsequently seizing an actual budget and creating a piece that, while reveling in a self-awareness of the first film and its mystique, does its best to subject another group of woods-bound youngsters and viewers to psychological and other forms of terror.The first fifteen minutes or so of the film is probably the best, with opening scenes that are comprised of television footage discussing the Blair Witch Project, which include an appearance by none other than Roger Ebert. That leads directly into some documentary-style interviews with residents of the town of Burkittsville, Maryland regarding the impact the film had on their lives, and includes a cameo by Berlinger.Soon, we meet the latest witch aficionados as they venture into the abyss of the Black Hills -- on the inaugural run of the Blair Witch Hunt -- setting up camp at the Rustin Parr ruins and mocking the first film, including Heather Donahue's much-imitated hysterics, but that's not all. Erica, the twenty-something witch, comments: `The Blair Witch Project. Ok. Two guys and a girl sleeping in the same tent, night after night, and no sex? It makes no sense (sic).'INTO THE WOODS. AGAIN.Beyond that, here's a brief synopsis of the film: the five characters -- a Wiccan, a goth, two Blair Witch researchers and a mentally-ill tour guide -- go into the woods with a battery of cameras, lose several hours of their lives, and spend the remainder of the film holed up in a Civil War-era factory that's been turned into a dwelling, reviewing footage they'd shot in an attempt to piece things together.As this is going on, it's discovered that another tour group has been ritualistically murdered at Coffin Rock -- probably during the blackout. Action is quickly traded for claustrophobia, and a more psychological and conceptual horror flick emerges, one with little (intentional) humor.\nMuch criticism has been leveled against the performances turned in by a group of relative unknowns, although each of the actors and actresses probably has a brief moment or so as a better angel of the film, and Kim Director is solid in her portrayal of the cynical goth character.\nWhat distinguishes this project, however, is its meditation on mass hysteria and popular delusion -- or at least its effort to do so.\nThe film plays with `reality,' sorting through layers not only of memory, but also media -- and the possibility of the existence of supernatural elements -- as the group pores over the various video tapes they've brought back, grappling with the latest Coffin Rock murders and whether or not the killer or killers is in their midst.Jeff, the abovementioned tour guide character, who also sells Blair Witch memorabilia on the Internet, delivers a significant line in the film, explaining that while film lies, video doesn't. Is the truth out there?\nBW2 GOFor discerning home video enthusiasts, one valuable aspect of DVD commentaries is the occasional insight into the intrusiveness of studio overseers. In the case of BW2, it's revealed that Berlinger was forced to intercut shaky-cam gore scenes throughout, something that was, in my opinion, the worst element of the film.Another noteworthy DVD disclosure involves the fact that a striking shot over the November woods of Maryland, originally written with Sinatra's `Witchcraft' in mind, ended up being scored by Marilyn Manson's `Disposable Teens.' Two things probably account for the decision: the target demographic most likely wouldn't recognize or like the song, leaving them doubtful to buy the soundtrack; Marilyn Manson was called in to supervise the music, excluding of course the original score.I actually purchased BW1 on video for some strange reason (charmed, I'm sure), but ended up quickly selling it on eBay after finding myself unable to suffer through it a second time. BW2, however, resides in my permanent collection.A technological aspect of the DVD worth mentioning is the fact that the other side of the disk is a CD featuring the entire original score and a few of the soundtrack's more pop-related offerings.PLEASANTLY MALODOROUS.BW2 has been called many things, including a wretched waste of celluloid (not to mention videotape) and an unforgivable festival of clich\u00e9s.\nWhat it comes down to is this: BW2 is a movie that I hate to admit I loved. Although some performance and execution flaws might outweigh any uniqueness in the eyes of most viewers, for what it attempts to do -- in taking on the task of making a sequel that shouldn't have been made, defying many expectations along the way -- I give this box office flop a B--.\nIn case you missed BW2, or don't you feel you have the stomach for it, not to worry: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the creative team behind the first Blair Witch, are reportedly working on BW3: the attack of the prequels.",

            "content": "When I put Blair Witch 2 in my DVD player, I did not expect a great movie because I heard such bad comments about it.  Furthermore, I was so scared of being disappointed about the sequel that I waited two years before seeing it.  I am really a huge fan of the first one, and I wasn't able to figure out how a sequel could be half scary as the first one.  But the answer is simple:  Blair Witch:  Book of Shadows shows a completely different kind of horror and is a lot more:  It is also remarkable for its subtle references to the original, for its ironic vision of the mass-media phenomenon that surrounded it (mostly in the first 10 minutes of the movie) and, above all, for its inner structure that brings answers to the viewer, but in the same time brings other questions.Book of Shadows is far away from the esthetic of the first Blair Witch, but the horror, I think, is as scary.  As I know, only a few people knew that The Exorcist was based on a novel that was based on a true story, and the story of Carrie, another great horror film, is pure fiction.  So it's not because the mystery about the veracity of the Blair Witch mythology is gone that the movie can't be frightening.  You have to accept it and to be opened to a new type of structure to fully appreciate Blair Witch 2.But beyond the horror stuff, this movie is about the difference between perception and reality.  In another words, subjective interpretation (the characters) and objective interpretation (the tapes).  For the entire movie, we see what's happening through the characters.  It's just when the people still alive are arrested that we see the tapes, what \"really\" happened. And what Stephen says when he sees it?  The tape is wrong!!!  That's what this movie is all about.  Are the tapes wrong?  Have the five young people killed the other group of campers, or the spirit of the Blair Witch is so strong that it can modify the tapes (the reality)?  If yes, what happens with the first movie?  Maybe the footage found three years later is wrong, and what really happened in 1994 in Burkittsville is out of our knowledge...Berlinger's film is so complex and so rich that both answer can be right. Just hope there will be a third Blair Witch episode to help us understand, or to make us doubt even more!",

Put another bunch of kids in the woods and he would be slammed for being unoriginal and so he made a more cerebal horror film that was slammed for not being as closely associated with the first film.  I think the main reason this film wasn't successful was that because of Berlingers whole what is reality angle when the twists come the audience and critics laughed them off as stupid. I'll admit the acting isn't the best (especially from the male actors) but just by fighting against the expectations that people were going to have of a blair witch sequel i enjoyed the film.  Just listen to the DVD commentary by Berlinger to hear about all the studio interference he had to deal with and see how great this film could have been,  Without ruining the ending i walked out with a smile on my face when i heard the exact same comments at the end of BW2 that i heard at the end of 1 'what thats it?' or 'thats a load of crap'.  Although BW2 is entirely different from the first film its ending holds true to the spirit of the original as the people that got the film left having enjoyed the original should feel the same about BW2.

            "content": "Now, I will start off my review by saying that I never understood the hype of the first Blair Witch Project. Half the time I felt dizzy, very confused and slightly \"sea-sick\". While I understood the basic idea of the movie: 3 friends go into the woods to make a documentary about a legend of the Blair Witch and subsequently they seem to be stalked and attacked with no clear answers as to why or how, their footage being found a long time later; I wasn't sure why it became as popular as it did.One night I had fallen asleep with my TV on and when I woke, I saw Book of Shadows was on. I almost changed the channel when I realized that it was the sequel to Blair Witch Project, but (like a superficial girl) I saw Jeffrey Donovan on the screen and stayed a moment, ending up watching the entire movie.The movie was about a tour guide (former mental institution patient Jeffrey) who takes a group of tourists (Gothic Kim, Wiccian Erica, and a couple researching the Blair witch Tristin and Stephen) into the woods where the footage from the original movie was made. One night they camp out in the woods, drink, talk, have fun. All the while, they videotape their night. Suddenly they all wake up and have no memory of what had happened that night. Tristin and Stephen's research notes is found ripped to shreds all over the campsite, the tapes hidden away. They find the tapes and eventually go to Jeffrey's home. Looking through the tapes, they see nothing, but eventually they run the tapes backwards and they find that they had a wild party. Still unable to put the pieces together completely, they find out that tourists that they had a run-in with were murdered, and it was them who committed the crimes. Erica is found dead, and they realize that Tristin is to blame for the murders (I don't believe it is confirmed, but it is implied that she is possessed by the Blair Witch), and they confront her and as she ties a rope around her neck, she mocks them, especially Stephen, who loses his cool and pushes her off of the stairs. The three remaining are arrested, the cops have video tapes that shows them killing others. The tape shown to Stephen shows Tristins death completely different than how it occurred, showing the 3 ganging up on her, and kill her by tying the rope around her neck and pushing her off. They are baffled and assumed to be arrested.It is shot completely different from the first: a fiction movie rather than a faux-documentary, and the storyline being more clear. There were many twists and turns, interesting characters, a solid storyline and great editing.I definitely recommend this movie to others. It's not perfect, but it is a solid film.",

The powers that be wanted a sequel as soon as possible and many of the folks responsible for making this film wanted to wait...so they made the next film without them! And, it's obvious as the supposed sequel is really nothing like the first picture. It's not a found footage film and instead spends much of the movie talking about the first movie...and how it was a movie. Not surprisingly, this was nothing like what fans expected and they mostly hated it...but enough excitement from the first film STILL meant this follow-up made money in spite of itself. Talk about cynical film making!So why did I decide to watch this film...especially since I never watched the original? Well, I have set a goal for myself to see every entry on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 worst rated widely released films. So far, I've seen 71 of them. A few I might never see (such as a couple Turkish movies and a German film) but I was excited to see this, #96, on Showtime. Is it as bad as fans think? Could it be as bad as fans think? Or, were they simply angry that the movie wasn't at all what they expected?My verdict is that the film is quite bad. Not only is it NOT what fans wanted, these new characters are incredibly annoying jerks. Seeing them hanging out in the woods drinking, talking (non-stop) and acting like idiots did not make them endearing....and I just wanted the picture to end. It was a literal chore to make myself finish the movie. Not the worst thing I've ever seen by any stretch but I can see why the fans were disappointed.",

After spending the night in the ruins of Rustin Parr's house they awake to find their camera's destroyed and their paperwork shredded. Was it the Blair Witch? Hardly, she's not real. Right? Don't look at me for answers, the film doesn't contain any. In hoping that the audience would rather be confused than bored, any old crap is thrown at us to keep us in the dark.The original film was excused for this. It was a low budget independent movie and NOT a Hollywood film. BW2 IS a Hollywood film and fails on every basic level. Even the tiny, tiny irony in being called Book of Shadows, I believe, is a fluke/coincidence. Any other attempt at irony is purely textbook. Ooohhh mass hysteria!And if the Blair Witch ISN'T real (as this film repeatedly states) why are their physical impossibilities taking place? Why do they all go mad (mass hysteria my ass)? Why, if they are naked, do they conveniently have underwear on when it comes to frontal shots, but take them off for any other angle? What's the deal with tour guide dude's past? It's all trash and all pointless. A cheap, quick cash-in and a total insult to the honesty and simplicity of the original.I paid 36p for this!The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1 with some rubbish extras.",

It was in no case similar to the first one, which in my opinion was quite dull and slow-going. It's a very interesting film, and quite unique at some points. Nevertheless, I still can't decide on what finally happened in this story. Who was the witch, what really happened with the tapes and what all five of them actually did. To tell the truth, I really wanted to get some questions on those answers of mine.

            "content": "Book of Shadows is technically the follow up to the 1999snoozefest, \"The Blair Witch Project,\" but has few ties to the original. This movie is not a true sequel to BWP. It mentions the original film as a work of fiction, and it is debatable if the BWP2 storyline exists in the same continuum as the first film. BWP2 has better writing, effects, and production values than its predecessor. It is unfair to compare the sequel to the original, as the second installment isn't even a true horror movie. Book of Shadows examines the experience of supernatural phenomenon as it is experienced in reality. The question is: Are the events in the movie objectively happening, or are they subjective experiences of the participants based on collective delusion? The film maintains a constant level of tension and creepiness, but genuine scares are few and far between. That said, I believe that the filmmaker's intention was not cheap frights. Viewers are shown the events though the victims eyes; you spend most of the film trying to figure out what is going on. The confusion is played out less through plot advances, but rather through character development. The writing is decent. Every character but the Wiccan has believable dialog. There are also some great scenes that show a level of cinematography that is not evident in the grainy original. The BWP used amateur video to create the mood of the original. There are no scenes in the movie that are technically well done. BWP2 has some well architected images that invoke tension by their design. The only point where this movie suffers is in its attachment to the original film. This is not a great movie, but people will hate it because of its association with the BWP. The film is based on the cultural event surrounding the BWP, not the movie. Audiences may not have been sure if the footage in the original movie was real or faked. Even if they knew it was 'just a film,' there was still doubt about the subject matter. Was there a real Blair Witch legend? Was the movie based in fact? Was there a disappearance? BWP2 focus on the confusion created by the uncertainty. If you were frightened by the original BWP, it was because of the mystique, not because of what you saw in the film. This movie examines the effects of mythology and belief on the collective perceptions of the believers. If this movie had focused on some other phenomenon than 'Blair Witch Hysteria,' it would not suffer from the backlash of the original. I think this is a good flick and worth a rental (if not the price of admission). Don't expect a horror film; this movie is working at a higher level.",

Instead of believable characters, creepy atmosphere, and not being afraid to leave some things up to the imagination, we get unlikable clich\u00e9d characters, bloody violence, nudity, and an obtrusive heavy metal soundtrack. As soon as the movie started with a Marilyn Manson song I could tell I was in for a stinker. The acting is mostly mediocre with a couple of exceptions. Jeffrey Donovan is absolutely terrible, hamming it up like he thinks he's Jack Nicholson or something. Of course he later went on to success with Burn Notice but even most viewers of that show could tell you how often he displayed the limitations of his acting ability there. Kim Director is the only one of the cast who seems to stand out in any positive way. It's a poor excuse for a movie that is everything Blair Witch Project was not -- loud, predictable, and utterly 'Hollywood' in every way that can be used as an insult.

I mean I couldn't knew what was that all about when one of the characters,Jeff,was in mental hospital...I guess we expected woods and something more first.Lemme start with movie's name : Book of Shadows - Is it just me,or there is actually no book of this movie.I mean I know Erica supposedly haves it,but whats the point of book.It doesn't get much word around or use,if its meant for that.It could be simply called Blair Witch 2 and nothing more.Actors are solid,of course I liked the first part actors better,but there was an excellent work from Leerhsen,Director and Donovan.I liked that idea of two interesting ladies,Goth and a Wiccan,in one movie,especially Blair Witch.It really needs some mysterious characters,Donovan was a funny and interesting guy though.Actually,Skyler and Turner didn't convinced me that much....Dunno...I mean they play solid and all,but not convincing......I liked the part of movie,when they are in the forest.We did expected to be scary and all and maybe more focused on the forest and Burkittsville,but none of this.I think Berlinger wanted to be different from the first movie,and focused on other things,but I actually like it.I found it very interesting to watch from time to time ( maybe I can do so today )and I heard it has handy special features,but I haven't got nothing more on my DVD than trailer.I think that people are giving it bad reviews,because some don't understand it.No blame though.I didn't understand it too when I saw it like 2 times,just like movie Mullholland Drive,but if you watch it often,soon you get the picture.***andreja***",

It lacks the style of the first, the soundtrack is lousy, the pace is interupted by intermittant scenes of psycho-sadistic imagery, a lot of unnecessary swearing, repeatedly flashes of the end of the movie from the beginning and an uneven plot complicated by fair to good ghost effects confused with time warping in the reality of the movie. At its core, the movie is a very chilling horror story as a satire of Internet marketing and the Blair Witch phenomenon, but it is also tainted by a script seemingly written after a stoned out trip with marijuana as in the Monkee's movie \"Head.\" Everything goes in this confusing film that really doesn't explain anything, but there are clues a plenty in the tripping images of the character's video cameras. The movie does have a very chilling cabin madness to it as everything goes unreal around the five strangers, one of whom looks uncannily like Fairuza Balk in \"The Craft,\" but as you wonder who the witch is, I have to ask, who isn't the witch ? Creativity unleashed, this movie is definitely not up to par as its predecessor, but it is clearly worth a watch as a horror mystery. I almost wish I could be in a Blair Witch 3!",

This was a star making turn, to say the least, but somehow she was not utilized as she should have been. Her talent has never really received the recognition it deserves, except by those in the film industry who used her in creative project after project. Another outstanding performance by Director was in an episode of Law and Order: Criminal Intent, involving fan conventions and a seductive con woman. She is dynamite in that part as well and it is obviously a tongue-in-cheek tribute to her work in Blair Witch II. Kim Director is an artist, a master of her craft, and the true star of this film.

To his credit, Berlinger doesn't go down the obvious route, churning out an uninspired rehash of the first film; instead, he takes a different path through the woods, delivering a self-aware piece revolving around the hysteria created by the original Blair Witch Project. OK, so it doesn't work all that well, but he definitely gets points for trying.Berlinger's film opens in documentary style, with interviews from fans of The Blair Witch Project, as well as the residents of Burkitsville, who have taken to exploiting the film's success by marketing rocks and stick-men as souvenirs, and offering guided tours of the locations. It is one such tour into the Black Hills that provides the basis for Berlinger's movie: local entrepreneur Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) leads a group of four Blair Witch enthusiasts to the house of infamous child killer Rustin Parr, where they set up camp for the night. When the group wake up in the morning, they are shocked not only to find their equipment trashed, but they have no recollection of the previous evening. Finding Jeff's video cassette's buried in a hole, the gang return to their guide's home\u2014a disused factory\u2014to review the tapes, hoping to piece together the events of the night before. While doing so, they suffer a series of scary supernatural events. Meanwhile, the bodies of a rival tour group are found disembowelled on nearby Coffin Rock\u0085Book of Shadows received quite the critical mauling upon its release, but I think that there is actually a decent idea underneath all of the spooky shenanigans: a group of people suffering from amnesia desperately trying to understand what has happened to them, but horrified by what they discover. What makes the film less than successful for me is its glossy, MTV-style editing and the thoroughly unlikeable characters: I hated the flickery, grainy imagery, but not nearly as much as I disliked every single person in the film, from mentally unstable tour guide Jeff, to tough goth chick Kim (Kim Director), to sexy Wiccan Erica (Erica Leerhsen)\u2014although she at least had the decency to take off all of her clothes.As a rock/metal/alternative music fan, I at least enjoyed the excellent soundtrack, which features Marilyn Manson, Death In Vegas, System Of A Down, P.O.D., Queens Of The Stone Age and Rob Zombie, but I can't help but think that with just a little more care in the character development department, and with a little less of the showy stylisms, this could have been a whole lot better.",

Something I noticed that only hardcore horror fans may have noticed was a classic symbol from an older franchise. At 46:00, Erica lifts her shirt to reveal symbols carved into her abdomen. The main symbol is none other than the symbol of \"Curse of the Thorn\". For those of you who aren't familiar with this symbol, it originated in the movie \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1988)\". Something else that I thought was awesome was \"The Secret of Esrever\". The Secret of Esrever was a genius puzzle that was hidden in the movie. This puzzle allowed the viewers to interact with the movie and also created a unique rewatch factor. To be blunt, this movie was awesome.

Comparing both movies is almost like comparing a golden nugget to a bunch of crap.This movie tries everything it can to stick to the first movie and capture something that allows it to work and make a similar success. It is not a \"found footage\" movie, as was the first, but tries to continue the previous story, with a team of amateur and young filmmakers looking for information about what happened there, and the chaos to settle as the supernatural begins to mess with the mind of each of them. I can't say that the movie is a complete disaster... it starts very slowly, it takes a long time to capture our interest, but it gradually improves from the middle on and gives us a relatively well-made ending, that does not scare minimally, but at least, It makes us intrigued.I don't think it's worth it to highlight any name in the cast.

The first one was a film that hit me in a way that I was craving.  I wanted that feeling of what it was like to experience Halloween for the first time again, or what it was like to hear Freddy taunt Nancy as he hissed, \" Come to Freddy \" in the first one.  And I got it with Heather, Josh and Mike.  I was terrified and helpless, just like Mike was when he weakly shouted out, \"Tell me where you are Josh!\"  Blair Witch was just as much an experience as it was a film.  And again, I didn't expect the same going into the sequel, but I did hope for some care.  I wanted and fairly expected some sort of homage or even a style that was similar to what Sanchez and Myrick gave us.  Sadly, what we got was a modern day trashy film that took none of what was good about it's predecessor and everything that is bad about every other horror film on the market today or yesterday.  Book Of Shadows is not only a bad film but it is an irresponsible one.There are times in the film when there are moments that are looking and feeling as if they are going places, but they don't quite seem to know how to get there.  They tease you with the smell of suspence or the realm of good film making but then they cut you off before you can feel it in your bones.  And that angers me.  This was a quickie put together to cash in on the craze but it doesn't have the care that the first one did and it certainly doesn't have the guts that Daniel and Ed put into the original.  I for one, am looking forward to the prequel that is slated for next year. With the boys back on the project as writers and producers and directors, it will be better that this.  It's funny, I used to write almost every day in this forum on the films I have seen.  I still have seen almost all the films that have come out this year, I just haven't had the time to comment on all of them.  But this is one film that I had to express my opinion on.  Because Blair Witch was not just a film to me, it was something that I could relate to.  It proved to me that others out there appreciated the same kind of Hitchcockian/Carpenterian/Cravenian/early Friday the 13thian kind of horror the way I do.  But this effort is stale and lazy and I had to say so.  Sanchez and Myrick have cleverly distanced themselves from the project and will all likeliness vindicate the witch with their prequel.  And that is something to look forward to.5 out of 10- an utter disappointment",

It spawned an amazing reaction turning itself into a cult classic with obsessed fanatics that were not sure if what they saw was real or not.While this probably is not a controversy anymore, in it's day it was a very valid question among fans: \"was it real or fake?\". This so-called \"sequel\", is a satire of that controversy. Just as the first one was a \"Fake real film\" this could be called a \"film based on fake real events\".Four people take one of the many tours to Burkitsville that began to appear after the movie became famous. While their reasons to be there are different, they share the same question: \"was it real or not?\". They venture into the woods following the steps that the protagonists of the \"Blair Witch Project\" followed.Suddenly, strange things happen and they find themselves involved in the murder of another group of tourists. While they have no idea of what's going on, one is left to wonder if what's happening is a case of collective hysteria or the real supernatural forces having their revenge.The plot is particularly interesting, and probably with a better developed script it would had been as revolutionary as the first one. Sadly, both the script and the direction feel limited, as if they had done the movie just for cashing on the success of the first movie.The camera-work is very MTV-influenced and the acting seem to be taken from a sitcom. Worst of all, any good chance of psychological horror is exchanged for cheap jump scares that truly wastes the infinite possibilities of the plot.Overall a mediocre movie that deals with an interesting point, but fails at every chance it had of exploring it. Very disappointing sequel to the most original film of the last 20 years. 4/10",

However the residents of Maryland, Burkittsville are also cashing in on the films popularity as people flock from all over the world to visit the setting of the film & try to 'see' the Blair Witch herself. Local lad Jeffrey Patterson (Jeffery Donovan) conducts guided tours called the Blair Witch Hunt & joining him are lovers Trsiten (Tristine Skyler) & Stephen (Stephen Ryan Parker) who are researching a book on the Blair Witch, a self proclaimed witch named Erica (Erica Leerhsen) who wants to contact the Blair Witch & psychic goth chick Kim Diamond (Kim Director) who is there for kicks I suppose. They venture into the woods & set up camp where the character's in The Blair Witch Project disappeared, they spend the night there but wake up the next morning unable to remember anything about the night. As they examine all the footage they recored things turn strange as they start seeing ghosts, having hallucinations & it emerges that several other Blair Witch sight seers were murdered during the period they cannot remember. The taped footage becomes very uncomfortable viewing...Co-written & directed by Joe Berlinger Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is the one & only sequel (so far anyway) to the mega surprise hit The Blair Witch Project (1999) a film which split opinion right down the middle with many calling it a brilliant & original piece of film-making while other's described it as a low budget nonsensical piece of crap that benefited from a clever marketing campaign. I doubt this sequel will divide anywhere as many people as the original as I cannot see the majority of film-goers getting anything out of this muddled mess. The script by Dick Beebe & Berlinger starts off quite well as it adknowlegdes that The Blair Witch Project was just a film & this film is based on the events that surround the myth of the original, unfortunately that's when things take a nosedive as it then just turns into a standard teen supernatural horror with silly character's, bad dialogue & a really odd narrative structure. The story just doesn't unfold as in most films, oh no to be different & clever the filmmakers randomly splice meaningless footage into it of events that have happened already or will later on in the film & a lot of the second half of the film are either dreams or hallucinations the character's have. It becomes a bit disorientating & annoying after a while, I was also disappointed with the ending. The film never quite makes itself totally clear as to what had happened, was it all supernatural or were the kids just crazy & where did the doctored video footage come from & what did those files on everyone have to do with anything & whose were they? You decide...Director Berlinger does an OK job, he still keeps a few hand-held shaky camera shots in here but this is very much a Hollywood film compared to the rough documentary feel of the original. The film is quite low-key compared to original as well, it doesn't seem to want to build any tension or atmosphere & I can't honestly remember any big scares or 'jump out of your seat' moments, it's all pretty dry & straight forward actually. The gore is tame, there are a few brief shots of people being stabbed in the stomach & that's about it.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 compared to the paltry $35,000 it cost to make the original you have to ask yourself where the money went. It just shows you don't need bags of money to turn in a decent film. The acting wasn't great & I find it strange that the five main character's share the same first name as the actors that play them, surely that was deliberate.Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (that's another thing, what does the Book of Shadows have to do with anything? There aren't any books in it.) is a pretty bad film, there's no scares, it's a bit of a jumbled mess & won't impress many people. I thought it was pants really, not recommended.",

I was like 15 when this movie came out, so I didn't get to appreciate it in theaters, but I recall watching it over summer break around 2002 and was amazed at how well it rolled together. It's not a jump-scare-ridden garbage fest with quick edits and cutaway scenes. For a group of pretty green actors, they did very well in conveying the story and the motive behind the happenings within.

At least it tries something new than most of the 2000's Horror movies.I really tried to like \"Books Of Shadows\" because it tried hard to be a unique movie without copying the elements that made the original a smash hit.\"Books Of Shadow\" deals with demonic possession, witchcraft, and some slasher elements. I won't get into the plot because to be honest, I don't know how to explain it because it's very complex and if you haven't seen it I could confuse you.The most important thing to know about the movie is that it's very different from the original. The sequel is a gory flick that deals with witchcraft. There are some truly bizarre moments created by the movie's editing! Keeping distances, this movie works in the same line as Christopher Nolan's brilliant \"Memento\". The thing is that \"Blair Witch 2\" confuses the audience and turns into a terrible mess towards the ending. The plot begins interestingly but then falls down after the abortion incident to the point that you don't know if the events are real or are part of the characters' imagination.The performances are terrible! except for Erica Leerhsen that gives a credible and sexy performance as the Wiccan girl that compares the horrifying events with her religion. By the way, I have to say that she's very hot in her sexy scenes.The direction in the movie is dull but sometimes shows some interesting scenes like the ritual where some people are brutally killed. The atmosphere is creepy in some scenes but fails to catch the viewers' attention through the movie.\"Blair Witch 2\" had a lot of potential, some interesting ideas and the difficult mission to be a stand alone movie. Sadly enough, the comparisons have to be done and this sequel lost and will be remembered as one of the worst sequels to one of the best Horror movies from the last decade.By the way, check out the references to Evil Dead (the tape played backwards), Evil Dead 2 (the dancing corpse), and several references to The Exorcist.Sorry but this movie can't be recommended because it's a mess!",

Unfortunately, the first one was the subject of a remake launched in 1999 whereas the latter gave a follow-up. And however, these are movies that cry out to be left alone! Here, \"Book of shadows: blair witch 2\" (2000) only aims at exploiting the phenomenal success of the first film and we're very far from its achievement.However, the starting point was interesting: a bunch of young people go into the Burkitsville's woods in order to know if the Blair witch really exists. They spend the night here, more precisely in Rustin Parr's ancient house. But, at daybreak, they have no memory of the eve and they especially don't know that they are possessed.This is the typical case of the good idea which is badly exploited: we are under the impression that the story contains quite a lot of flaws and it isn't clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie is badly acted, badly made and instead of creating a disturbing atmosphere, it reaches the peaks of ridiculousness and boredom. It's a shame because the way Joe Berlinger designed his movie was far from being uninteresting. And what a bad idea to have used hard-rock music. Although, I'm fond of hard-rock, I think that it doesn't suit to the movie at all.This is ultimately a total failure and even the fans of \"the blair witch project\" will be disappointed. Besides when it was launched in the fall 2000 the movie didn't (fortunately) encounter the expected success. One last thing: the title contains an insignificant expression \"book of shadows\".

Many people thought it was the most revolutionary movie of its time, due in no small part to the realism. Audiences found themselves believing every step of the movie. And, of course, the endless Internet hype didn't hurt. Many of us watched that film before the popular press piled on - and nothing kills a movie quicker than overhype. If critics tell you a movie's wonderful, your expectations are massive, sometimes insurmountable. This is perhaps why a lot of people I've talked to hated, hated, hated The Blair Witch Project. They illogically thought the movie would be the best thing ever created, even better than sliced bread, hot tubs, the Internet, or shoe horns. Imagine their disappointment when it was just a movie!That said, the sequel - which was made with a much, much bigger budget, was even more hyped, although not in the underground, independent-film style of its predecessor. Book of Shadows was marketed in a wide multimedia campaign, boasting of its shock value and of its relation to the first film.It has failed in every possible way to be entertaining.The story has a \"tour group\" prowling the forest around Burkittsville, Maryland, the site of the first film. The recovered videotape from the first movie has led to a huge influx of tourist to the area and its beleaguered residents. Naturally, people make money off the tourism, and a few give tours of the forest. The movie focuses on one of these tour groups, comprised of a couple of lovers, a couple of witches, and the arrogant SOB who's running the tour itself. These people couldn't get much more caricatured.Many years ago, William Castle held a nationwide casting call for a movie called 13 Ghosts. The movie wound up being one of the worst of its kind (a haunted-house mystery), and most of the very amateur actors in the movie never acted again. Book of Shadows does not have that level of professionalism or of thespian promise.Remember those cheesy movies - in the 60's, it was beach movies; in the 70's, it was biker movies; in the 80's, it was arcade game movies - that you and your pals laughed at and threw popcorn at? The acting was bad, the production was bad - you even got lucky some times and saw an errant microphone.The difference between those films and Book of Shadows is that this movie had a budget. But the acting is atrocious. Every line is delivered either flatly or with wild, over-the-top emotion. These kids have no idea how to act. They ACT like they're acting! Sure, you're saying, the original's actors weren't actually veteran actors, either. True, true, I concur, but those actors were playing their roles naturally, as if we were watching them voyeuristically. Book of Shadows didn't even attempt to do this. Much of Blair Witch was shot in black and white with handheld cameras - held BY the actors. Not this time. Professional cameramen held their expensive cameras while their decidedly amateur cast screwed up their deliveries. It's like going to an acting class for nonactors - people who can't act have a tendency to overact, to overplay, overenunciate, overindulge, and just plain overestimate the audience's capacity for dull, uninteresting crap.Then there's the effects. I could probably come up with better special effects on my tiny PC with one little graphic program. The editing was childish. The cinematography was below anyone's standards, even if one had a tiny budget. With a bigger budget, you would think better filming would take place. Au contraire!It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this horrid in every way. Oh, and the ending? I won't be dumb enough to give it out to you, but it's no mystery. This is a stunningly awful movie, content to make its bed in the den of The Blair Witch Project. It's like an overprivileged son who doesn't feel he needs to stand on his own two feet to survive, only to learn his wealthy daddy won't support him.",

At the very least it will make you cringe, or maybe just feel paralized like the first did.  Unfortunately, I just cringed.  The plot involves that after the Blair Witch movie, 5 people go up into the black hills to camp out for a night. But chaos ensues when they can't remember a thing they did, saw or felt, and when they leave, there mind begins to play tricks on them (and when they find the evidence of what went on, you might just have to spew in your popcorn from the gruesome footage that makes the Manson's look like the Smurfs).Overall, the direction (picked by original creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) by Joe Belinger was not needed.  Anyone could direct this film, but the actors pull through to make us feel as paranoid as they do. Not great, but still a ranking horror flick for this year. B+",

It ends up completely bastardizing the first one, portraying it as a laughable piece of fiction.  The first one may not have been the scariest movie ever made, but it was far more innovative and original than this trite sequel, which is so full of plotholes and inconsistencies.For example, how can the Blair Witch call our insipid group on their phone and pretend to be the town sherriff?  Does she have a Nokia like everyone else? I find that a bit too \"Scream\"-ish.  Second, the Blair Witch must have attended some incredible film school to know how to edit and manipulate the group's video footage.The first one gave Elly (the witch) the powers that she should have, powers to destroy and instigate confusion.  In the second, she is reduced to a mere \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" witch who's a little too 1990s saavy.\nThere is nothing redeeming about the sequel.  It is not the least bit scary, and the ending is extremely anti-climactic, while I dare say I've never seen a better ending than the first one.  The acting is horrible, and any complaints about Heather Donahue will be quickly silenced one you've seen the performance of any of the five leads.  Save your money and don't even wait for video.

However, Book of Shadows spoils itself with forward shadowing, cheesy dialogue, blatant misuse of stereotypes, and a host of other problems, before we even address the fact that as sequels ago, this could very well be the worst on record.\nI am reminded of Bob and Doug MacKenzie: (played by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas on SCTV and later the film Strange Brew) Canadian brothers who made a small cable television show called Great White North. In one particular episode, Bob and Doug were discovered by a big network and given a great amount of money to go Big Time. Which they did. And their new show failed miserably. What made their original little cable show so entertaining and enjoyable was lost for all the glitz and glamour of show business. In selling out, they lost what made their show special. The same thing happened here with Blair Witch. Some may find one or two statements in the following paragraph to be *spoilers*. Book of Shadows will forever be intertwined with The Blair Witch Project. However, the films do not belong together. Blair Witch was a fictional account about three college students who went into the woods to make a documentary about suspicious legends of the area and never returned. Book of Shadows is a fictional account about five young adults who venture into the woods and drive themselves crazy. Believing the Blair Witch from the first film to be distorting their reality when actually they've just lost their minds, Book of Shadows dismisses Blair Witch as the hoax that it was, and in so doing hasn't a leg to stand on by itself. Some call Blair Witch Project genius and some call it a fluke, but it grossed over ten times as much money as was required to make it. No matter how you slice it, Blair Witch will be remembered in history as a success. However, Book of Shadows is an inevitable byproduct of that success. Nothing more. Book of Shadows is the very sort of movie that inspired directors Sanchez and Myrick to raise the bar of the genre in the first place. In interviews the men have explained that one day they were sitting around talking about what really scared them. It wasn't the trite Hollywood slasher films of present day, but eerie documentaries of their youth. Stories of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and the Bermuda Triangle. So they sought to outdo modern day blood fest films and action packed polished horror thrillers by inventing a mythology with some historical relevance and sociological believability. Book of Shadows is just another bloody fright. It's just another high budget Hollywood chiller thriller. If you like that kind of movie, you will find Book of Shadows to be a satisfactory clone. If you were someone who was attracted to Blair Witch Project because you've been looking for something more creative and daring than any horror or thriller films that have come out of Hollywood the last twenty years, Book of Shadows will seriously disappoint you. Book of Shadows disregards the events of The Blair Witch Project as not real, and therefore deserves to be dismissed itself. Just as if the sequels to Nightmare On Elm Street had pretended Freddy Krueger didn't exist. If it is ever made, a true sequel to Blair Witch will deal directly with the events of the first film - specifically the disappearance of the three college students. Personally, I refuse to refer to Book of Shadows as a sequel to Blair Witch Project. There are rumors that a \"prequel\" dealing with the original history of the Blair Witch might be made, but even that will not be a sequel. The true Blair Witch Project Two has yet to be filmed. Unfortunately, I fear it never will be.",

This one works here when utilizing the potentially supernatural happenings to build its mystery about their night together, which gives this such a fine, chilling atmosphere here. The visions we get of their party are fun enough, but the next day aftermath is where it gets good with the shredded paper, the paranoia about their equipment and the realization that the bloodied dream really happened as depicted which really comes off rather well here. The later scenes here in the warehouse are even better as not only does the tape-viewing uncover a series of enjoyable parts as they're tormented in fine fashion with erotic dreams that result in nasty, brutal wounds on all involved, the strange crying or howling wails heard throughout the building, the flashes of ghost children throughout or the strange reactions to the videotapes where it shows the group performing completely foreign acts from Wiccan ceremonial rituals to carving themselves up or even performing nude strip-dances around the fire all comes off as perfectly chilling for what's attempted in that style of tormenting that occurs in here. Even the final half here where everything comes out in true form where what really happened is revealed, the fates of the group is given and the psychological tortures are far more impressive and chilling that really takes the mind-games and tormenting to another level of intensity throughout here. These here the positive points that do hold this one here is pretty much dependent on the mind- games throughout the later half here indeed makes it pretty chilling, but it's also rather confusing in that what happens isn't going on as we see it and makes it all untrustworthy and pointless as to why it should be watched. This one never makes it seem like there's a twist or anything happening with what they're doing, it simply goes around doing one thing and then switches it around with the videotape reveals at the end which shows what really happened. In the end that makes the whole thing pointless twisting it around as it does without any warning at making the previous antics redundant. The other fact against this one is the completely irresponsible storyline here about the cop and his harassment of the group which is quite full of overkilled moments and completely uncalled for storyline segment just to make its point. Otherwise, this one was quite fun.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and Nudity.",

Not only is this movie is a wreck, but it has nothing to do with The Blair Witch Project. With the exception of a few good in jokes, including a clip from Siskel and Ebert's show, there is nothing here. Blair Witch 2 actually makes me wanna go back to the Saw or Friday the 13th series, both of which I've put aside after the third entries.It has been one year since Heather Donahue and her pals disappeared in Maryland's Black Hills, but they have become a national cult legend. The county is overrun by tourists and fans of the box Office hit 'The Blair Witch Project'. Most these people have the IQ of a fish. This movie focuses on five, who attempt to recreate the Blair Witch hunt, and pick up from where their heroes left off. Taking a plethora a camera gear, They begin at the ruins of the house where Blair Witch ended, (as well as the footage). But once again, this is not just gonna be a walk in the park, things are about to get real.There is nothing I can say about Blair Witch 2, that has not been said already.

That's the whole \"plot\".The story is completely incoherent, boring, predictable and unrealistic. To add insult to injury: there's no conclusion or culmination. It leaves you wondering what the hell did you just watch and what was the point of it all.I hated \"Wild Things\" -- confusing, too many \"twists\", and total lack of realism. This was similar, but it didn't have the first rate actors or the atmosphere present in \"Wild Things\". Basically, this movie has no redeeming factors whatsoever.

            "content": "Though it became one of my favorite films, I can understand how many viewers were turned off by The Blair Witch Project's unconventional style and unusual approach to horror.  What baffles me is how anyone, anywhere, could ever possibly like the abomination that is Blair Witch II: Book of Shadows. How could a script like this even be approved in the first place?  Halfway through the film my friends and I were comparing the dialogue to that of Godzilla 2000.  That's how poorly written and acted this movie's words are-- they're reminiscent of a laughably translated Japanese monster movie.  The story is also very badly structured, leading up to an unbelievable ending that will leave you feeling sick and angry.  Also questionable is the film's style and direction, which indicate that Joe Berlinger was more interested in making a bunch of weird, pretentious montages than an atmospheric horror film.  But what infuriates me the most is that BW2 is guilty of many of the exact stupidities that the original film set out to protest-- the fake scares, the ridiculously good-looking young leads, and most of all the crushing lack of respect for reality and the audience.  The first film was a masterpiece because it had fully rounded characters, created an incredible aura of believable reality, and most importantly because it respected the audience's intelligence and imagination.  Blair Witch II doesn't even try to do any of that.  The characters are either bland, unappealing nobodies or exaggerated one-note caricatures (the ridiculous sheriff most of all); there's hardly a single believable moment in the entire running time of BW2; and the film takes over for our imaginations by showing us the ghosts, which are clearly ripped off from movies like House on Haunted Hill and The Shining.  It would have been so easy to get this movie's characters together, develop them a bit more, and then send them on a terrifying odyssey into the woods like in the first film, where hopefully at some point they would actually encounter a !!BOOK OF SHADOWS!! of some kind, since that's the TITLE of the movie... but Artisan decided to soil the good name of the most important film in their library with this heartbreaking sick joke.  Now that The Blair Witch Project has been forever tainted by this woefully poor sequel, I really wonder if there's any hope left in the world.",

This leads to revelations involving ghosts, an orgy, vicious cult-like murders and maybe even The Blair Witch herself.Quick cut editing and gore are no substitute for real scares and suspense (a lesson the director should have learned in viewing the original), but this has a few interesting moments, adding to the Blair Witch mythology and all. However, some of the performances are pretty poor and it completely falls apart by the end.

Despite the stylistic \"found footage\" technique and \"realistic\" approach, it was abhorrently boring and yet another inexplicably tedious low-budget feature that garnered far too much success, in my opinion anyway. Immediately, a sequel was commissioned a year later as soon as its predecessor gained traction in popularity. A secondary chapter that revolves around a fanatic tour, fascinated by the original's mythology, experiencing mass hysteria by watching some tapes in reverse and realising they spent the entire night naked swinging around trees and destroying their own equipment. Whether that's the truth or illusory hallucinations, remains to be seen.The most important lesson to take away from Berlinger's psychological \"thriller\", is that nobody cares. Who honestly gives a damn whether these characters encountered supernatural phenomena or not? They are all undoubtedly unlikeable, one-dimensional and emotionless. A tour guide that looks stoned. A naturalist earth witch who strokes the ground. A couple whom experience a miscarriage one second, and then laugh about life a minute later. And a creepy stereotypical goth chick who clearly supplied the film's soundtrack of Marilyn Manson, System of a Down and...Nickelback? Well, we all have guilty pleasures I guess. All performed by mediocre actors that believe good acting is overacting. Someone going crazy? Shout in their face. Tapes gone missing? Act like Scooby-Doo and repeatedly scan the area for clues.The narrative constantly references the original, and is initially filmed in a documentarian style with falsified interviews and archival footage. They even included Roger Ebert praising its predecessor! God damn! Berlinger then switches to a more authentic filming style, which coincidentally relinquishes the majority of connections to the first film. There is absolutely nothing that relates these films together, other than the explicit merchandise of stick formations and constant whispering of \"...the Blair Witch...\", acting as a friendly reminder that you are indeed watching a sequel. Yet, where is the ornate sense of fear of the unknown? Where is the actual Blair Witch? Where is this so-called \"Book of Shadows\"? No, seriously? There is no book! Why even call it that!It's just an abysmal ambiguous continuation of a \"legend\" that is illustrated through flashbacks, therefore rendering the final act of psychological explanations and \"oh, you've been punk'd!\" useless. If you're going to show us which characters survived, why put us through this ordeal in the first place? The \"scares\", if you can call them that, consist of a ghostly apparition of a white girl doing her best Miss Vanjie impression before disappearing. That's it! Oh God, I'm done. This sequel makes the original seem like an indie masterpiece, a film I disliked already! It's just some edgy, grungy...terrible stuff. No thanks.",

            "content": "A film best described as an \"interesting failure\", this sequel didn't have me holding my hopes up very much - seeing as just about all reviewers gave it negative marks. In my mind, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was one of the scariest films I've ever seen, and any film following that is going to look bad in the process. So I kept my expectations extremely low and went to see this sequel on Halloween. It's a film that borderlines on genius and very nearly manages to be extremely scary, but loses all credibility with a cast of poor performers and some cheap shock tactics. Indeed it's easy to be alarmed by the \"jump in your seat\" shots of objects smashing through windows or instead be disgusted by some gruesome hallucinations our friends have - a woman rips a man's stomach open with her nails, another girl is seen to eat a dead bird - but the underlying themes in this film are the ones that make it interesting.Looking beyond the obvious shock/gore tactics, this film's main theme is that of perception - and whether we (the audience) or they (the people in the film) are truly seeing what's going on. Clever editing is used to build up to the chilling revelation and the ending was, for me, a very good one. Sadly the true horror of the situation is underplayed in favour of a high dosage of unwanted comic relief, poor acting and a whole slew of supposedly disturbing/horrific moments which actually turn out to be unintentionally funny.Whereas the first film established a back-to-roots documentary approach, this film in turn goes overboard with the exploitation tactics to appeal to a young audience. One character wanders around naked for much of the film while repeated clips of a bloody murder are shown throughout the film. The one interesting character in this film is the tour's guide, an ex-mental patient who finds his sanity breaking down as the film progresses. Played by Jeffrey Donovan, the acting is spot on and he turns in an excellent portrayal. It's just a shame that the others don't live up to his standards. The actress playing the pregnant woman is forced to do a lot of humiliating things and her acting skills are frequently laughable - of course this is not helped by inane dialogue like when she sprouts about dead children looking up her skirt. Her husband is not much better, being as he is a bland puppet, while the Wiccan character in this film I found to be extremely irritating. Finally, the actress playing the goth shows glimpses of a real talent, but for the most part she's simply obnoxious. And don't get me started on the intrusive music used at every opportunity.While it simply cannot live up to the first film, this is more interesting to watch than your typical mindless slasher or gorefest. The film is based around some real deep-seated fears of madness and chaos and with a better execution, I think this may have been as good as the original. Just enjoy all the general weirdness going on as the film messes with your head and let it suck you in. My favourite parts of this film were when the camera footage was being pieced together and revealing some pretty bizarre stuff. The shock ending is powerful too. As a follow-up, BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2 sucks, but it almost stands on its own as a complex, partially successful piece of psychological horror.",

            "content": "You have to admire the chutzpah of the people who took on the project of creating a sequel to \"Blair Witch Project\". The original made so much money and created such a furor that a sequel was inevitable...and yet, the elements the made the original such a surprise success (including the marketing campaign and the relative novelty and uniqueness of the plot and production elements) were no longer available to the makers of any sequel. So anyone volunteering (or assigned) for this 'suicide job' faced the problems of retaining the 'freshness' of the original while not being too derivative of it. To succeed under these conditions, you'd either have to be divinely inspired or incredibly lucky. Well, these guys weren't either of those things, and they didn't even come close. They do one thing right - they take a 'postmodern' spin on the plot by acknowledging the effects of the original movie on popular culture - in fact, the opening of the story reveals that there is practically a \"BWP\" cottage industry in and around Burkittsville which exploits the commercial success and interest raised by the first film. That's reasonably clever scripting and gives a credible reason for a motley group of people to go back to the original site - they are on a guided tour to the site. In fact, the wittiest moment of the film is when \"our\" tour group encounters another guided tour group and they argue over who gets to camp where, etc. Where the original was about \"bewilderment\", hysteria, \"woods shock\", and agoraphobia, the sequel tries to keep up the interest factor with group psychosis, mass hallucination, Dionysian possession and claustrophobia, and it tries to keep the audience guessing about what 'really' happened that night in the woods and whether something followed them back. It also is far louder, less subtle, more explicit and gory (although you could argue that the sex and violence is revealed in video flashbacks to the surprise and horror of the cast). However, just about everything in the film is done at in a way that combines facile slickness (money was obviously spent on this film) with mediocre execution. In fact, with a different framing sequence and plot device (and a little less nudity and violence), \"Book Of Shadows\" could have been an extended entry in an anthology series like \"Tales From The Darkside\", \"Tales From The Crypt\", or \"Night Gallery\". Those were always OK to watch if nothing else was on, but they were nothing you'd be willing to pay money to see. The acting and dialog is especially problematic. That was true in the original as well, but the actors (and their dialog) were always captured in grainy, low definition half-heard 'documentary' style that was part of the point of the movie. Here, it's front and center, and there is no escaping the fact that these actors and the director aren't very good, and the movie wears out its welcome very quickly.Still, if you don't think of this as a \"Blair Witch\" story, and just take it in, it isn't all that bad. I've seen a hundred 50's and 60's sci fi and exploitation films with worse camera work, sound design, costumes, and yes, acting and dialog. So if you only half watch it as background while you read a magazine, or neck with your girlfriend or drink beer, etc., \"Book Of Shadows\" will go down painlessly enough. I just hope you didn't pay real money to see it the theater in its first release.",

They wanted some cash, and they wanted it so badly they made such an awful movie it almost guarantees everyone who was involved with it can say bye-bye to their careers.While the original shone because of the creepy, raw and bad quality it had, the new one is terribly bad because of the same traits. It's just that these time, a \"real\" movie was tried, with disastrous results. Everyone's acting is wooden and planned; while the 3 actor's terror in the first movie was real and palpable this is just another dumb movie with no emotions whatsoever. The story is so convoluted you won't be able to reach any conclusions at the film's end. The movie is so predictable you will begin wondering if they wrote it in 1 evening or two. Worst of all, you can see the merchandising you will be assaulted with shortly all over the film. What a shame of a movie!This movie is dumb, stupid and bad.

            "content": "You spend most of your time at \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" waiting for something scary to make you scream. Unfortunately, nothing nerve-wracking jumps out and grabs you by the jugular in this lurid but lackluster sequel to the most lucrative independent horror epic of all time. Okay, you may break out in goose bumps galore as you anticipate your worst fears, but those fears will never engulf you, unless you are extremely squeamish. Not only does \"BW2\" lack the agoraphobic hysteria of the original with its creepy, black & white photography, and epileptic hand-held camera work, but also writer & director Joe (\"Brother's Keeper\") Berlinger and co-scribe Dick (\"House on Haunted Hill\") Beebe ignore the mystery about what became of Heather, Joshua, Michael, and more crucially, the witch--Elly Kedward. Instead, they expose \"The Blair Witch Project\" as outrageous hokum, then contrive a pretentious, anticlimactic, often incoherent chiller about obsessive moviegoers who channel inspiration from \"TBWP\" to wreck murder and mayhem. Ironically, Berlinger classifies \"BW2\" as a \"fictional reenactment of events that occurred after 'The Blair Witch Project' was released.\" Again, the line between reality and illusion blurs but with considerably less appeal. Consciously arguing the media dictates reality, Berlinger sets out with this elaborate agenda to helm a mediocre gorefest that indulges more often in propaganda than peril. Like its predecessor, \"BW2\" suffers from dull characters that rarely engage out sympathies. Artisan Entertainment has beefed up the budget this time, so the Black Hills around Burkittsville, Maryland, ooze with gratuitous blood, gore, sex, sodomy, and sadism. \"The Blair Witch Project\" appears prudish compared with its promiscuous, overwrought Technicolor sequel. Despite its bigger budget, better cast, and occasional glimpses of evil, \"BW2\" leaves less to the imagination than its restrained, artfully ambiguous predecessor. Since a shoestring budget prevented \"TBWP\" from showing us its monster--the witch, the filmmakers exploited our fears by concealing the evil as well as using jittery movement to perpetuate our curiosity. Sadly, after a tantalizing, tension-fraught build-up, \"TBWP\" wrapped up on an anti-climax, because the movie could not pay off the suspense it created with a display of evil. While \"TBWP\" exploited this simple, amateurish, pseudo- documentary approach in its depiction of evil, \"BW2\" complicates its relentlessly conventional haunted house plot with confusing flashbacks and flash forwards, sabotaging any sense of suspense about its abrasive characters who emerge as even more enigmatic than Heather, Joshua, and Michael.\"BW2\" opens with an amusing mockumentary about \"TBWP.\" Briefly recapping the original's phenomenal success, MTV's Kurt Loder, late night talk show hosts Conan O'Brien and Jay Leon, and film critic Roger Ebert rhapsodize about the movie while Burkittsville natives describe their newfound celebrity status. One local explains she sold all the rocks in her garden to \"Blair Witch\" trophy hunters. She tried to sell more rocks on the Internet, but the shipping costs proved exorbitant. Berlinger frames this clever opening gambit so it mimics the 16mm dimensions of the original \"Blair Witch.\" Afterward, \"BW2\" lurches off into its own plot and degenerates into an undistinguished, reality-versus-illusion supernatural saga about an ex-mental patient turned \"Blair Witch\" tour guide (Jeff Donovan) who leads a quartet of souvenir seekers on safari into the same ominous woods where Heather and the guys vanished. Like \"TBWP,\" \"BW2\" enhances its realism by letting the cast use their actual first names. Unfortunately, Berlinger's sequel doesn't imitate the impromptu, cinema verite look of the original. He shoots \"BW2\" as a traditional formula Hollywood fright flick, departing momentarily from this slick, glossy style during the orgy when he quickens the editing rhythm and lenses the action \"NYPD\" style. No, you need not take Dramamine to survive this sequel.The script by Berlinger and Beebe is no great shakes. Basically, \"BW2\" occurs in two acts, first in the woods around Rustin Parr's ruins and later in Jeff's fortress of solitude (equipped with an Archie Bunker dog alarm so when the door opens a recording of barking dogs can be heard) where our heroes hole up after their bucolic bacchanalia. Meanwhile, flashbacks and flash-forwards involving murder, mayhem, and police interrogation are spliced confusingly into the narrative. Two realities emerge. Jeff tells Kim \"film lies, but video tells the truth.\" The truth appears in the videotape sequences from either Jeff's cameras or the surveillance cameras, while the characters see what the film sequences show, little realizing how warped their own perception of reality remains. Anticlimactically, the organic horror of the \"Blair Witch\" takes a backseat to the immediate horror of their demonic possession. Berlinger prefers to play up the clash between his possessed principals than the presence of the witch. Big mistake. Elly Kedward is still more interesting than these oddball characters with their domestic squabbles.Altogether, \"BW2\" qualifies as a pointless, inconsistent sequel with goose bumps about a \"Deliverance\" like encounter between demonic spirits and a motley bunch of twentysomethings who go berserk and turn on each other. Valiantly, writer & director Joe Berlinger strives to create a different kind of authenticity compared with the first film, but he founders in his own sea of pretentious ideas. Berlinger should have heeded the old saying: if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it. In debunking and refocusing the elements of the original, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" blunders off on an even more tedious tangent to tedium. Boo . . . Hiss.",

Everything in this film is purposefully ambiguous because that is how reality now is like in our media-driven culture.  Through the medium of video and film, several different layers of reality are created, and all of them can be equally true.  That, in a nutshell, is the whole point of Blair Witch 2.  Berlinger cleverly cuts back and forth between film and video to reveal how these two different mediums can both distort and reflect reality.In the end, when yet another level of reality is revealed to the viewer, one is left shocked and reeling.

Because Berlinger actually had some really good ideas, but as is quite usual, he was forced to make a lot of changes in pace, tone, scene order, etc. by the studio, all at the last minute. He was also forced to shoot extra footage that he repeatedly says on the DVD commentary that he was loathe to put in.And for good reason... There's a really interesting psychological horror film in here someplace, and occasionally it surfaces. Throughout the movie, Berlinger plays with our minds in the same way the five protagonists play with each other's. Is there really a Blair Witch? Are all the stories of evil merely BS? Or is something evil really coming from within themselves? And if so, is that evil being directed by supernatural forces or merely their own paranoia? Interesting questions, yes --- a hell of a lot more provocative than 90 minutes of \"TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE JOSH!!!!!\" --- but none are really answered here, and too much is obscured by Berlinger's badly mangled plot and ridiculous over-the-top, extremely fake-looking gore and (ha ha) special effects that take incompetence with CGI to a new low.The evil here is really in Artisan's money-hungry, impatient executives, who were so rabid to cook up a sequel in six months that they ruined what could have been a small miracle: a sequel with more soul and brains than it's provocative, if not exploitative, predecessor.",

Later they discover on a news broadcast that another touring group was attacked and disemboweled. Prime suspects and succumbing to weird hallucinations, they find tapes which might recount what happened during their black out better shedding light on five hours which are lost to them. Fearing that the Blair Witch is real and causing the hallucinations overcoming them, the group will attempt to piece together what happened as they unravel mentally to unusual circumstances occurring to them. Is the Blair Witch real? Or, are these characters merely so obsessed with the mythos of Elly Kedward that they conjure her up, leading to unspeakable acts by a group of people too consumed with a story where she seems so real even if she isn't? I will always be mixed about this film. There are many scenes I think work well. Like when tour guide, Jeffrey Donovan and his group, goth chick Kim Director, Wiccan \"nature witch\" Erica Leerhsen, & Elly Kedward researchers, Tristen Skyler and Stephen Barker Turner discover the missing footage by replaying backwards. The idea of discovering a time you can not remember playing back and revealing creepy things always works for me. When Tristine approaches the screen standing at about the same pose as Heather Donahue from \"The Blair Witch Project\", except carrying a sinister look, really gave me the creeps. The opening interviews(..which look like video documented footage)of annoyed citizens(..and a few who have profited from obsessed fans who have infiltrated their quite town)are very funny. I also like how crazy fans are lampooned as Ebay is mentioned. And Jeffrey's home is a nifty warehouse where he contains lots of cool technology which are used against him and his co-horts. Like the first film, these characters begin having a great time, drinking and smoking, just enjoying the event for what it is, only later falling prey to either supernatural forces, or problems of their own making. Maybe Berlinger's parable of media consumption causing us to commit acts is laid on a bit thick, but it is an interesting template to explore. But, I really hate when an opening camera fly over the Blair Witch mountains is interrupted with murders that will later occur. And, the whole asylum deal with Jeffrey left me rather underwhelmed. I think this really beats us over the head that Jeffrey isn't exactly mentally healthy. And, director Berlinger just keeps bringing it back up over and over. While I enjoyed how this film takes little joyous jabs at the first film, the way this tale unravels as our tour group see ghostly apparitions which could or could not exist(..among other things)I think Berlinger, attempting as much ambiguity as possible, loses the audience. I can respect ambiguity, I do, but after a while Berlinger really pummels us over the head with a lot of confusing situations which finally erupts into chaos at the end when Tristine is believed to be Elly. I do really like the final sequence at the end which shows from video evidence that what the characters were experiencing throughout doesn't correspond with what is actually recorded to be quite chilling. This is where Berlinger succeeds the most, I think. We experienced, through their madness, situations that perhaps never took place, delusions created by fans so obsessed with an untrue legend that fiction became fact in their minds..we are participants of this with the final sequence of events(..the interrogation and their acts caught on tape)revealing that we have just spent a great period of time with folks who believe strongly in something that is false.",

This movie was terrible and I got tired of the godawful acting. Erica is laughably blank and is supposed to be this wiccan who is in touch with what's going on -- yet she's the FIRST to die and is as clueless as the rest of them when things start going haywire.  The guy who plays Sheriff Cravens is unintentionally hilarious -- I keep waiting for him to say \"I'm gonna git dem Duke boys!\" and drive off to Hazzard County, he deserves the Shatner award for overacting.  Stephen is horrible and tells a stupid joke that made absolutely no sense and left everyone in the theater with me saying \"huh?\"  People say this movie is supposed to make you think, and they were right:  I began to think that I'd wasted my time and money and I was right.  This movie won the Razzie award for WORST sequel of 2001 and in my opinion is the worst sequel ever made... and that includes Exorcist 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4, The Phantom Menace, Leprechan 2-whatever, any Friday the 13th movie, any Nightmare on Elm Street movie and any Chucky movie.  The worst part is that they used that RIDICULOUS \"esrever\" thing as a marketing ploy to get people to watching it again!  Why not just fall on your knees and beg people to watch your lame flick?Oh, and to the reviewer that said he needed to smack people who didn't like this movie:  you have real courage... especially since you didn't even have the guts to put your real name on your review.

No solid storyline, made no sense, it wasn't believeable, and the acting wasn't up to par...oh, and the camera angles, jerky movements, etc made it that much worse.  Blair Witch 2, which shouldn't even really have that title if you ask me, is the same thing all over again, just with a bigger budget and a LITTLE less jerky camera stuff.  This movie has even less of a plot that the first did, and the end is even more unsatisfying as the original.  So, the acting wasn't the worst, but it wasn't that good...and the whole basis of the plot was just silly.  This is one of those movies where you see everything happen, then in the end- you find out you were either lied to the whole time or someone screwed with reality in some way as to make you think you saw what you saw when you really didn't.  Make sense?  Good, neither did this movie. That's because there was nothing to make sense of. If you're going to make any film, you need a script to start off with...a good one would help, but this movie doesn't even have a bad one.  It feels like a reel of film full of weird images and quick flashes of what seems to be mayhem...the director clearly thought editing would make this movie...it didn't.  I would stay away from this entire series no matter what...especially this one. \n1/10 - one since I was actually able to watch it till then end without shutting it off and cancelling cable, because it sucked so badly!",

            "content": "I don't understand why so many people are rating this film so low, while there are so many people who are voting so high for the first film; this is clearly a far superior film. Both are independent, but this actually has some scary scenes, whereas the first just had three stupid teenagers running around in the woods, getting drunk and high, and finally disappearing. This is far better. The film is about a few people who go into the same woods that the stupid teens went into in the first film; something very strange and apparently unexplainable happens, and they spend the rest of the film trying to figure out what exactly happened. The plot is very good, it starts out reminding the audience a lot of the first, and then drastically changing style, turning into a mystery-horror piece. The plot immediately takes off, I was pretty much completely into the film from the very first scene, whereas the first almost had me falling asleep during the first couple of scenes. It also has a great pace, while there constantly is something interesting or exciting going on, to keep you watching, without it getting cheesy, like many new Hollywood-like horror films tend to do. The acting is far better than the first film, at least for most of the characters. The main characters all seemed perfectly credible to me, which is far more than what I can say about the cast of the first film. Some of the supporting cast did seem a little lacking in acting ability, but these aren't actual actors, after all. The special effects and various shock effects are surprisingly good; I would be lying if I said I didn't jump in my seat at least three or four times. Now, as for the negative in the film; admittedly, the execution isn't as good as the idea itself, which is a bit unfortunate, because this plot really has potential, or, rather, \"had\". Definitely more potential than the film utilizes, unfortunately. I can't complain about any of the scary scenes or special effects, they were all handled extremely well; even things that, had they been done just in a slightly different manner, would have looked ridiculous, and made the viewer laugh out loud rather than send chills down his spine. This film is about as far away from the original as it could possibly get, without actually using a completely different story. All in all, a very well-made horror film, that far surpasses the mess that was the first Blair Witch film. I recommend it to anyone who saw the first and was sorely disappointed by it, and any fans of horror in general, as it will please most generic horror fans with it's reasonably vast amount of blood and gore, and the amount of shocks and jumpy moments. 6/10",

They set up a camera and watch strange things happen that they cannot explain. Basically no plot and the story relies heavily on gore and violence. Joe Berlinger can be credited for making things uncertain and stresses minds warped by media influence but the screenwriter is another bust altogether. Special effects are terrific with haunting atmosphere but the acting really sucks. Bad acting by Kim Director, Stephen Barker Turner, Tristen Skyler, Erica Leerhsen, and Jeffrey Donovan.

We now travel to Burkitsville where the aftermath of the film has spawned more attention than Beatle-mania. Tourists come and go hoping that they can get a glimpse of the Blair Witch. Now we find ourselves watching a string of events so pointless that no sense is to be made out of anything from start to finish. Meet out tour group, five teens consisting of and ex mental patient, a writer and his pregnant girlfriend, a real life witch and a gothic psychic who are going out into the woods to uncover the truth of what really happened in the first film. If the thought of a Blair Witch sequel doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth the fact that filmmakers are actually trying to push this as a true story should. At the beginning of the film we get a message that this is a fictionalized account of actual events. Give me a break, how stupid do these people really think we are, if you found the first a little hard to believe than this one is sure to make your brain melt. Director Joe Berlinger has such a hard time deciding what kind of film he is trying to make that it is almost more nauseating than the camera work in the first. We start off with a documentary style filming, reminiscing of the first, then kick into gory slasher movie, next comes teen explotion flick, then we come to psychotic House on Haunted Hill rip-off. The script is horrible and the story makes not the least bit of sense and you better believe that you won't get an explanation for anything that happens at the end of the film. Berlinger seems more interested in just filming some weird images and having them edited into one huge mess rather than making a horror movie (believe me there is not one scare to be had in the entire film). Berlinger has had great success with his acclaimed Paradise Lost documentaries but it is clear he is not ready for a major motion picture. We see foreshadowing and flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks and strange dream sequences, you will find yourself totally lost by the halfway mark, but that doesn't really matter because it all amounts to nothing anyway. I would be lying if I said that I hated the first Blair Witch Project but why it needed a sequel is beyond me especially since this one losses sight of the Blair Witch completely about fifteen minutes in and there is not one mention of a Book of Shadows. The acting is horrible, the direction is horrible, the script is horrible, it is by no means a sequel, a prequel or a remake and I can honestly say that it ranks among my list of worst movies I've ever seen, avoid at all costs.",

Dick Beebe and Joe Berlinger are, for writing this goofy mess. As people have already commented, what made the first Blair Witch great is the way it was filmed, docu-style with two camcorders. The elements of mystery were what made the movie great and gave it its eerie mood. Blair Witch 2 follows the exploits of a group of weed-smoking teenage student cretins, who have flashbacks to past and present in which they are savagely attacked in the woods. This movie is unbelievable, it was shot like a normal movie with real cameras and Dolby stereo sound which completely detracted the creepyness of the first. I hated all the characters, they were pathetic and terrible actors. And the worst thing about this movie is the fact that they made out the first Blair Witch movie to be just that .. a movie. I couldn't believe it .. if you are going to make a sequel, you could at least assume that the prequel was real. By openly acknowledging the original was a movie, it crapped on it, as audiences can no longer believe that Burkitsville Woods housed the Blair Witch, therefore audiences can not believe that the students are threatened with any imminent danger.

Now five die-hard fans of the movie:Kim (Kim Director), Jeffery (Jeffery Donovan), Erica (Erica Leerhsen), Tristine (Tristine Skyler) and Stephen (Stephen Baker Turner) are visiting the woods. Where the original film is set-up but after an night of partying and drinking too-heavily. The five strangers found their stuff destroyed and having no real memory of what they done that night. Slowly these five people find themselves seeing visions or ghostly presence that haunts them and there's nothing what it seems from these people or the things they experienced.Directed by documentary filmmaker:Joe Berlinger (Metallica:Some Kind of Monster, Paradise Lost) made an interesting although flawed and not very scary loose sequel of \"The Blair Witch Project\". Berlinger isn't very happy how Artisan (now Lions Gate Films) re-cut his version, which could have been much better. Which the Director explained in the entertaining audio commentary track. Die-Hard fans of the original were truly disappointed that \"The Blair Witch Project\" was only an movie and this one takes an different style of modern film-making. \"Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2\" did make an small profit at the box office, it is probably completely forgotten now but the movie does have an small loyal of fans. Which some people will say \"Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2\" is a minor cult film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an filmmaker commentary track, an selected scene commentary by music composer:Carter Burwell (Psycho 3, In Bruges, No Country for Old Men) and more. DVD also has CD Side with an few songs from the film and the entire soundtrack from the movie. Director Berlinger did really try to make this an scary movie with an few jabs at satire but it doesn't always work. The cast do give their 110 % (especially Donovan is terrific) but only Larry Flaherty as Sheriff Cravens gives an laughable amateurish performance that hurts the movie, when he is on-screen. Otherwise... that's one of the few minor flaws of \"Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2\". I doubt, we will see Berlinger's true director's cut one day but it is certainly an underrated film with some occasional cleverness. Worth a look. (****/*****).",

The execution of it was absolutely HORRIBLE and ended up with very disasterous results! A film with no visible plot, loose ends that never got tied up(could someone please tell me the significance of showing Jeff in the mental hospital if it didn't help to push the plot along), no concept of foreshadowing, unnecessary use of gore and nudity, characters I couldn't sympathize with in the least, and the worst acting I've ever seen!

Soon after wards three of them are being questioned by the police about eight murders but none of the three seem to remember what happened. Their video footage of all the events are going to tell the entire story. It's well known that the directors of the original film weren't ready for a sequel so the studio pretty much just did one on their own and the end results are mixed to say the least. I don't think this is a good movie and in fact I'd call it a very frustrating one but at the same time I somewhat give the studio credit for trying something at least a little different and not just a rehash on the original film. The thing that was so frustrating is that the movie is on the brink of becoming interesting so you keep watching it but nothing special ever happens. Something might happen to wake you up or make you pay a little closer attention but then you're just letdown by something else that either doesn't work or something that's simply annoying. One thing that doesn't help is that all five characters are rather annoying. I thought the actors all did a good job with their roles but the screenplay has them fighting way too much to the point where you'd wish they'd all just shut up and go away. This certainly isn't a good thing when you're suppose to care for these people and want them to survive what they're going through. The non-stop fighting just wore my patience thin and after a while I really gave up on the characters and couldn't care what happened to any of them. Another major problem is that the film itself really doesn't seem to know what type of story it's trying to tell. The director has stated that the studio took the film over and edited it behind his back and I'd believe this because the entire thing is rather confusing. There's a big twist ending but I must admit that it wasn't nearly as shocking or horrific as it was trying to be. I wouldn't say the director was without blame though as some of the heavy metal music didn't work at all and the quick edits of violence was also rather bland. The screenplay also makes the mistake of having the characters sitting around watching the video of the events that happened in the woods and none of this is very interesting either. Once again, each time something decent does happen they follow it up with something bland. Now, the most disappointing thing about BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLACK WITCH 2 is the fact that it's simply not scary. There isn't one tense moment to be found here and that's a real shame considering how powerful the original movie was. In the end this sequel just comes off as irritating because you go into it hoping for something special but it just never happens.",

Maybe his ideas were watered down in re-write.  Or maybe there was studio pressure.  Regardless, \"Book of Shadows\" is a shambles, either as a stand-alone or as a follow-up to the inventive original. (The original, by the way, scored its success in part because it didn't pander;  \"Book of Shadows\" is nothing if not pandering, from its Goth chick to its \"Deliverance\"-like treatment of the locals to the death rock on the soundtrack.  The subtext of this multi-million dollar production is that it understands those on society's fringe and those who imagine themselves to be on the fringe, and that it sympathizes;  really, though, it just wants their money.)  So much is wrong here that I don't think there's any reason to go into it. Is there?  One thing, though:  the actor portraying Sherriff Cravens (I can't find his name here) gives the worst performance I've seen in a major film in a long, long time.

But all the various character's stereotypes end up being the reason why I come back to it, from the 'I totally know more than I should know' goth chick, the skeptical of the occult writer, the wiccan chick, the 'Oh I only do this for the money' tour leader.\nIn short Blair Witch 2 is worth a pass over but don't expect something wow woah, go into it expecting some really cheesy kinda not that great plot, and laugh as events unfold before you.",

            "content": "...and I somewhat succeeded.  Why, you ask, did I want to try to like this movie?  Well, I rented it on video, hated it and then decided to buy it on DVD, granted the price was 5.99.  Just so people know, the DVD is a DVD and CD combined.  I felt even if my thoughts of the movie remained the same, at least I'll get the cool soundtrack.  And it was only 5.99.  So I didn't have much to lose.  I liked the movie a lot more the second time around, though I'd still rate it as OK.  The film has an intriguing premise that keeps the audience guessing.  That's the good part.  The bad part, you ask?  The premise doesn't pay off, and we're led to a third act that's mostly populated by pretentious gibberish.  The acting is decent, except for the old guy who plays the sheriff.  That goth chick and the redhead are both really hot!  There are cool horror images.  I hated the original \"Blair Witch\" with a passion, so this is a masterpiece compared to that overblown dud of a motion picture.  This one didn't scare me either, but it intrigued and amused me.  Not a film worthy of rushing to the video store, but a fairly good one nonetheless.   \nMy score:  6 (out of 10)",

            "content": "Here's the setting: it's a day before the movie starts, and I'm calling up a few friends to see this movie, and I'm really excited to see the long-awaited (for me, anyways) sequel to the cult phenomenon \"The Blair Witch Project\". Well, it's the day of the movie, and I'm reading reviews that absolutely tear this movie apart because of it's crappiness.  But hey, it's a sequel, how bad can it be?Well, overall, the movie was pretty suspenseful.  I enjoyed Dick Beebe's writing in \"House on Haunted Hill\", which was a good horror film, as well, so that kind of raised the standards for me, here.  Also, the editing job on this movie is quite superior, in contrast to a review I read somewhere. The editing jumps back from before and after this whole incident occurs, and really keeps you wondering. I liked the storyline, as well. It kept you into the movie throughout it's whole run. But, as someone mentioned on these reviews, it definitely relies on shock value. BW2, for the general teen audience that will see this film, is a pretty twisted, graphic and disturbing film, which is probably what director Joe Berlinger's target was. It really doesn't bother me as much, because I think it made the movie better...to a certain point. The gore kind of got...well...boring for me after a while. The weak stomach may have trouble watching this movie, but folks like me may get tired of seeing it. But the good side of this movie that it had some suspense sprinkled throughout, especially when they start contemplating about the strange events they had during their stay in the woods and they are viewing their videotapes. Also, it does come to a pretty amazing climax.  Getting off the track a little, it does have an awesome soundtrack, too.All in all, the sequel holds true to the legend, but don't expect it to be much like the first movie, which truly scared the hell out of me because of it's play on the mind. In this film, it plays with the mind, but also heavily (and at times redundantly) plays on the eyes. 7/10P.S. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for Blair Witch 3 next year, as well.",

So bad is this celluloid abomination,that I was amazed that I was watching this in a cinema. Made on a budget of $10 million(still low by mainstream standards)It feels like a straight to video cheepie that will sit on the bottom shelf at video shops the world over. After all unlike the original's low production value's which contributed to the success of the first film,this was made to appeal to the idiot's who were bemused by the lack of special effects and conventional photography,well they're going the wrong way about it with this amatuer effort. The acting,direction and scripting is more rank than the navy. When I saw this on opening night,the audience sniggered with laughter throughout. There should be a law against putting films out in cinema like this one and insulting undeserving punters by conning them of \u00a35.00.

No further investigation into the witch, just a couple of new teenagers...I think the movie was lousy, to say it all in one word. There is no tension building up through the movie, it's more like unexpected short cuts that make you jump a little, and that's a very cheap way to scare people. Like in most other horror movies, a lot of things happens without explanation. But if there never is an explanation it's not frightening, it's just frustrating. A horror movie should build up tension and in the end you get to know. Like in \"The Ring\", and watching BW2 was like waiting for the girl to come out of the TV, but she never did. The whole movie through, it feels like something is missing. Part from the tension, it's a story. I also got the feeling that the creators thought that nudity and sex would be just as good as a story. Several times the nudity feels very unnecessary with the actors walking around naked for, as it seems, no particular reason. Probably just a way to make the movie interesting in some way ;).The plot didn't make much sense to me and the end didn't make any sense at all. I can see that it's all the work of the Blair Witch but you never really get to know that in a good way, and I guess that's supposed to be the scary part but judging from the many low grades given to the movie, many people think like me - it isn't!

I think the critics usually miss the boat with horror films. The acting is decent and did the job for me, but the important thing is it is supposed to be fun, mysterious, and entertaining. It was.

            "content": "Book of Shadows\" begins with not so much a recap of the events of the original, but an overview of the hysteria caused by a film called \"The Blair Witch Project\". It acknowledges the original as a work of fiction (a la \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\") as evening news shows report about the fans overrunning the real-life small town of Burkittsville, Maryland.Hey, sequels aren't easy. The movie, directed and co-written by Joe Berlinger, isn't a lazy retread of The Blair Witch Project (1999) but a fractured and semi-satirical meditation on it. Berlinger takes as his subject the box office phenomenon of the first film, and then goes on, with both fervor and an amazing lack of genre savvy, to raise solemn issues about the role of media in messing with people's heads and inducing them to commit acts of violence. Is the Blair Witch herself driving the movie's young, impressionable protagonists to murder, or have they simply watched too many horror pictures? Berlinger knew a straight redux of the found footage gimmick of the first film wouldn't have worked, so he didn't even try. He then looked at what were the key elements of the original and what he might be able to do with them. One detail he carried through was the cast of total unknowns acting under their real names. Another detail is the significance of the website to the enjoyment of the experience. This time out, you really need to go the official site for much of characters' histories and for any mention or description of what a \"Book of Shadows\" actually is. The best idea Berlinger had was to take the idea of the audience using the \"lost\" footage to discover what had happened to the campers, and this time have the campers try to find what had happened to themselves.Book of Shadows is spicier than the first; the actors are more developed, interesting, and additionally more appealing to look at. Of course the latter lacks relevance to the movie as a whole, but it's especially a bonus compared to the first. Anyhow, the array and diversity of the characters is also something new that was not in the original. This finds itself with a story that is insofar only connected by the name, while the screenplay widely acknowledges the previous movie as just a movie. Here, there is actually an element of creepiness. One of the best offerings Book of Shadows had was the element of manipulation. It combined the mental state of delusion and group hysteria along with video manipulation. It's as cataleptic as the first, but in more of a satisfying way.with Joe Berlinger as writer/director. He retains the spirit of the prototype, while going dangerously deep into the concept of \"perception is reality\". What happens to these people is scary, because they don't know what to believe. They learn not to trust their eyesight. Flashbacks and flash forwards crash their consciousness. Dreams become as vivid as woken fear.In the end the cameras hold the secret of what is and what is not true. Compared to a special effects gross-out, like The Hostel franchise, this has an edge.The script is acerbic and funny, the characters not without interest. Kim snaps at Jeff: \"You're a long way from sane\". Perhaps that's right. The loony is still off his head. The sheriff certainly believes so. And yet, despite obvious paranoia, Jeff seems to understand how far beyond a joke the situation has reached. Steve calls it \"collective delusion\". There is another word. Terror.Where the original was a faux-documentary, this one sells itself as a re-enactment. That aspect is treated with wit and intelligence.Erica Leerhson and Kim Director are intriguing to watch. Tristen Skyler is only transitorily their equivalent.Jeffrey Donovan is very out there and gives a fun performance,at his audition, a camera was put on Jeffery Donovan and he was asked what he thought of the original Blair Witch Project. His answer: \"I think it sucks\". He still got the part.Stephen barker Turner puts a lot of emotion in his performance and looks very familiar The acting is overall solid.It is to their credit that the filmmaker and screenwriters tried to offer something different and original. Blair Witch 2 follows its own rules but I'm not sure everybody will dig the game it's playing. I have a feeling that many people will hate this sequel but that with time the masses will learn to appreciate it for what it is: A different, ballsy, unorthodox film. Bring on Part 3.",

But you know, it totally worked. Sequels are hard to make. Joe Berlinger and Dick Beebe wanted to make this as a psychological thriller and meditation on mass hysteria - it's also about how one town can become a place that it only was on film - and create a movie that was the direct opposite of the first film.Book of Shadows is closer to the Hollywood movies that the original went so hard away from. Berlinger originally made the film with an ambiguous tone that didn't give away exactly what happened when the characters stayed overnight in the Black Hills. Artisan wanted a more commerical film, so they had him recut and reshoot this to make it more commercial. That footage was shot weeks from the release in a time when movies had to have prints made, not like how they could just upload the movie to theaters.The interrogation that is spread throughout the movie was originally an eight-minute end of the story, but the studio also asked them to be spliced through the story. The filmmakers wanted a story that went from a lighthearted romp to suddenly getting violent and dark. They also added in Marilyn Manson's \"Disposable Teens,\" which replaced Frank Sinatra's \"Witchcraft.\"Actually, I said this was a bomb earlier and it made $47 million on a $15 million budget. For any other movie, that'd be a success. But it didn't equal what the first movie did. Honestly, that was impossible.Tourists are filling up the small town of Burkittsville, Maryland, hoping to be part of the same occult scares that they saw in The Blair Witch Project. Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) is obsessed with the movie and takes a group on a tour. They include Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) and his pregnant girlfriend Tristen (Tristine Skyler), Wiccan Erica (Erica Leerhsen) and goth Kim (Kim Director). They camp in a cabin in the woods and hope to see something. Jeff already notices a tree in the middle of the house that was never there in his memory.After doing drugs, everyone wakes up to Tristen losing her baby. It gets worse - they've all been marked for death, their research destroyed and the world itself turning on them. When they play the. Tapes they find under the house backward, they see themselves taking part in a demonic ritual orgy and murdering other tourists. The video footage the police show them is even more damning, putting the statement that Jeff makes earlier, \"Film lies but video always tells the truth\" to the worst test.Berlinger has mostly made true crime movies in his career, like the Paradise Lost Trilogy, in which he told the story of others who had been blamed for their occult murders, the West Memphis Three. He tried to make a horror movie while also creating a film that took audiences to task for believing everything shot on video to be true. People just wanted more of the same.I know it's pretty on the nose, but I love that this ended with Poe's \"Haunted.\"",

            "content": "The Blair Witch Project was a brilliant supernatural horror film to successfully use the video footage look and present it as found footage to create a big hype, and this a sequel with hardly any relation. Basically it focuses on four Boston college students, researchers Jeffrey Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan) and Tristen Ryler (Tristine Skyler), witch craft enthusiast Erica Geerson (Erica Leerhsen) and psychic goth Kim Diamond (Kim Director). They are fascinated by the events portrayed in the Blair Witch movie, and there are those who think it was fake, but they are obviously of those that speculate whether there is in fact a witch in Burkittsville, Maryland. So the four students decide to go to the woods where the three students of the Blair Witch movie disappeared, hoping to capture some evidence themselves. After filming themselves sleeping through the night in the site the video footage was found, Rustin Parr's house, and experiencing a little disturbance, they return to town to Jeff's house. There they look through all the footage they captured, and see that it is a little all over the place with timing, and they see themselves doing stuff that they would never remember. Also, through seeing all this we see the students being interviewed by the police about a murder, obviously by the end we see who they are referring to, Tristen being hung. Also starring Stephen Barker Turner as Stephen Ryan Parker, Kurt Loder as MTV newscaster and Chuck Scarborough as Newcaster. The first film was a phenomenal film for making you scared without actually seeing anything, and also the improvising of actions and dialogue made it more realistic. This sequel is the complete opposite, it looks like any regular film with teen pop music, predictable characters, dialogue and events, and it just feels pointless, a stupid film that won't scare or surprise you in any way. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Director for Joe Berlinger, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for Any two actors in the movie and Worst Screenplay.

            "content": "When \"The Blair Witch Project\" became the sleeper hit of 1999, a sequel became inevitable. Despite being adsorbed widely through pop culture via parodies and rip-offs, sequelizing \"The Blair Witch Project\" was a tricky proposition. Found footage sequels are common today but the style was rare at the turn of the millennium. More importantly, the original film was self-contained and didn't leave much opportunity for a follow-up. Commerce would not be denied. Ignoring all these problems, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" was quickly thrown together and released a year after the original.The film starts with an interesting hook. Instead of directly following the original's conclusive ending, \"Blair Witch 2\" takes the meta approach. The film is set in \"our\" world, were \"The Blair Witch Project\" wasn't a true story but only a wildly successful movie. Thus the film dismisses the found footage angle entirely, progressing as a typical, third-person movie. The story at first focuses on how the real town of Burkittsville was affected by the sudden rush of attention following the movie. During this time, a number of businesses popped up, taking curious tourists on tours through the woods. Among these groups is Jeff Patterson, who makes decent money selling stick-men and genuine Burkittsville dirt over the internet. His freshman tour group, composed of himself, goth girl Kim, would-be wiccan Erica, and married couple Stephen and Tristen, quickly begin to experience strange things in the woods and in the broom factory Jeff calls home.Though the premise isn't without promise, \"Book of Shadows\" squanders any interest the set-up could deliver. First off, this movie stinks of the year 2000. From the obnoxious nu-metal soundtrack, to the fashion and style, this movie reeks of the turn-of-the-century. Compared to the striped-down, stark style of the original, \"Book of Shadows\" is a glossy studio product, as crass a cash-in that has ever existed.The movie is also exceptionally stupid. The film indulges in so many late-nineties horror clich\u00e9s that it almost feels like a parody. The film is inconsistently told in flashback, cutting haphazardly between the past and the future. All this does is drain away any suspense, since it tells us which characters survive. Upon entering the woods and coming to the ruins of an old building, the tour group immediately indulges in drugs. They drink, smoke pot, and even whip a crack pipe out. Despite one of them being a pregnant woman. As divergent as the characters' backgrounds are, they all get wasted. They wake up in the morning, hung over, their camp site wrecked. Most of the rest of the film is devoted to them snipping at each other in the broom factory, nightmare sequences that may or may not be real, and occasionally the characters trying to solve a mystery. Not the mystery of whether real black magic is happening here. The mystery of what happened to their video cameras.There's a lot wrong with \"Blair Witch 2\" but the biggest problem is its shotgun editing. Throughout the film, scenes will cut away to incoherent footage of people being stabbed and killed. The characters are haunted by incoherent visions. Stephen and Tristen dream about having sex, which turns into them slashing each other with their nails. Everyone sees visions of a backwards walking ghost girl. At one point, Kim sees Jeff in an electric chair, his body sparking and twitching. There are visions of ghost kids, barking dogs, and bloody murder. These fantasy scenes are cut into the film in a spastic manner. So much so that they are frequently funny, like when one of the characters starts chewing on a dead owl. What level of realty this takes place on isn't elaborated on. Which is confusing, especially once a falling bridge comes into the picture.The movie's terrible construction isn't help but it's awful characters. Jeffrey Donovan would, years later, find fame on TV series \"Burn Notice.\" I bet he doesn't put this movie on his resume. His character is obnoxious and the performance is pitched at an embarrassingly ham-fisted level. Erica Leerhsen is far too earnest as the wiccan. She's the kind of girl you'd meet in college who wouldn't stop harping on one or two topics, even if no one else was interested. You hate people like that. Stephen Barker Turner is hassled with a deeply unlikable character while Tristine Skyler, as his wife, spends most of the movie lying sick in bed. Kim Director comes the closest to likable as the goth girl but even she is forced to do incredibly stupid things by the senseless screenplay. An exchange in a local grocery store is especially embarrassing.The direction is awful, the characters are annoying, but the script is the biggest problem. The supernatural events that happen are never connected in any meaningful way. Weird stuff goes on for seemingly no reason. Plot points are raised and dropped. Jeff's time in a mental hospital, Kim's supposed psychic powers, or Tristen's miscarriage come up but have no meaningful affect on the story. An especially ridiculous plot turn involves playing a tape backwards. The film reaches for a level of ambiguity it in no way earns. Few answers are provided for the sake of \"preserving the mystery.\" Is the Blair Witch real? Is she responsible for what happens? How does this connect to the first film? All this really means is that, upon any scrutiny, the film stops making sense completely. For a clue of the film's intense inanity, look no further then its meaningless sub-title. No books containing shadows are seen during the 87 minute run time.The movie was so bad that even a public with Blair Witch fever rejected it. It more then doubled its tiny budget but the response was so negative that no further sequels were made. \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" was rightfully dismissed as the crass cash-in it was.",

What we have is five college students that go into the woods near Burkittsville to investigate the disappearance of the original film crew. The cinematography is not as rough, raw and jerky as the first. There is actually some pretty good F/X. A jumbled story line and the mix of the five characters makes for some nerve wrecking. My favorite scene is actually when they watch the playback of the episode of missing time the group cannot remember. This did make the hair on the back of my neck rise. Creepy! Nudity and foul language seems mandatory for realism. Besides the appearance of MTV's Kurt Loder the cast is pretty lame. But of note is Erica Leerhsen who can grab your attention with or without clothes on. The actual musical score is haunting and meandering. The soundtrack hits pretty hard with music for the likes of Godhead, Rob Zombie, Slaves On Dope and probably most impressive is P.O.D. This is not the worst...but a movie away from being the best.",

The movie does nothing to scare or create any tension that was ever present in the first film. The creators thought they could throw whatever on the screen and capitalize on the past success but all this movie does is make a shameful movie that everyone involved most likely wanted to forget as soon as it was released.Book of Shadows has nothing to do with any book that I could recall though I stopped paying close attention before the first hour was over. The movie stresses that this movie is involved with the first one with news story praising the success of the first film. The setting is the same Maryland woods as the characters are fanatics of the real film. The group goes out there and experiences the same phenomenon. It is a wonder that the first film could make this local so haunting and the second feels like a spoof film canceling out all the dread that was steadily built. Nothing scary happens at all during the initial scenes.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

            "content": "This movie could have benefited from never being made.  In theory, it was probably a great idea.  Take a look at the phenomenom spawned by the Blair Witch Project- a recent cinematic feat that's been mirror and mimicked by plenty since (even I've made a bloody blair witch spoof), cast the director of Paradise Lost- guys who've researched mysterious child murders with possible occult tie-ins, and let the dollars come rushing in. Unfortunately, this film is a mess.  It was a tricky idea to pull off, and it looks like they really rushed their way through what could have been a carefully constructed study on media exploitation of cultural phenomena, psychosis, and faulty camera equiptment.the movie is just generally uneven.  The commencement focuses on the Blair Witch hysteria and how its plagued the small town in witch its based, carefully never hinting as to whether the movie was ficitional or not.  The characters in the movie live in a sublet of our culture wherein the phenomenon caught on, but the three actors didn't go on talk shows and get numerous interviews. \"We know it's real\" they exclaim.  Blair-Witch Hunt crews explore the woods and exploit people's wallets.  It's a biting satire of the the capitalizisation that inadvertently comes with every trend. This segment of the movie is designed with cheesy one-liners and a generally light-fared plotline.   The movie then attempts to take itself seriously and falls flat on its nose, cracking that nose causing a surge of  blood and gore to gush out ruining what could have been a delightfully beautiful face. Speaking of which, there's relatively no gore in this movie- which is a plus- but the more explicit scenes come in flashes of projected Blair Witch induced slayings- which may or may not be the ones that legend has said took place in the woods.the acting is subpar. the terror is absent.  and it's not because barely anyone dies or because nothing jumps out of each corner, that was a wise part on behalf of the directors-who obviously took notes from the first movie.  It's just that nearly every attempts to turn frightening fail to inspire the sympathy for the characters that other movies, such as the first Blair Witch did.  They're each unique and i did appreciate some of the techniques used by the actors/actresses (esp. the uppity \"i understand and you don't cos I'm a\" wiccan character. that hit close to home) but the development is severely lacking.  On a positive note, the movie does leave you with a dilemma that the film never answers and you can debate with your friends afterwards- but it hardly inspires you to sit down and go through the process of watching it again.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining horror flick about a haunting witch that's been dead for over two centuries",
            "content": "Released in 2000 and directed by Joe Berlinger, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" begins amidst the hysteria of the found-footage of the first film. People from around the world curious about the Blair witch phenomenon overrun Burkittsville, Maryland, wherein an entrepreneurial dude named Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) leads a 'Blair Witch Hunt' tour involving four clients, a Wiccan, a Goth girl and an academic couple. After camping at the ruins of the home of an executed murderous hermit (who was evidently possessed by the spirit of the witch in the 1940s) the group has a rude awakening when they can't remember what happened the night before. They go to Jeff's nearby pad\u2014a curious factory-turned-house\u2014to review the video tapes for answers and discover something horribly macabre.Atmospherically, \"Book of Shadows\" is quite effective as a haunting ghost/witch flick and the writing is actually smart\u2014the entire play on hysteria, delusion & perception is quite clever. The screenplay was written by director Berlinger, who's best known for the great \"Paradise Lost\" trilogy of documentaries about the \"West Memphis three,\" youthful outcasts accused of a hideous 1993 triple murder in Arkansas based on dubious evidence (and who were finally released in 2011). Anyway, \"Book of Shadows\" starts satirically and amusing, but gets increasing serious and sinister. The acting is good too, with Kim Director's powerhouse performance as the Goth girl standing out. Erica Leerhsen is also a highlight as the Wiccan babe with several alluring scenes, but they coulda done more with her.The reason so many people call this flick \"the worst movie ever made\" (Why sure!) is obviously because it's a knee-jerk reaction to it being a sequel to the mega-popular \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999), which was an altogether different kind of movie, being a found-footage flick, not to mention the herd-mentality of an over-critical feeding-frenzy. Since I'm not a fan of found-footage films\u2014seeing as how they're about as entertaining as watching home movies for an hour and a half\u2014I find \"Book of Shadows\" far more interesting than the first film.There's a secret message in the movie that you can discover in (***SPOILER ALERT***): the FIRE, the GRASS, the factory WINDOW, the GRAVESTONE and the RUG, which all-together spells: \"Seek me no further or...\". This combined with reversing Tristen's backward words in the last act reveal the secret of 'ESREVER': \"Seek me no further or... the children will again walk free,\" meaning: the Blair witch would loose the spirits of the murdered children to torment the invaders of her domain. (***END SPOILER***) As for the complaints of there being no Book of Shadows, it's simply not true. The character Jeff is a movie enthusiast with ambitions of being a filmmaker and \"Book of Shadows\" is the name of one of the scripts he put together and intends to shoot. So it's not something totally out of nowhere that Artisan dubiously added to the title, as most people think. Yes, they added it, but it had relevance to the movie. Furthermore, the actual 'Book of Shadows' is a Wiccan spell book and is figuratively used in the movie in that the group obviously falls under the spell of the Blair Witch after entering her diabolical terrain.The film features a creative score by Carter Burwell and a rockin' soundtrack with quality cuts by the likes of Marilyn Manson (\"Disposable Teens\"), Godhead (\"The Reckoning\") and many more.After Berlinger finished his version of the movie the studio complained that there weren't enough conventional horror elements and so additional scenes were shot & edited into the picture. What else is new? It has been thus throughout cinematic history. For me, the added scenes beef-up what might've otherwise been too low-key for a horror flick. True, this route was taken with the first film, but \"Book of Shadows\" is the antithesis of that movie, and it's the better for it IMHO.\"Book of Shadows\" is a dense horror flick and therefore worthy of repeat viewings for gems to mine. (One aid in helping to understand the picture is Jeff's statement at the camp: \"Film lies; video tells the truth\"). Unfortunately, this is evidently too much for some dullards. Yes, it's a slow-build with meandering aspects, but the movie's laden with subtext and the climax is pretty horrific, even while it's somewhat predictable. You never see the witch, but her nefarious presence is palpable nevertheless and the ambiance fittingly oozes Gothic. As for the doofuses who argue that the pic has too little to do with the first one, nothing could be further from the truth. Lastly, Jeff's factory-turned-house is almost iconic; a great location for a ghostly horror flick.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Maryland.GRADE: B",

It had some vision that most films of its ilk severely lack, and was about as un-Hollywood as you can get. In part because of this, there was this buzz of uncertainty about it. When it came out, I was just starting high school, and there was a lot of gossip about how this actually was true.Blair Witch 2 completely betrayed that. And profoundly betrayed it.The actors were all pretty teens. The plot was nonsensical and nothing was actually resolved or revealed. What was advertised as an exploration of the Blair Witch legend didn't explore it at all, but just contrived new stuff, handed us archetypal characters that were impossible to care about, and attempted to draw it all back to videos, as if it somehow made the first movie more meaningful.What was truly ironic about all this was that the fact that this was bigger budget never actually came up. The first movie had no money, and so attempted to scare us with suggestion and inference. This movie HAD money, and tried to scare us overtly, but the best it could do was a pristine dead girl in a closet? STILL no actual sighting of the Blair Witch? But it's not all that surprising. Even on the video release of the first film, the downward spiral was becoming evident. The new footage was the three actors (on better quality tape) just sitting around and regurgitating stuff they had already said in the theatrical release. The creators had nothing to add, but added for the sake of it. Which is exactly what Book of Shadows is.",

            "content": "In the Autumn of 1999 after the release of The Blair Witch Project, the town of Burkittsville, Maryland sees a massive boon in tourists who are obsessed with the Blair Witch legend giving rise to tourism in the area. One such tour, The Blair Witch Hunt run by Jeffrey Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan) is having its inaugural tour with boyfriend/girlfriend graduate students Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) and Tristen (Tristine Skyler), goth girl Kim (Kim Director), and wiccan Erica (Erica Leershen). During a wild first night the group blackout and awken to find Stephen and Tristen's research papers have been torn to shreds and a slow descent into madness begins.Following the success of The Blair Witch Project Artisan Entertainment were eager for a sequel, but producers Haxan films wanted to wait until the hype over the film died down before attempting a follow-up. Artisan instead made the decision to move forward on a follow-up without the original writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, though they are credited as executive producers. True crime documentarian Joe Berlinger was hired to direct in what would be his first narrative feature film (and also his last until 2019's Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile). Berlinger sought to make something the direct opposite of the original film as the filmmaking and camera work had been subject to widespread parody following the film's release and Berlinger instead of making a straight horror film aimed for a more satirical film lampooning the lazy consumption of media that allowed audiences to be fooled into thinking The Blair Witch Project was a documentary. Artisan did not like Berlinger's original cut and made requests for new kill footage to be inserted throughout the film, the additional of mental hospital sequences, and the 8-minute epilogue that bookended the film set in a police interrogation room would instead be sprinkled in vignettes throughout the film. The film was a far cry from the success of the first film as Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 only made $26 million in the United States a far cry from the $140 million the first one had produced with interational numbers only bringing the film to $47 million against its $15 million budget. Critics and audiences also panned the film, and Artisan ended up scrapping a planned Blair Witch 3. While the movie does have some interesting ideas about mass hysteria and consumption of media, it conveys those ideas rather sloppily and poorly.Easily the best part of the film is the opening 5 minutes where Berlinger gives a snapshot of the hype around The Blair Witch project using clips from Roger Ebert's At the Movies, late night talk show hosts Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno, and interviews with residents of Burkittsville to look at the cultural ripples caused by the film with some very funny deadpan deliveries on things such as \"shipping rocks\" getting a good smirk from me. But unfortunately the film heads down hill and fast once we meet our main characters on the Blair Witch Hunt and while I didn't think much of the three characters from the first Blair Witch movie, Blair Witch 2's characters make those three look like the pinnacle of John Hughes' writing. The characters in Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 come from the Kevin Williamson school of late 90s horror tropes with them falling into the same Gen X cynical and \"too smart for their own good\" archetypes that might've been interesting were it 1996, but after multiple imitators across several different teen skewing horror films it's pretty hard to see these generic twenty somethings as anything other than \"a copy of a copy of a copy\" that's seen its edge dull from crisp clarity to a messy pixelated blob. The movie's edited like scenes were placed in a blender with random gore shots or cuts to the police interrogation never creating any sort of atmosphere of creeping dread especially since the interrogation room sequences spoil who's going to be left alive. The editing in Book of Shadows is some of the most frustrating I've ever seen with the opening having at least 4 different time identifying texts that will leave audiences confused and bewildered as to where we even are.Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 seems like it has a nugget of a good idea with satirizing the frenzy around The Blair Witch Project, but with the sloppy editing, unlikable characters, and virtually non-existent story good ideas alone aren't enough to salvage a mess like this. Maybe if Berlinger's cut that had a more satirical tone had been released maybe this material could've worked, but you're still stuck with a group of bland unlikable characters so it's a crapshoot.",

            "content": "what this movie wanted to be: a psychological thriller or a sequel to 1999's ground breaking \"The Blair Witch Project\".  I vote for the latter.  \"Blair Witch 2\" really has nothing to do with the first film except for the hype surrounding it.  All \"Blair Witch 2\" is really about is five people (a tour guide, a writer and his pregnant girlfriend, a girl who is into Witchcraft, and a Goth chick) who go into the woods in Burketsville, Maryland to find out what really happened there.  They decide to spend the night in the woods and they set up a surveillance system to video record anything that might happen.  They wake up the next morning only to discover that the surveillance equipment has been trashed, the writer's papers have been ripped up, the pregnant girl has had a miscarriage and they have no memory of what happened the night before. I don't know what to really make of this film.  I really can't say if I liked it or hated it.  This movie does manage to maintain a constant level of creepiness but it unfortunately never amounts to a big pay off.  However, that level of creepiness is actually one of this films biggest merits. Since no one is really sure if the events of \"The Blair Witch Project\" actually occurred, that adds to the overall goodness of the film.  Whether \"The Blair Witch Project\" really happened or is just a brilliant hoax concocted by local townspeople or talented movie makers is anyone's guess. This is where the concepts of fantasy and reality come into play.  Is the Blair Witch real?  Did three students really disappear into the woods of Burketsville, Maryland?  But as I said before, none of this ever amounts anything truly satisfying.  This is what \"Blair Witch 2\" should have done which was try to explain the mystery of the Blair Witch, but it instead opted for the usual cheap scares.    6/10",

            "content": "This follow-up to the ground-breaking film that introduced many of us to the Found Footage concept is a 'fictional re-enactment of events following the events of The Blair Witch Project.' It starts promisingly, with Burkittsville residents being irritated and financially bolstered by the notoriety their town has attracted. Some dialogue is rank, (\"There are always naysayers who come here and say \u0085 nay.\") and the characters are pretty unlikable and stereotypical (we are introduced to Kim (Kim Director) lying back on a grave, smoking, dressed all in black and daubed with heavy make-up \u2013 so she'll be a goth then). Erica (Erica Geerson) is a Wiccan and therefore sensitive to whatever 'curse' may or may not be out there. They seem to be a bit stoned and listen to rock music and might possibly have just stumbled off a catwalk. Text book, picturesque teens. A disappointing development after the realism displayed by Heather, Mikey and Josh from the original.This is a major flaw. Main character Jeffrey (Jeffrey Donovan) has a history of hospitalisation and is victimised by the local Sheriff (who seems to have strolled straight out of 'The Dukes of Hazzard'). And yet because of his uncharismatic, postured playing, it is impossible to sympathise with, or feel anything for him or his plight. Tristine (Tristine Ryler) is really the only sympathetic, or realistic character present \u0085 And yet, this sequel is undeserving of the critical drubbing it has received. It has some great unnerving moments: the stuttering doll-like creature Tristine sees in the hospital, the image of her drowning her dead, bloodied baby in a stagnant pond (would anyone who suffered a miscarriage during such an unnerving trip seriously then consider continuing with that trip?), the slow drifting into delirium \u0085 and the ending, where the group watch the recording they made of themselves and it contradicts their memory of events is a pretty neat way to wrap things up.The temptation could have been to produce another docu-drama, but events here are deliberately stylised in such a way, the audience is in no doubt it is watching a professional production.The locations are excellent and the whole production is very well shot, but I think 'Book of Shadows' is a (perceived) failure because while it is good, it isn't brilliant \u2013 and it needed to be brilliant to match the virtually insurmountable success of the first.\"She's a witch, maaan!\"",

Obviously the producers seemed to like some of the ideas used in the first film - like the interview footage - but its use seemed totally inappropriate.This exact group dynamic has been over used in recent horror films, but it was totally unnecessary in a film which already had such a fantastic story to work with (from the 1st film). The actors were totally unbelievable in their roles, at almost no point during the film did I view them as their characters - all I could see were obviously cast actors - was I supposed to believe that I was watching a totally free spirited young woman who is one with nature and somehow had time to completely master the wiccan art, when it's obvious she has been in make-up for three hours before the scene.\nThe addition of numerous drug/alcohol consumption scenes was a very cheap attempt to gain the film credibility with its younger audience.\nAll in all - the films desire to be a box office success completely undermined the character and raw edge of the first film.",

            "content": "With success coming from the most cost effective film in cinema history, The Blair Witch, a sequel was inevitable. And it came just a year later. Even with a signed contract with the production company for a return, the writers and directors of the original, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, seeing the path to where the project was going, decided not to return at the end. To replace them, it was called the famous documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger, just the original film is practically a documentary and have been sold as one.Berlinger, director of the famous Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (1996), Paradise Lost 2: Revelations (2000) and Brother's Keeper (1992), had good experience in the field and seemed to be a good choice to keep the same climate and characteristics of the original, but what was seen was a complete misrepresentation of the concepts and ideas that both surprised and shocked the world a year earlier.Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is the previous movie really is like a movie and fanaticism caused by the success of the film that will develop the structure of this sequence. Everything begins with a montage of news reports and TV shows, entitled to the testimony of celebrities such as Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and Kurt Loder (MTV) interspersed with residents of the fictional town of Burkittsville, where events have passed, arguing how the film has affected their lives. Are shown scenes of queues at the cinema to see the movie. Tourists have been drawn to Burkittsville, which has no more than 200 residents, because the film about the Blair Witch.Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) is one of the city's residents who decide to cash in on the instant fame of their city. He has a website that sells T-shirts, caps and sticks tied exactly like in the movie. Your product is the hottest tour of the place where they were found tapes Heather Donohue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams, the protagonists of the film. It brings together a group that part towards this morbid visit to the city. In it are the beautiful witch Erica (Erica Leerhsen), a couple who is studying and writing a paper on the \"Blair Witch\" Tristen Skyler (Tristine Skyler) and Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) and Kim Diamond (Kim Director), a goth with psychic powers. On reaching the place promised, the five wriggle in the most comfortable and start talking and drinking until erase. The next day, the equipment Jeff are destroyed, the work of Stephen and Tristen is torn and no one remembers what happened in the forest. They then decide to go to Jeff's house to try to find something for the few remaining tapes and when strange pagan symbols begin to appear in the body of the young, the situation is complicated.Blair Witch 2 was an almost unanimously negative criticism from U. S.. What seems to have bothered the critics was Berlinger deliver a film \"conventional\". Director Joe Berlinger said everyone expected something more like the first film, and he preferred to reverse expectations. However, in this case reversing expectations was the worst decision. It is acceptable to the director actually want to deliver something different, a different point of view of history, but many facts leave the film as one of the worst of 2000. Black magic was inserted gaining prominence, but the fact of fdora pagan symbols, the question is not thorough and emerges as the resolution of the questions raised.The film takes a clear idea of wanting to profit from the success of the first film in a disjointed and poorly done. First the shooting style and realism printed in the first film simply were not shown this time. The identity was being lost. The footage shot by the actors themselves with camera shake in hand and drop method actors alone in the woods. Berlinger, and leave the camera shake, bet on the soundtrack and a much more elaborate edition, seeks to take the events of the forest environment and leads to a more closed, claustrophobic.In the photograph we had a big disappointment. The night shots in the first film scary passed an impression of where the story was going. It was also left out. Now the most important is to show the teenagers playing with the legend of the witch, and sex. Speaking of casting, he is one of the worst I've ever seen, except maybe for the lovely Erica Leerhsen. The others are from a lack of naturalness, specially the Gothic Kim Director.Change the expected by all, in this case, was not a good decision. Blair Witch 2 is full of clich\u00e9s, with a horrible script, made predictable (as that Erica is back in a closet and obviously know it will backfire and cause a big scare at all). The movie really distorted what was so successful and was the first differential. Tried to innovate and show something different. Despite the criticism of the imaging industry, the film is not scary at any time and this is very serious for a horror movie, which theoretically would have to at least equal the first.",

When it turned an extremely healthy profit someone in a suit decided that a sequel would be  good business. So it was with some trepidation that I sat down in a south London cinema yesterday evening to see possibly the first public showing of this film in the UK. I should have stayed at home.The basic story is simple. The Blair Witch Project has been a massive success, and the town of Burkittsville is overrun with obsessive fans. Jeff, who has recently been released from a mental institution, has set up the Blair Witch Hunt, which offers tourists the chance to see where the movie was made. But after a night of camping, Jeff and his four customers cannot remember the events of the previous night, so they decamp to his home, an abandoned warehouse, to study the footage that was shot the day before...The premise of basing the movie on the hype of the first film is really the only sensible alley that a sequel could have taken, but writer/director Joe Berlinger manages to stuff it up at the first corner. \"I was in the hospital when it came out\", says Jeff of the first film, so we are subjected to laughable scenes of him a rubber room, complete with window and radiator, and of him having milk poured up his nose. Things don't improve. Throughout the film we are subjected to mono-dimensional characters, right from our alleged heroes to townspeople so unpleasant it makes Royston Vasey look like Hi-De-Hi. The words they speak seem to be coming off the tops of their heads, and the script as a whole is so poor I wouldn't use it to line a cat litter tray.As director of the acclaimed documentary Paradise Lost, Berlinger should at least make things look interesting. He doesn't. He fails to inspire any kind of tension, and it's worth noting that he employs a device [interspersing videoed footage with people talking about it] that Myrick and Sanchez rejected the first time round. The performances are workmanlike at best, with the five leads giving it their best shot. The worst actor here though, must be the sheriff [whose name isn't listed at the time of writing]: a gruff stereotype who adds virtually nothing to the plot.I do hope the young actors find better roles, but they can't really do any worse. A cack-handed shaggy dog story filled with plot holes [Who is Erica really? Why did the Witch possess Tristine in particular? What the hell is the Book Of Shadows??] is not the best way to start a career. But I am left wondering why Artisan are releasing the film worldwide simultaneously? It couldn't be because they want to avoid bad word of mouth, surely? At the end of the day, The Blair Witch Project was a truly unique event, and Book Of Shadows is nothing more than an ordinary horror film, and not a very good one. Don't even think about paying to see this rubbish.",

Scenes involving discussions or fights are really really lame. Actors make nervous expressions in face and attitude, but instead of really pushing the other actor, they just affectionately put their hands in other's shoulders, like they were good friends calmly sharing secrets.

The first Blair Witch film and its companion piece CURSE OF THE BLAIR WITCH proved that. To this day, some people are still asking, \"Did it really happen? Is it a reenactment of a real event?\"One character in this movie says that \"film lies but video doesn't.\" Yet we know that both can be faked -- the same point made in WAG THE DOG. For example, we buy into stereotypes of people because we see them on TV and in films. BOOK OF SHADOWS is filled with stereotypes, the most obvious being the old sheriff, complete with southern accent, nasty attitude, and threatening behavior. Is he real? No. This movie admits that all the people in the film are actors \"re-creating\" supposedly true events. And we buy in because we want to play along.This film is a bit ragged, but that too may be intentional since we are being duped and we know it. The acting is not great, but that may be simply to remind us that this is just a movie version of supposedly real happenings, just as in the awkward TV reenactments of crimes on \"reality based\" shows.I found the film to be an interesting dark comedy mixing THE EXORCIST, the recent remake of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. In typical Hitchcock fashion, we are misled all over the place. Perhaps Jeff, the mentally unstable leader of the tour who is very expert in video equipment, has faked the videos. Perhaps not. When this film comes to its abrupt end, we are left to decide for ourselves, much as we were at the abrupt end of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.",

I didn't walk out only because I was in shock at how bad it was.Bad dialogue, bad editing, bad special effects, and dear God, bad bad acting. If one can call it acting. I am personally offended at how bad this movie was.It was as though Berlinger decided that in order to make it seem like he is not ripping off BW or cashing in on its success, he had to do exactly the opposite of what made it successful. Do not leave anything to the imagination. More gore must equal more scares.I think the group involved in the creation of this film should have been fired, and the group responsible for the outstanding mockumentaries be brought in. Namely Curse of the Blair Witch, and the Burkittsville 7. The new one to go with BW2 was outstanding above the other 2 by far. Those were scary, because they seemed so real.This movie was formulaic in the classic big budget Hollywood sense, and missed the mark horribly.

This time around, we have a movie that recognizes itself as a movie knowing that its predecessor was a work of fiction. Paradise Lost director Joe Berlinger chose a creepy movie to direct and it is certainly made that way by him and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL screenwriter, Dick Beebe. The opening credit sequence was awesome as we see a load of forest and trees to the sounds of Marilyn Manson's \"Disposable Teens\". *MINOR SPOILERS* This film follows a former mental patient named Jeff Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan) who has come up with a tour to bring four other fans of the original film into the woods to invent a search for the legendary Blair Witch. The countless visions of violence and gore are enough to turn any weak stomached person away from the screen. There is enough blood, violence, gore and death to keep any horror movie buff occupied. If you want to scream...don't see this movie. That is the last thing it does. It entertains. But to some, it annoys just as badly as the first film did. Which, the first movie did not bother me. I was only bothered by how all the people moaned about it. I had to slap them too, just as how I had to do with those who felt the first movie was terrible. This film gives some good visions and ghostly images. Thanks to the IMDb goof page, I was able to find all the hidden images within the film. Thanks guys! Despite what other people say, this was an under-rated horror film that should have been an immediate smash success. Instead, it was a success just not as big a success as the first films. Many people were disappointed. And now I feel that when the third entry comes out, I will have to slap many more people in order to try and punish them into realizing that these are some of the most original movies ever made.....5/5.",

Of course the promptly consume what seems like tons and tons of drugs and booze and when they wake up in the morning they find their stuff trashed and that they have lost four hours of their nights where they have no recollection. Retreating to the warehouse where one of them lives, they start watching the videotapes to try to figure out what happened to them, and mysterious things keep happening. Basically many things happen in this film that are either real or illusion and the reality of the situation is dependent on the differences between film and video as outlined early in the movie. However that throwaway comment is easily missed and the audience is constantly on edge wondering what is happening, what is real or not real. The cast of young newcomers is quite good at setting their characters and the direction and tech work all contribute to an eerily spooky setting that will please both fans and non fans of the first installment.

Brainless, derivative, and opportunist were a few of the terms banded about or at least implied.So I watched it expecting something truly dire aka Cabin Fever and ended up actually being reasonably entertained.It presents itself as a 'fictionalised re-enactment of true events' - once again attempting to blur the line between fiction and reality, and is filmed with a higher budget and more traditionally polished production values like you'd expect from Hollywood. No shaky cam this time.The story focuses around a troupe of 5 intrepid adventurers going on a tour of the Blair Witch area to see it all for themselves. Jeff is leading them on this mission as 'the tour guide' and it's his maiden voyage after advertising the service on the web (Once again smartly tying in with the original.).After a night's camping of getting stoned, drunk and talking complete nonsense they wake up to find their gear's been trashed and it's snowing paper. None remember falling asleep and they're disturbed by what's happened.From here, things get weirder.Obviously there's a supernatural overtone in this movie, with gothic ideas and black magic prevalent. In places these are implemented reasonably well, if not enough to *scare* us they're enough to keep our attention.\nThe main strength the movie has is blurring reality - you're never sure what's real and what isn't, so although the acting isn't exactly a-list it's enough to facilitate the quirky happenings and make things puzzling.There aren't any strong twists or clever moments, but it never pretends to be a work of art.As a horror film buff, I accepted I knew what this would be, and it was never self-important, boring, or pretentious.

Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows manages to overshadow the original Blair Witch film by establishing itself as one of the worst films ever made. The real crime of this film is that somewhere a third world worker suffered over CD stamping plants to produce the god awful pile of crap. This is the kind of film that makes going to see Glitter seem worthwhile.There are spoilers below, but do you really care at this point?The film begins by informing us that the following is a reenactment of the fictional events following the Blair Witch Project film. Thinking about this screen for any length of time makes your head explode. Do not resist this urge. Save yourself from the incoming s**t. I've never enjoyed films that take time out of their busy plot to inform us how clever they are. Once you're in the theatre the eight dollars (or whatever) is gone. You're there. Stop pimping it. That's one of the reasons that seemingly endless clips about how cool the original movie was are so annoying. Chances are the small handful of people who went to see Blair Witch 2 also saw the original. If they didn't, there's no way in hell they are going to go back and watch the original now.The acting is miserable. From the over-the-top hillbilly/western/North Eastern sheriff to the collection of gen-x kids who wander into the woods in search of thrills, liquor and who knows what else, this is one of the worst casting jobs ever put to screen. Replacing the cast with marshmallow peeps would have brought more personality out. Sure, the film tosses out some gore and nudity, but after two hours of mind-numbing plot you just don't care anymore. You just want to see the credits roll so you can go on with your life. The actors in the film were given character names similar to their real-life ones, and I suppose this is supposed to be clever, but ultimately it just lands squarely in the \"who gives a f**k\" pile.As if the bad acting, sets, and storyline wasn't annoying enough, the real kick to the groin comes at the end of the film when you're informed that everything you've seen previously didn't actually happen. The characters, hopped up on drugs in the woods and in a pseudo house, thought they were having a normal evening of killing off the bad \"witch\" for the good of. well, something, but instead were all crazed psychotics who murdered innocent people. Whoopee. Nothing like sitting through a couple hours of mind-numbing garbage only to be informed that the garbage you sat through was all just a big bait and switch, and that none of it actually happened that way. I suppose if the end result would have been something meaningful it might have left the audience happy. but instead you just don't care.I'm happy to have seen Blair Witch 2 because it sets the bar for crap. No matter where I find myself, be it stuck on an eight hour flight with Battlefield Earth playing over and over again or forced to go to a Pauly Shore marathon to save a dying relative, at least I can say that I'm not having to see Blair Witch 2 again. This film will forever give us that: no matter what miserable hole you find yourself in, just remember:At least it isn't as bad as Blair Witch 2.",

The violence doesn't flinch, the acting is above average and the idea is original. Did you just want more of the first movie or something? The end of this film is truly gripping as far as horror flicks go, and the ideas it puts forth is spine tingling. This a good movie and I can't understand the bad reviews for it. I think its because of all the Blair Witch 1 backlash, that nobody really gave Book of Shadows a chance. Well I am here to help you make up your mind.

Soon after setting their camp up in the forest, they start seeing and committing sinister acts and lose their grasp on what is real and what is not.Unlike the first movie, Blair Witch 2 is not a mockumentary, although it utilizes shaky video camera footage a lot. Actually, it's not even a direct sequel as it acknowledges the fictitiousness of the original film right from the beginning while relying on the same mythology. In any case, it's not a very good film. The charm of the first Blair Witch was to NOT show the scary things, and a similar approach would have been better for the sequel too. Now we only get a rather run-off-the-mill horror movie with very unconvincing acting and little sense of building paranoia. The scares are sparse and the non-chronologically advancing plot line frequently robs the story of its tension.

The idea, and this will be a spoiler so watch out, that individuals can be so taken in by the obsession surrounding an event that they find their own evil. The characters here are silly in the worst way, and in some ways are similar to the original in that they are thoroughly dislikable and stereotypically Gen X, a bigger snooze than any in the last few years: A Goth, a Wiccan, a couple of grungers etc. Awful. But when they go slowly insane trying to reconstruct several lost hours of their lives--and are faced with the reality of events--well, there's something there. Something that, given a decent script, and all the rest, has much to commend it. Don't see this movie--it's garbage. But if you do, I'd suggest trying to ask about the culmination some questions; dig a little deeper past the garbage, there are some nuggets worth finding.",

The appeal of the first film was that it concentrated on that aspect of horror which many horror movie today seemed to have forgotten with the use of CGI special effects. The plot was honest and believable.  The film used the in your face interview of the local's take on the legend of the Blair Witch to convey that mystery which embody the whole Blair Witch quality.Well, in the sequel, the same effects are employed, but it is a complete disaster!  The first interview of the local made me felt that he was putting me on.  Once that tone was set it carry out toward the whole movie.  The movie is saying, \" Don't take it too seriously and let us just rehash some of the old stuff and throw in some new stuff that make us look amateurish.\" In the end, BW2 did not do justice to the first because it is a complete sellout.  You will also know why some films should not see the day of light. This film is definitely too rough to sit in your stomach and will make you puke after the first half hour leaving you with a wanting for some good old fashion Freddie Kreuger one-liners. Yeech!",

            "content": "By Greg UrsicRoger Ebert once compiled a list of a thousand things not to do in a horror movie: don't split up to search for the killer/monster, never go in the basement, etc,.  I don't remember if it's listed, but one of the criteria should be - don't return to the scene of the crime - any camper at Crystal Lake or insomniac living on Elm Street can tell you that.  Someone should have told the witch hunters headed for Burkittsville.The \"sequel\" opens with snippets of news stories documenting the effect the first movie had on the people of Burkittsville and highlights the fact that it was pure fiction.  Our intrepid travelers - consisting of a Wiccan, a Goth chick, two researchers, and a their recently released mental patient guide- are determined to find out for themselves whether or not there is anything to the legend of the Blair Witch. After a night of binge drinking and drugs, they awake to discover that, small surprise, five hours of their life is missing, but not in the normal god-I'll-never-drink-again-hangover way, but the there's-something-spooky- X-files kind of way.  The question on everyone's mind is what happened.\"The Blair Witch Project\" either scared you stupid or bored you silly, but there's no disputing its success - costing only $30,000, it brought in $200 million plus at the box office.  The marketing for the film was brilliant - extensive prerelease coverage, Internet hype (the website's \"Missing\" posters, video clips, and legend of the witch drew hundreds of thousands of hits), and its jerky video style, was the ultimate manipulation of the reality tv concept.  The combination worked so well that many people were convinced that the events onscreen actually transpired.  Much to its detriment, \"Book of Shadows\" dissociates itself from the very conventions that made the original fresh.I'm suspicious of any horror movie that peppers its press release with phrases like \"amorphous villains\", \" general conflation\" and \"devolving psychological state\". \"Shadows\" demonstrates a classic maxim - a big budget does not necessarily mean a better film.  Although this movie boasts a heavy hitting soundtrack, and is helmed by a talented director (ironically renowned for his skill as a documentary filmmaking) it falls prey to the curse of the sequel.   And how.Plagued by stilted dialogue, a disjointed plot that jumps around needlessly, characters that are pale representations of people and horribly amateurish special effects (the animatronic owl would not have fooled a child) there is little to recommend this movie.  More frustrating is the violence - intended to be shocking, the sequences are poorly filmed and the blood so obviously fake, that the scenes lose any impact they might have had.   The ultimate death knell for  \"Shadows\" however is that it is guilty of being a horror film that isn't frightening.The only terror you will experience watching this film, is the time you've lost, and sadly you will know exactly what happened.",

The originality and creativity that bled into the original from the created legend is some how let loose upon a new concept in this mind bending sequel. The mass hysteria created from the first film invades the real town of Burkitsville. A group of info seekers join a Blair witch tour hosted by an ex mental patient who sells blair witch 'everything' on line.  You see they party hearty and wake up the next morning to a destroyed camp and a group of victims from another camp.  Puzzled by the phenomena, bad events happen one after another as the atmosphere builds to an open conclusion. One in which the director asks you the audience to come up with your own answers. To bad most people just couldn't figure it out. They need everything delivered to them straight forward with no brain work at all. Read between the lines people and discover what the film maker and his art trying to say messages about suggestion, the reality of video, the influence of hollywood, public reaction, prejudice, group hysteria and etc. Finally someone asked The mainstream audience if they could handle figuring something out.

            "content": "I saw this film when it first came out. I was in college in 1999 only 20 miles away from Burkesville MD and so I understand as well as anyone the huge sensation 'The Blair Witch Project' caused. Every weekend about 25% of my college would roam around the Burkesville woods getting drunk and high.Hence, this film really hits home for me. Just as the viewer is forced to be around hung over kids whom spent the night drinking and smoking in the woods, so was a whole year of my college life! This is the classic example of a rushed sequel punched out to cash in the original's popularity before the fad wears off ('Sister Act 2' 'Sherk 2' 'Shanghai Knights') without any regard for quality. The studio never cares about quality because the sequel factor alone will guarantee box office success.The major factor here is that ALL FIVE of the characters are just named after the actors playing them! That's how fast this script was punched out! It was literally written ON THE SET! I'll never forget the trailer for this. Usually trailers highlight the major action and money shots of the film. This trailer actually showed a girl dancing on bed. Yup, that's the best shot they could show us to drag us into the theaters! A girl dancing on a bed! This is supposed to be a scary movie right?Anyway, five stoners camp out in the Burkesville woods just like 'The Blair Witch Project.' Scary? I'm always amused at how even respected film critics like Roger Ebert religiously recited 'The Blair Witch Project's promo, \"the Black Hills of Maryland\" as if somehow it's scary. Burkesville is the suburbs. The suburbs! No one can get lost in someone's backyard! And any \"campers\" would be arrested for trespassing. It's the suburbs! After a hard night of drinking and drugs the five kids awaken to find their book in progress destroyed by an industrial shredder. They all act surprised at having blacked out as if something scary has happened. Nothing scary has happened! They just passed out drunk! Next, the pregnant girl has a miscarriage. Drinking and drugging will cause that as well. The nurse at the hospital says, \"Your body is telling you something's not right.\" as if it is scary. No, it's just the drinking and drugs! So the five kids go to what's described as an abandoned Civil War factory. WOW! Plumbing, electricity, paint and glass that's held up for 150 years! No wonder the North won the war, they were really advanced. WWII factor we might buy. But Civil War factory? Anyway, the kids watch the tapes of themselves from the night before but find nothing until they're played backwards. OF course you can't really do that because video doesn't work the same as film but whatever. The backwards footage reveals an orgy of drinking and drugs. We already knew about this!!! The kids then go into a trance and wander off to murder an neighboring group of campers. They're so out of their minds that they remember to bring a camcorder with them to capture it for posterity.Next the kids are interrogated by the police in scenes which fail to work as either drama or comedy as ALL the cops are overly acting redneck stereotypes. Again, Burkesville isn't the Deep South. It's the suburbs! Why are ALL the cops inbred rednecks? If the movie isn't going to take these scenes seriously neither is the audience.All in all it is fun for some laughs and not horribly made. It does go down as a classic example of a punched out and rushed cash in sequel.Only one mystery remains. What's the \"Book of Shadows?\" There are no books or shadows in this film or even mention of them! Again, this leads me to conclude there were multiple studio scripts and rewrites and the film was just slapped together without regard.",

The first BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was successful for me because it managed to be unsettling in a very \"simple\" and \"creative\" manner. I seldom bother seeing new horror films anymore, but I broke my rule one more time for this atrocious piece of garbage...As with practically ALL new horror movies, the first few minutes make you think that the filmmakers are going to try something special, but then your expected disappointments come crashing in FAST. Next comes the unnecessary heavy metal (or rap) music, and then a young and aggravating cast of hateful teens are introduced and are so despicable that you pray they'll get killed.Love the intelligence of our 21st century teens in this script; their dialogue is sprinkled with the usually carefree helpings of \"s..t,\" \"f..k,\" \"d..k\", etc...etc... And they speak in those annoying lingos: \"yeah, like, I mean...dude...like...\" Heaven Help Us.Once again we've got our MTV camerawork spinning and flashing, zooming in and out. God knows we've got no story, so I guess something has to stimulate an audience. What the hell is supposed to be happening in this movie? I can't tolerate an endless barrage of illusions and images that fail to add anything except to make me more confused. This film makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL.When it was over, it was forgotten...just like a bad meal. In years to come, NOBODY will remember it (like 99% of all modern horror bombs).Which brings me to a comparison regarding the re-release of THE EXORCIST. Now there's a classic made about 30 years ago with strong characters with personality and problems. There were shock sequences, to be sure, but they all had a purpose. I am astonished at how many \"lost\" young people today cannot see the greatness of EXORCIST, yet I'm sure those same 21st century kids will enjoy the \"cool rock soundtrack\" for BLAIR WITCH 2 (and think that it constitutes a great horror film). Oh, well...what can we expect today when a film from 2000 has the \"normal\" kids swearing and raving more than the possessed little girl of THE EXORCIST ever did???

But at the end, you're going to have to clean the carpet, he has to sleep outside, and nobody won here.One half of this film is motivated by greed, the other half is motivated by wrath. You put the two together and it's like mixing nerve gas, everyone in the room dies horribly.The director apparently blames the studio in some regard for the movie's poor reception due to the heavy editing they did. But honestly? Even just from watching the footage that actually made it into the film, it's easy to see there wasn't much to salvage.It's rare to see a film that's cheap cash grab AND insanely pretentious, but Book of Shadows pulls it off. It's one of my top ten worst movies of all time.And no, \"Book of Shadows\" doesn't mean anything.",

The new premise promises to scare people away by telling a new story in wich the dark forces of the woods really exist and attack a group of blair witch fans, was this idea too desperate or what,i mean,did they really think people were gonna go and get scared at this movie,It\u00b4s sad to see a good premise go down so fast but hey \u00a1That\u00b4s Showbusiness! This film sadly doesn\u00b4t build up any suspense or tension enough to keep people awake,I liked it but i am a big fan of the genere and a true Blair Witch fan from the first movie so i have to appreciate a sequel,not as the original but at least like it and show some compassion for the effort they made on making it,even if they sucked at it on making it. I\u00b4ll give it a sad 7 out of 10 on horror in the woods movie.",

The movie comes off as more of a suspense film in which you could be intrigued by the plot rather than scared.  The movie definately wasnt horrible in my opinion, but thats my opinion and i bet 9 out of 10 people will probably beg to differ.  Mostly in part because the whole movie was COMPLETELY CONFUSING!!  I might of been the only person in the entire theater that had an idea about what was happening (because certainly my date had no clue!).  The constant flashbacks and forshadowing of events can certainly boggle ones mind.  But...  it was somewhat inventive, at least it wasnt exactly the same as the first movie!  For the fan of Blair Witch you should probably check it out, but if you didnt care for the first movie, or are looking for something scary, stay clear from this one and dont waste your time!  Just my opinion and of course i could be wrong. :)",

            "content": "If 'The Blair Witch Project' redefined everything we knew about horror, then 'Blair Witch Two' clarified everything we know about sequels. Mainly, they're a bit s**t. Or, in the case of 'Book of Shadows' they're all s**t. Other reviewers have said it, but I think it's worth repeating. 'Book of Shadows' is the MTV version of 'The Blair Witch Project' They took all the qualities of the original and injected it with retarded ness. What resulted is a film so caked in `The 90s' that it stops being a horror film and ends up being a derelict. There is absolutely nothing to fear from this movie. The atmosphere is foreboding horror is totally absent. Instead, we are treated to CGI! Wow, a CGI ghost. Can you think of anything less effective? In some ways it's like comparing the two 'Haunting's. One, with an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife despite the fact you NEVER SEE anything, and the other so overdone with OTT CGI it ceases to be anything more than laughable. In fact, they're similar in a lot of ways. Didn't the 90s Haunting have the giant purple ink stain in it? Or was that 'The House on Haunted Hill'? Either way, my point still stands. 'Book of Shadows' has a bunch of stereotypical teenagers go out in to the Blair woods. They all fall asleep, or something, and when they awake they have no idea what's happened. Of course, as logic dictates, they've had an orgy in the middle of the forest and this revelation is only discovered when they play their video tapes backwards. What the hell? That about sums up my review. Basically they took the premise of the original and realized that to squeeze more juice out of it they needed a sequel. But sadly it seems they listened to all those idiots who moaned about `there wuz no ghost u dindt see nething it sux0r lololol' and all that kind of nonsense and what resulted is this. Three out of ten. If you want to see a scary film, watch 'The Blair Witch Project' If you want a comedy, watch 'Airplane' If you want the equivalent of a coca-cola enema, watch 'Book of Shadows'",

As far as the plot is concerned, it's kind of... weird. On the one hand, it had its good moments, but unlike the last episode, where I was like \"WOW, that was something\" after the ending.

The plot is too simple and the execution and pacing is sloppy. My favorite character may have well been Kim, the goth chick.

It doesn't want to face the evil it created and just winds up going around it. SPOILER ALERT The film is just so predictable, and at times, too obvious. For example: the bridge that's the \"only\" way in or out. We all know, without having to see the trailer, that the bridge will collapse. And the dog alarm, the real dogs show up. The guy goes to get a gun, and presto, the dogs are gone. I knew they would be. This film breaks no new ground, and is not at all scary. Stick with the first.",

The artificial lighting editing and acting contrasts vividly with the original. Movies have suffered in the past from \"theatrical\" acting, but movies appear to be evolving in such a way that heavily artificial movies like this suffer from being \"movieistic\". And that coyness of the \"nude wicca\" still wearing her panties and with her hair obviously glued to her breasts to hide her nipples! This was clearly for a quite different market than Blair Witch, perhaps for people who enjoyed Scream 3. There is naturally a certain cynicism involved in making sequels to \"horror movies\" but there was something almost immoral in this exploitation of the original movie and of a potential audience. Perhaps the makers were sincere and it's easy to lose one's way in the woods. But I have rarely seen a movie so deserving of the oblivion that it is surely nose-diving into. Every movie has its audience though, and perhaps one will turn up. For myself, I think it will be a healthy thing all round if it loses a lot, a lot of money. I liked the final credits though and the soundtrack is great, one is less likely to be disappointed by the film CD.....",

It went on WAY too long and had only a few scares that consisted mostly of breaking windows. \nWe still didn't get a good look at the witch and we didn't even get a good look at the murders that took place during the film.  All we get is a bunch of artsy footage that leaves us confused at best...and knowing in advance how the movie was going to end.  In fact, the end was ruined by the sheer fact that we already knew what was going to happen.The only character that made this movie even remotely worthwhile was Kim.

Halloween gave us Halloween II.  A Nightmare on Elm Street gave us Freddy's Revenge.  These aren't sequels, they are desecrations.For me, the Blair Witch Project worked.  I saw it after the hype was firmly established and while it was what I expected it somehow still managed to get under my skin and stay there for a long time.  This film, with it's bloated, unnecessary contemporary soundtrack and by the numbers direction was exactly what I didn't expect and I left the theater feeling cheated.  The film starts off promising, managing to poke a little fun at itself without being too self aware.  There's a couple references to the original films critics via characters who are walking around the woods claiming they \"just want to see something.\"  After the promising first few moments, the film seems to slowly fall apart.  I think some of the individual parts of the film work very well, but the film as a whole seems less than the sum of it's parts.\nWhat exactly is the film trying to express?  It is an indictment on modern day \"witch hunts\" in which people who embrace alternative religions and/or dress in black are really good people that society prejudges as evil?  Does the sheriff in the film serve as conservative ideology against the younger generation who engage in behavior he just can't understand and therefore labels it as wrong or even immoral?  Given the directors documentary history, it seems natural that the film would use the idea of a witch hunt to show that things haven't changed much since the Salem witch trials of 1692.  The Wiccan character even says that the first film sent back the cause of witchcraft (as a religion) 300 years.  By the end of the film I was just confused.  I'm not sure that the film didn't show witch hunters as sympathetic, thereby giving the prejudice an excuse.Remember the first Nightmare on Elm Street?  It was very effective in 1984, the time of it's original release.  By 1991 we were given Freddy's Dead-The Final Nightmare.  Supposedly they took the little independent low budget film and supplied it with a budget and true Hollywood talent and each installment came was no where near as effective as the first.  It seems the lesson was not learned and we will be forced to see sequels of this merit.\nIt's not just the fact that sequels are generally inferior that is my point here.  Two guys with some equipment purchased at electronics store make an original horror film-no matter how you felt about The Blair Witch Project it was different and they took a chance.  Now Hollywood has it's hands on the franchise and have rendered it unrecognizable.  I will go see the third Blair Witch project where the producers will undoubtedly try to correct what went wrong here, but I fear, while already low, my expectations will most likely be confirmed.",

For two prime examples of both phenomena, (see also: Star Wars Episode 1) we have 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'. Neither is 'Citizen Kane', but they both certainly have something to recommend them. 'The Blair Witch Project' can never be recreated. It was a one-time marvel, wildly innovative in its way, and the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life to boot. 'TBWP' is all about what you can't see, but are afraid is there. This annoyed some people something fierce, as they certainly couldn't be expected to exercise a little imagination, now could they? Others, like me, saw it as the 90s' single blow for true psychological terror. Furthermore, it has believable characters. Heather, Mike and Josh talk like every college kid I've ever known, including me. And *you never know*. Was there really a Blair Witch? Did those three ill-fated campers actually even die? Who the hell put Heather's footage at the foundation, anyway? I remember sitting in the theater watching the last 5-10 minutes of 'TBWP' and feeling like my fiercely pounding heart was pumping icicles through my bloodstream. I flinch at a jump scene like everyone else and grimace at gore, but sitting in a theater, surrounded by friends, I felt for the first and last time *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger. Of course, shortly thereafter, the media couldn't stop yapping about a movie that had been talked about for months in the independent film industry. It's ultra-creepy web site was getting a gazillion hits a day, and 'TBWP' was an Event, voted 'Movie of the Summer'- over Star Wars, no less- by several publications. The point of all this rambling about 'TBWP' in a review ostensibly for its sort-of sequel is necessary, as the one aspect of this second film *is* the reaction to the first- and it is also necessary to look at the aftermath of the original movie to understand reactions to this one. At the end you still 'don't know' what happened.  'BW2' is not as scary, funny, believable or innovative as the original. It's got nudity, sex and tons of blood, none of which the original stooped to- although the blood-letting flashbacks were put in at the studio's insistence. The performances- though not groan-worthy- are not as good, some of the characters not as interesting. Erica and Kim- who bears a middling resemblance to Rose McGowan- are both gorgeous, and they are at least fairly interesting. Jeff comes off as useless, but you can understand his position, and the 'normal couple' is simply boring. 4 of these actors- all except Erica- have worked before, although for one- Stephen- this was a first movie role. All are relative unknowns, but most of them have parts in upcoming flicks, and any talk of their careers ending here is just malicious b.s. on the part of the anti-bandwagoneers. Any assertion that the box-office failure of 'BW2' shows that most people hated the first after being 'tricked' by the hype into seeing it is strictly inaccurate- I didn't see it in the theaters, not because I hated the first but because I didn't have time and I was sick of the *hype* itself. There is a subtle but important difference. What we have here is a movie that tries to be independent of the first- it's relative lack of artistic and structural ties to that movie being one of its best assets, as it avoids most sequel cliches- and it's a decent effort on it's own merit. The problem is that it can't be seen as an independent movie with its own merit in the eyes of the general movie-going public. If it didn't have 'Blair Witch 2' as part of it's title, half the people who have posted reviews here wouldn't have done so, and those reviews that remained would not have been so adamant. This is not a movie worth getting *that* worked up about. It is, however, worth a rental.",

At only nine minutes in, you already know just what kind of one dimensional cliche characters you are in for and the general mind numbing soundtrack that accompanies the truly worst dialog and acting that your gag reflex starts to kick in. You've seen this type of film many, many times.One review I read claims that viewers that do not like it, just don't \"get it\". Well, let me tell you, this is definitely the type of movie that no one needs to \"get\".

After mental patient Jeff Paterson (Jeffrey Donovan) is released from the hospital, he moves back to Maryland where he begins a tour guide called the Blair Witch Hunt. His first tour is a group of misfits including Stephen Turner and his girlfriend Tristin, Erika Geheersen who is a witch, and Kim Director who is a gothic punk with a pathetic life. They begin their tour by going up to the Black Forest where the film students dissapeared. It starts out like a fun time. They get drunk, have sex, and basically party their heads off. By morning, they don't remember a thing that they did the night before. So, they head over tho Jeff's house which is an abandoned factory. They decide to look at the footage that they shot and see if they can develop any clues whats so ever. Accusations fly by, eriee clues come, and they put the pieces together on the tape and discover the unexpected of their evening.

Blair Witch 2 is not nearly as good as the original which was incredibally creative, however, it is far from terrible. It is creative in its own way which means it does have some really cool elements. ofcoarse, along with those, there are plenty of stupid moments like quick halucinations that are a waste of time, or even worse, when they cut to images of bodies getting cut up. This stuff is not scary, but stupid. However, the movie does get interesting as these five or six characters can't remember what they did and try to figure it out. I often felt like if they took ideas just a little further they could have been really cool and scary, but they didn't. I don't think these guys really knew how to make a horror movie, which is exactly the opposite of the way I feel about the team that made the first one. Don't get me wrong, Blair Witch 2 is not a waste. It does have cool ideas, but it just isn't as great as I would have liked it to be. The ending is really interesting and it is a decent movie.

However, the results are mixed.  The first half-hour is near-brilliant in its documenting of the effect of the release of the first film on the weary citizens of Burkitsville, who are sick of the tourists who've flocked in to see \"the home of the Blair witch\".  There are great scenes of tour groups flocking through the sparse forests in such abundance that they run into each other.Once the plot, such as it is, settles in, any sense of purpose inherent in the setup goes south in a hurry.  The characters are depressingly undeveloped, acting more as mouthpieces for their various points-of-view than as believable people.  An hour of hearing the Wiccan moan about the general perception of witches made me long for her inevitable demise.The main problem here is the story.  Hitting you with a constant barrage of \"did that happen or didn't it?\", the narrative retroactively cancels events and then reinstates them with such rapidity that you eventually come to the conclusion that none of it really matters, and disengage from the movie. It's like a season of the X-Files condensed into two hours.  The ending is intended to be an ambiguous lady-or-the-tiger style question, but since neither possibility has really been adequately explained, you're unlikely to care.  There are some good creepy moments here, but in the end, they're buried under a story that's impossible to care about.",

            "content": "Alright, to start with, I'll go on record as saying I enjoyed the original movie. That's important for a moment's time.I think the best way of describing this movie is that the producers took Blair Witch, and remade the movie to appeal to the MTV generation.What do I mean by that? Well, the first movie had a very deliberate style of horror. It was rooted in the grainy realism of the whole thing, which felt so realistic because of how the movie was produced (most of the time, the actors weren't acting, they genuinely WERE so scared). The horror was not about what you could see, but what you COULDN'T see.Of course, in today's fast-food quick-fix world, subtlety like that just doesn't sell. The original movie The Haunting was a genuine classic, a horror movie based entirely around sound. The remake was a CG special FX-laden snorefest without the slightest scare. This movie is much the same thing. It seems that people today don't want horror, they want to see a big ugly computer-rendered monster on screen ripping people apart. The first movie had none of that, so when it had been hyped up, everyone went to see the movie expecting this. When they got a subtle and genuinely creepy movie instead, they complained, it wasn't blatant and dumbed-down enough for them. I know I sound like some artfag movie critic who wants to sound like he's above everyone else, I'm not, I'm just a semi-intelligent guy who loves horror movies. I love a dumb horror movie if it's just plain fun instead. Sadly, this one isn't, it's just dumb.So that, and the huge profits the first movie made, seem to be the reason this movie exists. Atmosphere is stripped away, and replaced with a bodycount. Surely the kids would lap it up, the people who hated the first one for not having blatant visuals and scares would love this one, it's much more in line with movies like Scream, which is today's youth's idea of horror? Correct. It's almost universal that everyone who liked this movie hated the first one too. The people who liked both tend to be people who just enjoyed the mythos and setting. I'm almost one of those people.The plot's been outlined many times, so let's get down to business. The characters are a horrible bunch. Stereotypical goth girl who hangs out in a graveyard, is constantly bitchy and depressed with snappy comebacks, and thinks she's psychic. Token Wiccan girl, because thanks to Buffy, they're trendy these days. She's another walking stereotype. Barely 5 minutes go by without her pointing out how witches aren't all evil and they're unfairly persecuted. Her wiccanism is really forced down the viewer's throat. Then there's the wizecracking, goofy crazy streetwise guy who's all about beer and pot. The cast so far seems specifically DESIGNED for the MTV generation. Then throw in a couple of slightly older folks, who feel rather out of place in the movie. I'm not sure why they were put in, their relationship works great in the plotline, but their characters just don't sit with the rest of the whole movie.The method of storytelling wants to be edgy. Tell it with flashbacks and chronological jumps, fill us in on backstory as we go. Whatever. This is a horror movie, it's impossible to build suspense for what's about to happen by telling us how someone's life was two years earlier, or letting us know that they survive to the end of the movie. It's mildly confusing for most of the film, and does far more harm than interest. Should really have stuck with a more conventional style.And the nature of the horror itself? It's largely a matter of personal preference, but most people with an IQ above 70 and an age larger than their shoe size just isn't scared by \"OMG A DEAD BODY!!!\". CG special effects and really blatant, laboured horror are the order of the day here. No doubt groups of fratboys or alternative metallers hanging around with popcorn and soda will be cheering on every death and consider this a cinematic masterpiece. With a rock/nu-metal soundtrack, it seems to be the kind of demographic this is marketed at anyway. People who prefer slightly more intelligence from their movies will be left rolling their eyes at the \"suspenseful buildup\" that you can see coming a mile off every time.\nI sound like I'm really giving this movie a panning, and hate it. In some respects, I don't mean to. In others, I do. I love horror movies. Some of them take themselves seriously and succeed. Others don't take themselves seriously in the slightest, and they're just fun. This movie wants to take itself very seriously, and falls so flat on it's face that it's not funny. It constantly references the first movie, but if it'd instead referenced itself a couple of times, to let the viewer know they should be having fun instead of trying to be scared, it would have worked a great deal better. Another bad idea, this movie wants to be a scary horror, when it would have been so much more fitting as a silly horror. The characters, effects, scares and even subject matter all seem absolutely perfect for some kind of self-referential parody. But nope.I guess that's the core of why I didn't enjoy the movie. It tried too hard, and tried to reinvent a great horror movie into a dumbed-down but still entirely serious revision.I'm a fair person though. The characters may have been hopelessly cliche'd, but the actors did a great job. They played what they were given very convincingly. The visuals of the movie were great, the forest and the area most of the movie takes place around (I really wish they'd used lower-quality, TV-style cameras for the mock documentaries at the start though, another example of it taking itself too seriously). The soundtrack was out of place for a horror movie, but it's still good music in it's own right. And finally, the Blair Witch setting kicks ass. I've seen the movies and played the games, and it's a great setting with an incredible backstory that's weaved together through all these different mediums. This movie doesn't let down on that front. Shame it does on all the rest.Overall verdict, if you're willing to turn your brain off for a couple of hours to be only mildly impressed, or if you've got a short attention span and hated the first movie, go rent. Otherwise, give it a miss.",

            "content": "Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2 is based on the events which occurred after the release of the first film, and stars a group of five persons who are all equally obsessed with the Blair Witch legend. They all joined an inaugural \"Blair Witch Hunt\" on the Internet, which was started by Jeff(Donavan)who travels with the other four into the Black Hills of Maryland where the first movie was filmed. From the start we are shown that Jeff is, or was, highly unstable via a scene in a mental institution. The other four seem somewhat normal...we have the logical couple, pregnant Tristen and her boyfriend Steven(Skyler and Turner), who have written an argumentative novel on the Blair Witch legend..then there is the beautiful red-head Erica(Leerhsen), who claims to be an Apiscipal minister's daughter and also a Wiccan..and then my favorite of them all, Kim(Director, not literally), who plays a sexy goth chick who has premonitions and psychic powers. Quite an eclectic group, I might say.Once the first night falls they all hit the brewskies and pot pipes(yes, even the pregnant girl)but are rudely interrupted when another tour group comes and wants to take the foundation camp. After an exchange of profanities, Jeff and the rest of the gang pretend to be all freaked out and ultimately convince the other group to check out Coffin Rock. Hmm..interesting. Anyways, after this scene, Jeff's group presumes to drink themselves into a blackout. They wake up the following day to find all of their research ripped to shreds and all of their cameras broken into pieces. They ultimately blame the other tour group for this since they would not give up the foundation camp to them. See, this is where the movie gets tricky, because they have no recollection of what they did during their drunken stupors...or do they? And if they do remember then why do they blame the other tour group, which, by the way, was brutally murdered at Coffin Rock late in the previous evening. What is going on here? Certainly our main characters aren't responsible...I referred to this film as manipulative because a lot of what it shows the audience is not what actually happened...or is it? It is suggested that maybe other forces were at work here. An example is the scene where Kim gets into a confrontation with the store clerk. We clearly see for ourselves that Kim only threatens the clerk and does not kill her...but at the end of the film the police show Kim the security video that they confiscated from the store and it shows her stabbing the clerk with a nail filer. And the scene where Steven accidentally pushes Tristen to her death is also shown at the end of the film as a deliberate act of violence because Steven was mad that she had a miscarriage. I really don't know...this is kind of a mess. Did the Blair Witch manipulate the footage? Or did they really commit these crimes? One will never know because the film never provides a direct explanation. Oh well. It's a very intriguing idea, to say the least, but I use the word 'intriguing' most lightly. It's an okay sequel, but only if you enjoyed the first film. If not, skip this one altogether. I would also recommend skipping it if you don't like to be played with, because this movie will play a lot of tricks on you and this is part of the reason why I rated it so low...it was deceptive. 3/10...it's still worth a look if you are a fan of horror films. Don't expect it to be like the original, though.",

            "content": "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, the sequel to The Blair Witch, takes us back to Burkitsville, Maryland where Jeffrey Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan) has started a blair witch hunt tour to make some cash off the events that happened in the original Blair Witch movie. A group of students decide to take the tour each with their own agenda. Tristine (Tristine Skyler) and Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) are writing a book on the blair witch, Erica (Erica Leerhsen) a wicca who hopes to find and learn from the blair witch and Kim (Kim Director) who plays the roll of a goth. They all head into the woods on the tour but wake up the next morning to find their camp in disarray and unable to remember anything that happened the night before. All they have are the tapes from their camcorders. As they try to find out what happened that night, strange things continue to occur and they are unaware of who or what is behind them.Joe Berlinger tries his hand at directing this sub-par story but didn't come out on top. I felt detached and only wanting to see the tapes to know what happened, nothing else that happened in the movie really mattered. The story was pretty unoriginal, missing a lot of characterization and actual entertaining scenes. The actors didn't really do anything to change the downward slide and couldn't draw me in.Joe Berlinger didn't follow the same camera techniques as the original blair witch and it probably saved this film, somewhat. If he would have gone with the first person view I believe the movie would have flopped even more based on how well the original was done.There are some quick gore scenes throughout the film to satisfy an itch and the plot never made me use my imagination so we are lacking quite a bit of what makes a horror movie, a horror movie.All in all I couldn't shake the undying need to know what happened on those tapes. After I found out the action finally started to pick up but a little too late. If interested give this a peek but don't go out of your way.",

            "content": "\"We're walkin' around in circles, Heather!\" \"No. We're not!\"But, in the end, she has a nervous breakdown and admits, sobbingly, that they WERE walking in circles. But what else could she have done? Face the sad fact that there was definitely something out there? Stop living in denial? Wake up and smell the coffee?In October 1999, Marc heard about a low budget horrorflick that was taking American audiences by storm. A few weeks later, Marc saw the scene in which Heather Donahue videotapes her own testament and found himself scared witless.First, despite the simple Grimm Brothers-like story-line, people still manage to not get The Blair Witch Project at all. \"The dialogue is pretty bad\", one complains. Another person accuses the filmmakers of bad filmmaking: \"I couldn't see were the second act ended and the third act began\". \"It had its boring moments\", yet another guy wrote. And Joe Berlinger, director of the inevitable sequel said that the mockumentary-style doesn't require a 'shakycam' technique, adding that \"Mockumentary certainly isn't about convincing people that what they are seeing is fact\".Boy o Boy! (2 X)Talk about missing the point! This isn't 'unconventional filmmaking'. This isn't a mockumentary that directors tried to surpass as being fact. Its companion piece, \"The Curse Of The Blair Witch\", THAT'S a mockumentary. Our three disappeared characters never came around to shoot and edit a documentary. After the couple of interviews they did in town (steadily shot), they just tried to capture on video what the f**k was going on in the woods, holding the cameras with trembling hands. BWP shouldn't even be considered as a movie. \"A Year Later Their Footage Was Found\". This line is right there on the screen, at the beginning of it. Raw footage. And what follows is just that: a bunch of dark, suggestive, incoherent images and sounds with only one purpose: scare you. Scare you good. Everything else goes. BW has no redeeming quality; if it didn't scare you, you can only appreciate the fact that five people beat Hollywood with a camcorder, and pity the fact that it was hyped to such an extent that people turns against it because it was too popular to be considered underground. By the way, I do think it's rather amusing that much negative reviewers aren't saying something like \"I didn't like BW\" but \"I wasn't scared -I really wasn't!- by BW\".And, OF COURSE BWP has its boring moments. That's all part of its pseudo-authentic nature. When was the last time you couldn't take your eyes off the screen when a friend or relative showed you his or hers incoherent videotaped holiday or backyard activities? When was the last time you remarked to such a person that their video had such a nice structure and great dialogue? Anyone who dismisses BWP because it is sometimes boring and lacks movie-dialogue and a good structure is clearly missing the point. Again, folks, check your conventional movie-expectations at the door.I think it was Stephen King who considered the sound behind the door-routine as the archetypal horror-situation. So, imagine, if you will, a walk through the first floor corridor of a haunted house...wait, let's make that a haunted castle. It's night. It's dark. You're alone. You hear a sound, right over there, right behind that door down the end of the hall. A loud, creaking sound. The best thing to do? Run! Run in the opposite direction. But something in us can't resist. We humans are rather curious creatures, aren't we? (and stubborn: I'm gonna prove there ain't nothin' there). So we stand motionless for a couple of secs. Then, ever so slowly, we start heading for that door. No matter what can be found behind that door, it'll be relieve of tension as nothing, nothing can be more nerve-wracking than the walk itself. Tension mounts. What can be scarier than not seeing the whole picture? For people with a sense of imagination, our mind, our fantasy becomes our greatest enemy. So, when we finally get our hand around the doorknob, we have become jelly-legged. We pull, or push, open the door and out comes a monster/killer/ghost and things fall in place. Labeled. Branded. A manifestation upon which we can focus our fear.In BWP, that long walk through the corridor isn't accompanied by comic relief, a cool soundtrack, or the fun of watching a every-hair-perfect-in-place Neve Campbell or Jennifer Love Hewitt screaming at the top of her longs while the camera  focuses on her breasts doing a little exercise in her just-a-tad-too-tight tank top. What we DO get is a tired girl, coming down with a bad case of the flu, whispering directly at us, in a grainy video-image, that she is 'so scared' and 'so sorry'. And we never get to see what it was that scared her so. Nor does it matter. The fear itself is enough. Is more. In BWP, we never get around to open that door in that haunted castle. We never get around to face, label, brand, or categorize what scared us. No relief. Just the fear. And the horrible authenticity of it.BWP was and is a once in a lifetime experience. And I have to admit, I was naive enough to NOT expect a sequel. Come on, a sequel would be the dumbest thing, right? What do you want to do, have another bunch of unsuspecting students go into the woods, armed with semi-professional camera gear? Not exactly, but a sequel was inevitable enough, though.One guy on the internet compared it to the Scream-phenonemon.They greenlight the sequel any day. Story not quite done? Final cut must be ready within three months from the first shooting day? No problemo, patron. The sequel doesn't need to be a good film. There will be so many people just dying to see this thing. Ever heard of those two magical words: Opening Weekend, man! The first two days before the effect of the word of mouth (\"It sucks!\") kicks in, we already made a profit. But, stubbornly, we still go for that part three, by the time of which nobody's interested in that witch anymore.The story of Book Of Shadows (BOS) wasn't a story that wanted to be told, but had to be told, to give the originally fairly small Artisan Pictures the chance to even more cash in on their sleeper hit. And fast. Several drafts were written and Artisan quickly rushed into production with this one. It took them merely a year after BWP's release to cough up BOS. The opening is fair enough, which shows the effect BWP had on the area where it was filmed. A frustrated sheriff who clearly had enough of it all, runs around screaming at the umpteenth bunch of teenagers to get their butts out of the woods and back in their cars so they can be on their way home.Artisan was wise enough to make this neither a Kevin Williamson-style horrorflick or a 'remake' of the first film. But, in a way, this is actually both. The story that had to be told for money purposes takes elements from Twin Peaks (the 'inhabiting spirit' storyline) and Wes Craven's New Nightmare (fact and fiction interwoven in a fictional film). Whereas BWP threw everything overboard to be an overwhelming psychological experience, BOS is, in technical terms, a professional picture. Technically conventional moviemaking. The film is populated by fairly attractive people, whose acting ranges from mediocre to downright amateurish. There are special effects and conventional scares (the ole tap-on-your-shoulder routine). There is a superb soundtrack produced by Marilyn Manson and there are some cool visuals (like the camera 'attacking' Jeffrey Donovan, who should be given the chance to move on to better things). Is it unfair to compare it to the first film? Well, it's a continuation of the same premise, isn't? It's the middle part of what apparently will be a trilogy.And Joe Berlinger's reaction to the criticism resembled that of Jan de Bont's, who did a remake of \"The Haunting\": \"They didn't get what they expected, they had other expectations of what I was trying to do with this film\".  Er, gee, it's a horrorfilm. I guess I sorta expected to be scared. I dunno. My fellow countryman's \"The Haunting\" wasn't scary and Berlinger's BOS isn't scary. BWP was for many people a terrifying experience, a confrontation with their own fears. BOS, not a sincere motion picture, simply isn't scary. Thus a failure.This film is released in a time when I have to get used to the fact that I'm in a new phase of my life, and, more important (obviously not necessarily for me), the United States of America are choosing their new leader. And my mind can't help but wander back to the walking around in circles in BWP, to Heather's clinging to a fake certainty, to Heather's not wanting to face the facts.So many of us are there with her, aren't we? Walking around in circles. Fooling ourselves. Limiting our own potential. Wanting to be in control of things. Needing patterns. Fake certainties. Sticking to rules we create ourselves. Taking sides. Even if it all doesn't work one bit, we couldn't just try to change it, could we now?We see it in our own daily routines, in politics (the repetitive stupidity of the presidential elections. Not joining hands, or at least trying to find a middle way. No, it's a contest with opponents who need to disagree with each other on principle in those dumb debates -\"Senator, how serious are you about your plans?\"- and trying to beat 'the other guy' by finding out that he did something in the past that makes him way too human. Every four year. The same thing over and over again) and in art, too. BOS came out and, there we go again, all the reporters ask the same questions that already have been asked about a million times and the 'talents' give their standard replies, stating how great it was to work with their fellow actors who are the greatest bunch of talented people, and that their director is a one of a kind auteur. We all know it's a charade, we all know it's bonkers, but we still keep it up. What else can we do?In the end, I really don't know what scared me more: the power BWP has to conjure up primal fears or the symbolic value of a stubborn person suddenly realizing and admitting that she has been walking around in circles and the way she reacts to the fact that she doesn't have this pseudo-safety anymore to hold on to.If you appreciated the original Blair Witch Project, I'd like to recommend the original \"The Haunting\" (1963) by Robert Wise. (O, and maybe \"Primary Colors\" -1997- by Mike Nichols, too).",

            "content": "\"The Blair Witch Project\" was a monumental film for many reasons: it was made on a non-existent budget, grossed millions at the box office, brought terror to the audience through suggestive imagery, and showed that \"a little movie that could\" can beat a studio film like \"The Haunting\" when it comes down to it. However, this is not the case with \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2.\"The idea is good, but it's another example of bad execution. The idea is that in the fall of 1999, this group of five people travel into the woods of Burketsville on a \"Blair Witch Hunt.\" The leader of this troop was once a mental patient at the local loony bin and has now set up a travel agency of sorts into the Blair Witch woods, which is funded by witch merchandise, merchandise, merchandise and by hocking black market goods on Ebay. The rest of the group is made up of a couple working on a Blair Witch book doing on location studies, a real life modern day witch that is a \"child of nature,\" and a run-away goth chick who. So, all of these people saw \"The Blair Witch Project\" and now they're off to see where it was filmed and this entire movie is a reenactment of what happened to them.So, there's no book of shadows in \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" and there's no witch either. This time the troop of people go into the woods and make it out, but the Blair Witch has \"touched\" them and continues to mess with their heads from far away. So, the gist of it is that the Blair Witch has these super powers that now reach long distance and turn everyone against each other by making them see things that aren't really there.All in all, it was disappointing. I really enjoyed \"The Blair Witch Project;\" part 2 was very hard to get through. It seemed more like an excuse to make a movie hot on the tails of a successful one hoping to ride the gravy train and throw in as much metal music as possible. The best character, though, by far was the local Burketsville Sheriff, who seems like he's out of \"Smokey And The Bandit\" and adds a lot of comic relief. Maybe I haven't figured it out yet, but then again maybe not, but I get the feeling sometimes that the whole point of \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" was to make fun of itself and the entire popularity that surrounded the first film. But I could be wrong and it's just another silly horror flick that takes itself far too serious.",

What annoyed me about other reviews were the fact they claim it's not scary enough thus making it crap. It isn't scary but it doesn't ruin it. I wonder if they planned the movie to end with 2 guys and a girl like BWP had? I loved all the cast and their characters are well defined and acted. I enjoyed searching for all the hiden creepy images in the movie, at the end or on the DVD they give you clues for 5 of them but I think it has about a dozen.

            "content": "Never before have I seen a film with absolutely no redeeming qualities. I enjoyed the first Blair Witch because (as a fan of horror movies) I was grateful to see something a bit different.I approached this film with the same mixture of hope and despair that normally accompanies a horror sequel, all the hope vanished within the first 20 minutes... \"Oh look\" I thought \"The freak, the psycho, the sceptic and the true believer. You don't often see that in supernatural horror films.\"The characters were wooden, the plot was trite and it even had the 'cat in the cupboard' scene that the first Blair Witch had so carefully avoided. Even the gratuitous nudity didn't redeem it, since normally in a horror movie the nudity is so pointless and out of context that it's just funny, but here it was actually a plot device... on that note I'm puzzled about why - if the gang (wait a minute... van, pesky kids, supernatural plot... nah) went mental and took all their clothes off - did they think to get dressed again after the murders? And come there was no blood on them? And how did they film the murders and stuff if they'd smashed the cameras and hidden the tapes (both acts they somehow filmed as well)? And where did the pregnant one (I forget her name) get that robe from anyway?This film leaves more loose ends than an explosion in a string factory (I wasn't at all surprised to discover that there's talk of a Blair Witch 3) and doesn't really explain whether the Blair Witch is 'real' or whether a bunch of people just went crazy... at the same time... and all had the same idea...",

            "content": "The Blair Witch Project was an original film. We saw for the first time, a movie that was set through the video-camera lens, from a bunch of college-goers producing a documentary for their project. The film was dark, atmospheric, realistic, but subtle in its execution. That's what makes that film so wonderful, your own imagination working to produce the real scares. Your own imagery of what was really out there. You don't need fat-cat special effect's producers to show you.And then we come to Blair Witch 2. This time there is another original approach. The film is set in a time where the original Blair Witch film is portrayed as a cult film, featuring a bunch of fans, selling merchandise on their web site. A bunch of them go along to Burkitsville (the town where this fictitious story is supposed to have taken place), and basically hang about in the woods. Er, guys. this is a fictitious story remember - a film. You won't see any witches out there. They decide to camp out there anyway, where their own little imaginations go wild, and they start to dream of strange things. We have a bunch of people we've never heard of, with little acting talent. We have a lead character. It's really hard to find anything we like about him. In fact, it's hard to find anything to like about the ENTIRE CAST! Erica is the beautiful `girl of nature' that summons up good, but she's so strange I don't really understand her role in the film at all. She just talks to trees and stuff. Then we have the pathetic goth girl. Good god, what a mess. Maybe if she kept her mouth shut and stopped swearing every three seconds she'd be fine. There is nothing more to kill the atmosphere then a group of sceptics who wouldn't believe in the supernatural if it was shot up their backsides through a shotgun. Nothing actually weird ever goes on, only in their minds. Brilliant. Then various members of the Blair-aholics find they have markings on them from an ancient alphabet, which a Goth tells us; `Means a witch touched us'.Guess what guys? Yep, it's a whodunit film. One of the fans of the film is actually the Blair Witch. Er. but according to the storyline the Blair Witch isn't even real. Oh well, not that anything makes any sense anyway. Yes, people, it's SCREAM time! Except the story is so lame and the plot has as much direction as a spider with no legs, that you couldn't give a monkeys what's going on. The script seems to have been pieced together by one of those randomisers you find in the box of Twister; `You gotta understand that', `Are you crazy?', and `What the f**k are you talking about?'.\nThe plot makes absolutely no sense all the way through. We keep getting shots at the end of the film with various members of the cast being questioned in a cell saying `It was an accident!!! It really was!' Most of the film goes through video tapes of the things they saw in the woods. Hours of the video taping is missing, they want to find out why. They get dreams about strange things such as the Goth eating an owl, people getting sliced and diced, and sex. The sex part is probably the best part of the entire movie, despite the fact that it rarely ever works in a horror movie. But the movie was so incredibly poor, it breathed a little bit more excitement into this shameful monstrosity.#SPOILERS AHEAD# The ending is so incredibly weak, it even matches having Bruce Willis finish off the bad guy in a Die Hard film by stamping on his foot. Yes, it's THAT bad. The woman who you least expect to be the witch er. IS the Blair Witch. I hear the director whisper in my ear: `Heh, bet you didn't expect THAT coming did you? Good eh?' No, it's a rubbish idea, that should never have been utilised in a film like this. At the end comes the most pathetic of all `psychic' messages; `Run the tape backwards, and all will be revealed! I. just know.' Oh, so running the tape backwards means all that missing footage will be revealed? Oh brilliant. What the. What have you DONE?! I think they went for a WWF-style twist. Speaking of which, this film features more wrestling lookalikes then any other film I've seen. Look out for this lot: X-Pac, Taka Michinoku and Daphne (David Flairs manager from WCW). Why do I mention that? Well, it'll give you something to do for if you ever have to sit down through this miserable film again.Overall, I think that this is the WORST film I have ever had to sit through. Not just as a sequel, it plunges to new depths of awfulness as a film itself. I can hardly BELIEVE this. The only real good part of the film is the music itself, from acts such as Marilyn Manson and Queens Of The Stone Age. The rest of the film is a non-sensical, dire mess full of poor acting, pathetic camera-switching (why can't they keep the shot still for once for gods sake?), un-natural lighting, bad characters, `fake' scares, and the list goes on. If you're an original Blair Witch fan, I won't be able to stop you watching this. But by god, you'll regret ever wasting your money to see this.Some said that the sequel had to change its roots. Well, do you think setting a sequel with a new group of people camping out in the woods, aimed with video cameras, would have been any worse then this? They could have made it so that a group of seven or so people camped out in the woods to find out what happened to the three campers of the first film. More could have been uncovered. More strange things could have happened.\nIt seems like since the late 90's, people are unable to make a decent horror movie. The latest horror movie that was brilliant was the original Blair Witch. The horror movie is dead.",

Having just viewed it again on DVD, I would give it a slightly above-average rating (6/10). The acting, with the exception of Kim Director as the Goth girl, is not good, and the story doesn't quite make it, but this movie still has a filmmaker's integrity and it was fairly entertaining upon second viewing, with a few standout sequences (the graveyard scene--which you should watch closely for a couple of eerie touches; the morning-after rain of paper, and the goth girl's trip to the town market--again which you should watch closely). DVD viewers beware though: the director's commentary is really pretentious and repetitive--I lost track of the number of times the man used the phrase \"trying to depict the dangers of confusing fiction and reality\", or words to that effect, and he let his bitterness about the critical and public reaction to the film creep in once too often. Like I said, he was trying to create an artful film here and I give him credit for that, but having to listen to all his hot air about his efforts was a trial.Sometimes it's best to let the work speak for itself.",

I guarentee if this film came out under another name and used some other references to some other which it would have been a blockbuster success.While the first Blair Witch was a subjective visual movie, BWP2 is made just like any other movie with a script, cast, special effects, etc.  It is a movie influenced by another.The tension in this movie occurs because you have no clue what is going on. Even though your view is objective and we don't just see what the characters see, it is filmed in a way that makes it hard to comprehend.I found this movie to be great for the same reason that i found the first BWP to be fantastic.  Both movies leave room for endless discussion at the end.  What just happened?  Why did it happen? etc.  This is a thinking movie with psychological twists that frighten the hell out of you but the fun part is not watching the movie but rather trying to fit all the pieces together and seeing if your explanation of actions can hold up under the scrutiny of others....",

Sheesh, did they learn nothing from the first film? The original Blair Witch Project is quite a film, it usually brings a positive or negative reaction and little in between, but this \"sequel\", well lets just say it has little or no redeeming merits to even debate. Typical of an American sequel it features the molded Wes Cravenish sterotypes that have killed real horror dead and is polluted with mainstream pop music like Marilyn Manson from the get go. The acting and dialogue is incredibly sappy and unbelievable, and thats saying ALOT... the goth is about the only redeeming thing in the entire film (at least she is nice to look at if nothing else, but thats about the extent of it.). The real question is WHY they make a sequel of a FEROCIOUSLY original film so unoriginal and predictable. The precedent the original set was almost immediatly erased and BURIED despite the films success and financial gain. Why go for scares when you can go for safe, wholesome and PLAIN teen style garbage? Why set an example by breaking a trend when you can simply ADHERE to the same crap that killed the industry in the late eighties? Why... WHY? I seriously wonder why folks, why is it so HARD for US based films to GIVE us some thing original (and please, do not cite The Ring, it was a total rip of Hideo Nakatas japanese original), and not make such horrid follow ups? By all accounts after watching the trailer to Battle Royale part 2 tonight (and oh my god, it looks UNREAL... no lame PC restrictions or Rob Schneider complex there) maybe Japan is the last frontier when it comes to intelligent and thought provoking horror genre films. Maybe one day we will recieve some REAL horror again in the USA, I just hope that day is soon.",

The ending was also interesting because it left the interpretation up to the viewer. I also liked the confined and unique setting of the film. However the characters are just annoying and stupid teenage caricatures who don't have much to offer, so it is sort of hard to care about them. The film is also filled with plenty of pointless conversations between the characters which only serve to pad out the run time.

This is *not* a sequel to The Blair Witch Project, inasmuch as the original mockumentary, 'The Curse of the Blair Witch' wasn't a sequel either. It's a kind of companion piece, another take on the story, yet more layers of myth adding to the text. This is a dramatisation of what might have happened in Burkittsville after the release of the first movie. If you took the first movie too seriously. And were of unsound mind, and under the influence. It's also a dramatisation of what might have happened if the Blair Witch was real. The fact that it's both those things things at once may just subtly point to the film's inherent cleverness.Okay, it's not wholly frightening. It has its moments- and some of the imagery is genuinely disturbing- but it lacks the kinetic drive of the original. By distancing itself from the hand-held nightmarishness of *that footage* it's placed in safer, more audience-friendly, territory. Never trying to convince the viewer it's at all real, it forgoes the sweaty menace that BWP had and instead tries to scare with more conventional Hollywood tactics. Fine. I have no problem with that- to try and pull the same trick off twice would have been foolish. Unfortunately, rather than coming across as a poor Blair Witch clone (like Last Broadcast, for instance) it opens itself up for comparison to all the glammy glitzy horror movies currently haemorrhaging out of the studios. However, it stands up pretty well, and is certainly more entertaining than most. It's also far smarter than all the 'Scream' and 'I Know...' movies put together, and actually gives you something to talk about when you leave the cinema.So- is it worth seeing? Oh yes. Go with no preconceptions other than you are about to see something that relates to a movie, and more importantly, a *phenomenon*, that we all found inescapable last year, and then enjoy it for that. Or not, as the case may be.One final word: Kim Director. Hubba hubba.Steev",

Why is it mentioned that Kim's character is psychic at least 5 times in the first 5 minutes of the film, then it's never alluded to again? What is the deal with the disappearing tree, which also figures prominently in the exposition of the film, but is never mentioned again? And why is the film called \"Book of Shadows?\" What is the significance, since a book of shadows has nothing to do with this movie???Overall the film is watchable, but the screenwriters and studio who obviously rushed this out just have product on screens in time to cash in on \"Blair Witch\" hype all get F's.

What transpires is a descent into an apparent nightmare from which they can't seem to wake up. It's a horror film that works on a purely psychological level and it counts on the audience's intelligence to put the pieces together and give the story closure - the film itself doesn't - and it's all nicely and efficiently realized.  Good photography is one of this film's assets, another one is the tight, tense direction.

I have seen it in a theatre in 2000. Some of you who might have seen it only on a TV screen believe me: it was scarier on the big screen, in the dark room. Anyway, let\u2019s talk about its sequel which was mocked by horror fans all over the world. If anyone hates sequels, I am that guy, but I know that film industry doesn\u2019t have any hindrance, especially when it comes to sequels. So I faced the fact that a sequel exists and dared to see Book of Shadows: Blair Witch Project 2 (Note that there isn\u2019t a Book of Shadows in the story!!! :-)). I think that this movie has the same problem that many movies (especially horrors) have nowadays: the writers and the directors didn\u2019t have a sense for rhythm. SPOILER! I just watched and watched and I were 50 minutes into the movie and nothing really happened. Then came the interesting part after they watched the tapes and strange things started to happen. What is happening in the first part? We see a bunch of young tourists going to see the haunted house known from the first movie. They arrive, meet another group who go elsewhere, then they start to get bored and then have a party drinking alcohol and smoking pot. During these they are talking a LOT. We learn that BWP was only a movie for them just like for us, real viewers, and I think it\u2019s a great twist and a good starting point for a sequel. END OF SPOILER. When I\u2019m into a horror flick and nothing scary, even interesting happens in the first part of the movie I press STOP on the player. But I was patient, and my patience was rewarded. I don\u2019t wanna spoil the ending of the movie. I have to tell you that I really liked it and if there is a way to make a sequel to the one and only Blair Witch Project, this is it. They didn\u2019t explain the mysteries of the first part, they remain mysteries, on the top of that, we have another mystery now. They didn\u2019t put a lot of special effects into it, at the same time it\u2019s not a fake documentary made with a handycam. It is a psychological horror, just like the first part. As I said before, the only problem is the rhythm: if I recut the movie, the first 50 minutes would be densed into 25 minutes, and the last 30 minutes would be stretched to 40, even 50 minutes with an increasing suspense. And we would have 10-15 minutes for something that is not in the original script: meeting with some unfriendly Burkittsville folks or something like that :-) Anyway: if you really liked the first part, try this too.",

Now, I have to admit that the acting in the movie was nothing that will get any awards... ever... but the concept and delivery of all those visuals was brilliant.The movie itself had a twisted story that you really don't have a clue what is going on until the very end... like any good movie should do.  Screw with the audience until the conclusion.  Beautiful.  The main reason why I loved this movie was because of the Visual were brilliant, and the Aurels were even better.  I loved the sounds they used (including the soundtrack, which was great) and if you watch it again, I suggest paying particular attention to those sounds I am promoting.

There is gratuitous nudity and violence, the acting is not very good, and the whole plot could have been avoided if the stars of the movie had just LEFT after the mysterious events of their evening in the woods.  That said, the film does have some strengths, too.  By the time the ending arrives, the viewer is tangled in a web of confusion and mystery.  What's really happening here?  Who's actually telling the truth?  Did the events on the videotape REALLY show what happened out there?  Who's getting stabbed in the glimpses and images of violence that show up throughout the movie.  This confusion didn't bother me--as it has so many other people.

But there are thousands of people out there ready to knock it. I think what people wanted was to smugly confide that it was just as terrible as they thought it would be and there were no redeeming features at all.\tA few popular thoughts are that 'there was no plot' and 'nothing happened.' Well, you could say the same about the first one. But you didn't, did you? If last year's double dose of celluloid trash, \"The House on Haunted Hill\" and \"The Haunting\"  proved that CGI isn't scary and constant screaming and strobing visuals are boring and irritating, then BW2 proved that static, confusing images and disruptive timeline jumps are rather unsettling and exactly what make a suspenseful film work.\tNow, I am not saying that this film was fantastic. The acting was startlingly bad at times, and none of the characters were sympathetic. Also, I think that there was a script/improvisation mix which exposed the limitations of the actors more than a well-written screenplay would have. But I was impressed by the unusual 'twist' and the framing devices/story structure which sparked a long discussion about the nature of reality (and the depiction thereof).  When you discover the end, and the TRUE events are played out on the screen, it not only changes one's perspective on the action up to that point, but also what may have happened in the first film.

The whole time the movie has an overall eereness that just wasn't there in the first movie.  There are less scary moments than the first one, but the overall eere feeling makes up for it.  Another reason this movie is better than the first is because you can actually see what is going on(i.e.-it is not from a handheld camera point of view).  The movies doesn't center on the Blair Witch theme very much, which could be good and bad. It mainly focuses on what happened when the characters blacked out, which doesn't really have to do with the blair witch.  I really enjoyed the movie the whole time I was watching it, and this is one of the few movies where I can say the sequel was better than the original.  If you haven't, go see it.",

There was absolutely nothing about this movie that was good or original! When the credits started to roll, we hated the movie so much that we went outside with the video and tied it around a tree. My friends proceeded to open it up and dissembowel it, as we had our own crazy ritual. We pranced around my friends car with the black tape held high above our heads and let the wind take it away, far away. We buried the empty video under lots of rocks in the forests and went home.

But on the other hand:what was it all about??? In the first BW,there wasn't an explanation either,but that movie was completely mysterious and bizarre.This movie is trying to be freaky and bizarre AND commercially succesfull at a time.This the major mistake Berlinger and company made.Those two elements just don't mix. Technically the movie wasn't great either,the story (was there one?!) wasn't good either and the acting was pretty poor at times. But generally the acting wasn't that bad and I enjoyed watching the movie,just for fun and looking at what the big world of sequels is all about:being inferior to his original. Rating it 5 out of 10,I don't see this as a Classic movie,nor a very bad movie,just a plain movie by a brave director.",

The line was \"film is false, but video always tells the truth.\" or something to that degree.

There are two main differences between one of those attractions and BW2.  First, you have sit through BW2 for nearly two hours.  Second, it costs more than a dollar.When I left The Blair Witch Project, my stomach muscles hurt because (though I didn't realize it during the movie) they were completely tensed for the duration of the film.  When I left, one of the first things I said was \"I hope they don't make a sequel.\"  I'm usually not quite that dead-on, but hey, this time I was right.The primary reason that I saw this movie was to get more of the Blair Witch mythology.  There wasn't a single scrap of any new insights anywhere in this film.  With that taken away, what I was left with was a genuinely awful horror film.  Nearly all of the character development was done through dialogue, which has always been a pet peeve of mine.There was one good thing about the movie.  The joke about how many Heather Donahues it takes to screw in a light bulb.  Do yourself a favor and ask some poor sap who saw the movie what the punch line is.

As a horror film, it's largely a failure, but in retrospect, I'm not exactly sure that that's what this is.  I don't think either of the Blair Witch films operates on its own merits, but when viewed in conjunction with promotional films like \"Curse of the Blair Witch\" and \"The Burkittsville Seven\" they shape a rich mythical horror tapestry.\nThink of it like this: The Blair Witch Project is a movie that purports to reflect a real situation.  It is supposed to be real, the retrieved footage from a documentary shoot gone horrifically awry, a sort of \"Faces of Death\" style exploitation film.If you expect the same from Book of Shadows, you are only set up for disappointment.  It is trying to be something else entirely.  In the Blair Witch mythos, the BWP was not a recreation, but actual footage.  In the world of BWII, Book of Shadows is a recreation of events that occured from the perspective of those who alleged to have lived them.  It is a docudrama about murderers told from their perspective.  And in this case, their story attempts to explain their murderous rampage as the product of unseen forces rather than their own machinations.  It is not a horror movie, but rather a faux version of a serial killer docudrama told from the serial killer's perspective.  If BWP borrow's heavily from \"In Search Of,\" \"BOS:BWII\" is more like the \"Amityville Horror.\" Watch it alongside the Burkittsville Seven and it makes that much more sense.Essentially, the BWII takes the perspective that Rustin Parr was indeed guided by voices in his head, one that the faux documentary Burkittsville Seven challenges.  Still not the most compelling movie, but more fun and original than most give it credit for.",

And, probably because of that, the sequel is called Book of Shadows - BW2, what I think it was a way to hide, in some way, the original's title, so the public could be induced to see this second part!This time, Blair Witch 2 opens mysteriously, surrounded with a Gothic-scary style, along with Marylin Manson's music as background. All starts with a group of friends going out in search of the wicked woods where the first film was done, in search of the Blair Witch. More cautious and aware of what happened before, the group carries some cameras and tapes to record any unusual events. They set up the cameras in strategic places so every movement could be filmed. As the time waiting for something to happen passes, our \"heroes\" become tired and bored. One starts smoking, the other drinking vodka and then... everything ends in \"paradise-like\" atmosphere of drugs and unconsciousness. When they all wake up, they find their research works completely destroyed, along with the cameras. Funny enough, the tapes are not broken... only missing! Strangely, one of the group members locates the tapes, what makes things a bit more strange and bizarre. In any case, they all decide to take the tapes to one of the members' studio, to process the images inside and answer all their questions about what happened at the site! Although, for their amusement, the tapes reveal something unexpected... something dark, bizarre and evil! Everyone recalls nothings of what happened during their drugged sleep, but there is something very wrong with them all! What happened to them seems to have been recorded differently than reality itself! Voices in the tapes are strange, as if recorded as a wrong \"version\". The members start to doubt their own sanity and point evidences to each other. Their reactions are violent and insane. What the hell is happening and what will come next?! That is what you have to find out if you don't get paranoid before!The movie is done carefully, with a morbid-like atmosphere and dense musical scores. The appeal to the Gothic style is present all along and the crazy mind of the director will make you doubt your own reality! Blair Witch 2 is far better than the first one (fortunately!), and will dive you into a dark minded world of witchcraft, insanity and twisted dreams (or reality?!). In summary, a well done movie, with excellent sound effects, interesting story, nice acting and very confusing elements.If you have already seen the movie and think you understood the end, then you should maybe think twice about that! If you haven't seen it yet, then remember that it will probably make you brain aches. So, before you go insane, you should think twice before you enter the cinema room! Make sure you can handle it.",

But that's not saying much at all.The biggest problem is figuring out what's happening, from start to end! Another big problem is trying to understand why the tapes from the video camera contains what they contain. Probably the best example is why the huge tree at the ruins are just a little branch in the tapes! Well, it probably is because the Witch is in the woods that night and the tapes therefore films her original time of existence a few hundred years back in time... But really, WHY ON EARTH does it happen?? There's no answer anywhere!I'm sorry, but when I have to watch a film several times just to understand what the heck is actually going on, that just ruins the whole purpose of watching it in the first place!

Every film student should see this movie just so that they know what NOT to do.First of all, the script (I use that term loosely) was terrible.  The story seemed like a set-up for another story, never really developing itself. Furthermore, the entire movie is interrupted by annoying \"flash forwards\" that seem to serve little purpose other than giving away the ending.The characters are completely undeveloped.  The gothic chick, the guide, and the witch are all nothing more than stereotypes; while the other two characters don't have definitive personalities.  This might have something to do with the fact that we are never properly introduced to the characters, as we meet them all within a minute.The acting is certainly not the worst I have ever seen, but it is definitely not good either.  Then again, it is hard to tell how good an actor is when they are given only stilted dialogue to speak.Overall, this movie is fairly disappointing.  I was expecting a bad movie, and I got just that.  The only redeeming quality is that you are never really sure if what is going on is real or not...which can be a good thing, but not when you base the entire movie on that concept.

            "content": "When I was in film school, the projects in our screenings had a certain flavor to them, like when you wake up with a hangover and it feels like you have fur on your teeth.  Yes, there were always some clever ones in there, making their mark and moving in new directions, but they were usually far outnumbered by imitations.  Therefore it's become somewhat refreshing to see a commercial film in a theater, because even though I know it's going to be formulaic and horribly banal despite costing millions, it will at least have neat effects, some explosions, and a superstar.  But `Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows,' which didn't have any of those things, made it feel like I was still stuck in a school screening, and never came close to even being somewhat tolerable on the `This Movie is Terrible' scale.You've probably heard something about the plot of the original `Blair Witch Project': three students making a documentary disappear in the Maryland woods near Burketsville and a year later their footage is found.  The film consists of the discovered footage, which is stitched together into a frightening, disturbing and actually pretty original piece of suspense (it would be horror except for the lack of graphic violence).  It was released amid throngs of internet hype and media rumors that it was actually real (it wasn't).In `Blair Witch 2,' there are some idiots who want to relive the experience of the students that vanished, so they each bring their obnoxious selves to the Black Hills of Maryland.I'll use general descriptions for the generalized characters: first, the used-to-be-in-a-sanitarium-but-now-a-hip-youngster Black Hills tour guide; a Witch-obsessed woman who just found out she's pregnant; her weird and controlling boyfriend who can't act; a nature-oriented Wicca witch who throws leaves in her hair and wants to communicate with the Blair Witch; and last but not least, the token Goth child, who's pretty much along for the cigarettes and beer.For the first ten minutes there are disturbing flashes of the Hip Youngster (hereafter known as Hipster) in an antiquated asylum full of employees with shaved heads and inmates that drool.  Then some calendar dates indicating some sort of passage of time flash onto the screen, though one loses track of them after the 15,000th one.\nThat's all the background we receive before being catapulted to the fictitious woods where the Hipster leads the aforementioned stereotypical characters on a tour of the same course taken by the ill-fated characters of the first film.The quintet stops at a site from the first film to camp out and absorb some freaky vibes.  Before we know it they're smokin' dope, downin' some beers (yes, even Pregnant Lady parties with them) and chattin' about perception, reality, and all the other ideas the movie couldn't get across except in the dialogue.  Though the group vows to stay awake there's something about mixing large amounts of alcohol with marijuana that makes people pass out, so of course they do.They awake to find that their campsite has been ransacked, and then some other weird, gross stuff happens.  Then, because their combined IQ scores are less than their combined ages, they all decide to stay at Hipster's dank but roomy apartment/abandoned factory that is located nearby.  Thus begins the madness, or whatever.For the rest of the movie we are subjected to some of the most disturbingly stupid imagery, acting, and plot lines I've ever had the misfortune of watching.  Hallucinations, unwarranted explicit carnage, sounds of babies crying (give me a break), wrecked cars that are fixed the next minute and vice-versa, people disappearing and then reappearing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was so predictable it made want to cry.  The few scares came only from decibel level, not clever set-up and execution, and witty lines, which usually came out of Hipster's mouth, were few and far between the \"fuck\"s and the \"shit\"s and the \"I need a beer\"s.  The only entertainment came from the high-schoolers behind me who kept yelling things at the screen like, `Look behind you!' and `Aw, *HELL* no, he ain't goin' in *THERE*!'\nIn the end we're meant to question our own realities, because what we think is actually happening may not be what is actually happening. Oh. Deep.  I wish that'd been the case with me; I would have much rather been bowling or vacuuming my apartment than sitting there watching this movie. Plus, there is no book of shadows.  Not even a brochure of shadows.  What's THAT all about?My grade for `Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows': D",

It tries to pull on all the audiences strings, throwing in cuts of knifings, shots of one bloke going crazy etc..I must say that i did like the ending. Perhaps because it was so unlike the BWP. A slow, anti climax that did make me wake up a bit. My only problem was that throughout the film you knew who was going to survive as they were in the interrogation rooms.I would like to think that this film didn't try and fob us off that it was the \"blair witch\" controlling these peoples minds. The only reason i liked the end was because I had it in my mind that they went mad themselves, on hysteria of the witch, mind expanding drugs and overactive imaginations. Showing that cameras don't always tell the story that you think you've seen.If this didn't have the BWP in it's name then it may have done better, but this was definitely a venture for the purposes of money and no other.",

Many fans of the original film will go to the theater just to come out say how much they hated it.  However, the only real thing wrong with BW2 is that it DOES kind of feel like a rush job.  Artisan should have waited another year to let their merchandising campaign run its course so everyone would finally start recovering from their hatred of seeing all these little stick figures everywhere.  It would probably have also been a better time to interest people in seeing the new film.That said, it is a pity that most of the people seeing this will only be there to rip it.  It was a surprisingly intelligent film, not so much horror as mystery.  What happened at the end?  Who knows.  It will probably be left unsaid, unless the prequel shines some light.  For an amateur cast, the acting was well done, and Joe Berlinger definitely has a good, if spare, directing style.  And, as for showing the blood, this really doesn't show much.  The same scenes are repeated, over and over again, and only in flashes.  In terms of horror movie gore, BW2 is still mild, and what is left to the imagination is still the most important part of this movie.",

            "content": "\"Book of Shadows:  Blair Witch 2\" is perhaps the most-anticipated sequel of the year.  After the moderately successful Urban Legends:  Final Cut, which was somewhat of a disappointment, I was expecting a lot out of \"Blair Witch 2.\"  However, I found a tad less than I was looking for. This film treats the original Blair Witch, which was a revolutionary motion picture, as though it was actually just a film (which it was).  It features a new slew of Hollywood unknowns as well as a standard style of direction. Book of Shadows follows five young Blair Witch fans' journey in search of the truth.  They consist of Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan), a student director with a history of mental illness; Kim (Kim Director), a young woman into the Goth style of life; Erica (Erica Leerhsen), a Wiccan who is seeking the Blair Witch as her mentor;  Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner), a young skeptic along for the ride; and Tristen (Tristen Skylar), Stephen's pregnant girlfriend with an eerie connection to the phenomenon. The five people hike into the woods where \"The Blair Witch Project\" was filmed.  From there, they fall into a drunken and stoned haze.  They wake up the next morning only to realize that they have no recollection of the past five hours.  Now, they must discover the truth of what happened to them, and if, in fact, the Blair Witch is behind it. Original in its own way but nowhere near the greatness of the first, \"Book of Shadows:  Blair Witch 2\" is a ninety-minute excursion away from real life and into a world of fantasy and fright.      There is no denying that the original was much, much scarier, but this one does have its moments.  These `moments' are found in mostly bizarre and disturbing imagery, famous to films penned by Dick Beebe.  The prime of example of Beebe's brilliant imagery is 1999's horror remake, \"House on Haunted Hill.\"  But \"Blair Witch 2\"'s imagery is definitely not as unsettling as it was in \"House on Haunted Hill.\"  But never mind comparisons.  \"Book of Shadows\" has lots of plot twists, and the storyline is constantly inventive and keeps us in suspense, and for that, it earns credit. Though already lambasted for trying too hard, I think the film tries its best and does a fine job on a whole. The acting is decent, as well as Joe Berlinger's clever and graceful direction. \"Book of Shadows:  Blair Witch 2\" certainly cannot hold a candle to the original's brilliance.  On the other hand, it is entertaining and could actually be considered a laudable sequel.GRADE:  B",

This is most noticeable in the inclusion of an actual script.  I'm not exactly a traditionalist, but I do think that scripts are generally handy things to have when you're making a film. Telling your cast to \"run around looking scared\" isn't going to do much if the dialogue isn't properly constructed to match.Another big plus is that they actually managed to hire someone who knew how to focus a camera- BWP gave me quite a headache with all the weird focus (or lack of).Finally, this film is actually scary.  OK, part of this is down to the story playing very heavily on some of my personal worst fears, but Book of Shadows terrified me.  Now, call me a fussy, but I think that this is a very important feature of a horror film.  The really great thing about this is that it doesn't rely (much) on any special effects- the scares are all psychological....All in all, a very good film.",

Yes, the idea was good and the marketing was brilliant but that's where the ball stopped rolling.  In this waste-of-celluloid sequel not only did the ball never start back up again but it went flat and began to rot.  This movie is just plain boring.First of all, the story never makes any sense.  If your going to make a sequel in such a drastically different style as the original, at least try to give it some coherency.  Who did what in the huh with the eh?  This film was about as scary as watching my grandpa sleep.  To all the critics who said it was scarier than the first movie, it must have suddenly hit you that films like this can get such a large budget (seeing as to how it's nearly impossible to be any less scary than the first installment).  The best part of this movie is when the woman, accused of causing all the witchery mumbles some backwards gibberish which in the end sounds like she says \"neglip eight\" which made me laugh out loud.  Nothing is creepy and nothing is resolved, which is actually okay because nothing really makes any sense in the first place.Seriously folks, if you're in the market for a horror film that at least has a little potential, see the slightly less terrible Lost Souls but if you really need to see this one, wait until it's out on video and you've talked a friend into paying for the rental.",

Yeah, they're definitely not conventional-- but everyone seems to think that different=bad, which I just don't get. The first film was something new, and in the extinct land of horror movies, it was a welcome change. A lot of people I know who saw it when it came out thought it was one of the scariest things they'd seen in a long time-- but then the whole backlash thing started and they decided to go with the bashing flow. The second film was also pretty damn good-- With a film done the way BW1 was, it's a hard act to follow, and I think working within the world the first film created was one of the better choices. And contrary to popular belief, the acting wasn't that horrible either-- the actors all came from very strong theatre backgrounds. Kim Director has a B.F.A in acting from Carnegie Mellon. Jeff Donovan has been on the New York stage for ages in productions such as the Tony award-winning play An Inspector Calls on Broadway. I think because this film didn't have the usual slasher-flick formula, people decided they weren't going to like it. If you like psychological stories with still a tad of horror movie conventions, give this at least a one-time viewing, if not more-- and if you're a big horror movie fan, watch out for references to classic like The Exorcist, The Omen, and Evil Dead 2.",

            "content": "****Contains Spoilers**** The opening of this film briefly analyzes the fallout upon the town of Burkitsville due to the success of the original BWP. Fascination has turned the Blair Witch into a memorabilia goldmine, and the town into a popular tourist site. The story then centers around a group of BW fanatics who venture into the Black Hills to do some research of their own. It's here that things start to get interesting, because the group is made up of such a motley crew: Kim Diamond is a Goth woman with some psychic abilities...Jeffrey Patterson is a leader who underwent \"therapy\" at an asylum...Erica Geerson is a Wiccan witch...and Tristan Skyler is a pregnant woman who doesn't want her child and becomes tortured by dreams about the Blair witch. Rounding out the cast is Stephen Ryan Parker, her boyfriend (who ultimately hangs her).They camp at the ruins of Rustin Parr's house, a hermit who murdered seven children and became part of the Blair witch legend. After a hard night of partying, they awake to find the site a mess and no recollection about how it got that way. Most of the film from this point on is devoted to piecing together what happened, mainly through the use of videotapes that were recording the events. The story lacks a lot of the credibility of the first film because unlike the three lost student film makers, none of the characters here are truly trapped in a bad situation with no means of escape. Granted, the first film was flawed because all they would have had to do to get out of the woods was bring along a cell phone and call for help. But they didn't, and ended up traipsing through the woods for days, until things came to a catastrophic end at Parr's house. The characters in this movie have a way out: they could just get in the van and go back home. Plus they have telephone access. And Patterson's house isn't really out in the middle of nowhere. Kim is able to drive to a convenience store and back. So there really is very little danger to anyone involved.If you enjoyed the first film, I'd recommend seeing this one. If not, skip it and hope that the upcoming sequel in the works fares better.",

In the first Blare Witch Project, the actors could get away with bad acting, but in this one, because the approach is different, it makes the movie just plain bad.Something else that I apreciated about the first movie that was lost in this one, is that the camera did not appear to be in the documentation form of the first one.  That is, the camera was steady, and allowed the audience to clearly see just how bad this movie was... I personally thought that the camera work was the ONLY good aspect of the first movie, and it was lost in this one.  Of course, this is a different movie, and because of it's content, it wouldn't be right to use TBWP's non-traditional camera work.The up side to this movie is the plot.

I guess I'm the only one in the world who didn't get a copy of the \"Hollywood Sequel-Making Rulebook\" so I wasn't aware that it was against the rules to make a sequel with a totally different approach than the original.That being said, let's examine the very cool premise of the original Blair Witch Project.  It's fiction under the guise of reality.  And very well done in that regard.  Blair Witch 2, on the other hand, is fiction in the guise of a \"dramatized re-enactment\" of the reality WE created, based on the fiction of the first film.  I think that's pretty cool.  The filmakers had to debunk the \"reality\" of the original...most people, I hope, realized that BWP1 was only a well-made piece of fiction.  How better to debunk it than to make fun of the obsession we ourselves had with its supposed reality?  After the first film, there was an explosion of related merchandising...books, internet sites, probably even a BW lunch-box.  The sequel merely jumps on the bandwagon of it all, while at the same time, bringing it to a grinding halt.As far as the film itself is concerned, I thought it was reasonably well done, although there are a few noteworthy lines, like \"Video never lies...film does, video doesn't.\"  Interesting concept, considering that it is the video footage at the end that is seen as the \"reality\", not the \"film\" that we, the audience is seeing.  Also, the debate between Tristen and Steven about the origin of mythology.  He says it's all constructed by us; invented.  She says that all myth has at least some basis in truth.  An ancient discussion, maybe, but essential to the idea of the Blair Witch. Makes you wonder about how much of the myth here might be based on some truth.  Obviously, anything you find on the internet now about the Blair Witch or even about Burkitsville, MD, would probably be utterly fictitious.Another reviewer has already said that the way in which BW2 is similar to BW1 is that they both operate on a psychological level.  Good point.  What would have REALLY sucked is if Tristen at the end sprouted a pointy black hat and flew away on a broomstick.",

It is a sequel to the Blair Witch Project, but just barely, as it has only a few similarities to the original film. Yes, it all centers around the evil presence of the Blair Witch in the dark woods of Burkittsville. But it takes a different turn as it gets going and tends to focus more on the five main characters and how the presence has affected them after they blacked out after a night of drinking and partying in the woods while doing research for a book two of the characters are writing. Of course, cameras have been set up to record any phenomena that may occur. The cameras play a main part in the story as the movie climaxes. I don't see why this movie is bashed so much, I loved every minute of it! It starts out with a bang, slows down a little towards the middle, and then picks up again for a creepy, disturbing, bloody finish. It was downright enjoyable and I can't believe so many people don't like it! The film has some very creepy, disturbing touches which include Jeff's flashbacks of his time in the mental hospital (those scenes were very effective) as well as serious couple Stephen and Tristan's relationship and her miscarriage (which includes a bloody dream sequence which may make you squirm). My favorite characters were probably Kim, the gothic/psychic chick who had a great sarcastic sense of humor, she was really great, and also Jeff, who was very cool and not to mention incredibly gorgeous and has a nice butt (don't miss his nude scene near the end, it's great). It's hard to explain this film because it could mean something different to everyone and has a lot of strange subplots and whatnot. And also, it doesn't have the shaky camerawork of the original, and has more of a polished studio look, so this may be a relief to those queasy viewers out there.

That's what actually made the first movie moderately creepy. I remember the creators being hailed as being geniuses for figuring this one out. It was great, psychological horror was in again.Apparently though, they didn't realize that simple fact. The movie barely even touches upon this again, and it's very sad. Why do I say this? Well, because there's so much blood and gore that this movie qualifies to be titled Scream. The only psychologically creepy part is well... there isn't any.The movie also does a great job of opening up alot of plot hooks, but doesn't follow up on any of them, which gives the viewer a feeling of being dragged around in circles. The movie would've been much better if they had concentrated on one thing and stuck to it rather than opening characters up for development than forgetting about them.It feels as though they decided to ditch the whole idea of the Blair Witch altogether. I know that the Witch is supposed to drive people insane and against each other much like Cthulhu (if you don't know what that is, look up HP Lovecraft), but come on people! How about some backing for the story being told? Tell the legend that was merely touched upon in the first movie and completely forgotten in the second.I realize that I'm ranting now and moving in circles (much like the movie) and I can't possibly say everything that I want to complain about, so I'll cut it short, but I will at least compliment the movie: I liked how Rustin Parr was actually IN the movie.Oh yeah, and if you're looking for something intellectually stimulating, watch Brain Dead (also called Dead Alive) for something that actually has a plot and if you're looking for something relating to the Blair Witch that will actually make you jump, go buy the games.",

Because of this, I don't think many were going to give 'Blair Witch 2' a chance.  Even I myself was slightly dubious, but when I saw it, I was pleasently suprised. I have read MANY bad reviews for this film, but if people were to stop wanting to hate it and just watch it like a normal film they would realise how entertaining it is.  Okay, so it's not the best film ever made and it is by no means a landmark in movie making like its predocesor, but, it DOESN'T take itself seriously, it knows what it is.  There are moments of humour, the cop especialy and at times we are fed some disturbing images...all this ties in with the shocking truth that is not revealed untill the end.

One year later, I go to the cheap seats to catch a flick and Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2 is now playing for $2.50, so with nothing else to watch, I decided to give this Witch another shot to redeem herself and not looking forward to anything, I thought it would be much worse than the original.  To my surprise, this was better than the original and for many reasons, it had characters with different backgrounds and stories to back them up, the premise of the fans obsession for the Blair Witch Project was a very unique way to follow up the original and this was a real movie, no 8mm camcorder home video that will make me nauseous just watching it.  Though it's no Exorcist(the greatest horror movie of all time), it is an above average horror flick that goes more for scares than blood spills.  My advice is:Take a risk on this movie, some may like it like I did and others will despise that Blair Witch but believe me it's worth the $2.50 at the cheap seats.Rating: $3 out of $5",

Then, as the movie winds its way into \"scare\" mode, things start to stall and finally come to a screeching halt. But back to the good points. Kim Director is excellent as \"Kim Diamond\" the goth empath. I also liked Erika Leerhsen as overbearing \"Wiccan Hottie\" and Jeffery Donovan as the slightly crazy Jeff Patterson (In an homage to the first Blair Witch, the main characters have the same names as the actors portraying them). Tristan Skyler and Stephen B. Turner have taken a lot of flack on here for their portrayals of a researcher and his fianc\u00e9, but they do the best with what they are given: the \"serious\" roles in the group of four people taking the inaugural trip on Jeff's \"Blair Witch Hunt\" tour of Burkittsville, MD, home of the Blair Witch. Look for product placement galore: Shinerbock beer, Pete's Wicked Ale, Moosehead Beer. The scenes at the convenience store are hilarious: the store only sells the above three beers! Also, the weird little hidden things that the DVD touts as the \"Secrets of ESREVER!\" are interesting to try to find. The next two thirds of the movie is awful and not in a funny way. I never stop being disappointed in what I see. Much has been made of the movie \"operating at a higher level\" than a horror movie or suffering from its relationship to the original Blair Witch movie. Nothing could be further from the truth. This movie was promoted as a \"real life\" documentary that had to be altered slightly to avoid a lawsuit from the families of the victims. There was a made for TV movie called \"Shadow of the Bliar Witch\" released just before BW2 that played this up to the hilt: in it footage of the \"REAL\" Jeff Patterson and his \"REAL\" tour group are spliced in with \"REAL\" news footage from Burkittsville, etc., all in an attempt to make the viewer believe that BW2, like BW1, was based on real events. So, everything was set up to make a movie IN the \"Blair Witch Mythos,\" but something bad happened along the way. It's my opinion that writer/ director Joe Berlinger really dropped the ball in his work on this movie and he proves it in his comments in the DVD booklet. He goes on and on about his \"vision\", etc., etc. and finally makes the statement that with BW2 he has \"embraced ambiguity.\" In other words, he doesn't know what it means either. Well, that might be a good thing when one is describing their 12th grade charcoal drawing for art class, but it's not enough when one is attempting to justify screwing up what could have been a great movie.",

Blair Witch 2 is nothing more than violence, vulgar language and nudity and a couple of cheap special effects. However a few characters were interesting, Kim stood out, the gothic psychic who was portrayed much more realistically than goths usually are.The plot does give some clues perhaps as to what might have happened at the end of the first Blair Witch movie, however, the possibility of what \"might\" have happened leaves you feeling ripped off.  Not knowing is better, it leaves you with more possibilities.Don't watch this movie if you're a fan of the first movie, it may just ruin your love for it.",

This movie had a little suspense to it, and a few scares. It was not altogether without merit. Its real problem comes when you compare it mentally to the original movie, which was quite sophisticated and terrifying. In addition, in Book of Shadows, you really don't care about the characters, and you sort of figure from the beginning that bad stuff will happen to them since they are so whiney and stupid.I wouldn't go so far as to say that I wish I hadn't seen it, but I do wish it had been a much better movie, befitting the title Blair Witch.",

The beauty of the first film, I thought, was that it required almost no suspension of disbelief; it pulled you in, and kept you there.  Completely lacking gore and violence, it was all suspense.  The original captured that feeling of being 14, sitting around the campfire in the woods, and hearing a scary story.  The second one is \"yet another post-modern slasher / thriller\".As a stand-alone film, the best feature is an intelligent use of flashbacks and out-of-order sequencing that keep you interested.  Parts of it, however, are so far-fetched that they pull you out of the film.  And in the end, instead of being spooked, you feel sorry for the pathetic characters with screwed-up lives.  Who wants to walk out of a horror film feeling sad?The film seems a little rushed; it has a hard time deciding if it is supposed to be a documentary or a feature film, and could use one more rewrite to tie up loose ends.  The concept of \"group hallucination\" should be explored more.  The characters leave not-so-subtle hints of past issues, then drop them; character histories should either be explored, or excluded. My biggest complaint is that it is too loud: the soundtrack is too aggressive, too out-front.  Overall, it is mediocre-to-good: six stars out of ten.",

The 1st Blair Witch was actually believable, the 2nd one isn't.This time around, rather than the more convincing shaky black and white snippets of film mixed with shaky coloured film, the piece is a \"Fictional Re-enactment\" of events that occurred after the first film was released at cinema's everywhere, following four budding students into the Black Hills once more to find out just what happened to Heather, Josh and Mike.Sadly, the fact that it is a \"Fictional Re-enactment\" takes the fun out of believing that this piece could possibly be true. BW2 is simply too professional looking to seem realistic, even for a \"Re-enactment\" Whereas BW1 had a certain sense of mystery and reality.Although entertaining in it's own right, the fact that you don't really believe that these bizarre things happened to people lets down the aura that the first created. Because of the shakiness and poor quality of the picture in the first Blair Witch it made things more believable...But this time, with a literal cast of thousands, a soundtrack, cinematic score, boom mike and casting director, you begin to feel that the Blair Witch makers are just out the make a buck...And I hear you all gasp.My bitterness though did not spoil my outing, though a wayward film reel did. Actually, it added to the movie, as during their first visit to that Mill the film on screen was strangely angled and I thought it was clever. Until the Cinema Man walked in and apologised before having it promptly reassigned.Onto the movie now...there were actual scary bits. The bit where the Gothic Girl sees the fun dead kids was kinda creepy. The good 'ole laughing and crying children made a comeback, plus flashes, distressed looks and visions of what took place during a lost 5 hours.Which is where the story comes in. The four new people, one was called Tristian I remember that much, go on The Blair Witch Hunt into the Black Hills to have a camp out in the ruins of the Rustin Parr  ( see the first film to find out who he is ) house to catch a glimpse of our favourite Blair Witch.After a drinking and smoking session, the four awaken to discover strew paper and smashed, lost video equipment, before realising that they had in fact lost 5 hours during the night. Then, to make matters worse, hikers seen earlier by the quad are found dead on Coffin Rock in good old Stickman Pentagram fashion and strange Wiccan Alphabet symbols are etching themselves onto their skin.That is the overall premise of BW2. Mixed with interviews with police, townspeople, flashes of strange rituals and murders and the occasional dead child waddling around, a certain creep factor begins to appear, but not nearly as much as it's predecessor.Overall, BW2 had it's own sort of appeal. If you just wanted a strange movie with a fun witch back-story then it'd do, but as a follow up to an actual \"scary\" movie with a more creepy sub-text then it sadly falters.The actors are great, with the occasional worried look and shocked appearance during trippy murder visions. Burkettsville is looking as spooky as ever, though a Mill is the new scene of madness for this outing.The Blair Witch Mythology, created for the first movie, kinda takes a back-step in this film. Sure, there's the whole blame the witch possession aspect, but no actual explanation of what happened to Rustin Parr's house since the last film. The whole Coffin Rock past murder things. The disappearance of Heather and Co. in the last movie. Or even the Blair Witch herself, though the facing the corner Rustin Parr murder style thing is seen for a brief moment.The absence of the mythology and the sort of twist that the ending takes leads viewers to believe, rather reluctantly, that the apparent 3rd movie will consist of five students going to the Mill to find out what happened to the students in the 2nd film, who in turn were just trying to find out what happened to the three students in the first film and so on and so forth for another 59 sequels...Hopefully the guys take the first BW approach and just send people out and chase them around shouting Oooga Booga for the 3rd one Prequel thing.The point of all my rambling simply comes down to Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows being a great movie in it's own right. Creepy, strange and thought provoking. But, it doesn't quite make it as a sequel to the original Blair Witch as it misses the essence of its predecessor.Go see it just to see what everyone is complaining about and get your own opinion of it. That way, you'll enjoy the 3rd one and consequently the 1st one more next you view it. And oh yes, Take your Nan!",

Strange things appear on thevideo images, and soon before the characters' eyes, and paranoiabegins to seize the group. The questions soon become: Has awitchy presence followed them back, or has their own BlairWitch-mania taken over their psyches? And how much of what wethe audience are watching can we trust as real? Intriguing questions, but their effect is undercut by a numberof factors. For one, the characters, as both written andperformed, don't engender sufficient sympathy to get us caughtup in their plight.

If they were right, I join in the bash-fest. If I disagree, I post my opinion for anyone that cares to read it. So here we go.I thought it was pretty good.Hold up, let me tell you why. I'm not saying that it was excellent by any means. Some of the acting was horrible. There were certain scenes that should have been omitted completely. All in all, as a sequel to the first movie (which I really liked), it can't even be put into the same category because they use two completely different ideas. Yes, the movie is \"Hollywooded\" up in more ways than one, and it ruins a few areas of the movie in the translation.But gang, it could have been a lot worse.Aside from three of the five campers/housemates whose acting talent ranged from mediocre to just awful, I thought that both Jeff Donovan and Kim Director played their roles very well. I found that the movie outright avoided a lot of clich\u00e9s that would have ruined it completely, overdone elements seen in 95% of teen horror flicks today. No killer is alive when they're thought to be dead, no one trips on every object in range when trying to make an escape, there's no danger of the \"be right back\" curse. The plot point of the group all being fans of the first movie worked, I especially enjoyed the part featuring townsfolk that were either fed up with visitors (there is no G*****N BLAIR WITCH) or all set to cash in on a money-making scheme.  The innovative beauty of the first movie came from not knowing what surrounded the campers, but the second one offers a completely different removal of insight. I did not see the ending coming. I thought that it was, in itself, pretty clever.Probably the biggest problem that I had with BW2 was that it wasn't scary. You expect a lot of suspense to lead up to a violent climax, but there isn't any. I would BARELY call this a horror movie. There are a few scenes that warrant an R rating (aside from the language), but they're mostly cut shots that contain imagery that has been far more disturbing in other films. Where the first movie creeped me out, this one did not perform nearly as well.So yeah, it could have been better. They had a lot of options with this movie and made a few wrong choices, but I felt that I was left with a film that held up well enough in certain areas to warrant it being good enough to watch and not wish that I'd sneaked in the emergency exit door. I give it a 6/10.",

Well, cut yourself a piece of Book Of Shadows pie, because this is a terrible, terrible movie.I don't know where to begin, so ill just talk at random about the sheer wretchedness of it all. (Warning, some plot revealers here!)The opening credits are done to the music of a new Marilyn Manson song, that sounds a lot like beautiful people, one of his other singles.  Nothing wrong with the song, but it should have a proper place at least!  The camera flies over the top of the forest and the names of people involved with this monstrosity are named.  Every 15 seconds or so, a very brief clip of someone being brutally slaughtered pops up.  Then back to trees again.  All the while, even during the whole death thing, and upbeat metal song blares. Where the hell is the creepy composed music?!? If the intent was to shock viewers, use some slightly mood enhancing music here!-The drinking scene.  Ok, this is sad and pathetic.  Here we see for about 5-10 minutes, people getting drunk, high, and talking about their upbringings.  This is very boring.  The dialog is lame, and very hopefully came up with on the spot.  There's not much I can say that will describe why this scene is bad, other than the useless, useless blather that the characters seem to feel like talking about, like what Wicca people are really about, whether the witch is real, etc, etc, etc.-Stereotypes.  Ok, there are lots of crazy stereotypes here, and they all remind me of how bad this film is. -The Cajun sheriff, a big guy who says a lot of dukes of hazzard style lines: \"Listen to me you little punk\", \"ill git you!\", \"Don't make break this door down!\" etc. -The Wicca girl.  \"I'm a child of the earth!\".  She always acts so peaceful, close to nature, and so completely engrossed in the beauty of the natural world.  Performing spells must be great fun for her, since she seems to do them so darn often. -The Goth girl.  Dressed as a Goth, anyone can gain a sixth sense!  Because of her dark looking ways, for some reason she has the ability to know certain things without knowing why, and gets upset when she is asked about it.  She guesses the locations of certain things, facts about people's pasts, and knowledge of things to come. \"How did you know the tapes were there?\" \"I don't know, just shut up and leave me alone!\".  Also, she seems to need to be constantly drunk and high, again showing that goths are really just interested in the hedonistic lifestyle (I don't think this way.)What else?  Oh, I could go on for days.  There's the whole ghost girl issue. Some girl keeps popping up in everyone's vision.  Now, the director COULD have made the scenes with this randomly appearing girl really scary with subliminal effects like in the exorcist, but instead he has to show her walking away, backwards, with extremely jerky 70's style stop motion animation.  Just what the hell was he thinking?Then there's the stupid ideas that are meant to creep you out, but fall flat a mile short.  There's a huge tree growing out of the remains of the old rustin parr house where the kids are murdered.  The camera guy wants to know how an old tree could be growing there, because who would want a giant tree in their living room?  Then later on, on videotape, the tree is just a small sappling.  Oooh, scareeeyy!  Then there's the great amounts of things being there one moment, then not being there the next.  We have a broken bridge, then we have a repaired bridge.  We have an owl on a branch, then we have just a branch.  We have barking dogs, then no barking dogs.Then there's the unexplained plots.  Why does every character see something other than what's really happening?  Why is everyone involved in a big orgy that they don't know about?  Why can't cameras capture dancing naked women at normal speed?  Why the hell is it even mentioned that one of the characters used to be a psycho?  Why? Why? Why?!?  Simply because the script is bad.I think I've bashed this film enough. I feel pity for BWP1's creators for being associated with this heap of flaming crud.

They tried to tie the sequel into the first movie, but the only thing it had in common with it was the title and some references. Of course, it was a way different movie. They tried to capture some of the feel of the first movie by writing the use of cameras by the cast themselves into the plot, and they also let the actors use their real names just like in the first movie... But the magic just wasn't there. People who hated the first movie will probably like this one better. It's got more of the elements that make a modern horror film: Lots of spooky music, special effect ghosts, nude scenes, a much more laid out that was explained much better, a much more tidy ending than the first movie. The film leaves question marks, but that's just because there's holes in the plot. The movie flows fast enough that you don't really have too much time to worry about the holes though. Still, in my mind it was an above average modern horror film (when taken from the perspective of what else is being released now-a-days) that had a few good jumps and chills.",

            "content": "(WARNING:  REVIEW GIVES AWAY ENDING!!!!)Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2 is much darker and psychological than it's predecessor, BW2 far surpasses the original.  I will not deny, TBWP was a great film, it was orginal and horrifying, but the \"documentary style\" somewhat detracted from the movie.  The only part that really left me feeling a knot in the pitt of my stomach was the ending.  In BW2, however, during the entire film you felt the dark and ominous sense of being in the Black Hills surronding Burkittsville.  The story starts off with Jeffery Patterson, a home town resident of Burkittsville starting his own tour company \"The Blair Witch Hunt\".  This draws a goth chick, a wicca chick and a couple who are writing a book to sign on for it's inaugural tour.  Their first night they camp out in the ruins of Rustin Parr (See BW1) house.  They have a late night drinking binge and wake up that morning with no recollection of what happened during the middle of the night.  They go to Jeffery's house (really an old warehouse in the Black Hills) to review the tapes.  They later receive a call from the sheriff asking if they knew what happened to the other tour group \"The Blair Witch Walk\" which they met the night before.  They review the tapes and two of the characters die, they watch the tapes and see them perform some satanic-orgy ritual and go and kill the competing tour group and places them on Coffin Rock (See BW1)  The characters are arrested and the movie ends.  It leaves blank the question of the idea of \"mass-delusion\" or were they actually possesed by Elly Kedward, the Blair Witch.   The writing was pretty good, but the suporting actors'(all except Jeffery, who did a great part) dialogue seemed fake. Comparing the video-taped blackout scene reminded me of the fate of the original crew in Event Horizon.  Jeffery Patterson was really the only good actor in the movie.  The disturbing shots of the procedures Jefferey went through in the mental hospital and the townspeople \"acknowledgement\" that he was a troubled youth only adds to the sympathy when what really happened that night is finally revealed.  This movie is definitely worth the money to see it, and will probably make a great DVD.  Overall, Book of Shadows: BW2 was a great movie, though some will criticise it due to goriness, and will remain one of the great horror series in history.",

Anyway, unlike most people over here, I really liked Blair Witch, but sadly, this time I came out thinking that Book of Shadows is a really, really bad film. The acting was, for the most part, dire; and the direction poor -I won't give anything away, but towards the end we see video footage of the cast fooling around, being filmed with a hand-held camera... except all the cast are all in front of the camera, yet someone's holding it... oh yeah! The director forgot what he's supposed to doing! I do like the whole plot of the film, though: it's a clever twist on the first film and the plot twist at the end was good too, but the script was just awful. The dialogue was simply appalling at time, and things that are supposed to be scary and/or make you jump, just don't. It quickly went beyond bad, to just plain funny.Rather than reports of people being really shaken up by this film, many of the reviews I've read over here talk about people laughing through it. From my experience of this film, there were maybe two deliberate jokes, but myself, and everyone else in my screening laughed a hell of a lot more than that.As my friend said \"That's got to be the worst film that I've seen this year\". I think he's right. If I were you, I'd do the same as me: go and watch 'Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein\" it's a lot scarier, but not as funny.",

I will say that there were a few scenes, especially the end, that were gripping but as a whole a poor film. See Altered, Sanchez's new film for a good low budget horror film. BW2 may not be scary, but it has some very interesting ideas and most importantly, never bores. All the acting, while not necessarily Oscar caliber, is competent and moves us through the \"adventures\" of the characters. Don't listen to the other reviewers, this one is a winner.

But, you have to give the movie credit where credit is due. It created excitement. It got people into the theater. It was scary, without special effects and a big budget, relying solely on acting, atmosphere and peoples different perceptions of what they saw. It relied on exploiting our primal fears, fear of the dark, fear of being lost, fear of strange noises in the night, the fear of what's on the other side of that door. Blair Witch 2 seems to delibrately take every single thing that worked about the original and destroy it. I have never seen a movie so wrong headed, some ambitious in it's stupidity as this one in my life. First, the gore. I have absolutely no problem with gore and blood in a movie at all. However, it must serve a purpose because gore and blood itself is not interesting or scary. In this film, we have shock cuts of knives being twisted into somebody's stomach with blood spurting out peppered through the movie with no rhyme or reason. They are just there, presumably to scare us or disgust us, but it creates no impact whatsoever. It's there just for the sake of being there, just because this is a horror movie, so we should expect to see some blood and guts. Next, we have the characters. In the original, some people might have found the characters annoying, especially Heather. However, their emotions were real, and in the end Heather regained her sympathy with her breakdown on tape. Here, the characters are all one-note, defined in the broadest way. No personalites, just chliches. The goth girl. The Wiccan girl. The angry jerk. And the two \"normal\" people. Perhaps I should revise that and call them all angry jerks, since that's the way they act. I felt no sympathy for them, and could care less about if they lived or died, or what happens to them in the end. All their dialogue is cliched and consists of cursing at each other, none of it with conviction or any real feeling at all. Even if you didn't like Heather in the original, you still were interested in here character and wanted to see what happened to her in the end. Not so here. The plot is an absolute mess. It seems as if the point of the movie is that somehow, the events of the first movie became were actually real, that movie became reality. But the script doesn't follow this angle and instead has the characters accusing each other of causing the events, when it's obvious even to an idiot that what happened is supernatural. This movie reminds me a lot of what happened with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. The orignal Chainsaw was terrifying, relying more on what the audience thought they saw than what they actually did, and by convincing preformances. When Sally is carried away at the end of the movie, gibbering incoherently, it feels real. Chainsaw 2 did the exact same things wrong as Blair Witch 2. It seems like it was the same producer who made both of them. I can hear him now: \"You know, I liked the first one, but we've got to go further for the second. You more blood, more guts, more t**s and a**.\"",

But both of these films were great B-Movie's in there own right. If you walked into this movie expecting to see a straight forward scare film like The Haunting, you would be sadly disappointed.  The film, does leave you guessing as to what really went on, like the original.  I came out of the film wondering whether the group really saw what they did, or whether the video footage they recorded was telling the truth and they merely mass-hallucinated which made them believe they did not commit any crimes. Sure, some of the acting is over dramatized and some of the lines are really corny, but if you are a fan of B-Movie horror flicks, you will consider this one of the best.  And I'm sure the title 'Book of shadows' is a reference to the book two of the characters are writing about the events in the first film, but it seems other reviewers have failed to see this link.

Hell, in the first one \"what happened to that tree bridge\" didn't even work, but it comes back in this film both as a tree and as a bridge two seperate times.\nThe only thing that this film has that was the least bit original or interesting was its postmodern twist. It was a cool idea to use the sequel to sort of critique the buzz around the first film, but clearly it is relying on that same buzz to try to get this film in an pleasing place in the minds of the viewers.The shameful thing of the film is that while obviously they were aware that not showing any graphic scenes wouldn't work in this one's narrative format as it did in the first one, the scenes of gore and violence and such that they included were not horrifying, or disturbing or creepy. They were just outright silly. A horribly fake animatronic owl staring at our characters. A knife puncturing what is obviously not a person and fake watery blood flowing out that would have been more at home in a Troma film. Children wearing bad makeup and walking backwards.

Plus on top of that, most of the scenes of graphic imagery are not motivated by any characters background or psyche even though, they want us to believe that the Witch is messing with their minds. A stupid looking electric chair victim, a sex scene with clawing that goes to deep, these images do not in anyway connect back to the characters, they are just randomly thrown in, and if you are going to throw random stuff, at least make it good eye candy (see:\"The Cell\").On top of THAT, there are things in the movie that either don't make sense in the film's world or don't pay off inside the world of the film. The two things that don't pay off the most are the Wiccan (a horrible stereotype even though she says she hates stereotypes) lying about her past, and the file folders that the Goth girl finds. Each of these plot points never pay off and never lend themselves to the story or characters in any way.\nOn top of THAT, the film claims that it is a recreation of events that happened after the first film came out. Why then do all of the characters have the same names as the actors that played them in BW2? Oh, they said the names had been changed, but why would they be changed to be the actors names when the \"real life\" people would have been all over the news as seen at the end of the film? In fact why say that it was real at all when in the press kits and interviews they don't even pretend for a moment?I also loved that because of the fact that they couldn't actually shoot in Burkittsville and they had to film elsewhere, the director Joe Berlinger thought that they had to plaster everything with the town's name. Hell, most of the first film was not in the town, they didn't feel that need. But in this film there is the Burkittsville blah blah church, the Burkittsville Cemetary, Burkittsville Police, Black Hills Gas, all obviously fake signs as bad as the box of generic fried chicken in the fridge (I thought they didnt label things just \"FRIED CHICKEN\" anymore outside of TV movies - here's a thought why not Burkittsville's Best Fried Chicken? or Black Hills Chicken Hut, or the best BW3's?)I respected Joe Berlinger's work before and he said in Entertainment Weekly that he took this job because he was banging his head on the Hollywood wall and this was his chance in. Sometimes what you choose not to do is important as what you do. And does anybody else think that maybe Artisan approached Joe Berlinger because they though he might be able to make a good faux documentary? Anyways, now I think Paradise Lost and Brother's Keeper were cool because of Bruce Sinofsky and Joe Berlinger should have waited for something else to try to cut his teeth on.In short the Blair Witch 2 doesnt function well as either a sequel, stand alone, or horror film in general and just plain isnt scary. Those positive comments on this page have got to be studio moles as every single person in the preview screening I was at was doing nothing but snorting and snickering from the very beginning. But the movie will probably make money cause people will probably just go see it because its the sequel or its Halloween. They should save their money and go see the rerelease of The Exorcist instead.",

I believe the bad reviews are from the fact that a part 2 can never be made because of BWP's original concept(among other things). I do agree though that a sequel should have never been thought of in the first place, yet the blockbuster movie rule is that it should become a franchise and predecessors will follow the first hit film. Ok on to why it's not a part 2. The story begins with the aftermath of the Blair Witch Project. Cops chasing curious fans out of Burkitsville and locals take advantage of the phenomenon and start businesses. Also it looks at how maybe or maybe not the \"Blair Witch\" screwed with a couple of BWP fans' heads into killing each other. Now on to the bad stuff. It seems as if the writers were rushed into making the script of this film. The lines at times were just plain annoying. The b-movie acting didn't really help either. The thing that really ticks me off though is near the end of the movie is when the quality acting starts. What happend to those acting skills the first 45 minutes of the film?Overall, a good matinee film or when it comes out on video, a good rental. Don't let the bad reviews fool you.

Book of Shadows is, quite frankly, laughable. Where the first film thrived on having amateur actors and no script, this sequel suffers terribly from sub-amateur actors and an all-too-obvious script posing as improvisation. The plot (if indeed, there is one) is ridiculous, with only the first three minutes providing anything of interest at all (it parodies the media circus surrounding the first film). Somebody decided to edit this to create a non-linear narrative, perhaps to hide or excuse the fact that NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE!!! Even the actors are heard to utter; \"This makes no sense\" and \"I have no idea what's going on\"...and they are absolutely right, as the audience are saying the same things.From the horrendous continuity errors (check out the goth girl's white make up - it appears and disappears at will) to the laughable editing (one dialogue scene between two characters tries to splice two takes of the same shot together in between lines, presumably to cut out some terrible acting, and it is the most obviously poor edit in any film, ever...and I have seen Cradle of Fear), there is not ONE REDEEMABLE FEATURE that could leave you feeling anything other than cheated.The characters are, and I am complimenting them here, completely one-dimensional, the direction and cinematography are awful (not one decent angle. NOT ONE), and the climax is simply ridiculous. When the surviving characters are arrested and taken to the police station, their dv cameras and security cameras tapes are confiscated and played back to them...but some admin assistant at the police station must have fancied themselves as a movie editor as the tapes are played back as one, previously cut together collage of all the tapes!!!!What?!?!?!?!?! The 'scare' scenes of a Ringu-style girl walking backwards through the forest and disappearing are in there just for the hell of it.Oh yeah, and there is a disappearing and reappearing tree that spooks the characters at several points. Eek. NOTHINGMAKESANYSENSE!!!!!! If you enjoy mickey-taking and paying out ridiculously poor films, this is one for you. You'll have more ammunition than you know what to do with.If, however, you're a fan of the original, or a fan of movie-making in general, DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE.I guarantee that every time you watch this movie, a little piece of you will die.Shame on you, Berlinger, shame on you.",

Visually there are links from BW2 to the first film: close ups of female faces distended by unfocused camera lenses, 'found' footage on video, fake interviews with Burkitsville townfolk, but it is in the differences that BW2 strides ahead of its forerunner. Director Joe Berlinger has crafted a supremely intelligent film that both debunks and reinforces the Blair Witch mythos, ably assisted by an excellent cast of unknown actors.

            "content": "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch Project 2 \u00bd starWhat a sad and uninspired film has been made in an attempt to capitilze on the success of last year's excellent and original Blair Witch Project.What perhaps is most disappointing about this film is that it had such potential. The first 35 minutes are good. The set-up provided in that time period with these exact same characters could have been used to make a great horror film by simply following the rules of the genre. Instead this film strays from those rules but doesn't break any ground it just retreads poorly what occurred in the first film with a twist that basically just cheats the audience.The story starts by telling us the first film was indeed a fictional film but the town in it is real. It then shows how that film impacted the town, taking place about 5 months after the first film's release. One resident, Jeff, who had been in an insane asylum a year earlier creates a tour that goes into the woods to look for the witch and the legend discussed in the first film. For his initial tour he gets four young adults, Stephen and Tristen a couple writing a book on the mythology of the Blair Witch and the hysteria effect caused by the film. He is a man of reason who does not believe in mythology, she feels that there is always a factual basis to any myth. She is also six weeks pregnant. The other tour goers are Erica who is a Wiccan that wants to commune with the spirit of the Blair Witch, and Kim a Goth with psychic powers that is going simply because she thought the movie was cool.The tour group goes to the remains of the Blair Witch's house where they discover a mysterious tree. The Wiccan casts a pair of spells one to undo the evil at the sight, and one to awaken the Blair Witch's spirit. The group sets up some cameras provided by the tour guide and then engages in liberal drug and alcohol use around the campfire as they try to stay up all night. They have brief run-in with another tour group whom they convince to set-up camp at Coffin Rock where the witch committed her murders in the 1800's (as revealed in the first film).The group then collectively blacks out and when they awaken it is raining paper and all of their equipment has been destroyed. They soon find their videotapes in the exact place where the tapes of the first film were supposedly found. At first they suspect the other tour group of sabotaging their equipment but when they find out the next day the other tour group was murdered they don't know what to think.And then the film falls apart. The group goes to the home of the tour guide, which conveniently is an abandoned factory with a shaky metal bridge over a ravine providing the only way in or out. The factory also happens to be located on the Black Hills outside of town which are haunted by the witch. But that alone wouldn't have sank the movie. While we would have been in familiar territory (I'm sure you can guess what happens to that bridge) the elements were in place for a good film. The characters begin watching the tapes to try put together the lost time. The psychic and the Wicca both sense an evil presence among them.But the film is all build and no delivery and it requires the characters to have the intelligence of chipmunks. Before the characters set up house in the factory they have to go to the hospital due to a medical emergency. Later in the factory they notice they all have strange markings carved onto their body. You think they would be alarmed. But the two men both argue that it must be poison oak. It has to be one of the most laughably inane scenes in film history. The one character lives in the woods; he doesn't poison oak looks like? The other characters are writing a book on witchcraft or in the case of Erica is a witch herself. Earlier scenes in the film show them deciphering these same types of symbols. Yet they don't recognize them. Not to mention the symbols are obviously scar tissue from like a knife or something, even if they were so dumb as to think the symbols were coincidental why would think it was poison oak? Have they ever scene leaves that are so thin they can draw straight lines? And since they were in the hospital earlier anyway wouldn't they ask doctor to look at these symbols? Later in the film Erica does read the symbols and tells a character she's next to die. Yet that character does not die next meaning either Erica isn't a very well educated witch or the screenwriter failed foreshadowing in film school.This film is basically a one scare film. Characters will see something supernatural, the audience jumps and the character blinks and your back to where you were 10 seconds ago the image was a hallucination. The film plays this trick at least 30 times, no exaggeration, probably because it was too devoid of original thought to do anything else. The gore quotient is also up quite unnecessarily more than in the first film yet again probably because the director had no other way to manufacture scares. SPOILER ALERT The film has other problems, which I can only reveal by discussing specific plot points so feel free to skip this paragraph if you don't like minor spoilers. Much of the character's traits mean nothing. Kim's psychic powers end up having no bearing on the plot at all other than them finding the tapes which could have been done in a dozen other ways. Jeff's insanity again means nothing unless the viewer wants to interpret the ending of the film that he is still insane, the other characters never find out about it to cause dissension among them, it's just a tool to fill time for some pointless flashbacks. Halfway through the film we see the sheriff interviewing certain characters about the events basically letting us know who survives and doesn't before the film ends, yet once everything that happened in the woods and the factory is revealed the film just ends. Again couldn't we have seen them get arrested afterwards for all the difference it made? The jumps in time are more jarring then suspenseful throughout the film and since nothing happens after them at least the ending would have had more of an impact without them.Even the title cheats the viewer. There is no Book of Shadows in this film. Video tapes of shadows perhaps but not a book. The characters never find a book belonging to the witch. None of the characters own a book or read a book in the course of the film. And the two characters writing a book intend to title it \"The Blair Witch: History or Hysteria?\"Still other problems include the nonsensical way the filmmaker's decide Erica's take the evil spell back worked. Even the motivations of the witch make no sense considering the alternatives that are foreshadowed in the first 35 minutes. Then to top it all off the film provides a chronology of the witch's life in direct conflict with facts provided in the earlier film that based on other events in this film would also have to be true.Ultimately the film leaves the viewer letdown. It doesn't payoff, there are no scares, it is unnecessarily violent and most of the plot twists are pointless and/or disappointing. If it didn't have such a good set-up and character development in the early portion it wouldn't even get the half star I gave it.",

That is, they at least seemed like real people; not just actors.  Sure, they were a bit over the top in some scenes; but who wouldn't be in that situation - if it were *real*?  Maybe it was just the fact that it looked \"real\" (more so than the sequel, to be sure) but it did creep me out a bit more than I expected it to; knowing it was \"fake\".On to BW2, which - as we know - isn't a sequel, but a followup to the first. I just didn't care about anybody in this movie.  I was surprised that they actually portrayed a believable (if not completely accurate) Wiccan, but even that character failed to arouse my empathy.  The goth girl was gorgeous, but just a bit too apathetic.  All of the goths I've ever met are far more passionate (and interesting) than Kim.  The two guys were just slightly less retarded than your average drunken frat boy; and the scariest one wasn't the \"crazy\" one.  The \"pregnant girl\" (yes, I remember her name was Tristen, but does it even matter that she had a name?) was actually the most disturbing and least believable one of the lot.  I would have pushed her, too.Also, the early scenes from the \"mental institution\" disturbed me more than I think they were meant to; and in the wrong way.  It wasn't the hose in the nose or the goo dripping from his mouth that bothered me, rather the blatant disregard for another human being's dignity and physical comfort.  Why exactly was the \"doctor\" smoking while performing some sort of unnecessary \"procedure\" on little Jeff?  At least in \"Jacob's Ladder\", the hospital from hell had a purpose, as well as an explanation.There's more to say, of course; but I only have 1,000 words and I'd just end up venting and rambling about why a film  with a decent premise and real potential was mutated into this.  I read somewhere that they rushed to release it for all the college kids and fans of the genre (and the first movie).  I'd buy that.  Too bad, BW2 could have been really spooky-ooky.As for a reccomendation: see it for yourself.  I can't tell you whether or not you'll like it; but at least you'll be able to make up your own mind. There's nothing worse than not thinking for yourself.PS.  Every story has a moral: Don't have a drunken orgy in haunted woods unless you have lots of high-tech film equipment.  Oh, and things going backwards are much more interesting than things going forwards.  But that's not really a moral, now is it?",

This sequel however, is a completely different beast. It is impossible to examine this film without reference to its predecessor and I've got to say that Book of Shadows is everything the original was not. Where the first film successfully utilised the power of persuasion, documentary realism and naturalistic performances for its overall effect, this movie is wholly reliant on big budget horror movie stylistics and slick special effects. To be fair to Berlinger, the imagery is generally good and occasionally disturbing. The film is visually striking and edited extremely well. Where it is badly let down however, is through a combination of poor acting and a truly woeful script. The genuine fear and tension that the original cast created is lost and replaced with cliched, over stated performances and some unbelievably dreadful dialogue (\"She's a witch man...a big p***ed off witch\"...pleeease). Its a shame too, because there are obviously some interesting themes and ideas being addressed. The basic premiss of the film which deals with the hype surrounding the Blair Witch phenomenon is a clever one, and the concept of group hysteria which lies at the heart of the story line has much potential. It could have been so much better if the overall execution was vastly improved. The film has the aesthetic qualities of a decent horror movie.

But believe they are equally as good, for their own reasons.There is so much about the film, which is deep than most people seem to miss.  Everyone comes out of the cinema thinking they have understood it, but the only reason is that they expect to be told everything from start to end.  Sometime people, you have to open your mind and use your brain, then you may find there is so much more to the film than you first thought.If you don't believe me, see it again.  I've seen it 3 times now and each time is a new experience.Don't be persuaded by people to see or not see the film.  Make up your own mind.  If you go and see it because someone has said it is really good, you will expect too much.  If you don't go and see it because someone has told you it is bad, you may be missing out on a very enjoyable experience.What is your definition of a Scary Movie?",

            "content": "There are some horror films that use gore, blood and violence in ways that are detrimental to a film (like the Friday the 13th sequels). To hear critics and audiences speak of Book of Shadows, you believe it is a horrifically gory film. This is not the case at all. Yes, there is blood and some gore, but what is shown is more shocking than horrific. It hearkens back to The Silence of the Lambs, in which any supposedly gory scene was shown only to shock, not appall. I certainly don't consider it as classic as Lambs, but Book of Shadows does, in essence, achieve the same goal: to shock you, to make you think, but not disturb you to vomit or have nightmares.The story revolves some several months after the Blair Witch Project opens. Some fans decide to go on a trip with a former nut-house patient named Jeff, who is suppose to be sane, who has started a tour group of Blair Witch spots. The people joining include a skeptic, Steven, his less skeptical wife,Tristen, a woman who claims to be a witch,Erica and a goth girl, Kim. On the tour, they meet a competing group. After a short argument, both teams separate from each other. As Jeff's group enjoy themselves on the first night, they wake up in the morning and don't remember anything of the previous night.They decide to investigate and find answers, but what they find is far from what they expected. The journey is shocking and fun to watch. You think you know what's coming, then are floored when something worse happens. This film really captures what a good psychological horror film is about: to shock us into thought. On all levels, this film delivers what it promised. It is a shocking, amazing, thought-provoking piece of cinema. I loved it.",

I feel the writers/director did an incredible job of reinventing something that was thought to be unsurpassable.  I feel Book of Shadows, in it's own right, blows away the first Blair Witch Project. Don't get me wrong....the first flick was unique, fun, entertaining and worthy all on it's own.....but, Blair Witch 2 can compete with the heavy-hitter horror movies.  The biggest challenge that the makers of BW2 were faced with was creating something that didn't replicate nor take away from the first movie. I think they couldn't have done a better job.  So, judge for yourself....go see BW2.  I believe you will not be disappointed.  BUT - just for the record, I believe that the R Rating isn't restrictive enough here.  I feel NO ONE under the age of 17 should see this movie.  It's quite graphic and twisted. :)  Enjoy!",

            "content": "I haven't sifted through the other comments so I'm limiting my comment to my own take on the film and a response to the primary post featured on the main page titled \"Book of Shadows is technically the follow up to the 1999snoozefest, \"The Blair Witch\" -- First, a defense of the original; the initial comment states: \"If you were frightened by the original BWP, it was because of the mystique, not because of what you saw in the film.\" On the contrary, I had been out of the loop on all the pre-movie hype and reality controversy and walked into the theatre expecting crap (as the few reviews I had read said it was) but wanting to see what the buzz was about as I was a screenwriting student at the time. What I got was exactly what was missing in most horror movies of the modern age, and that is the basic hypothosis (so often overlooked) that true horror, true terror, is achieved through IMPLICATION not through overt or cheap fright techniques. I might jump the first, or even every time some teenslasher comes out from behind the door, but the fright then subsides during the experience of the film, and by no means do I cary it out of the theater with me. But a film like \"Jacob's Ladder\" or \"The Exorcist\" that uses a lot of shadows and implications to sustain the fear levels, this creates a constant feeling of dread (part of the true definition of a horror story) that not only sustains throughout the film, but stays with me out of the theatre. The first Blair Witch achieved this because I was able to suspend my disbelief due to the realistic docu-video qualities of it. It was real and unreal. Was it deliverence locals or a real witch? Either way they disappeared and were most likely murdered (within the fiction of the film). This has absolutely nothing to do with the pre film hype or \"mystique\" (which I experienced very little of) as the original post claims, it has everything to do with what I saw in the film itself. And as for \"technical expertise\" the poster is obviously biased towards non-experimental non-arthouse film and is basing his ideal of technique on big budget hollywood films. I thought the technique was refreshing, new, exciting, and fit ideas I and others likeminded have had for films for a long time. I didn't snooze during the first, I was scared to death. -- Now, as for the sequal. It is a true sequal, it follows the first, it has the same subject, and the fact that they refer to the first as a film does not alter the fact that this fits the definition of a sequal. The Final Nightmare by Wes Craven was loosely based on fact and refered to all the other films as fiction, but it was still a sequal, and, next point, was still a \"horror\" film. -- What is the definition of a horror film? A film which maintains (or attempts to maintian) a constant feeling of dread and or fear and usually has an unhappy ending, and, most often deals with either the reality of or implication of the supernatural. Thus Final Nightamre and Blair Witch 2 (both similar in basic premise) are both truly horror movies. To say otherwise is rather absurd, epescially based on the meager support that the film refers to the original as fiction, or that it explores the ideas of what is real or not real (doesn't every horror movie you've ever seen explore that difference?) -- As for the film itself independant of the original and independant of my problems with the initial post; what is the main goal of any film? To entertain. Does this film entertain? I think it does. Therefore it has succeded in its primary goal. It maintains a good horror movie vibe, it messes with your head, it has wonderful atmosphere, good acting (above standard for the horror genre) and superb music. The screenplay is a bit messy (somewhat unfocused and in need of some redrafts) and the direction is a little sloppy, but it's above average in my book, I give this film a 6.5 out of 10 and I will definatley see it again. It is almost impossible to seperate discussion of the original when talking about the sequal, and in this case I don't think it should be. Yes, the film stands on its own, but at the same time it couldn't be in that upright and independant condition were it not for the support of it's mother. -- In a final word, I am all to aware that in this world people can base their opinions on what is \"popular\" or what is \"not\" even those who claim to be \"outsiders\" can allow their personal opinions to be guided by the masses just so they can feel superior by going against the norm. So when a film like Blair Witch, a low low budget indie horror movie that film buffs should be supporting with all their might, suddenly becomes a pop culture phenomenon the outsiders relish the chance to claim the film is pure crap and dismiss it without a fair trial. Sure there are many who honestly hated it, this is the way of the world, but I know from many conversations that what it boils down to is that people mostly hate Blair Witch because of it's popularity and its hype, not based on any really solid and crystalized criticism of the film itself. -- My two cents. . .",

Because of all the hype around the first film, any sequel is going to have a rough time of it, and many people will snub this movie because \"it can't possibly be any better than the first one\".  So if thats your attitude and you loved the first film, then best just stay at home and not disappoint yourself.  But for the rest of us free thinking open minded individuals, it may be worth taking a look see.  I have to admit that I was expecting this to be terrible, but I was shocked to find that it wasn't.  The acting is fine (no oscars here though), but the actual plot line and how it is tied to the first film is actually quite clever. It's all about expectation, this film is a not half bad teen shlocker in the \"final scream at the faculty last summer\" mould.

And, through it all, I could think only one thing:Either I was on drugs or the producers were. And I'm pretty sure it's not me. There is some seriously freaky junk going on in this movie, and I don't mean in a good way. It's freaky because it really seems sometimes like they shot a bunch of scenes and randomly put them together in any order. In Fight Club, Tyler Durden liked to splice pictures of porno into kiddie films. (Anyone remember?) It kinda feels like Tyler Durden is running the tape projector during this movie. Except it's dead bodies and naked dancing, instead of porn.I won't even get into the awful acting. Wait, Tristan was cool. (The pregnant girl)As for the ending, I admit, I liked the ending. It was freaky in the good kinda way, even if it does basically make the past 75 minutes completely pointless. Do I recommend suffering through 80 minutes or so of garbage just to get to the ending?

Which in my theory, confuses them, bringing their liking of the movie down. They probably spent half of the movie thinking  what is this? i don't know what will happen yet, that's different, and then the final question 'WHY'? well, in thinking this, it proves that they aren't paying attention to catch its edgy creativeness.

I went to see Blair Witch 2 tonight, wanting to get in the Halloween mood, while also knowing that if the movie turned out awful I wouldn't have to worry about wasting my money. For all of you out there that are going to have to pay, think about it before you buy a ticket for Blair Witch 2. The original film was a gutsy, clever idea. The sequel is just like any other sequel; a pathetic attempt to cash in twice on a unique phenomenon. The movie actually starts out promisingly enough. Humorous, dark, disturbing, and very deep in places. Then, the story quickly unravels into psycho-babble madness, with fake blood, bad acting, and a ridiculously obvious plot. The first movie was frightening because of its ambiguity, the questions it left unanswered, the stark, un-airbrushed view of horror it provided. It appealed to people with a strong sense of imagination. Blair Witch 2 is mostly brain candy. It is a frightening film, at least it tries very hard to be one, with all it's images of raving madness, dripping blood, and children's voices wafting on the wind. But we have seen this over and over again, in countless other horror films, and quite a few of those have managed to do a better job than the filmmakers of Blair Witch 2. Early on in the movie, a character remarks that people are most afraid of the unknown. The makers of this movie should have taken this piece of wisdom into account, instead of following in the great Hollywood tradition of crappy sequels, shattering the mystery they worked so hard to create.",

To be fair, it was no great marvel in film making, but it followed up \"Blair Witch...\" nicley.  Contrary to many on this page, I found the film pertinant, interesting, and well done.  The gore was not gratuitous, the acting was appropriate, and the story worked as a kind of spin off from the original.First off, the flashes of stabbings provided not only a horror aspect not present in \"BW1\", but also gave us a bit of misdirection, or forshadowing, depending on how close one may have been paying attention.  Personally I was trying to figure out which one of the 5 was getting mutilated.  If the directors wanted to make another B+W with college students running through the woods, they would have.  I felt that the different genre (more of a true horror film) provided another look at the story, and gave us a more intense look into the mind of the witch.For those of you who had a problem with the acting, this was no worse (and definately underplayed) than most B horror movies around.  Though it was not satiristic like \"Scream\" or \"Evil Dead\", it's actors were moderate in skill, but who can blame them.  The directors had to find no-name actors, who were willing to do this film.  How many Juliard trained thespians would agree to be in this, possably killing one's career.I felt that going from the different angle allowed this movie a different power than the first, though it didn't have the long term effect on my brain, it did make me jump when I watched it, where the first one didn't. It isn't as intelligent or creative, but if you went in expecting that, of course you'd be disappointed.",

They were however sadly funny because of the embarrassingly poor acting and writing.Yes it might have been interesting to see where it all led to in the end, but I couldn't, on principal, stay through to the end... because it wasn't worth my time.One line that struck me particularly funny, was how every few minutes one of the cast would utter \"what was that\" with a look on his or her face of sheer, utter, ...... blandness.FYI, one of the other movies I walked out on was this year's Invisible Man with Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue.  I admire both of these artists for their work in other roles, but the acting was just too embarrassing here as well... and I couldn't sit through it.Bottom line is, your time has to be worth something.

It continues on from the last movie...kind of and revisits many of the issues that were previously explored in BWP 1. However, the difference is, BW2 happens to prove a) Suspenseful b) Worth the money I put into see it and c)It says something about society and the mediatization of contemporary issues from everyday capitalism to the myths and legends which flavor society.It is intelligent and manages to create some background that will probably prove most important to any other movie that might be made.There are far too few open ended movies and in the allegorical world of the millenium and in the Motion Picture Arts especially, this movie manages to convey the essence of the direction that movies may be taking.As a horror movie, it is questionable, erroneous, and tacky.

To my surprise it was.  The whole feel of the movie was similar to the first one, but of course with higher budget and different writers/directors it was a lot different. But my biggest criticism of this movie, and the first one is that it just isn't scary.  The hype and peoples comments make the films out to be the most horrific thing since the Exorcist, but it just isn't true. A few spooky apparitions aside, it offers very little extra on the first movie. People go into forest to the same spots as the blair witch, some minor weird stuff happens, go back to guys place, a few more weird things happen with murders along the way with hallucinations in tow, and thats your basic movie. It offers very little tangible substance to the Blair Witch legend, but instead offers suspense in the form of the actors trying to piece together what is happening around them. It offers no jumps or shocks, very little horror, just slight suspense that you won't really think about at all after you have left the multiplex tucked up in bed afterwards. All in all, if you liked the first movie you will more then likely want to give this a watch, if only once.  If you didn't like the first film when Iwouldn't bother watching this one as it is much in the same vain. If you like horror, then go and watch the Exorcist, the Omen or Poltergeist, they are so much better and will leaving you thinking about it afterwards, which is what any good movie should do.",

The tense, cleverly shot, 'keep-you-guessing-til-the-end' plot of The Blair Witch Project. This has nothing appealing; the actors give nothing to the film and could have been played by any sub-standard thespian, the plot is ridiculous and the 'scary' parts? They're just not scary.

That's reality, and that's where Blair Witch 2 picks up. It's fantasy based on reality based on fantasy masked as reality. So there's this native Burkitsville guy who's sort of persona non grata there because he wants to cash in the movie by making all sorts of thingies from it like the little crosses and selling them over the internet. But things started to get really ugly when he set up the \"Blair Witch Hunt\", which was this tour he organized for people who wanted to visit the famous location. At first everything was party, but then strange things started to happen. This one night the group blacks out for hours and wakes up only to discover everything they had brought had been torn to pieces, except for the tapes which the goth girl found with her mind or something. They had no idea who did it so they went to the guy's cool place to have a look at those tapes. Guess what they see? Really freaky stuff. When the movie started I got the feeling that it was gonna suck because of all the gory scenes which led me into thinking it was gonna be everything the original wasn't like dumb and unimaginative. The first half hour leaves you without much to work with because there's nothing really new. You get to see 'real' reports on tv about the original Blair Witch movie and what it caused afterwards, and you get to meet the group of college kids that was getting set up to visit Burkitsville. Until this point I had no clue as to where the movie was gonna head to. I mean, was it gonna be actually Blair Witch 2, as in everything again? But some time further into the story the movie gets its own personality. It never tries to copy the original or even use the same techniques that made it a hit. Yet, the sequel manages to keep the very core intact: the horror works more on a psychological level. You never got to see a witch or anything in the original and there was where its most brilliant achievement was. Now, things haven't changed. The Blair Witch is still only in the viewer's mind. The way they made all this work without copying the original is really, really freaky. And their excellent idea worked beautifully because the movie has a creepy atmosphere and the acting is fairly good. The ending also lived up to the original. It left a lot of questions without answers, giving the audience a chance to use their brain and give the story closure. Overall, a great sequel that anyone with a taste for the unusual and an IQ slightly above average should enjoy.",

On the journey are four people: the writer, his wife, another women that's a Wicken (i.e. a good witch), a psychic Goth chick (cue the cheesy-beyond-words bit when she's walking with the wife of the writer and asks \"When's the Baby due?\" and the other women's like \"How did you know?\" so she says, after a moment of silence with a slow moving close up, \"I just know\") and finally there's the \"There for comedic value\" driver guy that spends the whole film permentally stoned.Added in with this are some weird and somewhat random \"scary\" shots of people dying in a forest every now and again, and the anally stupid plot line of them waking up in the morning with a \"gap\" of a few hours that none of them can remember from the night before (which is a stupid plot thread when you consider that they were drinking and smoking around the camp fire the night before so no-wonder they can't remember anything...). Then there's the clich\u00e9d to death part with the main character taking the people back to his house which just so happens to be an old warehouse from the 1840's that's located in the middle of the forest with loads of security camera's and a walkway that you just know is going to end up getting destroyed at some point.Other notable parts are the acting which begs the question of what the director told the actors to do, motivation wise, seeing as they have different expressions during the same supposedly scary scene (i.e. scared, bewildered, stoned, lost, confused, constipated). Then there's the crap sub-plots like the writers wife losing the baby (which she recovers from when the stoned guy gives her a free Blair Witch baseball cap), and the un-human like reactions of the characters (like the bit when the writer and Wicken are sitting at the table and suddenly end up ripping each other clothes off, then suddenly go back to the table staring at each other and just shrug it off. Like where's the \"What the hell happened then? conversation that any normal person would ask).Add a pants-beyond-words ending which leaves you thinking more alone the lines of \"Is that IT!?\" as opposed to \"What the Hell happened there?\" and the general dialogue that barley reaches the levels of the Sun's readership with such engrossing conversations of:\"Cool, I'll get the drinks\"\"Thanks\"\"Ok\"\"Good\"There are dozens of plot threads that are not even remotely cleared up, most notably the one with the main character having been in a psychiatric ward, and the whole film just reeks of a flashy, over done and inconsistent cash-in. Any hopes of a franchise are wasted with this film, which is probably just as well seeing considering the downhill spiral that horror franchises seem to have (Hellraiser anyone?).",

At the end I was scared stiff and had goose bumps all over my body. When I went to bed I was still scared. Weeks later I was still scared of what might be behind the next corner. BOS, however did none of these things. Sure, at the end, when we find out that we are seeing things as the three surviving campers saw them and not what the cameras were actually seeing, I had a few goose bumps, but they quickly went away and I had a very peaceful sleep that night.I will agree that BOS was more visually appealing than BWP, but it doesn't compare on the frightening scale.",

            "content": "This movie is not getting a fair shake, as is the case with many sequels that must live up to their predecessor. Blair Witch was such a monumental success and such a unique film that this sequel was destined for doom before it was even conceived. Having seen it now I can say that a) I expected it to be aweful and b) I was pleasantly surprised. I can start by saying it would have been too easy to make a similar film in style so credit to the director in that this movie is TOTALLY different from the first film. It is well shot (visually), with some cool effects and a pumping soundtrack. I loved the 1st film but must admit that the phenomena was the most intriguing thing about the film and given that fact the second film does well to pick fun at that and progress a story based on the phenomena. Integrating the 1st film into the second film allows the second one to seem fresh yet at the same time continuing the phenomena.  Regarding the story, on the surface it is thin however I think this one requires some additional thought and possibly some additional viewing. This is not a film about a witch, this is a film about paranoia and the mass hysteria that can be created when people are put into outrageous circumstances, while believing in something that may not actually BE real. I do not want to give away too much of the plot but I felt that it was creative and unique. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it is not the mindless drivel that the film critics are leading us all to believe. I will say that the marketing of the film has been all wrong in that it looks like a \"Scream\" type teenie bopper movie and the title, well that just plain sucks. Book of Shadows has nothing to do with the film...big strike for the name!",

It was a real thriller that kept you at the edge of the seat by having a strong impact on your imagination.The sequence is a lot different. It's like comparing tomatoes with potatoes. It's failure derives from the fact that when you are going to watch it you are expecting to watch a high quality movie, as the original was. However, once the story unfolds you are wondering: \"what am i watching?\"To those of you who really enjoyed the original, as i did, i tell you one thing. Do not waste your time and money. You will be disappointed. You will see blood, murders, witches but you will never, throughout the film, have that feeling of fear and agony which you felt while watching the original.",

I LOVED the Blair Witch Project (almost religiously), but for some reason this movie just didn't seem to have the same feel as the TBWP.  It never snapped like the first one did at the end. This movie was disturbing (necks being slit always disturb me) and unsettling (what the hell happened???).  It worked, but not completely. The cast was believable in some parts, especially Jeff.  The movie just seemed to need something more.  I suggest watching the Sci Fi special to learn what Jeff did to get in the mental hospital, as it's never touched upon, and may confuse many viewers.  It does have a lot of the same themes of the first movie (human nature vs. evil witch), which I enjoyed.  I'll just finish with this: this movie was made for the people who stayed with the series. Also, YES THERE IS NO BOOK, but this movie IS THE BOOK.  A witch's book of shadows is the legacy of the coven, the artifact that is passed from generation to generation (i hope i know my stuff when I say this).  Watch the movie, you'll understand.3 out of 5 6 out of 10 C+",

            "content": "I went to see Book of Shadows the day it came out as I did for the first BWP. I respect the original as a groundbreaking did not find it scary.  I also liked the concept and thought it really did a good job of knocking the movie industry on its ass.Needless to say I was very skeptical on hearing of the sequel(s)...I guess the other movie is technically going to be a prequel. The whole mutli-dimensional junk they listed on blairwitch.com sounded really bad to me.  But when I started reading information on movie posters and about the time the preview hit theaters I actually began to have a strong interest.I went to see it and boy was I disappointed.  Much like The Cell this film is fairly visually pleasing but besides that it is very lacking. Poor story, poor introduction for those not aware of the previous movie somehow, and generally the film feels incomplete.  Its as if they just released a work in progress. The movie just ends up feeling like a documentary about schitzophrenia or drug binges. I totally did not end up connecting to the characters at all.And if you are looking for a scare you will be disappointed.  I admit I wasn't scared at the first movie, but not one person seemed afraid in my theather...and with good cause, as there is nothing really to be afraid of besides various bloody shots.  There is no suspense, everything is very transparently laid out.I have to admit I was quite disappointed, even more so upon learning the two orignal creators of the Blair Witch Project were Executive Producers. This barely connects to the original too only using it slightly as a back story, ending up just as a non-scary horror film unfortunately.The lack of a real story kills this film and the chances of success for the actors in it.  It seems like the movie makers just sat down and came up with some cool ideas and put them together and released it without trying to connect them.",

            "content": "Book of Shadows manages to be a movie for all people:  those who loved the Blair Witch Project, who hated it, and who never got around to seeing it.In fact, I think a newbie will enjoy watching Shadows before Project. Project has been reduced to a prop, a plot device to explain why five strangers end up in a haunted forest in the middle of the night.(mild spoilers, I guess...) For the Fangoria fan who hated Project, Shadows offers the classic 80's standbys of naked chicks and buckets of blood.  The script offers plenty of snickers at Project's expense.  Most of all, a few extra million in the budget gets you some of the images that actually run through these people's heads.  Trippy. For those who 'got' Project, Shadows examines similar themes:  the folly of ignoring fear, the false security of technology, the power of the things you can't see -- which is STILL scarier than what you can see.  Fear of the unknown is still the greatest fear of all, and Shadows remembers that. The fun is still there, watching these people who are SO convinced they won't get scared, learn why to be scared... Shadows is not the T2 of horror, however.  The camerawork cuts down on the Dramamine moments, but offers the strongest cliches in an otherwise refreshing tale.  The crazy house scenes are just there to pad the film. Dread and paranoia are the film's strengths, so there's still not enough jump-out-of-your-seat moments people expect in, say, Hellraiser films. Since we know that it's a movie, there's nothing to replace the big parlor trick that made Project a phenomenon in the first place. Maybe Shadows is too clever, too neatly fitting the Project, and its hype, into the second while basically recycling Project's story.  That's the new gimmick of Shadows, as if to suggest \"Well, this is the real movie, the Project was just to get you in the mood.\"  It's a way to be all things to all people. So for those curious to see how they manage to wrangle an encore for The Blair Witch Project, Shadows is an impressive answer.  For those looking to see the scariest movie of the year (again), expect to be disappointed.",

Director Joe Berlinger had the promising idea of making the sequel a satirical psychological thriller and the studio seemed intrigued by the idea and greenlit the sequel. Unfortunately, the studio did a complete 180 and wanted straight up supernatural horror film and as a result the script was change. As a result, it left a horrendously butchered experience of a film as the movie is left with nothing but a confusing story with huge plot holes, clueless directing, and scenes that led to nowhere. (For example, A group of tourists the run into the protagonists were there to show the global obsession of the first film, only for the studio to mandate they get brutally murder by the protagonists just to have some slasher gore.) As result the film was horribly panned by critics and left 16-year gap in terms of sequels.

In the first blah witch when there in the woods they do not come back out and adding a Tristan who goes mad dose not make it any better. It was a attempt of mocking Michael going mad in the first one. Tristan went mad about nothing. the child part was from I would think the noses out Side the tent in the first. there were children playing. I think what also ruins book of shadows is that you see the ghosts. what makes the first really good is that you can only hear and not see. In the 3rd Blair witch you see the ghosts as well witch is why that Blair witch is not popular as well. even through It is not the Blair witch it still ruins the point. after saying that I would not watch It.

There was not much I can say this movie has going for it - except for maybe the fact that it tried to be more eventful than the original. The plot of this movie is just a mess, these people go looking for the Blair Witch, which, once again we learn absolutely nothing about, and slowly see themselves get terrorized by the witch, similar to what happened in the first movie. There was a twist that this movie tried to throw in, which I have to say was probably the most interesting thing that happened in this movie, and I can't really complain about that because at least they tried to do something other than leach off of the first movies success. There is so much wrong with this movie, even the title doesn't make any sense. There is no \"Book Of Shadows\" in this movie, nor is there any mention of a book of shadows, no reference, not even a book that could resemble a book of shadows. This movie should have just been called \"Blair Witch 2\", but I guess the producers scrapped the plot entirely for the \"Book Of Shadows\" and just made up some new crap and threw it out. Everything from the way this movie was shot, to the acting, to the actual plot just screams lazy, and although I could see \"The Blair Witch Project\" being good in 1999, I know for a fact that there is no time where this sequel would be anything better than just a trashy movie looking to make a quick buck off of the original movie's success. \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" is terrible.",

Actually, whoever it was, what was the motive? Why kill all these people? Were they under a spell or just crazy? I mean, we know that this guy  was crazy because he was in a mental institution. In fact, what was up with that opening with the pouring of the mucus into his nose? They never explained that. Hey, how come they saw crazy images sometimes and then didn't at other times? Was there ever a rhyme or reason to it, or did they just do it out of nowhere? For that matter, how do we know the video footage is really what we're seeing? I mean, is that really what happened, or did the ghost or witch or whatever it is play with that, too? We saw clearly he can mess with the footage. Speaking of which, why was the footage only playable when being played backwards? I mean, even then, how did they see the snippets of it when they were playing it forward? Oh, yeah, and did they ever explain why the goth chick was psychic? That was a thrilling backstory, wasn't it? I'm so glad they had that in the movie, that was essential to the plot! Hey, is there any chance that you can explain why you were cutting to those bits of those people being murdered out of nowhere?! Did it add anything to the story? Did it create any suspense? Now that I think about it, from a storytelling point of view, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE FUCKING BLAIR WITCH?* A CONNECTION, IF THERE IS ONE AT ALL, IS BARELY MADE! In fact, wait a minute. (He does a close-up on the movie poster's title) WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE BOOK OF SHADOWS?! (Back to the movie footage) Did they ever mention that in the movie?! Where the hell was that title? They never talk about it! WE NEVER EVEN SEE IT! DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE THE TITLE OF YOUR MOVIE SHOULD GODDAMN HAVE SOMETHING WELL FUCK SHIT DAMN TO DO WITH YOUR MOVIE? IT'S NEVER EXPLAINED!

Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is one of the worst sequels I've seen to any film, no matter the genre, and the fact that the studio pumped it out to capitalize on the instant success of the original explains a lot. This movie is not found-footage, and instead exists in a world where the original Blair Witch Project has already come out, and these new characters, much like the production company, want to make a quick buck by creating a supposed \"tour\" in the Black Hills Forest, which then goes awry. The acting is atrocious in this film and it's clear that first-time, feature film director Joe Berlinger was out of his depth in reigning in these performers, who resort to going as over-the-top as possible with their line deliveries. The editing is also terrible, with random inserts of exposition that don't connect to anything, as well as intrusive foreshadowing that really only exists to give the film some gratuitous violence. The film is so lazy, it borrows every cliche from the horror playbook including random ghosts, jump scares, animals acting nuts, and of course, DREAM SEQUENCES! The only good that came from this film was the element of time displacement, which expands the mythology and answers some leftover questions from the first film. Apart from that, this is a complete waste of time and the only enjoyment I reaped from it was rocking out to the Marilyn Manson song that plays during the opening credits, that's as \"scary\" as the film gets.",

The film is edited to shit (so many cuts to the present and the past), the characters are unlikable, and the whole thing is confusing. There are some genuinely interesting ideas here (One example: If a group believes in a fictional thing hard enough, can that fictional thing be brought to life?), and the mystery at the heart of the film is actually an intriguing one. Unfortunately, the film throws all the puzzle pieces in a jumbled heap on the table and tells you to get to it. Figuring out what's really going on is just about impossible. It's clear that the group is suffering from severe hallucinations (sometimes even shared hallucinations), and that one or more may be possessed by The Blair Witch at different times. I suppose the simple answer is that the group is slowly being driven mad by The Blair Witch (which begs the question: Was The Blair Witch real all along,  did the group inadvertently bring her to life by believing in her, or have they been driven mad by their obsession over the Blair Witch?). Either way, the film leaves you with many, many questions and tons of almost answers (and the film is assembled in such a way that finding the truth is a herculean task). Hopefully one day we'll get a directors cut, but as it stands now Book of Shadows is interesting, frustrating, and maddening. On the plus side, I actually kind of dug the score and I liked the setting of the warehouse.",

In order to appreciate this film, you need to have some understanding of the occult, particularly of black magick and evil spirits as depicted in legend and folklore.  From the proper perspective, this film is terrifying, whereas the average viewer might be confused or bored.  You see, the way how evil spirits interact with people is to get inside their heads and distort/change how they perceive \"reality.\"  This movie is all about that phenomenon.

Thats what this film is, one big ass wiping session. Its painful from start to finish, not one moment of it is in anyway enthralling or scary or even enjoyable. If any film maker wanted to continue the success of the original, why not do a take on the Rustin Parr avenue, that could have worked, continue the mythos, create a broader world? Or how about a prequal about Ellie Kedworth, how she came to get banished and how she seeked her revenge, yet again expanding the mythos. These all seem like decent enough ideas right? So what do the film makers of the sequal do? I have no idea... I was watching but nothing was sinking in. It took me three sessions to eventually reach the end of this movie. I dont know the characters names because they are that one dimentional and stereotypical that i didnt care about them in anyway. The script is utterly appauling. A group of blair witch fans go on a tour of the woods where the original is filmed, some crazy drug session follows and in the morning they have unleashed madness upon burkettsville... I mean who cares, its nonesense. It's laughable, that someone actually thought that this would even help the lengevity of a franchise and it didnt, it killed it stone dead. Total and utter waste of time from all involved. As the last words uttered in the film \"I didnt do that\" the answer on every fans lips is \"We know, we wish you didnt either\".",

The idea of following up The Blair Witch Project with a horror movie based around the huge phenomenon the former would end up catalyzing is strangely meta, and has potential for a clever horror movie in the vein of the very self-aware Scream. But alas, instead of capitalizing on the idea, the filmmakers opt for a slasher that has literally no connection to the Blair Witch lore outside of name dropping the film a few times. The film is titled \"Book of Shadows,\" and yet there is no mention of any book of shadows at all. The filmmakers behind this one seem to think that cramming strange imagery at random counts as suspense and scares, but fail to realize that it's actually just utter nonsense. There's nothing wrong with ambiguity, but when all of the posed questions go unanswered, it's not ambiguity: it's nonsensicality. There's no scares, no thrills, no suspense: like its predecessor, it's a paranoia driven story, but unlike that film, the paranoia isn't effective. The Blair Witch Project works because it's grounded in reality. There's a reason so many people believed it was real footage and not just a movie: everything in the film was plausible. Here, the constant visions of random events posing as \"horror\" are just absurd, and not at all frightening. A pathetic excuse for a horror movie, and a horrible follow-up to a fantastic horror film.",

But, you know, I figured \"Joe Berlinger directed this movie. He's half of the team that directed Brother's Keeper and the Paradise Lost documentaries. How bad can it really be?\" By the time I was done watching it, I discovered I had been asking myself the wrong question. Instead, I was then asking myself, \"how does a director with such a proven track record (as well as the aforementioned, Berlinger had also directed at least one episode of Homicide: Life on the Street, one of the best shows ever on television) make a movie this awful?\n\nPlot: Jeffrey Patterson (Burn Notice's Jeffrey Donovan), a resident of Burkittsville, MD (the scene of the original Blair Witch Project), decides in the wake of the film's publicity to start a tourism service. A group of college students and a husband-and-wife professional ghost-hunter team take the maiden voyage, which finds itself in not-so-friendly competition with another guy who had the same idea, and is also on his maiden voyage. The first night, the crew camp out-but when they wake up the next morning after a night of drunken and drug-fueled revelry, they find that they weren't the only ones who blacked out-their everpresent video cameras have lost five hours of time. And during that five hours, the other crew of ghost hunters were brutally murdered. With Jeffrey and his charges the prime suspects, they retreat to the well-guarded house of Rustin Parr, supposedly the first victim of the Blair Witch's possession (and in whose basement the first film's unforgettable final scene takes place), and start dissecting the videotape they do have to try and figure out what happened that night.\n\nWhat makes it even more confusing is that, unlike the first film (let's face it, Joshua Leonard was the only person to come out of that movie with a career), Book of Shadows has a ridiculous cast. Stephen Turner (Seducing Charlie Barker). Erica Leerhsen (Mozart and the Whale). Kim Director (Inside Man). Tristine Skyler (Cadillac Man). Lanny Flaherty (Signs). The list goes on. Ironically, this may point to one of the potholes the movie hit-whereas Myrick and S\u00e1nchez specifically sought out inexperienced/first-time actors, the casting team for this movie went for already-established actors, which hamstrings the whole \"we have no idea who these people are\" gig. It's obvious Berlinger and co. still wanted to play on it, however, since they used the same tactic of having the actors use things close to their real names. It seems a little thing, but it shows that somewhere during the development process, a lack of thoughtfulness about the movie's direction crept in. And the finished product shows you just how dangerous that sort of thing can be. Barely coherent, unsure whether it wants to be a horror film or a mundane murder mystery, with odd moments that look as if they were shot by rank amateurs (that stand out far more in a film as otherwise well-shot as this one); it's presented nicely, but little else. *",

The fact that it can be associated with one of the most well done horror films of all time is a complete embarrassment, as this \"sequel\" shares nothing with its predecessor except its setting and a loose focus on the legend of the blair witch. Ditching the documentary-style for a traditionally shot film, 'Shadows' is a terribly conceived idea from start to finish, and is only made to be clumsier than one would think thanks to an F-list cast, amateur cinematographic work and a nonsensical plot. The film is so bad that it's laughable at parts, and it does not once give the audience a chance to be scared. It's the opposite of scary. Considering how bad this is, it's a wonder that the studio gave this a green light. Although they are two completely different franchises, the differences in quality between 'Shadows' and 'Paranormal Activity 2' are miles apart, with the latter being an example of how to prolong the life of a successful horror series. Seriously, don't even bother giving 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2' a try - there's no point, it's a total waste of time and there it has no redeeming qualities.",

            "content": "Bad writing. Bad acting. Pointless movie. Reasonably decent ending, that is extremely flawed. Blair Witch Project was a scary, creepy movie. This is an empty shallow movie... which isn't scary. It doesn't even give any creeps or crawls. It just 'is'. This movie was hyped up upon so much, and then it seems to have been completely forgotten- I can see why. The only way that movie is related to the first is due to the fact that they set it a year after the release of the first Blair Witch Project. Apart from that, this movie isn't filmed in the same style, there isn't really much connection. If it were a good movie then it would've been good as then it would've still been an original movie, and avoided being a rehash. But this film just failed across the board, and was timed so badly, but also had so many talking scenes about the mystery, but it was poorly written and acted, so it was just bad. \n\nThis film has so many flaws to it, that you just start wondering why you haven't stopped watching it in the first place, as there are things that no-one would do. If you have a miscarriage, the first thing you do is definitely not go on a horror tour. Is it? There are other flaws that will be big spoilers so I won't give it away, but these are so blatantly obvious that I couldn't let it go. The characters are so thick in this movie that you don't feel any sympathy but just find them annoying, and it drove me crazy on some of the things they will do, ad it will annoy you too, because it is so stupidly ridiculous. You could argue that if they weren't stupid then this movie wouldn't work, well it doesn't work anyway, as this movie didn't need to be made in this way. It could have worked, but it just felt unnecessary, and like I was watching a straight-to-DVD movie instead of something that had a lot of money put into it, especially compared to the last one. The first movie's budget was $60,000, while this one had \u00c2\u00a315 million.\n\nThe performances in this movie are pretty atrocious, with some scenes where one person is possessed, and she just walks around the bed really quickly whilst reciting something like she was from a primary school. Everything was so over the top, that it just didn't work, and also they tried to add humor to this movie, and it just wasn't funny, and it also didn't seem genuine which was a big problem because these movies are made to seem genuine. It never felt like I was really watching a Blair Witch movie.\n\nThe way the movie worked wasn't the worst thing, as the way it was filmed was quite clever in the way they made it seem like a documentary, but then I found myself distancing from the characters, as it just didn't feel as real as it would've done, had it been in the 'found-footage' genre. The movie was just messy, with no clear story line or plot, and the structure was all over the place, leaving some stories open, and then just closing them without much explanation.\n\nAnother problem I had was that this movie just wasn't scary in the slightest. It had some of the mot lazy attempts at scares I have seen in a long time, as the scares would be things fading in and out, or it would be flashes of something going 'boo', and that would be it. And it happened only a few times, I would probably call this a bad fantasy or thriller than a horror, because it isn't really a horror that much. Also, some of the editing in the movie is so sketchy, as things are coming in and out of the frame, and the way it is edited, and shot, it results in things being missed and misunderstood. When the end neared, I missed a few major plot points, as it just wasn't portrayed in an effective enough way.\n\nThis is no Blair Witch, it has a decent ending, but has many flaws to the ending. But by the point of the ending, you don't even care, as the movie has been pretty dull and boring for the most part, as it is just people aimlessly walking around for an hour and a half. There is no fun to be had here. No scares to be had here. But there is poorly written dialogue... all the time. Fun! Fun! Fun!",

This will go down in history as one of the worst sequels ever, a follow-up that no one asked for and only exists to cash in on the wildly successful original. But while that remains one of the most original and scariest horror films of all time, this is conventional in every way. \r\n\r\nThere's great evidence of tampering by the studio to make this more commercial, but all they've succeeded in doing is making an incoherent mess of a movie that is so bad it tarnishes the reputation of the first film. There's absolutely nothing even remotely scary about this film, as the most it can muster are a lot of shocking images that turn out to be hallucinations anyway.\r\n\r\nGone is the imagination and suggestiveness that made the original so special. Instead, it's replaced by a lot of ridiculous and unnecessary gore that doesn't even make sense within the context of the film. The sequel sets up an intriguing premise that is founded on the basis that the first movie was just that; a movie. What would happen if fans of that movie try to prove its authenticity? But that premise is forgotten about after the first twenty minutes and what follows is an excruciatingly boring and talky film with only the most threadbare connection to its predecessor. And as perhaps a sign of the studio's desperation, the title is completely meaningless. There is no \"Book of Shadows\" in \"Blair Witch 2\", as well as no scares, logic or a coherent story. This may very well be the worst film of the year.",

It's worse than Jason X, it's worse than Halloween 3. In saying that, I'm also sort of happy in a way, that Book of Shadows was so terrible. If it had been even a slight success, there would have been a crazy amount of additional sequels dished out. As it is, this killed the sequels and we haven't been shown any for 12 years. Thank God.\u00a0\n\nBook of Shadows took everything that was cool and terrifying about the original and threw it out the window. The first relied on its small budget as a way to scare. Instead of showing us all the details, they left it to our imagination. This one decides to show just about everything. They show us tons of blood, in a schizophrenic and hectic sort of way. We are shown hallucinations of what characters think is happening and everything seems like it is passing over everything else. It's like a 3 year old with a coloring book. Initially you can see what the picture is, but after they've scribbled on it with ten different colors in incoherent ways, all that's left is a mess.\u00a0\n\nThis takes place shortly after the hysteria of the first film. At the start we are shown clips of late night shows and critics speaking about the film. We are given a fake news broadcast that is showing us how everyone is overrunning the town of Burkittsville. Locals say it isn't true, and the sheriff tries to keep all the tourists out of the woods. One local takes it upon himself to cash in on the hysteria, creating the Blair Witch Hunt. He takes some tourists out to some spots and they party. They wake up remembering nothing. All their stuff is thrown about and they have weird marks on their flesh. They then retire to the locals house, which is a factory, in order to decode what has happened with their cameras.\n\nDon't watch it. I love the first one, but this is just a waste of time. It adds nothing to the Blair Witch story and only serves as a film Artisan thought they could make some money off of. Once again, Thank God they didn't.",

Its not a continuation of the original, but more of a companion. \r\n\r\nIt starts out painfully slow, but once it gets rolling, it has some good scares and does a good job of keeping its viewers on their toes.

Or were maybe just hoping for a Blair Witch sighting. Because it's not like the characters in that movie died or anything. That's the basis for this odd meta-sequel that does away with the found-footage approach in favor of a more traditional film-going experience.Putting the two films side-by-side it would be impossible to tell this was meant to be a follow-up if didn't constantly reference it's predecessor by name every so often. Cameras still play a big role, but we're not watching the action through them. Instead they are used as a nod to the first movie, another attempt to convince us that all of this really happened, and as a method of delivering a twist ending that most will probably see coming. The approach and setting are totally different, but things play out in basically the same manner. As the strange events the characters experience begin to get more sinister the paranoia and frustration set in causing them to become distrustful of one another.There are attempts at social commentary about mass hysteria and people's perceived perceptions on reality, but the movie isn't really smart or scary enough to have true depth. It's mostly just the character's seeing stuff that isn't there when they turn around and an ending that poses the question of whether or not they were actually afflicted by something supernatural or were just a bunch of nutcases. The bad acting doesn't help.While I'm not quite sure I liked it, I was certainly never bored. It's got that early 2000's cheese (a Marilyn Manson song plays during the opening credits) that's perfect for an October horror marathon. The movie is worth watching just because it exists and is such a bizarre way of turning The Blair Witch Project from a standalone horror film into a franchise. As mediocre and much less enjoyable as the Adam Wingard title was, you can't say it didn't resemble the first movie. This is something almost entirely different and it's interesting because of that.",

I did see the first Blair Wifch Project movie and it really scared the \"s**t out of me.\" It doesn't have real actors, it's not based on a true story, it just set a wave of a new standard genre called Paranormal and that ushers in a slew of low-budget but well-made films like The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the aforemention Paranormal Activity series. One year later, throw in a new sequel but with a shameless new director wanting to scare audiences even more. Boy, this movie does not even scare me at one bit. But in this case, the critics are right. This movie is bad. I mean which horror sequel is donned the worst. This or Halloween Resurrection or A Nightmare on Elm Street V? You make the call.

None of the actors really did a good job, the characters are tiring and poorly designed, unable to capture our sympathy or truly deserve our attention.
