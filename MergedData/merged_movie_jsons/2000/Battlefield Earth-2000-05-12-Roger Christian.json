            "content": "3 seconds in: The title is cheesy green and beneath the words 'battlefield earth' is a subtitle: 'the saga of the year 3000'... Not an auspicious start!3 minutes in: The camera is always on a tilt. It's like watching the old Batman TV show with Adam West. My neck is starting to ache already. My friend wonders aloud if they have put the film into the projector at a funny angle.10 minutes in: That scene was ripped straight from bladerunner11 minutes in: So was that one...12 minutes in: Hey look the costumes are out of dune!14 minutes in: Hey look the aliens look like klingons15 minutes in: Hey! They speak like klingons too!16 minutes in: Hey. The computer displays are out of predator!17 minutes in: John travolta shows up. He's funny, it might start to pick up from here... maybe...?20 mintues in... or maybe not.30 minutes in: Why are these aliens so stupid! Let's not only leave our captive human slaves unattended but let's actually *inject* their brains with all the information about our race and then take them to the library and give them the declaration of independence to read. That won't make them dangerous or rebellious at all!40 minutes in: Barry pepper does his oscar winning speech: \"we will fight for our freedom, and we will win. Are you with me? ARE YOU WITH ME?\" The Scots all shout \"yes William, I guess we didn't get all dressed up for nothin\"...45 minutes in: John Travolta snarls \"When we took over your planet all of the forces on earth put up a fight for a measly 9 minutes before they were defeated. There is nothing you can do to stop us!!!\"...I'm left wondering if a race so stupid could have defeated mildly intelligent things like humans in 9 decades let alone 9 minutes.55 minutes in: Why are the aliens after gold???? Why is this making no sense???1 hour in: There hasn't been any middle setpiece yet. Actually nothing has happened at all.1 hour 15 minutes: Did i just lose time? Was I asleep? Had I slept? what's happening? do I care?1 hour 30 minutes: Maybe the middle set piece is just late... maybe one will come along in a minute?1 hour 45 minutes: ... hmmm, maybe not.1 hour 50 minutes: Oooo goody the humans have come up with a plan to get rid of these incredibly stupid alien's. Finally.1 hour 51 minutes: Could you repeat the plan please? It made no sense and I think I might need to understand it so that the rest of the film is coherent?1 hour 55 minutes: Cool, our heroes have found a hangar of fighter planes in Texas. The caveman humans learn to fly Harrier jump-jets in 6 days. Very impressive indeed!1 hour 56 minutes: ...But since the Harriers have been sitting in a hangar for 1000 years how come they are still fully fueled and shiny with working weapons?? Never mind. I guess we're not supposed to notice that.2 hours: Yayyy the fighting has begun! Ooo look, some pretty explosions. Cool - a building fell down! The humans are stopping to throw chairs through windows. That will defeat the aliens for sure!2 hours 2 minutes: Hang on just one moment? Isn't this supposed to be BATTLEFIELD earth? There are about 15 humans and 10 aliens. Shouldn't they have called it 'slight scuffle earth' or 'schoolyard fight earth' instead?2 hours 10 minutes: Please somebody kill me now.2 hours 15 minutes: YAY! the head alien has managed to blow his entire race up by being really stupid.2 hours 20 minutes: Where's the exit! Take me home please.",

            "content": "My spouse and I went to see this on opening night. We were expecting to see an extremely bad and costly film, and we were not really disappointed. It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.As they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry \"can't get a break\" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking \"Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?\" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here, but not much else. Some day when you need a good laugh, rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector.",

My  candidate for worst film for the new millennium: atrociously awful  Travolta vehicle (who is totally to blame for his co-producing this pet  project due to his Scientology ties) in bringing L. Ron Hubbard's cult  sci-fi novel to fruition is just one God-forsaken mess from start to  finish in what feels like the ultimate Ed Wood film with a dire need  for the gang from MST3K to show up and provide apt ridicule: Travolta  stars as 9 foot tall alien Terl, a Psychlo who commands his rampaging  race in wiping out mankind in the year 3000 with only rebel Pepper out  to thwart his nefarious plans of mining gold for his own just rewards.  Ridiculous from the get go: the make-up of the Psychlos: a combination  of dreadlocks a la Jar Jar Binks to the 'Coneheads' to the costume  rejects of any speed metal band of the 1990s; the dim lighting and  production design; the cheezy special effects (except for the climax of  Terl's planet - who the HELL cares if I'm giving away the ending?!! IT  SUCKS!!!) - which looked kinda cool!) and laugh-out loud dialogue:  ('Rat-brains' is the often reviled retort by Terl to the 'man-animals'  he despises). Travolta better get his mind straight because his  post-'Pulp Fiction' comeback is running on jet vapors at this point and  don't even get me started on his evil Vincent Price-inspired chortle!  UGGGHH!!! (Dir: Roger Christian)",

            "content": "Battlefield Earth has become something of a legend. It's the Holy Grail of Hollywood crap from the decade if not beyond and is quite possibly \"that which we do not speak of\" among scientologists. I was never one to pay much attention to critics, I always liked to watch and decide for myself but even I couldn't resist being strayed from any interest by the aura of disdain that surrounded this movie back in 2000. I was 16 then and any sci-fi adventure movie should've been worth a view, but not this one. Now, eleven years later I finally sat down to give it a shot and not only does it live up to it's reputation, it surpasses it.I was expecting a bad a movie. I was expecting cheesy performances and a weak a script but I got so much more. Battlefield Earth is a garbled mess from start to finish. We begin, as you might have guessed, on earth. A tribe of caveman-esque people struggle to survive. They're warned of a beast that prowls the land just beyond the horizon and are told of demons that rule the planet. But one brave dude, played by Barry Pepper decides there's more out there worth seeing and sets out to prove it. That beast they're all scared of? That's a statue from a long since abandoned mini-golf course. And those demons they're always whining about? They're a race of aliens from the planet Psychlo that have enslaved the human populace. For you see this isn't earth billions of years ago but earth in the future where the humans are no longer the dominant lifeforce and it's been so long since they had any power they're not even aware of how badly they got screwed over. This might seem like a spoiler...like I just blew a twist for you...but nope...fear not. Because thanks to a lame subtitle at the opening we already know this is \"A Saga of the Year 3000,\" and thanks to some other on screen text that we apparently needed we also already know that the human race is nearly extinct. Which basically means that if you actually managed to get to this movie without having seen any previews you still won't be in for any surprises. Because who wants to be surprised by a movie right? That would be stupid.The basic idea behind this introduction to the world isn't actually bad, having us start on what seems like a primitive society and seeing the truth revealed in layers has been done before but it can be effective even in spite of those spoilerific titles at the beginning. The problem though is this information is thrown at us within about 15 minutes of screen time. The whole movie feels very rushed and none of the scenes have any room to breath and we're treated to the same split wipe transition every 5 minutes or so. I won't break down the plot any more than that because there's really no need...let's just say the badguys do some stuff, the goodguys get involved and they want to stop being slaves...because well, being a slave sucks.The director seems determined to make this movie a visual feast but really doesn't know how. Every camera in the entire movie is tilted, which can make for an interesting shot, but when EVERY DAMN shot is done the same way it holds no artistic merit what so ever...instead it looks like they were working with a broken tripod. There's really nothing visually interesting about this movie at all except for the establishing shots of the planet Psychlo, which is only because they remind you of Blade Runner. In fact I'm pretty sure they just tinted a few shots from Blade Runner purple and cut them into this movie.The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger, hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. You see, they have access to all of Earth's history and the capability to learn how to decipher it but evidently nobody thought it was a good idea which is why they think the favorite meal of a human is uncooked rat, and they can't be sure of man's ability to fly without tossing them in the air as a test. To top it all off the alien performances are so goofy they lose all menace. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have careers full of great performances but with this material they look like a High School theater troupe.There might've actually be a decent story to be mined out of this mess but the people involved just weren't able to find it. I like to give credit where credit is due even in movie's I'm not fond of, it's not too often I find a movie with no redeeming qualities to be found but I'm afraid Battlefield Earth just made the list.",

            "content": "It was with a certain morbid curiosity and a near certainty that I would be seeing an awful movie that I rented Battlefield Earth, and I must say the movie exceeded all of my expectations, it is indeed exceptionally terrible. Upon finishing the film I immediately checked to see if Ed Wood had directed it, then I remembered he has been dead for some time, but no worries Roger Christian is here to take his place.I'm not real sure where to begin because there is nothing good to start with and so much bad to describe, but I might as well start from the top. Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race that is scouring the universe for gold....yeah gold, don't know why but they want it. Earth has been occupied for a thousand years by these aliens and they are still here, searching for gold. They haven't bothered to raid the bank vaults of the world, they are too busy digging for the stuff....no really, part of the plot later hinges on the humans finding and raiding Fort Knox to supply gold to the aliens to fool them into thinking the humans are mining when they are secretly planning a revolt....I'm not kidding, but that comes later.The few remaining humans are savage tribal creatures scratching out a miserable existence as primitive hunter-gatherers. Later on they learn to fly Harrier jets and dogfight alien ships with only a few days of work, they must have been passing down fighter pilot lore for the last ten centuries or so. The main character, Jonnie Goodboy (Barry Pepper) and no I'm not making up that name either, leaves the safety of his tribe because he doesn't believe in the aliens and his dad has just died. His dad's death is very emotional, even though he never appears on camera, is never referred to ever again in the film, and the mourning lasts for about three seconds before the cut to the next scene. Anyway he gets captured by the aliens in a shopping mall and taken to their base. There follows a terrible scene where Jonnie Goodboy does battle with the alpha male in the prison population over who gets to eat first, Jonnie defeats him, and proclaims that everyone will eat at the same time from now on with thunderous cheers from the riff raff....pretty powerful stuff. I've already wasted a lot of time bashing this film so I'll just finish by saying that Jonnie Goodboy gets hooked up to a learning machine, becomes really educated, learns to fly, plans a revolt, does a little nuclear engineering, and blows up a planet. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. Oh one last thing, at least half the film is shot at a fifteen degree angle, we're not sure why, and once again slow motion doesn't make a bad scene better, it just makes it take longer.",

            "content": "What a bad film this is. I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper)  and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think \" Rat brains \" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the \" man animals \" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term \" Man animals \" irritating ? Surely it should be \" Manimals \" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither",

            "content": "This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake. I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.'In preparing a judgment of worth, I proclaim this lame movie to be worst' Don't forget that 'I told ya' to blame John Travoltaand L. Ron for Battlefield Earth.Oh, if it were only a musical. 2/10.Clark Richards",

            "content": "It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age, slowly dying out in small, ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods \u0096 a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.Being a film critic must be a hard job to do at times. Many of the films you watch will not be brilliant, nor will they be terrible \u0096 most will be OK and nothing more. Therefore when reviewers get a chance to gush, they generally take it. Likewise, when a bad film does come to the big screen and reviewers get to see it, they often will take great pleasure in putting the boot it \u0096 we see it with at least one big budget film each year (2004 was Catwoman). So I usually will try and view a really panned film because I am aware that sometimes the critics are just being unfair \u0096 however, most of the time I'll wait until it comes to TV to make that decision. With Battlefield Earth, I must concede that it is a pretty bad film \u0096 but maybe not as bad as the many critics all said, although it would be easy to just keep kicking it in the same way as everyone else does.The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not 'the worst film of all time\u0099'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms \u0096 something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.The film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn't that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd \u0096 like a Klingon but with more bits! Similarly the transport craft and alien sets all feel like somebody has just ripped off other films and then tried to combine them; the end result is the look of a cheap sci-fi that looks like it is a sci-fi film as opposed to a 'real' futuristic world. It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fisted that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it \u0096 a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.With such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled \u0096 so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just so\u0085obvious and easy \u0096 there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material \u0096 but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.Overall this is a very poor film and, although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination \u0096 a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time.",

            "content": "I must admit, it was only recently I actually came across this film. The first clip I saw was the scene in the bar where John Travolta's character 'Terl' says his infamously cheesy \"While you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer galaxies\" line. The clip was on the YouTube video 100 top cheesiest quotes and at first I didn't recognise the fact that it was John Travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line and instead thought it was a secondary character or a comic relief, so I dug further in and decided to have a stab at watching this, hoping to God that it was what I had suspected. It was not, and in fact, it was much worse than that.The main problems with this film can be summed up in a few words:Everything...The acting is an absolute joke, there's no character development, John Travolta makes himself out to be a complete doom-brain, the special effects have nothing special to them, the story is more convoluted and nonsensical than anything ever written and whatever's left of this steaming pile of mess is probably a joke as well. At first I had high expectations to this film, but turns out I was wrong on so many levels.Let me elaborate on my above points, everyone in this movie (especially John Travolta) over acts their parts to the point of extremity, so much so that every scene is almost laughable. There is no character development, no proper run in as to he character's situation, you're just expected know before hand what is going on, which you can't because there's not enough of a back-story for you to build on. The special effects look like they were made on Flash Player 2004, the story makes no sense, with so many plot holes such as essential savages being able to learn in the window of a few days how to arm guns and fly Harrier Jump Jets, and how an entire Global Military force could not defeat the aliens yet 6 Harrier Jump Jets could take them down with ease. But this point is only trivial compared to some of the other points of idiotic interest you can pick out from this film. And probably my most irritating point is the fact that 99% of the shots are at an angle, which makes the movie almost unwatchable to begin with. Was the director's neck stuck at an angle so the only way he could tell what was going on was to have the camera's at an angle too? Really no need for it.Overall, this was just a big waste of time and money that somehow made it into the cinemas. I mean, for what was supposed to be an overly serious movie about the last fight of Mankind against aliens, this actually seems pretty comical, I mean John Travolta is essentially a one man comedy show with his overacting, a real gem of cinema there folks!",

If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie, so copies of it are rare.This movie is painful to watch.

All that being said, I cannot hate this film like some other movies, and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it, it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And, I have to admit, it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.And it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget, so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made. It's painful to watch, it makes no sense, and watching John Travolta, Barry Pepper, and Forest Whitaker act in this movie was like watching Goofy. Actually, I think I'd like to see a version where Goofy plays Terl.0/10",

My personal guess: no, and if they were, I'd rather not know about what.None of the reviews have done BE justice.

And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude. I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:* Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.* Special effects, film, sets, costumes, makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.* all other salaries: $4,999,888.* script: $112 and change.Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made, or released, for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this, why should anyone care? Ah, well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.I never thought I'd give anything a 1, but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen.

We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years, yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals. In all that time, the Psychlos never found Fort Knox, though gold is high on their shopping list, nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold. The humans, by the way, though reduced to primitive servitude by their conquerors, learn to use those jets in about a day, with the help of a flight simulator that fortunately is not only in working order, but can draw on power from... somewhere.The story is given appropriate support by some of the worst acting (what WAS John Travolta thinking???), dialog, and music you're ever likely to see or hear. A couple of acceptable special effects shots only serve to highlight the wretched standard of the rest. As for the camera work, well, I have nothing in particular against slow motion or tilting the camera, but was it really necessary to use either so lavishly here?After a while, I stopped even trying to find anything good in this mess and sat watching in sullen silence, unwilling to admit defeat by walking out, but determined not to see the film again.Since IMDb doesn't allow a zero rating, I guess it has to be 1/10 - which is at least 10 points more than this deserves.",

And man are they done badly in this stinker. In fact, they don't get anything right.John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have three Oscar nominations and one win between them, which is enough to discount the value of the Oscars altogether. Whitaker probably comes off the better of the two. He may be costumed to look like Oprah Winfrey from her fat years, but he gets far fewer lines, and therefore opportunities to embarrass himself. Travolta, on the other hand, assumes a dandified, English aristocratic accent for some reason, and delivers one howler after another. It's unclear to me whether or not he realizes how bad this movie is and is hamming it up on purpose for lack of anything better to do or thinks he's really contributing to something of value.Yikes -- you see something like \"Battlefield Earth\" and realize you might need to recalibrate your bad movie meter.

It takes professional pilots years of training.-- Jet fuel does not remain stable for a thousand years. Most of the plastic components in the jest would have become brittle. The battery packs in the jets would have become unusable. The tires would have gone flat and the rubber would have disintegrated.-- I seriously doubt that our planet actually has enough elemental Gold that a high-tech invading civilization would still be mining it after 1,000 years.

            "content": "Well, it seems to me that everybody involved in making of this movie experimented with their careers. If I was the one financing it I wouldn't be sitting here writing sarcastic comments, I'd be after some heads. Roger Christian's especially and that of the screenwriter and possibly Travolta's.Surely there have been other films that bombed colossally while being terribly expensive, but I haven't seen any that seemed to have been made to fail on purpose. Until this one.Let's start with the obvious. Direction. Directing was so poor and intrusive even the most unaware of the viewers must have noticed it and realized for the first time in their lives how the watching experience can be influenced by bad directorial choices. One single choice stands out like turd in a punchbowl - tilting the camera in every single shot. Every single shot you watch with nauseating feeling desperately wishing that the camera straightens up. But it never happens. And there was never any artistic justification for it. Okay, we see the future world through skewed eyes because the future world is screwed - point taken - now can we watch the bloody movie? No.I did endure watching it though, on a TV station that mercifully airs commercials every 15 minutes, so I could take breaks from time to time. I was able to realize that not only the picture has been massacred but the story as well.I was hoping it wouldn't be due to the following: Hubbard, author of the story, was founder of Scientology / Travolta is one of his zealous followers / this movie is Travolta's passion child / Travolta took a key role in production as well. One would assume Travolta would honor his master enough to make this faithful to the book. Well, he didn't. And it's a pity because I found the book to be spectacular (I was in high-school, but nevertheless). It may not be original but it is quite an inspirational saga of liberation of Human race and Earth from Psychlos, a corrupt occupational forces from outer space. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't rate Scientology one bit (I think it's a daft pastime for rich and famous) and I don't rate Hubbard as a person (frankly, he's an idiot). And I also didn't give a hoot about allegorical messages of this sci-fi while I was reading it, nor did it prompt me to turn to Scientology. But, for all its flaws, \"Battlefield Earth\" is still something that might have put the whole \"Star Wars\" n-logy to shame. Had they done it right.Of course, the movie is a fast medium, one must cut a lot from book to make it work on screen. But Travolta's vanity is also to blame for this movie's undoing. I guess if he was any younger he would be taking the role of Jonnie. Because the book IS about Jonnie, the hero (although opening parts of the book are written from the chief villain's perspective). It is about his journey from slave to master and mankind's journey to rediscover what they have lost. The decision to put Travolta's villain in the spotlight and casting the hero aside was instrumental in killing the spirit of the original story. Not to mention they totally omitted second part after Humans' victory over the Psychlos.Even if the director was not a complete dope, this still would be far from satisfactory.",

Or raging over the blunt plagiarizing of the Klingon look? Maybe laughing at the fact that someone obviously thought that an alien could be made menacing by giving it John Travolta's soft tenor. Somewhere along the line, I most definitely will have to pat the air force empathetically on the shoulder. Man, must they feel like idiots! All those years and years of training pilots, when all that was needed was a bunch of ignorant quasi-Neanderthals and some hours in a flight simulator...I don't know which was the worst move; casting lead actor Barry Pepper, who probably can't even spell \"charisma\", trying to pass off \"Dallas: Alien style\" as sci-fi action, or actually financing this project. The script is on the same level as the stuff I wrote when I was ten, and I think that someone should have noticed that. The mere thought that we're supposed to take even some part of this movie seriously is insulting.They name the movie \"Battlefield Earth\" and then make it mostly about alien Terl's attempts at getting a promotion. Alien Terl from a race that is, incidentally, so stupid I'm surprised they manage to get dressed in the morning. Instead of killing a rebellious slave, the aliens decide to teach him their language. How? By pumping him full of human history and science, and then letting him read up on the missing bits. That should be harmless enough, right? It's not like knowledge ever gave anyone power. And why would even more slaves want to rebel? But then again, how were the aliens supposed to know that the group of stick-wielding, superstitious, grunting cave men knew how to fuel, prep, arm and fly Harriers? That was just pure bad luck. (Also, having fighter jets that are evidently perpetually dusted off and refueled in a hanger that is perpetually powered by... the gods, or... or something? That's clearly cheating.)In the end, there's really only one reason to watch this, and that's if you're a person planning on writing your own sci-fi or other story, and wants advice on what not to do.

            "content": "There are certain movies out there that set the high water mark for being \"bad\". In that list you normally find such familiar names as \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\". Some of these movies are enjoyable in a \"so good it's bad\" kind of way. Others are just unwatchable and you can't get any kind of enjoyment from them. But one movie that belongs on this list is \"Battlefield Earth\". It's been voted as one of the worst movies of all time and nobody, except for members of the Church of Scientology, find it to be any good. So what's it all about?The movie itself is based on the first novel of some saga but it bombed so badly that no other movies were ever made and for that we're all thankful. it takes place in the year 3000 when mankind has been reduced to near barbarism by an alien race known as the Psychlos. They came to Earth because of it's great natural resources the most important of which is gold. They love gold. This is literally their raison d'etre. So they destroyed our civilization and are now in the process of strip mining the planet for our gold.A young barbarian, named Johnny \"Goodboy\" Tyler, is the hero of the book. And after getting captured by the Psychlos forms a rebellion, takes them down and nukes their home planet. . Cue the happy ending and everybody is now safe. Or are they? The idea was to continue the series but since it didn't make any money and most people thought it was crap the sequels never got made.But what makes it so bad you might ask? Well, it's a combination of a lot of things that just came together in such a way to make a gigantic pile of suck. Let's look at them shall we?The writing is terrible. L Ron Hubbard, the author, started out as a writer of pulp magazines. These were cheap magazines from the 50's that had a lot of fantastic stories in them and a lot of the giants of Sci-Fi got their start here. There's a certain style in pulp magazines which is \"use a lot of words\" as they were typically paid something like five cents a word. So in order to make more money, they would just go crazy with descriptions, adding words that weren't necessary and bloating their stories. You can see quite a bit of that in here. People don't talk. They instead speak in exposition in a way that normal people don't speak. It gets rather annoying after a while.The cinematography has some odd stylistic choices which honestly nobody really gets why they did it. For example every shot is set on a Dutch Angle. What is this? Well it simply means that every shot is tilted slightly. Do you remember in the old Adam West \"Batman\" series? Whenever they'd show the villain's hideout the camera was always tilted slightly. This was to show how \"twisted\" the villains were. But here, it's done in every shot. Then every transition from one scene to the other is a curtain wipe. There's just no reason for this.And then there's the acting. Oh my God it's terrible. John Travolta., a long time Scientologist, wanted to get this movie made for the longest time with him in the lead role of Johnny Tyler. But since it took so long he was now too old to play it and had to take the role of Terl, the Psychlo leader on Earth. And let me tell you he overacts like there's no tomorrow. And here's the thing, John Travolta has shown us that he's a good actor. But here? He's chewing the scenery as if he's starving and it's made of chocolate. The man is so over the top terrible that it's hard to take him seriously as a villain. The rest of the cast aren't much better going from passable to terrible.The story itself makes no sense. The Psychlos destroyed all of Earth's armies in a mere 9 minutes over 1000 years ago. But at the end a bunch of cavemen, flying Harriers manage to do what trained soldiers couldn't do a millennia ago. Fighter jets which have been sitting underground for 1000 years work perfectly. The fuel for them hasn't degraded. There's electricity to power these training modules which teaches them how to fly. The computers which run them are in perfect working order. This is beyond stupid. And then, to add insult to injury, they teleport some random dude to the Psychlo home planet and blow it up with one nuclear warhead. That's right. The entire planet ius destroyed with one nuke. How? Supposedly their atmosphere reacts to \"radiation\". And yet L Ron Hubbard was supposedly a nuclear engineer. I'm not and I can still tell you that that is absolute crap.And then there's the elephant in the room namely does it have any connection to Scientology and the answer is a big fat yes. Although a lot of it has been toned down but it's there if you happen to look for it. For example Johnny Tyler is a \"natural clear\" or a person that has achieved the state of \"clear\" in Scientology without having to go through the whole process. In the novel he literally heals himself from a head wound just by thinking of it. This is something that Scientologists are supposed to be able to do. But oddly enough they don't which ought to cast doubt on their whole religion. The Psychlos are nothing more than the big bogeyman for Scientologists as they're supposed to stand in for psychologists. Psychlos = psychologists get it? And their love of gold is representative of this because, according to Scientologists, they're all about getting people's money. There are a few more things here and there that aren't necessarily important. For example when Johnny is tied down to the learning chair to teach him their language he's taught by a creature called an obsequious creature called a \"Chinklo\" or something like that. This is a veiled reference to the racist word for the Chinese which I'm not going to write here and it was changed in the movie to Chinklo from it's original form. L Ron Hubbard was notable for his dislike of the Chinese due to having traveled to China as a child and hating it.This is a terrible movie that should only be watched to see how bad it can get. No enjoyment of this movie is possible. Even as a \"so bad it's good\" kind of way. It's just bad and it deserves to be left upon the scrap heap of history as a warning to those not to do this.",

Not unless you're a glutton for punishment.I'll just spend most of this review talking about the biggest plot holes and complete fallacies in this movie. Without even going in to detail regarding all of the terrible angle shots, bad directing and acting, ridiculous plot points. Let's pretend they were all good, and just focus on this movie's biggest problems. It would STILL be a horrible movie.There's this bit about how the Psychlos took little time in destroying the world's militaries. Terl says that that when the initial invasion kicked off, ALL of the planet Earth's militaries lasted a total of nine minutes against the Psychlos. Nine whole minutes. Fast forward to present times, and all it takes is a few dozen primitive schlubs, a couple of weeks of fighter pilot training, and NOW the psychlos can be defeated? Does anyone else see a gigantic logical fallacy here? It is completely impossible to suspend disbelief enough to believe that even if they were to become extremely lazy and lax, that a military that absolutely decimated that of an entire planet's could succumb so easily to a bunch of humans who've been reduced to a medieval state. This is completely impossible to believe.In \"Independence Day\" they at least ATTEMPTED to make it somewhat believable that a crash course in fighter jet training would work, as the pilots at the end of the movie had previous experience. Even THAT movie was far fetched. But unlike Battlefield Earth, it was still good enough in other areas to warrant a decent reception.I also had a real problem with the bit about the nuclear device causing the ENTIRE planet to explode. It's also consistent with the fact that such a technologically advanced race had supposedly never harvested nuclear energy, and never saw any accidents or nuclear explosions from it. This is on the level of \"Signs\" stupid. Seriously, there needs to be some semblance of logic here. Neither \"Battlefield Earth\", nor \"Signs\" had any. However, unlike \"Signs\", \"Battlefield Earth was rightfully panned. But let's not forget the entire Fort Knox bit. Yes, a race of aliens who look to strip resources from the planet Earth, the MOST important resource of all being GOLD, didn't know about Fort Knox. Seriously? Assuming they didn't study the planet before they invaded, you mean to tell me that at no point in the Psychlo's reign of terror did it ever come out about Fort Knox? No terrified human ever let it slip? No documents revealing it's location ever surfaced? It's not as if Fort Knox is a gigantic secret among humans. Virtually every American knows that it's home to one of the largest gold depositories in the world. And yet at no point during this entire enslavement had it ever come out? I REFUSE to believe that a race of aliens whose biggest mission of all was the mining of gold would not have learned about Fort Knox one way or another. That it took years in to this broken future for the humans to finally reveal it. Again, no logic whatsoever. The complete impossibility to suspend disbelief.There was potential here. But the execution was just awful. Good premise (potentially), but terrible script, direction, and too many plot holes. There's more than I even listed (like the part where they disarmed Terl, only to re-arm him moments later. UGH). This movie is AWFUL. Painfully awful. You'd have to really have a gonzo for some mindless sci-fi action sequences to want to watch this. In which case, you might as well just watch the last 20 minutes or so. But really, just avoid it altogether.",

Thats why the original Die-hard worked so well, everything was done with a wink and a nod. From the over the top New Joisey hero, to the subtly comic villain. This movie admittedly doesn't work as well as that one but everyone got wrapped up so tightly in the Scientology stuff that they didn't even give the movie a chance.

            "content": "Travolta's inane mugging i.e. his trademark over-acting is the movie's main attraction, though there are a multitude of other points of interest and hilarity. He was one of the producers so there was no one to slow him down i.e. he was out-of-control and surrounded with yes-men. At times he must have been thinking he was in a Shakespeare play, the way he pronounces certain words and sentences! Watching him play this alien with such reckless abandon, such merciless gusto, such witless panache, it becomes quickly clear that he was/is an idiot gone berserk with power and delusions of talent; he apparently has no idea how out of place such mugging is in a story like this. (He must have forgotten Rule 127.5D from the \"Book Of Acting\", which states: \"Never mug while in a sci-fi film, especially while you wear tons of make-up and a Rastafarian hair-do.\") This movie will also go down in history as an embarrassing failure by the Scientologists to bring the work of the Exalted One, Master of the Universe, Darth Hubbard, to the lowly masses of man-animals.The story is like the brain of a Hollywood Scientologist: full of holes. Terl regards the humans as beings incapable of doing almost anything, and yet he is supposed to know a lot about them (and how could he not, given his race has been on Earth for a millennium?). Question: if he knows so much about them then how is it that he displays so bafflingly little of that knowledge when he discusses human behaviour with Whitaker? It's absolutely idiotic that Travolta's race has ruled Earth for a 1000 years, yet they seem confused why a dog is more co-operative than a human - yet \"isn't useful for manual labour\". They don't even know what humans like to eat! (There is an utterly pointless, ludicrous segment where Travolta decides to let a group of humans escape so that he can see what their favourite food is, and later use that knowledge as \"leverage\" over them!) An alien master race, which has spread all over the galaxy, surely must be intelligent and advanced enough to at least have basic knowledge of their conquered slave races and not underrate anyone; in this movie the superior aliens underestimate humans to the point of mind-boggling silliness - to the point where their home planet gets blown to bits. (I don't think even fire-crackers catch fire this quickly. Terl's planet has evidently been covered with gasoline... Science fiction has never seen such ease in blowing up an entire planet. You see, their atmosphere is highly unstable\u0085 Senator Palpatine could have saved so much money if he had simply nuked the planets he wanted blown up.) The aliens are comic-book arrogant, i.e. not in a quiet, superior way but in a childish, boastful way! Listening to these aliens talk, one would get the impression that they must still be in their equivalent of the Middle Ages, and not a technologically advanced master race, rulers of the galaxy. Hubbard, the moron, hasn't thought this through at all. Also, isn't it a \"bit\" too much that a small group of humans - only one of whom has any kind of scientific knowledge - not only beat the aliens but actually even destroy their planet?! For 1000 years Earthlings have been obedient slaves to their alien masters, and suddenly there is an organized revolt, and in no time are the aliens beaten and Planet Psychlo blown to bits! \"Hey, why didn't we do this earlier?!\" \u2013 a question no-one asks but should. And how about cave people getting trained within days to fly fighter jets! (\"Piece o' cake!... Piece o' cake!...\"; the fact that one of the humans keeps saying it's a piece of cake doesn't make it so, but I guess the cheesy Oprahesque point of the movie is that \"you can do anything when driven by determination\".) Hubbard doesn't even possess basic knowledge of physics - a major embarrassment for any sci-fi writer - which he displays when the character \"Zete\" says that he hates \"puny, undersized planets\" because their gravities are \"so different\"; this implies that planet Psychlo is large - which means its inhabitants should be shorter than humans due to a larger gravity - not three heads taller. And what's this about him hating it because it's \"so different\": wouldn't a hot-shot from outer space know the difference between higher and lower gravities?? Of course he would; he should have said: \"I hate these puny planets because their gravities are so much lower\" (or higher - in Hubbard's universe). But I forget: Psychlos are MORON conquerors.The movie would have been somewhat less silly (and yet still unbelievably silly) had all the Psychlos been speaking their language at all times, with English sub-titles below. Instead, Travolta's squeaky voice is in stark contrast to his make-up, costume, and \"grand\" physical appearance. Whitaker, on the other hand, has a deep, booming voice which helped him get away from this movie without appearing/sounding too laughable. (Plus, he is a considerably better actor than Travolta; that's the other reason.) When we laugh at Whitaker it's because his dialog is dumb, but when we laugh at Travolta we laugh at everything about him.\"Psychlo\"... What a dumb word. (Based on Hubbard's hatred towards psychiatrists. Naturally, every loon hates shrinks.) We also have \"gastrones\" (or gas drones?). Gastrones are the military forces that conquer. So when they talked about sending gastrones, it always sounded to me like Psychlos were sending their food experts to prepare some delicacies for the invaded races. Or how about \"planet-ship\"??!!... Why not \"sun-laser\"? Or \"nebula-destructor\"? Or \"lightyear-orbiter\"? To read a loving tribute of BE, google \"vjetropev battlefield earth\".",

            "content": "This is truly a horrid movie. But (maybe..) worth watching once because it's an instant, modern camp classic.Now, if you notice, I only submit bad reviews to this site, but that's because bad movies are a hobby of sorts for me. I'm one who thinks you can learn more about film from bad movies than good ones, and if there is any thuth to that, every film student's thesis should be written about Battlefield Earth.You don't just wonder what they were thinking. You're amazed that so many people had to be so incompetent for this movie to get released. It defies comprehension. They had the budget, some (well, ok.. ) 'capable' (servicable might be a better term) actors.. so how could any outfit fail so miseraby?It's an amazing film in all the ways that it sucks. It combines all the elements of a horrid film - employs characters which don't develop in any way, that you don't care about (or even root against), who act in very irrational or excessively stupid ways for the purpose of lengthening the film or serving the plot. The very worst part of all (and how you can do this I've no idea) is that the movie is boring and abrasive at the same time. It's like repeatedly being stabbed while still being in that place between sleep and awake where you don't really care about anything.The crawl at the beginning, as well as the constant screen wipes, are a complete rip-off of Star Wars. I hesitate to even mention that film in this review. Worse yet, the script spends about a third of the film playing out things that you already know from the crawl! That aliens or whatever took over earth and killed most of the humans, the ones who still live are living in mostly tribal cultures. But, you're still subjected to quite a lot of them 'discovering' what is going on... which you were told before the movie even started. Why waste my time like that?Immediately, the cheese in this movie starts to get thick. You get the Hero (tm) riding a white horse, his love interest, the crotchety old tribal elder, the Hero knowing the truth though no one believes him... blah blah blah.Soon you start to notice that the screenplay is completely offensive to watch. In an effort to be 'cutting-eduge', a lot of the film is short from these tilted camera angles, what you would see if you tilted your head 45 degrees to one side. When it's not giving you a neck cramp from the camera angles, ripping off Star Wars with screen wipes, ripping off John Woo (poorly) with rapidly changing camera angles during combat scenes, you are treated (ahem) to gratutious use of slow-motion. Yes, there is more slow-motion here than in a whole season's worth of Monday Night Football. It's all part of a directorial scheme that really seems very patronizing to the viewer.Details in virtually ever scene evoke that \"yeah, right\" reflex from the viewer. Such as, in the shopping mall where the glass is still relatively clean (after 1,000 years), characters using 20th century phrases such as \"the grass is greener on the other side\" or \"piece of cake\", which have apparently survived 1,000 years worth of dialect evolution and humanity's near extinction. Or, when Ker doesn't notice the \"hidden\" camera (obviously in view of anyone with half a brain, and on top of that, it makes loud noises when it zooms!). But, good thing Travolta just-so-happens to have placed these cameras in the city sewers (we all know how much excitement there is down there), or he never would have seen our hero escaping. Other intelligence-insulting garbage occurs, such as when the cave-people learn to pilot fighter jets in a week, nuclear warheads are found in still-working order 1,000 years in the future,The alien costumes are pretty retarded, but I can't really complain because that fits the aliens, who have to be the stupidest race ever to conquer a planet and enslave a race. For example, the aliens are very intersted in gold, but didn't seem to locate Fort Knox. Or worse yet, when the enslaved humans are sent to mine gold (which, in this movie, is found in big chunks in the ground), and they come back with gold bars, the aliens think nothing of it. huh? The slang the Psychlos use is puzzling too. They call humans \"man-animals\", but just call dogs \"dogs\". They refer to air as \"breath-gas\", and the hidden cameras not as cameras, but \"picto-cameras\". Oooh! How high tech that sounds!You get the idea. Picture a movie that tried to be Star Wars. Now, subtract any sort of compelling storyline, any well-done action scenes at all, any characters that you care about their survival. Make the hero(s) stupid and the villians even more stupid. And still, the whole comes out to be less than the sum of its parts.Run - don't walk - away from this piece of crap. And if you like bad movies - don't bother. You can't laugh at this. It's just unwatchable. To borrow a phrase, this smacks of the Yiddish theatre in space.To be accurate with my overall rating, I might have to use negative scientific notation. But, I'll just leave it at 0/10. I could actually feel myself becoming stupider with each passing minute.",

            "content": "I originally wrote a review about this movie after only seeing parts of it. Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely, I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First, a summary of my old first review:Battlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting, but after zapping regularly between the two, it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie, it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same, the action scenes were bad, the dialogue was horrible, and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever, where everything repeats endlessly. So, eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.Now, after having seen it in its entirety, I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score, but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness: it gets a solid one.The whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight: the story on itself is preposterous \u2014 I'll come back to this later on. Yet, even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie, but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful: it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slow-motion shots, but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that close-ups and slow-motion would be used to focus on the action, but not here: the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action, they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off: scenes just drag along, and are then followed by a pile-up of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table, but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue, which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad sci-fi TV show from around 1990, stretched to almost two hours.Funny enough, I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really, what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then, but it's just ridiculous if *every* shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa, so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camera-work that is awful: there is an overuse of close-ups, and often half of an actor's face is cut off (partially due to the tilting). Sometimes we also get close-ups of random objects as if they are of great significance, but they aren't.The acting is bad, not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.The special effects probably looked OK back in 2000, except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now, it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie, but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.Now, by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes, even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG-13 but ironically enough, the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous, and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However, the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the \"nuking the fridge\" scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1, meaning \"never ever watch this\", I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl, but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously, it could be worth it.The only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score, but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins, the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.Overall, Battlefield Earth is a complete failure, and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100.",

I consider myself a lover of bad movies, movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success.  \"Battlefield Earth\" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.I saw this movie because I expected it to be bad, and even I was shocked at how bad it was.  Just plain bad.  In nearly every respect.I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic.  And they were loud.  So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed.  Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen.  Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), \"Battlefield Earth\" is already being compared to \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\" In my book, it's a fair comparison.Take the direction.  Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything.  The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.The effects, well \"Plan 9\" had pie tins in strings.  \"Battlefield Earth\" has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment.  Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.Gaping continuity?  Well, \"Plan 9\" had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars.  In \"Battlefield Earth\", the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future.  Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week.  How did they learn you ask?  Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course, somehow still working on electricity 1,000 years in the future.  More?  The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle.  How do they still work?  They found fresh batteries?  Next Duracels I see, they better say \"Best if used before 3005.\"Is \"Battlefield Earth\" worse than \"Plan 9\"?  I'd have to say yes.  \"Plan 9\" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh.  Just fun to watch.  After about an hour of \"Earth\" I wanted to hurt someone.  After two hours and it was still going, I wanted to hurt myself.  Avoid, even for lovers of dumb movies.",

In response to comments that I have seen from others, Battlefield Earth is NOT too deep, did my undergraduate in Philosophy, I know Ancient Greek and Latin and study Plato... no third rate sci-fi writer from the 20th century is going to get over on me. Battlefield Earth is NOT too bleak... I like bleak post-apocalypse films, the darker the better.  Battlefield Earth is simply too stupid.This film failed as a thriller/drama, because the characters were so wooden and unbelievable that I really did not care one little bit about anything that they did or what happened to them.  And the acting and dialogue were so horrendous that I felt like I was watching a highschool play.It failed as sci-fi because it did not tell us anything about ourselves or the human condition, and the science was a bit too fictional.It failed as an action film, because the action scenes were done poorly. Slo-mo, tilted cameras and echo-chambers do NOT heighten drama on their own, they must be used in conjunction with something else.It failed as a promotion of Scientology, because the only lesson that I got from it was that if you are mad at one member of a race of people then it is apparently ok to commit genocide on them as a whole.  I saw no evidence in the film that the human characters were justified in blowing up the whole psychlo planet, beyond the fact that a more reasonable solution would have been too complex for Hubbard or the cast and crew of the film to understand.And the fact that when the psychlo planet blows up I felt not one iota of excitement or joy, or even anger, just sort of an extension of the emptiness that I felt through most of the film. This is not some liberal whining about the evils of imperialism or anything, if the plot had demonstrated to me that the planet should be blown up and the psychlos wiped out I would have cheered and yelped like an idiot, but I simply don't remember that part of the plot.  All I saw was that Terl was a jerk so the psychlos must die, if that is the lesson that Scientology wants to teach, then I think we should be a bit concerned.This film was so remarkably bad that I began laughing about 10 minutes into it and stopped soon after.  After sitting in the theater for what felt like days, I looked at watch to see that only an hour had passed.  I communicated this fact to my friends who responded in horror.  We stayed to the end, but it was not worthwhile.This film has replaced Popeye the Movie as the worst film I have ever seen, because it had a huge budget, relatively talented cast and crew and still was not particularly more interesting than watching a blank screen for 2 hours.  Big budget films continue to get lamer and lamer while American tastes and standards continue to decline.The 'tributes' to older sci-films (or just rip-offs) sucked, I was unimpressed by the little Blade Runner montage at the beginning (as that whole scene just sucked), as I was by what appeared to be a remake of the infamous riot scenes in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (is that the right one?  the second to last film anyway), which was itself based on the Watts riots.  There were other examples, but those were the two lamest.I won't even get into the inconsistencies and improbabilities of the plot, because they have been well-documented elsewhere, and besides, they are not the reason that this film was so bad.  The 1000 year old fighter planes, the man-animals flying harriers, the flight simulators at Ft. Bragg (which I am assured are not there) all would have been fine in a film that was not created by the mentally impared.  This film was so bad, and so lame, and so terrible that it will be the yardstick against which all bad sci-fi will be measured in the future.Comparing this film to Ed Wood's work would be an insult, as Wood at least appeared to love film.  This movie is almost toxic in its disrespect for both its medium and its audience.",

One of the humans, Jonnie, is captured and wastes no time trying to escape constantly, in spite of every. Single. Attempt. Failing(pathetically, even, and usually for the same reason... and yet he eventually, unbelievably, becomes a forward-thinking flippin' genius). And somehow, Terl(Travolta, who chews so much scenery that you can barely believe that there's any left for Whitaker to chow down on... unfortunately, there is, and we are thus denied a single acting performance in this that is not awful), the security chief(whose scheming to get out of that job and out into the galaxy, conquering, where he feels he belongs, is one of the closest things we get to anything interesting... sadly it takes up fairly little of screen time), not only doesn't think anything of it, he *teaches him stuff that could extremely obviously be turned against him*(I know that they supposedly think little of us, but there's gotta be a limit to that notion). It's like the two species are having a contest of who can be stupider. The quality of being dumb, when seen in a mainstream movie(not something indie) tends to be played for laughs, or used to evoke sympathy. Here, it's straight, obnoxious and intolerable throughout. We're supposed to care about these guys(whose ignorance extends to not realizing statues and mannequins *weren't humans or gods*). And fear these... hammy Jamaicans(seriously, a bunch of the time, they laugh maniacally, even at each other). We do neither. The sets are bland, grimy and boring. Dialog is horrible. I'd say roughly a third of the shots... think about that for a second... are Dutch, meaning, the camera tilted to the side. Not only does it lose its effect within the opening minutes of this(!), it gets to be genuinely disorienting, to where it'll look like someone is walking on the wall, or facing an odd direction, etc. The horrid nature of the FX is beyond abysmal. And this has very little to do with Scientology... I don't care about L. Ron Hubbard or the religion, this is and would be pure crap regardless of that. There is mild language and disturbing content in this. The RiffTrax for this is hilarious and helps immensely in dulling the pain that this induces, and rewatching this with that, as I did, can help a lot to restore a chunk of the faith in humanity that you may have lost in your initial viewing. I recommend this to those who refuse to listen to the warnings of those of us who are unlucky enough to have watched this tripe. 1/10",

My dad actually changed the channel halfway through because we couldn't stomach watching any more of it.I watched it all the way through the next day and immediately regretted it. I'll start with some of the many plot holes, and trust me there are a LOT of them.The aliens supposedly defeated the powerful human military's of the world 1000 years ago, yet a bunch of cave men looking people were able to overpower them with ease, yeah effing right.-The humans are able to use electronics at one point, despite the fact that 1000 years have passed and they still work with no problem.-The movie takes place in Denver, yet after 1000 years one of the cavemen has a British accent.There are too many more to list, so I'll end by saying that John Travolta can hope and beg people to see this travesty all he wants, he's only digging a deeper grave of denial.",

He squeals and shrieks in high-octave girlish tones! He does not need to portray all two of his emotions (mad, sad!) with headache-inducing screeches!!!! Mad banshee screams and the spouting of Euclydian mathematics between the sniffing of food like a dog and occasional shouts of \"Ug!!\" sure is funny to watch, though!It was amusing watching Roger Christian struggle to give a sound excuse for his terrible directing. There are bucket-loads of references made to Star Wars and George Lucas throughout the Special Features section (how shameful). Visual effects producers proudly proclaim how they borrowed so-and-so effect from LucasFilm Inc. Mr Christian waffles on about how much he loves Science fiction (well, dhuh, he DID partake in three Star Wars flicks) and speaks of the grand-fatherly support he received from Mr Lucas.A skinny little guy tries to explain why they had to film every scene at that ridiculous neck-breaking dutch angle. His explanation was that all the scenes filmed at normal angles were cast into the cutting-room rubbish bin simply because they \"didn't work\". What sad excuse is that!We will not go into detail on those awful Star Wars wipes that occur every second scene.The majority of the positive reviews are based in California. Is that where Scientologists congregate in their largest numbers? All these Scientologists giving their rosy reviews are only trying to:1) Defend their Mentor (Mr John Revolta)2) and their God (L Ron Hubbard)Do they realize this, ahem, \"movie\" received the award for \"worst film of 2001\"?Finally I mustn't forget Mr John Revolta in his worst performance ever! Revolta wasn't even slightly funny. His Terl was annoying, stupid, irritating and a complete hack. How idiots like these Psychlo's could defeat any planet whether or not it's advanced is totally beyond my comprehension.\nDid Revolta partake in Shakespearean stage acting to achieve the putzy moron that is Terl?A well deserved 0/10!",

It's not half as bad as you've heard, if you fulfil a couple of criteria first.1 - Don't take it seriously. This isn't an Oscar Winning Drama 2 - It helps if you don't mind watching movies for fun sometimes. Some people seem to hate anything that is less than Oscar winning perfection, but let's face it, few things are.I'm not going to say this is perfect. Some scientology types like to defend it against all odds. Others like to totally pan it beyond reason. Ask yourself this. Are you the type of person who enjoyed watching Independence day? Or Waterworld? Or the Matrix? These are all films so full of plot holes, cheesy lines, and over-the-top action, they'd sink in the dead sea. Yet they are also (for the most part) good fun, switch-your-brain-off B-movies that most people enjoy a few hours watching. Battlefield Earth is no better or worse. I love genuine, serious SF from The Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001, through to Gattaca or Dark City. I also enjoy a good old-fashioned joy ride from the same genre.Sure, it has some plot-holes you could sail the Titanic through, but it harks back to those old 50s science fiction movies, like This Island Earth, or Invaders from Mars, with inventive (if unbelievable and unrealistic) fun. You can tell Travolta is having a great time playing the villain, and if you just go along for the ride, you may just have a good time too. For those who say this is the worst movie they've seen, all I can say is, they've not seen a truly bad movie yet. Ignore the Scientology roots. I've certainly seen far worse blockbusters that get praised beyond reason.There are better things you could do with your time than watch Battlefield Earth, but you can say that about any film. The trick is, if you want some popcorn fun for a couple of relaxing hours, you could do far, FAR worse, than waste your time watching this! ;-)",

The film itself makes Dune look like Star trek as far as having any entertainment value. This film has been panned by pretty much every critic with a medium to publicly air their criticisms.     Anyone calling this movie great is either a Scientologist forced to spew positive propaganda concerning their cult, or is a person who hasn't had as much experience watching films.

It got progressively, astonishingly bad.I already had John Travolta down as one of those hit-or-miss actors - brilliant in a few films such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Saturday Night Fever', but pretty awful in most everything else, except now he's taken a step into the bizarre, as well as giving a display of extraordinarily bad acting. And Barry Pepper who I quite like will never play this one down, although I do give him credit for his personal acting performance.The slide-out transition screens were reminiscent of the lowest budget TV sci-fi adventure imaginable and I suppose, over time, I'm going to think of one after another of ridiculous implausibilities, plot holes, insults to my intelligence, etc, but for now I'm leaving it at that - just an amazingly crumby film.

When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking, \"Oh boy, this is going to be hilarious.\" Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering, \"What's so bad about it?\" I'm wondering, \"Where do I even start?\" How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically, a race of aliens called the \"Psychlos\" take over Earth following a nine minute battle (yes, nine minutes). A thousand years later, the last remaining humans become hunter-gatherers. But, the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl, played by John Travolta, is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet, decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me, or is that really stupid? Plus, there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example: A group of tribal men, who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie, get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later, there going all \"Star Wars\" fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly, how were they able to master it in one day? There's more, but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements, it would become really, really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is, according to dictionary.com, \"a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on him/her and his/her attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe.\" Not only is that A, fake, but it's also B, stupid, and C, a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear, there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad, which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one, not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious, annoying, stupid, douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid, he's the smartest alien ever, and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie, I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a sci-fi movie, you think of CGI. Yes, Battlefield Earth has it, but it sucks. I've seen B-movies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake, the lasers are copy-paste with a ripple effect when it hits, the explosions lack impact, the scenery is bland, and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear, there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! I-it just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue, that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall, this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie, it's the soundtrack, which is somewhat decent (I use that term loosely). This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a B-Movie, it would have been decent because of its humor (yes, the movie is pretty unintentionally funny). As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers, which it is, it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap.",

Grunting is a universal language as well, just like English, which has survived 1000 years intact. Even the various tribes of man will speak the same dialect and have no trouble communicating and organizing a revolution. Grunting is instrumental in fooling your captors.The only animal to survive the last thousand years besides humans are horses and rats, and the horses kept their saddles.There is no humor in the future.The only people who can survive an alien invasion and subsequent enslavement and/or isolation are Caucasian. Asians, Africans, Latinos and various others went extinct long ago. For some reason though, there are one or two in the movie without any explanation as to how they would come to be. There is no humor in the future. Those races do exist among the aliens, however; and as portrayed by Forest Whitaker, are complete morons and inferior to the Caucasians, and in his case, inferior to humans.There are massive stores of gold in Washington D.C. close to where they keep the Harrier jets and suitcase nukes.Euclidean Geometry is simple.Having \"leverage\" over someone is everything. If you have \"leverage\" you can do whatever you like and they will stand dumbfounded while listening to you explain your \"leverage\" in great detail. Even if you show them your \"leverage\" and they threaten you with a beam weapon, they won't shoot because you have \"leverage\".If you happen across a weapons warehouse, there will be power on to essential things like the flight simulator, the projector, and the nuclear weapons batteries will be fully charged and all futuristic looking. Be careful with the bomb though, the trigger is on the inside, somewhere around a fuse that says \"warning\"... (there is no humor in the future) but if you remove it you'll be fine for a few minutes; just enough time to show it to everyone.Time and space are altered a bit; every now and then time will inexplicably slow down.Sometimes the evil aliens race will use the beam gun, but most of the time they'll use the same gun to shoot a physical projectile. There seems to be no difference between the two, except for their marksmanship. When using the beam gun, they will hit you every time, you need not even try to run. When using the flash-bang weapon, they simply can't hit you; instead laying waste to your surroundings.Anyone can fly a Harrier jet.The glass that the aliens use for the dome appears to be almost a foot thick as it hits the ground, but this doesn't change the impact of a couple boxes of ammunition and explosives from causing a severe chain reaction when detonated from a central location on top of the dome. The dome will quite neatly implode and very little debris will actually hit the ground, just enough for dramatic effect. Time will be altered at these moments, so you can get a good look at how thick the glass is. There is no humor in the future.I forgot to mention that when you implode the dome, various buildings will start blowing up... for no particular reason.Blowing an aliens arm off will only perplex him and make him docile.\"Vaporize\" means to kill or behead, and it's not funny because there is no humor in the future.If you learn the alien language and you are the only human to do so, rest assured that humans have lost all intellectual curiosity and will never bother asking you what they are saying, or ask what you are discussing with them. They will stand by and seem content to let you handle everything.When you blow up a massive planet, instead of turning into a star or imploding as you might expect, it will disintegrate completely. It's former mass will somehow alter space in such a way as to have no relativistic implications like causing a black hole or even leave debris.Men will outnumber women some 10 to 1.Batteries, fuel, and various other seemingly limited-shelf-life things - from our current understanding of them - will last several hundred or even thousands of years as long as they aren't used.Because man is so primitive and needy, machismo is a thing of the past, so is humor. If there is a perceived leader, no one will question his authority. Not to mention, if you jokingly ask about his woman and where she might be, he will attack you. There is no humor in the future.There is no humor in the future.These are only a few of the things I became to know while viewing this masterpiece. No wonder Scientology is the greatest religion ever. One day I hope to be rich and famous so that I, too, can become a Scientologist. Once I am a Scientologist I will make movies about it. I will prove once and for all that all other \"Science-Fiction\" is nonsense, and incorporate everything I learned from L. Ron Hubbard into my movies which everyone will watch because I am famous. I will even act in these movies, I'd like to play the hero but if by the time I am rich and famous I am too old to do so... I'll just play the bad guy. Everyone will take me seriously because I am famous. When you are rich and famous it is implied that you are smart, therefore you are worthy of being listened to.

But the costumes in this case deserve special attention. Were they bad? Let's put it this way: To call them worse than wearing a gown made from frozen puke would be demeaning to frozen puke. You know those shoes that the Spice Girls wore about 10 years ago with really tall soles? That's what John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker wore the entire movie.

I have no knowledge of Scientology nor do I wish to have any (that goes for most other religions as well) but it does seem to me that the spectre of Scientology looms over the movie. There seems to be an enmity towards the film that is unjustly transferred from the controversy surrounding the religion. Even with better execution the movie would have had to get past this controversy thing. It is almost impossible to do a remote postmortem on the production. I do think the finger can be reasonably pointed at the top executives & perhaps narrowed down to poor counsel to them or excessive interference by them. Many good stories & books have been lost in translation to the movie medium by the same management problems. I actually found the film to be watchable enough but then I was raised on cheap 50s monster movies. There are monumental plot holes in many of them too so I guess I have a bigger tolerance than a younger & more sophisticated audience. I for one feel sorry that Travolta lost so much money on the project. One last curious fact.

Everything you heard about \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" is true!\"Battlefield Lame\" is based on the novel written by L. Ron Hubbard, the creator of the (in)famous Scientology church(The religion of the rich and famous)In the year 3000 the good old planet Earth is lay waste by a race of vicious extraterrestrial creeps called the Psychlos which have slaved the planet. Apparently 90% of the population of earth died laughing at their ridiculous visage: a sort of Cowardly Lion meets Chewbacca meets Uruk-hai warrior. A few of the non slave humans survive in the wild without any kind of technology, living as primitives. One of them, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, who looks like Clint Howard with an anorexic Matthew Lillard combined) is taken prisoner.(Spoilers)In captivity he plans revolution and thanks of the sheer stupidity of the Psychlos, the crappy script and a healthy diet of rats (don't ask) he gets away with it, a final battle is set, primitives humans who knew nothing about technology learn how to fly combat jets in a few days in flight simulators with only repeating \"Piece of cake, piece of cake\" as a motto. Then is Psychlos v/s humans. Who will win?...(End Spoilers)\nAccording to John Travolta this is a movie he wanted to make for more than 20 years in honor of his dear mentor Mr. Hubbard. It seems that the wait was in vain. Apparently the filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie, they were dreaming another \"Star Wars\" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising, action figures and promotion, several spin off were planned before the premiere(including a sequel and even an animation series!) but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got \"Robot Monster\", \"Plan 9 of Outer Space\", \"Manos, The Hands of Fate\", \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\", \"Terror from the Year 5000\" and \"Mommie Dearest\" all rolled into one.This lifeless, cliche ridden waste of film is one of the worst movies ever made. No doubt about it. Everything that made the cinema art great is wrong in this one. Terrible script, inept direction, ugly photography and lighting, lame editing, overblown sound, obtrusive camera angles, run of the mill special effects and the acting MY GOD! the acting is incredible bad. The entire cast is making fool of themselves but it seems they thought they were doing Shakespeare in space. The urge of bursting into laughter after reading those lines must have being difficult to repress during the filming. And even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice Travolta hysterical overacting (who takes his character waaaay too seriously, channeling Vincent Vega by the way of Danny Suko with a little bit of Tony Manero on crack) and Forest Whitaker face of complete embarrassment. I felt sorry for Barry Pepper who must have signed the dotted line thinking this part would be his big break. I hope his career recovers. And why is Richard Tyson doing the role of Tarzan in the future? Or is Deathstalker? Or Yor? My favorite is Kim Coates in the role of Carlo, world's biggest wimp and useless sidekick who spent the entire movie cowering in fear, arm waving, over reacting, and eye popping in extreme his green eyes, you'll swear he is Marty Feldman in disguise.See it to believe it.

It's a bad film, there's no question about that, but at least it's not `Baby Geniuses' bad, and the words `Golan Globus' don't appear anywhere in the opening sequence.In a thousand years, humans will become filthy, stupid savages living in communal groups in the mountains, according to this film based on the late L. Ron Hubbard's mediocre book of the same name.  The earth is now ruled by Psychlos, who wear go-go boots and have Della Reese dead-poodle-on-head hairstyles.

Hissing and mincing about, he seems less like the officer of an alien outpost than he does an intergalactic interior designer.  Scene changes are jarring; one moment the humans are held prisoner inside the `dome', the climate-controlled Psychlo greenhouse, and the next moment they are climbing a mountain.  How did they get there?  One moment Johnny's girlfriend is leaving the human encampment, and the next moment she's a prisoner.  How did that happen?  The editors must have snipped this film until it bled.There are plot holes big enough to drive a Psychlo through:  why didn't the humans make sure the guns were loaded when they revolted in Terl's office? How could the humans learn where the Harrier jets were, fix them up, locate fuel, and learn to fly in only seven days?  The neck-collar things were so loose and ungainly that one could simply take them off and throw them away. Why in the world would anyone destroy a load-bearing arch?  Any just why did Johnny, after learning all about the Psychlos in the teaching machine, begin explaining things about Euclidean geometry to his friends?  Wasn't Euclid a human?  On top of all that, how can one atomic warhead destroy an entire planet?It's comforting to know that english accents will still be around a thousand years from now, when they will come in handy for either the advice-giving wise old man or the haughty Psychlo commander.  The director fudged a perfect opportunity to turn this into a camp film by not incorporating a certain song by the Talking Heads, complete with John Travolta blasting humans to bits with his weapon:  `Psychlo killer, qu'est que c'est\u0085fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\u0085'  Oh, the lost possibilities.  Tarantino should have directed this film.",

Its good in a 1950's pulp sci-fi sort of way. Then again what did anyone expect since L Ron Hubbard's work always was pure low grade pulp material. Of course the book's wild over length made any hope of a reasonable length adaptation impossible, as is it a severely shortened version of the first half of the book.No its not a great movie, but it a decent one even if it has one of John Travolta's worst performances, something that are becoming a dime a dozen these days.I'm not saying you should buy the damn thing, all I saying is try it on cable. Its mindless fun...and it has one of one of my all time favorite endings.(And just be thankful this movie tanked since they would have filmed the other half of the 1000+ page novel.)",

I find it to be one of the more readable science fiction epics with a great story, plenty of action, and interesting characters.The film, however, dumbs-down the story, characters and action so much that all the good qualities of the book are completely lost.  Very rarely do screen adaptions match the appeal of the book, but Battlefield Earth's concoction of idiotic characters, plot holes, bad acting, and lapses in logic came from ineptness and not from any demands of the film medium.With this one film director Roger Christian has shot to the top of my \"Really Bad Directors List\", easily replacing the likes of Michael Bay and Simon West.  Christian's reliances on wipes and tilted camera angles doesn't cover up the fact that he has no clue how to frame a scene or how to get his cinematographer to use more than a 40-watt lightbulb to light the picture.Critics long feared that this movie would have been a Scientology propoganda flick due to the author of the book.  From what little I know about Scientology I can't find any of it in this picture and I think that's a shame.  Such a picture would be far more interesting than this waste of time.",

But whether or not you're Christian, Muslim or Hindu, you know that one religion is more dangerous than any other: Scientology. Because no other religion in the history of mankind has spawned a movie as abysmally awful as the majestic super-turkey Battlefield Earth.The plot, if there was one, concerns a group of very ugly and expendable people locked up somewhere 1000 years after an alien race called 'Psychlos' (which is a combination of 'psychos' and the 'L' in L. Ron Hubbard) has destroyed civilization as we know it (kind of like Janet Jackson at the Superbowl). Also, the aliens are people with contact lenses, big heads and dreadlocks. Um... Yeah. That about sums it up. There's also a \"hero\", played (?) by Barry Pepper, an ugly old priest-something to whom the sixties weren't too good, and a dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend who has nothing to do but mope.John Travolta camps around with awful lines, laughing like an idiot, possibly in a state of suppressed panic as he slowly starts to realize that he's possibly not doing his pal L. Ron Hubbard a favor by starring in this film. The technical and factual flaws are too many to list and so obvious it's like the makers were joking. If that is the case, hardy f-ing har, big laughs! The goofs range from minor nuisances like the fact that Travolta's character speaks English when he's supposedly speaking Psychlon, to miles-wide plot holes like how the Harriers can still run after 1000 years, or how unprotected books are still intact.So, the cringe-worthy performances and holes you could put Peter Harryson's butt through aside, can Battlefield Earth at least count as \"silly fun\"? Why, of course not! Every skewed shot, every mindless scene of this movie seems intent on making the viewing experience as unpleasant for the viewer as possible. If they're not out of focus, the shots are likely to be ruined by one-colour filters, but what can you really expect when the director is doped up all throughout shooting? Barry Pepper is so bad as the supposed \"hero\" the makers could just as well have slapped a Cheney mask on a traffic light and called it acting. The only reason I even remember the name of his non-character is because it is so offensively stupid (how lame is 'Johnny Goodboy', seriously?!) I recommend the PC game of the similar name. The movie, on the other hand, you should avoid like a rabid Doberman with AIDS. That is all.(r#24)",

The Psychlos are represented primarily by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker, but their brand of Disney villainy extends only to constant bickering which may well be unintentionally hilarious but it's not the least bit menacing. Indeed Travolta makes for one of the worst screen villains in recent memory, his Terl coming across as petulant, stroppy and very, very campy rather than the terrifying monster the film is so desperately crying out for. It's this need to keep things safe so the little 'uns won't be scared that saps any sense of danger from proceedings. I mean, his big evil plot is to use the humans to mine gold on the side so he can retire. Hardly Earth-shattering stuff. . .Still, it's not all bad. Barry Pepper as the heroic Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is magnificent, expertly capturing the awesome personal charisma of the character and - oh who am I kidding? He's as dull as dishwater.The modest budget shows in every frame, and much of it appears to have been filmed in the same warehouse re-dressed numerous times. It's all shot in tight close ups at wonky angles in an ill-fated attempt to hide the generally cheap nature of the thing. Right down to the hair extensions and prosthetic Psychlo hands it all has a compromised, that'll-do feel.There are huge holes in the plot. And I'm talking about several of them. Gaping ones with barbed wire fencing and flashing warning signs around them to stop audiences falling in. However they're not as jaw-droppingly stupid as the massive chunks they either forgot or couldn't afford to include. But then again this is a film where spending a few hours in a library can enable a man who can't read to become knowledgeable on just about everything - including besting a warrior race at military strategy - and a couple of days in a flight simulator means you become an expert fighter pilot. Logic is not Battlefield Earth's strong point.Neither is its score, a truly dreadful effort in which even the instruments it's played on sound like they were found in a skip.The final battle is spectacularly inept, and springs from nowhere with no build-up. It's quite amusing actually; before you realise it's started it's there in front of you and then it's not.But the most staggering thing about the film is that not only was it not knocked together by a bunch of disinterested monkeys, it was in fact a labour of love for John Travolta. This is something he'd wanted to make for years, so how it turned out so indescribably, monumentally atrocious is a mystery.",

Ron Hubbard's impressive science fiction novel \"Battlefield Earth\" comes to the big screen-and it's one of the ugliest, most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. Let's not beat around the bush here, \"Battlefield Earth,\" everything you have heard about this movie's badness is true. Actually, I debated whether to even write this review since so many critics have rightfully bashed the movie already. However, the duty of a film critic is to pan the bad and praise the good movies. I am hardly going to betray my roots for a piece of trash like \"Battlefield Earth.\"The \"screenplay\" by Corey Mandell is unorganized and riddled with problems. The special effects convey some of the most phony, cheesy, and superficial computer animation ever seen on screen. Even big stars John Travolta and Forest Whitaker become lost in the material. They contribute the worst performances of their lives. To save time, name any aspect of \"Battlefield Earth\" and it's probably terrible.Produced by Jonathan D. Krane, Elie Samaha, and John Travolta, and on a budget of over 70 million, \"Battlefield Earth\" was not a cheep mistake. Hollywood needs to be more careful with its precious money. Movies are not a medium in which angry filmmakers can heap garbage at America. This film bombed at the box office and will haunt the producers to their graves. Thank God America spit at this despicable mess of a motion picture.\nThe most shocking thing about this movie is the massive talent involved. John Travolta is a multiple Academy Award nominated actor. The Cannes Film Festival rewarded Forest Whitaker the best actor award a few years ago. Berry Pepper starred in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning WWII epic \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The director is two-time Academy Award-winner Roger Christian. Designer Patrick Tatopoulos helped on such blockbusters as \"Independence Day\" and \"Stuart Little.\" Speaking of \"Independence Day,\" the Best Visual Effects Academy Award winner from that film, Joe Wiskocil, also worked on \"Battlefield Earth.\" Some of Hollywood's biggest producers, including Travolta himself, gambled big bucks on this project. With so much talent involved and so much going for it, how in the world could this movie be this bad?All of those award winning film contributors now have a whole crap load of contradictory awards to add to their shelves. \"Battlefield Earth\" won big at the Razzie Awards-winning the worst picture of the year, worst actor of the year (Travolta), worst director of the year, worst on screen couple of the year (John Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him), worst screenplay, worst supporting actor (Pepper and Whitaker), and worst supporting actress (Kelly Preston). This alone should raise a flag for anyone who still wants to see \"Battlefield Earth.\"There is no sense in explaining the movie's plot or listing the countless flaws in the production. It would take too long, waste too much space, and you would not care anyway. However, if I can still convince just one person not to waste their life away on this film-just one person-then I have done my job.",

There is actually a bit to like...although the final 1/4 of the film that is mind-bogglingly stupid! The film begins like a bazillion or a thousand years in the future...whatever. The Earth is now a craptastic wasteland filled with either stupid tribal humans or nasty Psychlos. The Psychlos took over the planet long ago and laid waste to it--leaving only tattered remnants of the past such as burned out cities. I won't bore you with needless details of the plot, though I actually was intrigued about a dystopian future where humans are killed for sport or enslaved--even though it did seem an awful lot like the Planet of the Apes films in many ways. And, the idea of these humans eventually rising up against their oppressors also intrigued me.BUT, as I said, this is a bad film. Throughout, the dialog is very lame and I knew something horrible must be in store--after all, critics were unanimous in their hatred of this film. Towards the final 1/4, what good there was in the film went completely out the window in a plot that made \"Independence Day\" seem very plausible. The smart caveman and the rest of his Flintstone-like pals stumble upon the ancient arsenal at Ft. Hood. And, the equipment is in perfect working condition after all these many centuries. And, the cave-dudes who have zero education and enjoy eating rats and rolling in their own filth suddenly learn, in a matter of just a few days, how to fly Harrier jump-jets, fire tow missiles AND detonate ancient nuclear devices PERFECTLY in order to defeat the Psychlos!!! This would be akin to a kindergarten class defeating the New Orleans Saints in Superbowl 44 or having trained cats beat the Nazis in WWII!! My jaw dropped in disbelief as cave-dudes in ancient jet planes took out alien spacecraft with amazing ease and Earth had a happily ever after ending! Ugghh! Here are my scores for the film, as I have decided for once to break them all down individually (from 1 to 10):Acting--2. John Travolta horribly over-acted and I wondered why he looked like John Travolta in dreadlocks while some of the other Psychlos looked more like Klingons. The human actors had the charisma of dirt---really, really dull and boring dirt.Technical crap/special effects--4. This would be a pretty looking made for the Sci-Fi Channel movie, but as a Hollywood release that cost $179,132,273,492,342,235.38 (more or less), I assumed a tiny percentage of the budget was spent on effects that just looked routine at best.Original story--First portion of the film--5; Second portion--negative 129!

The rumors about the film are mostly true, but the story isn't THAT bad....nothing is!",

            "content": "Battlefield Earth (2000) BOMB (out of 4) I hate bandwagons but I must admit that I'm jumping on one here. Incredibly bad movie set in the future where humans are pretty much an endangered species. They've been murdered off by the evil Psychlos but one human (Barry Pepper) decides to venture out of his safe zone and he's kidnapped by Terl (John Travolta), which sets a new chain of events into motion. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is every bit as bad as you've heard and in many ways it's actually much worse than its reputation. One really has to wonder what on Earth anyone involved in this thing was thinking. The original novel by L. Ron Hubbard is a piece of work I've never read so I can't say whether or not it's bad and they just made a bad movie out of it or perhaps it's good and this movie just messed it up. The biggest problem with this film (and there are many) is the fact that there's no a single second of screen time where you actually care or are interested in what's going on. The entire movie just seems so pointless as you never care for any of the characters, you don't care what happens as the plot moves along and you certainly don't care about anything happening. It's really shocking that a movie from Hollywood could be made without you at least feeling for one single character. Even worse is the dialogue, which is just so bad that most people will be wondering if perhaps the entire film was some sort of bad joke. The performances aren't any better, although out of everyone Pepper comes off the best. Forrest Whitaker isn't horrid but it's rather embarrassing seeing someone with his talent here. The real horrid performance comes from Travolta. Geez, what can be said about him? The performance and character are among the worst you're going to see in the genre and I guess the less said the better. The entire film has a very ugly look to it. The visuals are bad, the cinematography poor and even the music score makes you want to blow your ear drums out. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a complete waste of time and the 117-minute running time just drags by. However, if it wasn't for all the slow motion this thing might have clocked in at under 90-minutes.",

            "content": "Sometimes, you know you're going into a bad movie. It's evident from the trailers, the reviews, the feedback, the history, heck \u2013 the posters even. In most cases for myself, despite all I hear from others, I do all I can to go in with an open mind and give the movie a fresh start. And, typically, a truly horrible movie doesn't begin that way; the set up, plot development, atmosphere and characters typically don't sink the movie within the first minute of departure.Battlefield Earth was not very typical.BAM! Right out of the gate, this movie sucked. They wasted no time in the telling the audiences this movie will be bad, and should never have been made. In fact, I am very curious to hear from the very first person during production to question the morality of the filmmakers. I certainly hope one person had their eyes open during filming.Probably not. From a laugh-out-loud opening back-story naming the aliens as \"Psychlos,\" to hilariously and amateurishly tilted shots, to special effects that would only take up a tenth of an Atari 2600 memory cartridge, to sidesplitting dialogue and acting, this movie immediately takes you for a fast ride on an unfinished roller coaster. And all I described there, you can see for yourself within the first 5 minutes of this overlong 118 minute film. Sadly, yes, this movie that was intended to go on to be a trilogy \u2013 HA \u2013 was nearly two hours.Of course, I've heard of this movie, ever since it premiered in 2000 and even before that when they were filming it. I had no desire to see it, even when people hadn't spoken the horrors this movie would produce. Once word got out, I had less a desire to see it \u2013 especially when I learned more about this new cult: Scientology and its connection to the movie.Years passed and it got brought up time and again as one of the worst. Now, I might have been a bit curious just to see what many did label as \"the worst movie ever made,\" but part of me thought: well, it seriously couldn't be that bad.My excuse in seeing it for the first time in almost 14 years since its release, was that a fantastic podcast (How Did This Get Made?) ran one of their segments on it. In order for me to enjoy that podcast where they dissect a film and make us laugh at the craziness the subject film was, I needed to see it.As mentioned above, my eyes, my ears, my soul could not have prepared me for this. I've been watching movies for over 30 years now and remember timeframes pretty well. Now, I wish I had seen this in theatres in May of 2000. This is a rare movie for any generation, and especially back during that time. Rare as in, most movies, as bad as they might be, would not be as colossally bad as this. So, it would've been a hoot to have my eyes wide open and mouth agape on some turkey like this actually being released during that summer.Obviously, I've bashed this movie and its, ah-hem, \"quality,\" and you might think I'm over exaggerating the depth of madness here. Don't take my word for it. If those first five minutes doesn't tell you that you're in for a disaster bigger than the Titanic, watch on.After the first blow to my stomach, i.e. those opening five minutes, the movie, mercifully, didn't get that much worse. Most movies, as described in my opening here, start okay or somewhat bad and get progressively worse as they continue. Here, what you see (in the opening) is what you get for the rest.Some movies are \"so bad, they're good.\" This is not one of those. It was an extreme chore to get through this. The clich\u00e9s, the unintentionally hilarious scenes, the Travolta outbursts, the camera angles, the clumsy editing, the Star Wars rip-off scenes, the lack of charismatic \"heroes,\" pointless plot twists and numerous flaws were all so tiresome to keep up with.Some actors go crazy in the public's eye, and still, they appear to be doing their job on screen. This was everyone's chance to see John Travolta hitting rock bottom on screen. (Actually, during this year's Oscars, he pretty much proved he's not just crazy in movies.)If you don't subscribe to How Did This Get Made?, run away. Don't waste your time. There are plenty more \"so bad, it's good\" films out there. Like Troll 2, The Room, Birdemic, anything Syfy makes. Heck, Syfy films could actually remake this and put some rogue sharks with laser beams on their heads in space. And THAT would've been a better movie.* * * Final thoughts: When movies are as bad as this, I generally take hundreds of notes and turn my review in to a \"Top Twenty-Nine (or so)\u0085\" list of what I think are the funniest thoughts that entered my mind during the film. I did in this case, but gave up on #5, which is not enough to make an entire list. The reason? This movie literally bored me to tears. The shock of how bad it was over about 20 minutes in and then I just lost interest. But, not enough to turn it off. I was just determined to make it through this sewer of sh|t so I could listen to the guys (and gal) at How Did This Get Made? rant about it. At least, that part \u2013 the podcast \u2013 was worth it.",

            "content": "Where to begin...? First things first - this is not the worst film of all time. I watched it last night, I was laughing along with it in places as well as at it. John Travolta is hilarious as Terl, the head of security for the Psychlos (cunningly subtle name there), with a level of high camp and sneering bad-guyness so stratospheric that you expect him to tie the female love interest to some train tracks and twirl his moustache. Some of his lines are quite funny, and the jokes - although unsubtle as a hand grenade in a paddling pool - do tend to work.So there's the rub. It's funny and played for laughs by Travolta and Forrest Whittaker. But it's completely not by the rest of the cast, giving it an almost pantomime feel with the brave and serious heroes battling against the bad guys so over-theatrical it makes your teeth itch. If it were just played for laughs, with the knowing humour across the board, then it would have been palatable, almost like a low rent sci-fi Ghostbusters or a modern day They Live. It's not, so you get ridiculous plot aspects - cavemen find a flight simulator that somehow works after 1000 years, in a matter of days (hours?) they're ready to fly somehow fully operational jets, coping with G-forces and suchlike, when shortly before they were just throwing spears? The acting is strictly B-movie fare - Kim Coates is amusing but limited, Sabine Karsenti just looks lovelorn and scared, whilst man-of-the-match Barry Pepper is like a young Nic Cage in a ridiculous wig, never taking the expression of earnest concern from his face or letting acting ability get in the way of his braids.So in closing, your honour - it has some amusing ideas, it's not the worst film ever made, but it's probably up there with Cutthroat Island as one of the most ill-conceived, ill-executed and ill-received major studio films to be formed. As late night entertainment, it's a way of wasting a couple of hours and having a laugh. As a blockbuster, it's just an enormous bucket of fail.",

Half of it's enjoyment is in fact how cheesey it is. But the enjoyment is still there. The rest of the enjoyment is from Travolta's over done preformance.

I saw this for the second time on TV recently and I can clearly see why I fell asleep and I'm amazed I made it through this time. This review isn't going to shed any new light on a movie that largely been panned by everybody involved, except for maybe John Travolta, but I feel compelled to weigh in and say that this is plain garbage from start to finish. We all know the story, that earth was overrun 1000 years ago and what's left of mankind has been enslaved for menial labour, so it has a kind of Terminator meets Planet of the Apes feel about it. Despite all of earths combined military we only managed to put up a 9 minute fight. There's no real story on how this played out, at least in the film, but if they attacked us from orbit then I guess it makes sense. Maybe we fired off a few nukes into space in that 9 minutes, who knows, but they way the movie played out, it just kept raising questions. I won't bore you with insipid details on who does what to whom and who says what stupid thing to someone else, but in the year 3000, 1000 years after we were defeated, cities are still standing, albeit overgrown, books left lying in the open still have paper that not only haven't decayed - they can still be read, cars left on the streets still look pretty good, windows still have glass in them, old batteries still work, old machine guns and surface to air missiles still work a treat, jet fighters are all fueled, working and flyable, humans, that are for all intents and purposes little more than cavemen, can expertly fly 1000 year old jet fighters after only a few hours at a still working flight simulator. And there's a lot more wrong with this than that. I wouldn't have minded this so much if every single shot wasn't on an angle and the plot remotely made some sense. All the Scientology bashing aside, even if this had no connection to the religion at all, it fails on all accounts. It's clear that the studio interference was rife throughout the filming as talented actors seemingly forgot how to act. If anyone can point me in the direction for where I can claim back the brain cells destroyed in just trying to make sense of whatever the hell this was I'd appreciate it.",

Over-The-Top acting, horrible dialogue, noisy action sequences, and forgettable characters.

Although the movie starts funny as we can see Travolta and Whitaker argue in their silly suits about slaves, this quickly turns to boredom. The rest of the movie is the standard very bad, short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry (ok) and teaches it to his barbarian mates (huh?) who immediately appreciate the essence of it all (they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is). But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces. Check out the fact that the main character discovers the national library and finds a crisp fresh version of the constitutional law (it has been in that very same destroyed library for almost 1000 years and doesn't show any signs of decay ?)

Ron Hubbard the movie is horrible. For starters, the main characters name is Johnnie Goodboy Tyler. And John Travolta plays Terl in a terrible performance. And while he can be hilarious this movie is not so bad it's good it's so bad it's bad. The heroes are idiots the villains are stupid. And it's just frustrating!What I Hate:\nThe basic story is that the psyclos took over Earth in the 2000 to get gold from Earth. And in the year 3000 Johnnie Goodboy Tyler leads a rebellion against the psyclos.This is the point in the review where I point out the dumbest parts of the film. For example, the Psyclos just evilly laugh, for almost 5 minutes straight. Or another scene where the Psyclos enslave the humans to mine gold and to get around it they go to Fort Knox which after 1000 years, the Psyclos never noticed or tried to find out if humans extracted gold as well. And the psyclos always think humans are idiots and call them man animals so they never researched human history. And the scene where the humans discover an old military base with weapons that still function and planes that are still fully fueled. As well as a nuke conveniently there.Another thing, every shot in this film looks ugly and is at a Dutch Angle. But my favorite is Terl's plan to find out humans favorite food to get them to mine gold. Now, you think the plan would be to ask what they want to eat. Right? No, you put them in the middle of nowhere with no food forcing them to eat rats, and the Terl thinks they like to eat rats, and nothing comes of this. That was easily the worst scene in this movie. As it was just pointless.Conclusion:\nIn the end this movie sucks and all copies of this must be burned. I believe this movie is one of the worse of all time. This movie is able to make every framed look terrible every character an idiot everything about bad. There is nothing good about this.",

The characters : the characters are terrible really bad they are unfunny and I believe they are mental like why the heck are these people but john travolta character was the worst character of all time Yes his character was terrible and unfunny. 2. Villain : do you call this guy aka terl a villain really he just acts like a clown he isn't even trying we can't take him seriously to be our villain at least kylo ren try ed and did better. 3. Design : just forgettable really stupid. 4. Story and plot : wait I don't need to talk about the story and plot why? Well guess what there is no story after all. 5. Acting : horrendous they act like clowns they are not even trying and john travolta my man he is ignoring his roles and he is pretty bad in this movie he just sucks.Take my word guys don't even watch this crap it is known like one of the worst movies of all time and they are so damn right.",

I went to see this when it first came out and in the theatre were 8 people, myself one other and 6 people all dressed the same sitting right in the front row literally miles away from us. Nothing against them it was just a little surreal This movie has so many goofs and gaffs and plot holes I would expect a film student with his buddies to make something like this after a few drinks some star wars figures and possibly some stop motion photography. The concept and story is just so insultingly stupid (humans are really insulted I must mention) that it kind of doesn't work that well. There are a few things about the production that are a little daft lets say and I will try to explain. The camera angle used for the bad guys who are meant to be about 8 foot tall I think, is atrocious after a while I found my neck cranking as I was constantly looking at an angle to watch these scenes. The Alien race love gold and plunder it apparently yet the good guys simply walk into fort knox and take gold (after 1000 years!!!!!! yeah right) The idea that untrained primitive man could fly a Harrier is simply insulting (again the equipment and fuel has been sitting for 1000 years) learning machine or not you don't just fly one of the most difficult aircraft in the world.

This movie makes the movie makes Flash Gordon (Sam Jones version) look like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and The Last Star Fighter look like an Shakespearian epic.I find myself asking what were they thinking?  Couldn't you see this bomb a mile away?  I went to see this movie not having heard any of the bad review but good ones and the one that stands out in my mind is the review that said John Travolta is the new face of evil.  I said okay, I'll give it a shot and went out to see the movie.  After seeing it, I was like WAIT A SECOND!!!!!!!! Now let's go back to the year 1977.  People are standing in line around the block to see Star Wars: A New Hope.  Now the movie has started, you see two of the biggest ships  you have ever seen, the good guys are running down the hall to fight the bad guys who suddenly storm in shooting.  The good guys are defeated and then out of the smoke comes this big, huge, gigantic man.  He is dressed all in black leather, wearing a mask that would make ancient Chinese warriors wet themselves and he has a huge cape on.  He steps in with authority and his men quickly come to attention at his presence.  He says nothing as he surveys the damage and then moves on.  From this point, you know this is the man who is in charge and this is a man that you do not want to mess with.  That is the face of evil.  Travolta looked like Lt. Commander Worf's, the Predator, Mili Vanili, and Jean Simmons (of KISS) love child from a wacked out orgy.One of my favorite scenes is when Johnny Goodboy's girlfriend decides to leave camp to help ol johnny and then she is captured and nearly put's johnny's life in danger.  And if I hear the word leverage one more time, I'm going to die.  What was Travolta's obsession with leverage.  What he needs is a nice Psycholos woman to help him get over his urges of leverage. Let's not forget about Fred Flintstone flying around in a Harrier Jet with Barney Rubble as his wing man.  And what's the deal with the dome?  First of all we destroy the dome but has someone forgotten the fact that our brave men and women are still in the dome fighting when it comes crashing down. And Travolta must have been the only excellent shot in the entire military because they couldn'taim straight to save their lives.  The only good part in the movie is the end and the scene where Forest Whitaker finally gets `leverage' over Travolta.  The rest of the movie is nothing but Travolta talking about `leverage', laughing hysterically at every stupid joke that you saw coming a mile away and then him giving Johnny Goodboy all the information he needs to win the war. Alexander the Great he is not.Anyway, before spending any of your hard earned money on this total flop, I would recommend doing something more useful with your time, such as watching moss grow or watching the birth of a newborn child by cesarean or maybe skinny dipping in zero degree weather.  Because you will regret having spent American money on this film. Some of you may have givin Battlefield Earth thumbs up and some thumbs down, but I give Battlefield Earth the finger. Both of them.",

Like `Waterworld,' I think this was held to a higher standard because of the stars involved, plus here the association with Scientology.This film takes itself seriously and pretends to say something important. But the religious depth is as trivial as in `Star Wars,' and that film is considered a success. The power of myth is managed here by some fairly shallow minds, and in fairness, I think it common incompetence rather than religious blindness. Everything was banked on the visuals, and indeed some coherent notion of bleakness is apparent. But there is no novelty -- only ordinary vision here. `Star Wars,' the first film, didn't have a novel world either and many of the same professionals were involved, but there the characters charmed. Here, they lack charm, and are able to divert attention from the cardboard world.I believe that both `Waterworld' and `Battlefield' could have been fixed, or at least brought up to the `Star Wars' standard if early in the game a coherent vision had been brought to all elements. Such visions, it is increasingly clear to me, can never come from actors for structural reasons. I wonder if `Ishtar' is a more interesting failure?I think there is something interesting to say about film and religion, at least so far as archetypes and mythical image. One certainly feeds the other, and we are in the midst of creating a new media religion. Down the street from me are Pat Robertson's fundamentalist christian broadcasting network and film university. They understand the newly enabled power to create a religion and are investing billions directly, and more in contributed labor, to do so. Also, it is no accident that scientology targets Hollywood.But this film doesn't deserve such an analysis. It is too incompetent.",

In BE the few surviving humans have regressed into a primitive society with no technology or education and the film spends some time with them, seeing how they live and see life. FascinatingI tend to dislike sci-fi films carried by special effects only and thankfully BE doesn't fall into this category. What makes it different is that instead of having an intracate plot embelished with strange future technology it basically revolves around the physcology of being imprisoned and enslaved which is unusualA lot of time is spent dealing with the humans responses to technology and advanced concepts, while we also see the aliens are not just 'evil' stereotypes - they just think the humans are animals and treat them as suchThere are also no massive battle scenes, and for a sci-fi film a lot of hand to hand combat. All this made me even more impressed and like most good films, the hero's really have to fight hard to win and they do in BE too, there is a sense of satisfaction when they start learning to outsmart their captorsI liked the sound track which was atmospheric and there seemed to be a lot of repetitive music played quietly in the background throughout most of the film - this is actually quite unnerving and I enjoyed this unusual effectThe only points of criticism I have are the concept of the aliens being after gold, the sillyness of flying 1000 year old Harrier jets, and the computerised 'education' scene where the hero ends up explaining geometry and physics to his cavemen brethren!The gold didn't bother me THAT much, after all its a resource of the earth and it's very believable aliens would invade our planet for its rich resources As for one or two 'silly' scenes well, they only last a few minutes its not a big dealSo I don't understand the critical attacks to BE. I can only assume people don't like Travolta for some reason (ok, he's an easy target with the scientology), or were expecting lots of effects and action This is not Starship troopers (which bored me senseless)!Ultimately I think the film was marketed wrong, it should have been an underground film aimed at the alternative sci-fi market. Its just not a mainstream filmI think there a quiet a few people out there who would also be pleasently suprised like me!",

            "content": "So picture yourself sitting there, listening to your gossipy roommate who goes on to tell you personal details about their life that, despite your friendship, you frankly couldn't care less about. You can die happy without knowing about the crud that grows between toes, and the gas that comes up every morning.Battlefield Earth is that roommate.It throws its characters and plot at the audience like a used tissue. None of us, not even the film, wants to touch it. Barry Pepper plays Jonnie, the long blonde haired hero, who in terms of screen presence comes across more as a parasitic leech that could make a fine sidekick for Jar Jar Binks. Jonnie is an everyman. A primitive pretty-boy version of the guy who lives across the street, the kid who plays in your driveway, and walks across your lawn just to tick you off.Jonnie's apparently tired of living this primitive life, and by his melodramatic scream it's safe to say he lost something precious. What exactly? I don't know. I didn't care. Thirty seconds later neither did the film, either, so I didn't miss anything. And it never comes up again later. Like I said, dirty snot rags.So uncharismatic hero-less sidekick, Jonnie, sets out on a journey in which the audience has no emotional investment. Thousands of years of literature informs us a destiny awaits him on this path, a destiny that will presumably change the fate of the near extinct human race. Yet, as he rides out to meet his destiny, he might as well be running up to the 7/11 to get cigarettes.I guess it's just as well. A hero is only as good as his nemesis. So this grand hero's epic tale will put Jonnie up against the head of security for the Psychlos' colony. In other words, the villain of Battlefield Earth is a glorified security guard named Terl. Yes, a security guard. Need any more reasons to not care? Terl is greedy, stupid, and arrogant (played over the top compliments of John Travolta) - he boasts about graduating top of his class, rambles about conquering galaxies with his training, while simultaneously demonstrating utter ineptitude in every single scene.Strangely, Terl's stupidity didn't phase me much, probably because I'd given up on the film before his first appearance. A small army manages to sneak up on him, he hands his entire planet's defeat to Jonnie on a silver platter by personally implanting the knowledge, and he considers three days of half-assed observation a thorough study on man-animal behavior. Bravo! The plot isn't much brighter, but I didn't care. About an hour into the running time, for about twenty minutes the movie actually becomes genuinely interesting despite its amateurish methods and gross oversights. Jonnie begins learning the fate of the human race 1000 years ago and masterminding a plan to strike back at the Psychlos.Truthfully, I think I started to accept the film on its own levels of consistent absurdity and believe that in this world of Sci-fi hackery and authorial ignorance that it is entirely possible for Barry Pepper to inspire the shards of humanity to revolt, and that an arsenal of human weaponry can still be powered and functional after 1000 years of nonuse. Kinda like how in a Troma film you just start to accept the fact no one can act.And then after humoring the film with renewed suspension of disbelief despite its gaping flaws and faulty logic, it goes and shatters it again with an act of unprecedented absurdity: Cavemen flying airplanes. It reminded me of a Calvin and Hobbes Sunday strip where Calvin is playing with his toys and proclaims, \"Tyrannosaurs in F14s! This is so cool!\" And Hobbes answers, \"This is so stupid.\" But enough about the plot! Director Roger Christian sinks to an Uwe Boll low in stripping away the power of tilted camera angles and scene transition through excessive abuse. Imagine watering down a single drop of hydrochloric acid with, oh say, the pacific ocean. What used to eat through metal and kill most living creatures has been diluted to the point where you can drink it.The abuse of tilted camera angles and redundant transition cuts grows painfully obvious, not to mention monotonous by the 30 minute mark (much sooner for the acute viewers). I didn't keep a running tally, but I wouldn't be surprised if 80% of the shots were tilted. Every transition is the same \u0096 a swipe that starts at the center of the frame and moves to the two extremes of the frame, and viola: the new scene. Thus the film gives off the same vibe of that internet moron no one pays attention to, the one who has caps lock on and puts 50 exclamation points after every single sentence.I recommend dealing with Battlefield Earth in the same manor you deal with said internet moron.

            "review_title": "Hubbard Exposes Scientology--Warning--Spoiler",
            "content": "This is amazing.  I had avoided seeing this movie because it's really bad. But badness, to paraphrase Mae West, has nothing to do with it.  I was stunned to see the extent to which Travolta, as Terl, and his fellow \"Psychlos\" portray Scientology management, using their standard \"tech\"--\"acceptable truth,\" blackmail, etc.--as villains.  The \"Psychlos\" are \"head and shoulders\" above the \"man animals\" they dominate, looking down on them just as scientologists (while they are held captive by the cult) look down on the rest of humanity. Eventually, of course, this attitude is fatal, or worse.  Consider Terl at the end, his right arm blown off, surrounded by all the gold of Fort Knox, which, as the Christian Bible says, \"can avail him nothing.\"Notice the double meaning of \"blow\" in Scientology jargon.  To \"blow\" is to abandon one's post or escape from Scientology.  So when the \"man-animals\" \"blow the dome,\" the double meaning is to escape from the controlled atmosphere in which scientologists (like \"Truman\" in another movie) are kept.It is important that the man hero Goodboy learns the Psychlos' language. This is the first step toward destroying them.  My thought is, is it possible that Hubbard, who was reportedly held captive by his own followers (including the current head of Scientology, David Miscavige) was giving humankind the keys to destroying the organization he had built and ruled with an iron fist?  He had tried to make his son L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., into a clone of himself, to carry on the dynasty, but when he demanded of Junior that he get daddy an H-bomb (true!), that was the last straw, and Junior defected and changed his name.  So there's Hubbard.  His wife Mary Sue had been convicted and jailed for crimes he was also wanted for (spying and infiltration of the US government--1978--look it up).  One of his children, Quentin, was a homosexual (a very bad thing to be in Scientology) who \"committed suicide\" following the suspicious death of his lover. Hubbard's \"church\" was out of control.  Why should he enrich strangers?  Many say that Hubbard believed he would come back and so he wanted the organization there when he returned.  I say no.  He was too cynical for that.  I say he wrote \"Battlefield Earth\" (admittedly the book, not the movie, and he may not have written it himself or at least not all of it) as a scorched-earth effort, to destroy what he had built.Here's what happens--again--warning--warning--spoiler:  a rebellious \"man-animal\" (Johnny Goodboy) is chosen by Terl to learn to mine an area Psychlos can't enter due to radiation they can't stand.  In order to do this, he has to learn Psychlo language, recapitulate lost human learning, and learn to use Psychlo technology (\"tech\" in scientologese), including flying their spacecraft.  When he discovers he can't get \"leverage\" (blackmail, extortion) over Terl because, as Psychlo head of security (perhaps head of the Office of Special Affairs, the terrorist wing of the \"church\"?) Terl is too clever and powerful, Goodboy pretends to be mining the gold (like a good boy), while he plots and carries out a rebellion with the help of other humans and the (get this!) Denver Public Library.  (The books--although not the librarians--are still there.)Using desperate, even suicidal measures, Goodboy takes advantage of Terl's fatal underestimation of the human species.  He leads a rebellion of the humans in the artificial atmosphere of the dome built by the Psychlos. The captive humans \"blow\" the dome.  They then blow up the Psychlo planet, using the Psychlos' own teleportation device.  At the end Terl, probably like Hubbard, is missing his right arm (a little metaphor there?), is caged and surrounded by all the gold of Ft. Knox--out of his reach or use.  OK, that was learn the language, learn the \"tech,\" and use it to \"blow.\"  Hmm. Good advice.  Warning--don't buy this video or DVD or however it's sold. Travolta and any other scientologists associated with this movie donate their money to continue the \"work\" of the \"church,\" which consists of recruiting people to mine the gold, and persecuting those who refuse to help mine the gold, especially those who try to do what Hubbard does in his story--expose Scientology for what it is.Incidentally, I know it's supposed to be funny.  But scientologists are not allowed to have a sense of humor, so every time the Psychlos laugh (and the man animals don't laugh--ever) it's at someone's suffering.  For example: Terl's assistant sees that some man animals have been trapped at the edge of a precipice.  So he deduces that they can fly.  Terl argues with him on this point.  Terl wins when he picks up a man by his throat (his usual means of handling us), holds him for a moment over the gorge, then lets go.  As they watch the screaming descent of the person, Terl says, \"See?  Man animals can't fly! HAHAHAHAHAHhahahahahaha.\"  That's how funny it is.  And then there's the tongue scene.  OK I won't spoil that part for you.",

            "content": "\"Battlefield Earth\" makes so many missteps I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the best way would be to examine the film in the broadest of terms. Despite a potentially interesting story, the whole enterprise is plagued by clumsy scripting and poor direction. The plot holes grow bigger and bigger as the story proceeds, and what little credibility it had to begin with is extinguished by the unfortunate third act. I have not read the original novel, so I cannot compare, but it's safe to say that it couldn't have been much worse than Roger Christian's ill-fated adaptation. The idea of humanity fighting a centuries-old alien occupation certainly has dramatic potential, but little of it is realized. It plays like a bad \"Star Trek\" episode, especially since the alien race--the Psychlos--look suspiciously like Klingons. The film is poorly directed and edited. Christian uses a variety of techniques in an attempt to command our attention, but he doesn't seem to know how to put them to proper use; he just throws them at us in a fit of desperation. The camera is almost always tilted; rarely is there a level shot to be found. The overuse of screen-wipes is unnecessary and annoying. Just about every image is shot through blue and green filters. He generates little excitement or tension, confusing rapid, borderline-incoherent editing with action. According to some reports, even he wasn't too pleased with the results, although he tried to put a good face on it.John Travolta is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself, although delivering an over-the-top performance doesn't necessarily equal good acting. He doesn't really come off as menacing, just loud and brash. Barry Pepper is solid as the hero; it's a minor miracle he comes across as well as he does, but why did he sign up for this turkey in the first place? The same could be said about Forest Whitaker as Travolta's second-in-command. He manages to make it through intact, but I don't think he will put this thing on his resume anytime in the near future. I think bad movies like this explain why some actors are self-conscious about seeing themselves onscreen.It's a bit sad though; Travolta had wanted to make this film ever since reading the novel upon its first publication twenty years ago. At long last, he had a chance to proceed with the project--only to meet in glorious failure. He actively defends the results, saying that in twenty years it will be a cult film like \"Blade Runner.\" Putting aside the inappropriate comparison, this sounds like the voice of a man in denial. That's not the end of it though; he wants to make a sequel, based upon the remainder of the book (the film only covers the first half). Might as well bring it on and get it over with; to be honest I'm curious to see if it could actually be worse. Finally, I'd like to hear more about what went on behind the scenes. Such an account would probably be more worthwhile than the film itself.* (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",

Not that he needed any help here; Travolta redefines scenery-chewing, making Snidely Whiplash look as subtle as DeNiro in comparison.  It's a performance you'd expect to see from your high-school drama department on a bad night.Even the technical aspects of the film were badly handled.  Why were all of the scenes shot through blue filters?  Did the director decide he really likes tilting his head, or perhaps have a permanent neck cramp?  Why do humans sound like apes after 1000 years in the wild, when humans live in tribal communities all over the world without screeching at each other like Cheetah warning Tarzan?  I won't even bother with the most commented stupidities this film has to offer.  An interesting fact: women rate this film higher than men.  If you look at the IMDB vote statistics, the only two demographic groups to rate this film above a 3 are women between 18-29 and women between 30-44.  I find that absolutely incredible, especially considering the window-dressing attitude that the film takes with females, both human and Psychlo.  In fact, I can only remember two female characters that had any lines at all, and one of those is a cameo by Travolta's real-life wife, Kelly Preston, in a role with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Watch it for its unintended humor -- especially the Psychlo boots; good Lord, who designed those, Andy Warhol's ghost?",

            "content": "It is the year 3000. Mankind has been eradicated by the \"Psychlos\", an alien race who move from planet to planet, taking over one at a time. The remaining free humans have been driven from the cities into the mountains where they have reverted into primitive creatures. One of these men - Tyler - decides to attempt to do something with his life and ends up being captured and enslaved by the Psychlos. When they begin teaching him their language to work as a slave, Tyler realises that he has the knowledge to plan a revolt.It's not as bad as you might think it is. That's my verdict. I think the reason that this movie got so much negative press was that people were jumping on the bandwagon to proclaim it \"the worst movie ever made\". Kind of like what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, only in reverse. Sure, BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bloated CGI-infested blockbuster, but it's no different to a dozen others currently doing the rounds at the multiplexes. Yes, it is a poor film, but it STILL manages to be better than GODZILLA was.I like a good old-fashioned science fiction tale as much as the next guy and this is what BATTLEFIELD EARTH is, when it comes down to it. It's a fairly simplistic yet far-reaching story of aliens taking over earth and one man fighting back to reclaim his planet. As with a number of science fiction films made in the last two decades, the film owes STAR WARS something for the impressive visuals of dogfights and planets exploding. The plot is fairly predictable, and the script unfortunately dumb and aiming for the lowest intellect, although there is the occasional flash of cleverness before the film slips into being too simplistic again.The acting is pretty bad too. John Travolta goes over the top AGAIN as the whiny villain, and this time he is most definitely annoying (I was kind of unsure in BROKEN ARROW as to whether he was cool or annoying, but here I'm 100% certain). Forest Whitaker stars as Travolta's assistant, and is all but unrecognisable under mounds of latex (and all the better for him I imagine). One performance I did like was Kim Coates', playing Barry Pepper's friend and ally. Unsurprisingly Coates ends up - spoiler alert - dying again, just like he does in every single film I've seen him in. What is it with this guy? The film was hugely expensive and all of the money is up on screen, with loads of CGI effects which aren't all that convincing but will suffice for a fantasy epic. With all of these negative comments you may wonder why I don't rate this movie lower. Well, the answer is that I did somewhat enjoy watching parts of it. The film has a sufficiently epic feel with lots of locations and characters. The aliens have their own personalities and characters for once instead of being bland menacing villains. Some of the action is quite well done and occasionally violent, with limbs flying off. You can't help but get the feel that everybody was TRYING really hard to make this film work, yet that they all failed in the end. I would recommend curious science fiction fans to at least give it a try to see what all the fuss is about. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is neither bad enough to be unwatchable or bad enough to laugh at. It just makes you think \"uh\" and takes up two hours of your life.",

It will be required viewing for all film students, as the perfect example of what NOT to do.Now, before all of you start comparing me to Mr. Cranky (the internet film critic who manages to find the awful in every movie), I must remind you that as of this time, 1,100 IMDB users have given this movie an average rating of 3 out of 10.The plotholes (big enough to drive Battlestar Galactica through).  The scenery (I've seen more realistic matte paintings in movies where you're supposed to know they're matte paintings).  The ridiculous lift shoes the Psychlos wore (Gene Simmons would laugh his butt off if he saw this film and saw what these people had to wear).  The Psychlos overall appearance (whatever reviewer said \"They're Jamaican Klingons that speak like Ferrengi\" hit a bullseye).  John Travolta's dialogue (Oh my God, I can't even begin to get into that dreck).  The effects (visible wires holding the model ships up would have been better--at least they'd be enjoyable to laugh at).  The truly inconceivable stupidity of the Psychlos (how could they possibly conquer so many other civilizations when they repeatedly demonstrate utter idiocy).

Bad films are released every week, but this one sinks beneath ordinary badness to become a genuine so-bad-it's-good movie.  Barry Pepper gets to make lots a big, faux-'Braveheart' speeches as Johnny, a cave-dweller who leads his people in a fight against the voracious aliens who have taken over Earth.  He is aided in his fight by the aliens themselves, who helpfully teach Johnny their language and all the basics of science, leave him in an abandoned library so he can be inspired by the Declaration of Independence, and send him off unmonitored so he can take his people to a huge cache of US weapons left in a bunker, still working after 1000 years of neglect. (By the way, it appears these weapons were never used...no wonder the aliens only needed 9 minutes to conquer the planet.)John Travolta, who labored long and hard to bring this story to the screen (it's based on a book by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard), seems to be having a great time as Terl, the alien chief of security.  (Forrest Whittaker, playing his sidekick, looks like he can't believe he's in this thing.)  But the truly big laughs come from Pepper, who actually seems to be taking this seriously.  And the swelling, \"stirring\" music.  And the stunning plot holes.  And the stupidity of the aliens.  And the schockingly lame action sequences by director Roger Christian.  And the laughably fake matte paintings meant to evoke post-invastion Denver and Washington. Mark my words: 15 years from now, this movie will be a staple to midnight showings, complete with people coming dressed as Terl and shouting things at the screen.  It's such a fascinating guilty pleasure that, God help me, I'm giving it 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "Picture this. There is this caveman, ok? Raised a hunter-gatherer in a pagan world. OK? No problem. He's in a Harrier Jump Jet. Ok? He has just crashed the plane into a huge dome at an astounding speed on purpose. He's not hurt at all. Ok? He sees crates of fuel and explosives, lying for absolutely no reason on top of this dome, right next to him. Ok? He takes out a bazooka which he luckily remembered to bring, and blows the fuel, explosives, the dome and himself to smithereens. Ok? So, what is this, one of those silly Zuckerman movies like 'The Naked Gun', where the surreal is the order of the day? Nope. Is it a comedy at all? Nope. It's the latest sci-fi thriller from John Travolta and pals, BATTLEFIELD EARTH.Now, maybe the situation of a caveman flying an airplane into a dome and blowing it all up with weirdly placed props is explained. Ok, so it's a little farfetched, but it's all explained in a way so that it's believable, right?Let me answer that in the manner of a Psychlo: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! In man-animal-language, that means 'No way. This movie is so downright stupid and boring that it defies belief'. The last half hour or so is fun because it's just so insanely stupid and intelligence-insulting, but everything before that is a boring waste of time. It's not even bad in a fun way, it's bad in a 'I will rip your arm off and beat you to death with the bloody end'-way.Anyway, the lowdown is this: The year is 3000, and mankind, we are told, is an endangered species. It turns out Earth was invaded by Psychlos (Klingons without the charm) about 1000 years ago and wiped the entire planet clear of humans. Almost. Because Psychlos are vulnerable to radiation (it makes their breathing gas explode - yes of course it does), the humans live in radioactive areas where the Psychlos can't get them.We join our hero, Jonnie, as he learns his father was taken by the gods. Oh la la. He gets all stroppy and instantly starts leaking Hero Juice all over his torn caveman clothes. \"We must fight or we will never be free! Boo! Boo!\" He yells and everyone ignores him. But off he goes, into the unknown. In the unknown there is a huge golf ball for absolutely no reason. If you've seen it, you'd have noticed.Also in the unknown are other humans, who buddy up with Jonnie. Then, all of a sudden, the shadow of a Psychlo turns up and starts shooting green balls of light after them. Sometimes the gun says 'BANG', other times it says 'ZAP' and other times still it says nothing at all. The sound effects guy was really concentrating on that one.Anyway, Jonnie and his new buddies are captured by the Psychlos, and we are introduced to John Travolta Psychlo and Forrest Whittaker Psychlo. They both look, and are, stupid. Jonnie shoots a few Psychlos and is not punished for it, and then he has a pointless fight with someone in a cage. All the while, the Psychlos are acting incredibly pointlessly and stupidly, and they get a disproportionate amount of screen time. This goes on for about 45 minutes where nothing - and I mean NOTHING - happens. Not a jot. Zip. Just a lot of talking, yelling (for the humans) and laughing insanely (for the Psychlos).I must mention the Psychlo sense of humour, since it is all over this endless 45 minutes. The joke is always the same: one Psychlo says: \"Oh no, WE will not kill you.\" The other Psychlo says \"Oh thank Hubbard for that! I thought my days were numbered\" (the actual dialogue from the film was, believe it or not, much worse than this example.) \"No\", says the first Psychlo, \"WE will not kill you. But *I* will kill you!\". Second Psychlo looks stunned with surprise and gets shot. First Psychlo: \"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\" And that's it. The joke is always reading the sentence to the letter and then finding a little loophole to exploit. The other Psychlo is always fooled by this, even though he has heard this kind of joke at least a million times before and has used the jokes himself a million times. This sort of joke is endlessly referred to as being 'leverage'. If you get bored (and you will) then count the number of times the word 'leverage' is uttered.Meanwhile, back at the movie, someone seems to have remembered that a movie needs a plot of some sort. Ok, so we're told that the Psychlos are mining the Earth for gold. Since they have incredible technology like intergalatic teleportation and the like, they of course have an advanced spectroscopy machine to locate the gold ore via satellite. Oh, wait, no they don't. They just happen to find a gold mine in a radioactive mountain. OK, we know that Psychlos are allergic to radiation, so they of course just deploy some robotic miner. No, hang on, they don't have robotic miners. So they want to use the man-animals to mine the gold for them. So, they pick Jonnie, because he's the hero, and teach him everything about the psychlo language and how to mine, so he can teach the others. While they are at it, they also teach him everything he needs to know about Psychlo security codes and procedures, because that's really relevant. They also teach him how to read human language somehow, and he is taken to a library where he is allowed to read as much as he wants about anything he feels like. We notice that the Psychlos are very good at keeping their slaves ignorant so they don't start a rebellion or anything. Oh yeah and he is taught to fly a Psychlo plane as well.They are dumped by the radioactive gold mine and told to get going. To keep an eye on them he has a drone fly by the mine once every 24 hours or so. The Psychlo DO in fact have little miniature cameras with a huge range, but they seem to forget that and opt for the inefficient drone option instead. This gives Jonnie the change to forget about mining and just fly to FORT KNOX to get the gold! Yes, Fort Knox! The most enforced place on the planet, impossible to penetrate. Unless you're cavemen of course, in which case the outer door is just a piece of sheet metal you can knock over, and the door to the vault is left wide open. When the Psychlos go back for the gold, they don't wonder for one minute how the humans got the 'mined' gold smelted into bar form without any sort of equipment.The Fort Knox part leads into the stupid and fun part of the movie. I won't tell too much to spoil it for you, but the caveman in a harrier jump jet scene kinda sums it up. Oh, and look out for the effect of one atomic bomb on the Psychlo home planet.In short, I wouldn't call this a bad film. I would call this an absolutely, mindwrenchingly terrible film. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! (Psychlo Humour again)",

Unless you are making a comedy, the villain should be the smartest person in a movie.  The greatest dramatic tension is created when the hero is facing the greatest odds.  And having a villain who can consistently out-think the hero makes the hero's ultimate victory all the more satisfying.  Yet the Psychlos in general and the John Travolta character, Terl, in particular are especially dimwitted... always pompously posturing while being thoroughly deceived and defeated.It doesn't make them any smarter to say that the Earth was conquered in mere minutes by these people.  That is simply violating a basic rule of storytelling, which is \"Don't say it, SHOW it!\"  SAYING that the Psychlos flash-conquered the Earth carries no weight, and we just refuse to believe it, when we are SHOWN what incompetents they are all through the movie.And the way that our hero, Jonnie, prevails?  He is hooked up to a learning machine through the stupidity of his foes and suddenly he is capable of outwitting the entire Psychlo empire.  This is deus ex machina at it's worst.  Not through any particular virtue of his own, he is suddenly master of the situation.This all adds up to a strange taste in storytelling.  A style that evidently some people like (though not most, the evidence shows).  If I can judge by the comments written here, these people require villains to be nasty evil posturing boastful... and stupid.  Especially stupid.  Somehow giving them intelligence would be giving them a virtue, which you can't have in nasty evil posturing boastful villains.  Well, if that's your taste... but it makes for poor storytelling.  And if that isn't enough, the hero doesn't so much grow and change because of his travails as he is zap-transformed through the generosity of his foes.  This makes for something less than interesting character development.  In Storytelling 101 this formula would earn you a grade of D... for Dull.For those who admire this movie, perhaps Battlefield Earth is simply their style of wish fulfillment, where their foes are always stupid, and a simple trick will suddenly guarantee them absolute victory.

It is however true that there are major flaws with the film: The cinematography is distracting and made it hard at times to even figure out what was going on in the picture. The filming crew took some risks that in this case didn't work at all or might have given that they were done minimally. The slanted angle shots, slow motion sequences, choice of dominant coloring, and other cinematographic oddities became tired after about 30 minutes into the movie. - 2/10 The script was an attempt to cram a novel into a movie. It was lacking and at times confusing, referencing things that only a person who had read the book would understand. Repeting words and phrases was a little annoying. However, it was a consistent style that helped to develop the characters. - 4/10The acting was acceptable, given the script. The only main annoyance is that the accents were inconsistent. Travolta and all other supporting actors did a fine job. They were believable and into their characters. - 7/10 The music was right on. The composer was over the top, but the composer was writing a score for a movie where the cinematography was over the top. So, I do not think that the composer should be faulted for writing the most appropriate score for the movie he was assigned to. - 10/10 The story was compelling, but left more to be desired. Perhaps this was because it was a movie based on a book and the book would explain more. - 8/10 Inconsistencies, impossible situations, and continuity error was all over the place. - 1/10",

This could be the kind of mistake that everybody just shrugs off and has a laugh about in later years, were it not for the overbearing vanity that's weighted this project down from the very beginning...

Not even Forrest Whittaker emerges with any dignity intact.I usually try and be kinder with films that everybody and their dog have taken it upon themselves to trash. 3 examples: 'Gigli', bad, but not as bad as people say... 'Freddy Got Fingered'; bad, but not as bad as people say; 'Showgirls', etc...However, in one thundering misjudgement after another, all of the crew managed to confound my intentions until to say anything other than the truth would be a deception too far. \"Battlefield Earth\" is quite incredibly, dumbfoundingly bad. It's the most poorly conceived film on almost every level that I think I've ever seen for a budget of its type. To actually find investors to pump money into adapting Hubbard's schlock material in the first place is a miracle in itself; to make the result so comically inept almost beggars belief.The shoddy cinematography at times makes it seem that the camera has been dropped, and the film accidentally recorded somehow made its way to the screen as the final cut. Also, feel free to dissent by all means; but right before our love interest goes to find the hero; doesn't it seem as if the old guy might be reading an autocue?! Life can be a great leveller sometimes; less than a week ago, I had the pleasure of taking in \"Batman Begins\"... Right now it feels like sitting agog in-front of the travesty that is \"Battlefield Earth\" was fate's sadistic way to bring me back to reality with a sickening jerk...",

Instead I got the most oppressive, nightmarish production of the modern era.  It's not funny, it's not cute -- it is a tour de force of sheer, unequalled physical ugliness that, as Pauline Kael said of Full Metal Jacket, suggests a blunt instrument grinding into your skull, except no one will mistake this for the work of a master director.  It looks like this guy, whoever he is, spent his entire youth staring lovingly at Megadeth and Judas Priest album covers, tracing them with his fingers and whispering with deep reverence:  \"Cooooool.\"  He may also have seen Buckaroo Banzai and Dune more than once.  None of the behavior in the movie makes sense on anyone's terms, nor does the makeup, the black strips of leather that hang from the \"man-animals'\" noses and the women whose heads look like gigantic Pooper Scoopers.  People scurry around frantically while lots of growly-barfy noises with no definite source, presumably just part of the ambience of the Psychlos lair, threaten them from afar.  Travolta and Forrest Whitaker ( ! ) play two bickering Rasta queens who pop up every now and again. It's amazing how a botched movie like this can rise above its station to become sincerely dangerous to one's reason; after an hour of it, I felt like a radio signal beamed too far into the ether. Scrambled, disassociated, inscrutable.    The PSYCHLOS?",

            "content": "\"Battlefield Earth\" (2000), if there ever was a disease reincarnated as a \"movie\", then this is a perfect example of one. To be honest, I have never seen this \"film\" before in my life, but I have heard things about it, and have never had the desire to check it out. It just happened to be on TV last night, so I decided to watch it. I thought: \"you know what, I like science fiction/action movies. I'm going to give this a watch, how bad can it possibly be?\" Well, it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought. No, it was a million times worse! What in the world did I just watch?! The story, or lack thereof, is nothing short of a joke. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, the special effects are horrible, the sets/locations are abysmal, and the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Believe it or not, this \"movie\" is based off a novel by author L. Ron Hubbard. I have never read the novel, but I'm sure that it's probably much more entertaining than this pile of filth of a \"film\"! Originally, \"Battlefield Earth\" was to be a part 1 of a 2 part movie series. The original book it's based off of is 1,050 pages in length, and this \"film\" only covers the first 436 pages of the story. Can't imagine how bad the sequel would have been if it was ever produced! But thankfully, it was cancelled. This \"movie\" should have never been made to begin with! There is barely any story, it's basically like the diarrhea stain known as \"Diner\" (1982), nothing but subplots that go absolutely nowhere and don't add up! It's a crying shame, because the story concept seems interesting and has a lot of potential. But it was just executed so terribly, so terrible that it should be illegal! The acting is also a total disgrace, from all of the actors subjected to being in this \"movie\"! I have never seen acting so over the top, yet so cringeworthy and yet so boring in my life. I was surprised to see an actor like John Travolta in this \"film\". When I saw him on the poster, I thought: \"I like John Travolta as an actor. Maybe he can make this movie worth watching?\" But no, he actually plays one of the aliens, known as Psychlos. No really, they are actually called Psychlos. Come on, a preschooler could have come up with a more intimidating name than that! We'll get to talking more about those aliens in a second. The special effects are nothing short of horrible, I've seen better effects on old video games! Even the sound effects are cheap and generic. Like an old cheesy arcade game! Also, the makeup for the aliens in this \"movie\" is some of the worst I have ever seen. They just look like humans with Jamaican wigs and nose piercings. They must be inspired by the villain Screwface from \"Marked For Death\" (1990)! Honestly, I've seen children's Halloween costumes that look more realistic! Some human beings actually look more like aliens than the so-called \"aliens\" in this \"movie\". Let that sink in for a moment! The sets/locations look like they were edited together by a first year student in film school. Also, the cinematography is some of the worst I have ever seen. If you look at any scene from this \"movie\", you'll notice that most of the shots are at an angle. What? Was KidBehindACamera the cinematographer? Yes, I know that they were trying to shoot this \"film\" to look like a comic book. But it just makes it look like the camera operators were drunk! Seriously, over 90% of the shots are slanted. It looks like the \"movie\" is sinking! Although, to be honest it was sinking before it was ever made. If you have the courage to watch it, be prepared for a sore neck! Also, the soundtrack is awful, but I suppose that this diarrhea dump of a \"movie\" would be incomplete without a terrible soundtrack. This \"movie\" should have never been made, it's a crime to film making. I've seen many movies in my life, and this one is the worst \"movie\" I have ever seen, so far. I rate this \"movie\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 IMDB stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. For all you're worth, stay away from this sorry excuse of film making. To all actors and film makers sadly involved with this \"movie\", all I have to say is, I'm sorry. We can all be thankful that this \"film\" didn't ruin your careers!",

Turning that screenplay into one of the most derivative, idiotic movies of the decade just retires the side in the bottom of the ninth. Hit the showers losers, it's time to load up the short bus and head back to Clearwater.

            "content": "On IMDb, I'm a prolific author and frequent voter. I've given only one thing on IMDb a 10 (a television show, Arrested Development, although there are a few 10s if you count some of its episodes as separate), and this movie is the only thing on IMDb I've given a 1. So you know it has to be bad- so bad it needs to be seen to be believed. It's not Star Wars- it does have freedom fighters rebelling against an alien empire, and the aliens here (\"Psychlos\") are a poor man's wookiee- but it's missing all of the charm. It's set in the year 3000, as is Futurama, and I'd prefer Groening's vision of that year over this one any day.Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race known as the Psychlos from the planet Psychlo, who mine the planet for hundreds of years and make humans an endangered species. However, in 3000 a group of humans believe they can finally stage an effective revolt and exterminate the Psychlos- before the Psychlos exterminate them.Where to begin? A lack of imagination plagues this film, starting with the Psychlos themselves, who again, look like bad wookiees. The name \"Psychlo\" itself is just the English word \"psycho\" with just one added letter. No attempt was made to construct an alien culture for the Psychlos- they're exactly like humans, with schools and grades, bars and tabs, jobs and salaries, wives and divorce, and so on. The movie hammers the point that the Psychlos are evil. They insult Earth (so we know they're bad), they say they'll exterminate humans, they laugh evilly, and they call our hero a \"rat brain\" (a cutting insult)... several times! They refer to humans or \"man animals\" as inferior beings, so we're supposed to be proud of ourselves when the humans fight back. The movie Independence Day isn't great but has more luck with that. With Battlefield Earth, we can only feel ashamed that our species made this movie. Reflecting the lack of imagination, the same swipe from the centre is used for every scene change. Seriously.The storytelling and direction is problematic, but so is the writing and acting. Travolta's joke about growing a \"third arm\" makes for bad sarcasm and the constant use of the word \"leverage\" is meant to be a cool motif, but that's so transparent that it's just lame. The acting is bad, including- maybe even especially- Travolta's. He consistently sounds fake, whether he's acting pleasant towards his alien superiors, acting like he doesn't like his job, or expressing anger towards that black alien. On top of all that, the explosion of the planet Psychlo is a poor effect. So was the Death Star's destruction in Star Wars, but Battlefield Earth came out over 20 years later.How does a movie like Battlefield Earth get made? How are projects like these not nipped in the bud? The story happened to be the brainchild of the founder of Scientology, the notorious L. Ron Hubbard, and Travolta, a Scientologist, really wanted this movie to happen. He spent much of his own money on this. This wouldn't be the first time where religion clouds one's judgment.",

Because we say so!\"  \"Why were the humans able to suddenly learn to read and operate heavy machinery?  Because we say so!\"  Travolta's performance was more dull, flat, and lifeless than I've seen in a long time and inspired more mirth than menace.  Throughout the movie, I kept turning to my friend and asking, \"Is this the part where Charlton Heston goes to talk to Yul Brinner/Anne Baxter/Yvonne DeCarlo/God\" (CHOOSE ONE), but I'll admit \"The Ten Commandments\", a howler in its own right, was aeons better than this mess.",

The performances by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were so funny I could hardly stop laughing and the comic book camera angles completely blew me away. Yes, the story is silly but that just makes the movie even sillier...perfect for a comedy, and just what I would have hoped for. Actually, I feel sorry for people who are so critical they can't enjoy themselves. I watch around 70 movies every single month....movies being my only passion....and I enjoy better than 95% of everything I watch. Obviously, I do quite a bit of research before I select a film and I also have a few simple tricks to keep my level of disappointment to a minimum. One is really simple. I've noticed I like almost everything Roger Ebert likes so I can easily add his thumbsup picks to my list. If Roger pans something, I look a little deeper to see if any viewers liked the movie and why they liked it. Yep, Roger sometimes has a bad day and ends up panning a movie that is actually quite good. Reading movie reviews from average viewers helps alot, also. Battlefield Earth is a good example. If you scan the reviews, you'll notice a few people who loved the movie and alot of people who hated it. Try to figure out why those few people loved it, what they saw that others may have missed, and you might discover a true gem. For the record, I also liked Heavens Gate, Water World, and Billy Murray's Razors Edge.....all of which were heavily panned.

Ron instilled a fear of Psychiartrists into Scientologists, or \"Psyches\" as he called them, claiming they were behind the concentration camps in Nazi Germany) and humanity has turned into a bunch of pack animals that eat rocks and rats. The Psychlos are using people to hunt for gold (again, one of L. Ron's batshit crazy beliefs) and misuse them and treat them like animals.That's about as far as I got.

How was the door at Fort Knox convieniently left ajar? And do they really just keep a room full of gold right next to the entrance? Why did John Travolta laugh so much? Why was his voice demonic when speaking Psychlo, but high-pitched and completely non-threatening when translated to English? Why did Johnny have to be taught how to fly the Psychlo ship? Couldn't Travolta fly one and Whitaker fly the other? Did the creature designer intentionally mean to rip off the Klingons? Even their language was similar! Why were the Psychlo numbers so similar to humans? If the air was poisonous to humans and they had to wear those noseplug thingies to breathe, how come they were breathing heavily through their mouths? What was the point of Johnny's dad dying in the beginning? Where did Johnny learn to read? (if he learned from the machine, why didn't the Psychlos understand English too?)

            "content": "I checked out Battlefield Earth a few nights ago on cable. I wonder now which version I saw. Reportedly the film was taken back and re edited after it's disastrous theatrical run in the hopes of improving it, that's why it was delayed on route to video, DVD and cable. One Internet critic swears that the re edit was in fact worse than the original theatrical cut. Either way though, Battlefield Earth cannot be salvaged. This film truly is one of the biggest fiascos to come down from the high mountain of Hollywood in this or any other century. I won't go into the many plot and logic problems, as they have been covered in great detail already. I will say that the film fails (at least for me anyway) due to the fact that nothing, and I mean nothing memorable, ever appears on the screen. Nothing sticks in your mind, it's like watching a blank tape or scrambled TV image. Nothing is there. Continuity is bad too. It seems that in some instances the director went straight to \"C\" while ignoring \"A\" and \"B\" all together. It's also hard to accept the Psychlos (or whatever they are called) for they are without doubt one of the goofiest looking alien races ever created, a cross between the Klingons, the Predators and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein, with none of the originality. You laugh at these so called villains, with their clod hopper boots (that several of the actors have difficulty moving around in) and over size cod peices. I doubt that humour was the intent, but a good laugh is what you get at the bad guys' exspense. The various human characters aren't much better. You can't get drawn in when the bad guys are silly and the human heroes do not elicit sympathy. I wish I had a dollar for everytime that Travolta yelled out \"rat brain,\" though.Thankfully the misguided talk of a sequel has dried up, but the fall out of this megaton turkey will linger for years to come.

Indeed the plotline is one of the things that ruined this film for me, far too much is left unsaid as to what the creatures are, why there are the way the are and what that actually is. To be honest, I couldn't have cared for the humans winning or loosing, and if the storyline was extended, it would seem that this race would merely suck the planet dry of the resources they were after and move on.

Ok, so there are some films even I don't like.This is by far the worst movie I have seen in recent memory.  Battlefield Earth film reaches a new low.  On the DVD, Travolta boasts that all the big names in sci-fi wanted to work on this film.  Did they even read the script???  Are they proud of the film now???  Does Forest Whitaker know that he looks like a reject from a Wizard of Oz revival???As I'm sure everybody who reads this already knows, John Travolta is Terl. 1000 years before, the evil alien race of Psychlos have taken over the entire Earth (in 9 minutes no less), and those who survived now live either in scattered outposts, or are enslaved by the Psychlos.  In comes Johnny \"Goodboy\" Tyler to save the day.The premise itself is cool enough, and having never read the novel, I can only assume (hope?) that it's better than this space-wreck of a movie. So full of implausibilies, Battlefield Earth is more of a comedy than a straight-faced sci-fi film.  1000 year-old planes that still fly?  Heck, their paint even shines.  Books left in the open air that are still readable and not falling apart?  Come on.  The film does serve the purpose of being a party game.  Count the number of times the word \"Man-animal\" is used!  How many times do the Psychlos refer to the \"home office\"?  How long can Travolta go without cackling?Travolta seems to think that the world is clamoring for a Battlefield Earth 2.  He may be right.  Until the sequel comes out, I can't imagine another film in the meantime can be such a joke.  We may be clamoring, Mr. Travolta, but not for the reasons you think.  My grade: F",

It was merely long and overproduced, so it seems practically everyone got a chance to read it, which is why it is one of the few science fiction novels held in \"high regard\" by the masses.  Considering its very doubtful that the author actually even wrote the bloody thing, we don't even know who to really blame, other than Mr. Hubbard's wonderful little cult.  He still seems to be putting out more and more books decades after his death.  Believe me, the ideas in Battlefield Earth are almost plausible when compared with the \"concepts\" of Scientology...and the movie probably cost only a little more than the average person is supposed to pay to the cult.  Might as well be a Mormon for those prices.There are \"good\" bad movies and \"bad\" movies.  Ed Wood, Phil Tucker and Ray Dennis Steckler made \"good\" bad movies...one's that are fun to watch and you can laugh at but still see the work that went into them as some form of art. This movie was just plain bad. The story is bad and the acting is atrocious. Travolta and Pepper constantly sound like they are reading from cue cards or doing a cold walk-through.  There are so many plot points that are just plain dumb that it makes your head hurt to contemplate them...savages learning how to pilot Harrier jets overnight and US Military technology being fully functional after a thousand years to name two of the biggies.\nEven the special effects were pretty lame...in fact, they were basically stoic and standard.  In a major science fiction blockbuster, you expect something new or innovative.  Even Lost in Space made good use of that popular spinning effect (the process name eludes me at the moment), which was just becoming big at the time.  But there's nothing to grab your attention in this movie.  Luckily, I think this movie did so poorly at the box office that we don't have to worry about a sequel. Hopefully the Scientologists will find some other less intrusive way to plead their dead leader's case next time...I wonder if they tried door-to-door leaflets?",

Those scenes and devices worked well in the movies they came from, but in this one their impact was lessened because they weren't complemented or established properly. Such as the music swells, which would work at well-timed moments, but not to excess. The look is cool at times, stark washes of green, grey and black. Trying hard to uplift, it only becomes dreary and plodding especially in scenes detailing how \"evil\" the Psychlos are, excessive slow-motion during supposedly exciting chase scenes, and a badly-choreographed final firefight that has the feel of being culled from a video game with poor AI. It's such a waste because some of the characters do have potential, given the efforts put in by the performers, especially John Travolta, who's trying so hard to act he overacts in every single scene he's in. Then Roger Christian does know more than a few things (but very little more than a few) about establishing a sense of scale to the entire affair.

That it is mainly aimed at people who liked Independence Day ID4 which was mostly an action, emotional(aww she died boo hoo) affair using Sci-Fi as a tool for the disaster. But what we have here in Battlefield Earth is an entirely different cookie, this is pretty much all sci-fi, not completely ground-breaking sci-fi but it's not bad sci-fi. It had some more unusual colours and angles which you wouldn't normally use but don't you get sick of the same old stuff? And the center crossfades for every change of scene may seem strange but they certainly give the movie a definite distinctive mark. pretty much all the characters involved were good, although I didn't really feel I got to know the other human characters in the film really, so any deaths that happened didn't mean a whole lot, as I said it's a pretty much whole sci-fi affair \"All except fantasy, there is none of that\". It didn't stick close enough to the book for me,(so far as I've heard the audio book) it mixes and changes scenes around adds and changes characters but it still stands on it's own even if not a totally accurate translation of the book. The plot is pretty well set out and apart from some minor twisting of rules of physics is quite solid, the characters are not 100% real but they are distinctive, I've seen too many films where characters can get easily confused in your mind. The soundtrack was addequate, the special effects in the day light looked strange and not very realistic but still very cool :)Overall it's really not that bad and I'd say that it is quite long but I don't think it's drawn out, Strangely I felt it was rushing through everything but taking a long time doing it(if you can work that out).I don't think it deserves half of the flack that it's been given, I think possibly that you have been influenced by the relationship of the movie with scientology via it's writer L Ron Hubbard, which is a shame.I suggest you see the movie for yourself rather than let other peoples opinions decide for you. 6/10",

            "content": "Heed my words! \"Battlefield Earth\" is a cheap, poorly developed piece of crap that John Travolta should NEVER have considered taking part in.The entire plot is waaaaay too warped to make any actual sense, the graphics and sound effects are poor, the dialogue is almost exaggerated and the characters don't fit their roles at all.It takes place in the year 3000 and Earth has been conquered by a surprisingly arrogant and dim-witted race of aliens called the Psychlos, which is a very simple name, since it's just Psycho with an \"L\" before the \"O\". But that's just the tip of the iceberg! Very few humans are still alive after the invasion, including one in particular named Jonnie (Barry Pepper) who rallies up a bunch of other humans to rebel against the Psychlo leader, Terl (John Travolta) who is far too proud to even consider the so-called Man-animals a threat even after seeing them behave quite intelligently on several, crystal clear occasions.Along the way, the humans learn how to use jets, nuclear weapons and cumbersome alien technology within an impossibly short time of just a few days or weeks. In reality it takes months to learn even the basics of flying a jet and requires a solid education to understand the mechanics and physics of a nuclear bomb.What's even more baffling is the fact that Terl is responsible for the human victory at the end of the film because he's the one who taught them how to speak the disgusting Psychlo language and fly their stupid space craft. His abysmal plan to collect gold and bribe his way off planet Earth backfires on him due to his reckless stupidity and ridiculously severe underestimation of the humans. He ends up behind bars.....but at least he gets his gold.All in all, Battlefield Earth is just plain bad...and not in a good way like \"Plan 9 from outer space\". It's bad in a super-bad way!!!",

            "content": "* 1/2 out of ****Let's get right down to it; Battlefield Earth is a terrible movie.  Almost everything about it reeks of incompetence and even as dumb entertainment, it's still quite insulting.  Only the extremely undemanding sci-fi action fan would enjoy this (or those under the age of 10) and even then they'd probably say it was nothing very good.  Director Roger Christian and John Travolta should just get over it and stop claiming they think it's a genuinely good movie (Now that I've said that, the same goes for George Lucas, who claimed this was a good movie).  So, you have to wonder why my rating for it is above * star.  Well, that's quite plain and simply; Battlefield Earth is unintentionally funny to a high degree.  So was Batman and Robin, but it's to a more absurd effect in this movie since the actors involved actually think it might be pretty good.The story begins in a semi-interesting fashion.  It's the year 3000, and man has long been conquered by the Psychlos, an alien race out to look for gold, and Earth is a prosperous mining site.  What's left of humans reside in small villages, reduced to living like cavemen.  One of them, Jonnie Tyler (Barry Pepper) is dissastisfied with the way he lives, and he leaves his home and mate (Sabine Karsenti) in search of better land.He comes across two hunters, Carlo (Kim Coates) and Rock, and they lead him into the ruins of a city, where they reside for the night in a destroyed mall.  As they're feasting, a Psychlo hunts them down, kills Rock, and takes the other two as prisoners to be used as slaves in the Psychlo center, which is located in Denver.  Simultaneously, the Chief Head of Security, Terl (John Travolta), is upset with the Home Planet because he has been ordered to continue his position on Earth for another 50 cycles.  He discovers a vein of gold in a mountain not far away and schemes to steal it with the help of his partner, Ker (Forest Whitaker), who is mainly to be used as a scapegoat.Terl decides to use \"man-animals\" to do the mining and chooses Jonnie because he considers him the most resourceful.  He places Jonnie on a Learning Machine, which gives Jonnie an indefinite amount of knowledge about Psychlo culture, language, and history.  As a result, he and the other humans in captivity connive a plan to rebel and take back the planet.Where do I begin?  Let's start with the actual story.  Dear Lord, I can only imagine if this were a satire or parody of science fiction films in general. I mean, take a look, the movie \"borrows\" from Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Star Trek, and The Matrix.  Each element taken from each film is repeated and executed in such an awful manner, I couldn't help but laugh.Take a look at the Psychlos, who are obviously Klingon-rejects.  The first sight of one, especially Travolta and Whitaker, had me giggling uncontrollably.  This was to be Travolta's masterpiece?  You've got to be kidding me.  Of course, I haven't even actually begun to delve into the plot.Now, I've read the first 100 or so pages of the book and I just couldn't get through it so I'm guessing the movie and book are fairly alike. I can't imagine why the novel gets such acclaim.  But, anyway, the Psychlos are such an idiotic alien species it's hard to imagine they could conquer humans, much the less the ability to teleport or transport through space.  They're about 9 feet tall, which makes them pretty ineffective when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.  Sure, they can hit pretty hard, but that's no good when the enemy can shoot them.  Well, sure they have guns, but their aim is worse than any James Bond villain, since the only time they hit their targets is when it's a member of the \"expendable\" human cast, which is surprisingly pretty small for a movie called Battlefield Earth (all the fighting's in Denver, by the way).Travolta's Terl is perhaps the biggest idiot of them all.  He actually has a human being put into a learning machine, thus making him accustomed with everything Psychlo (but also teaches him Geometry at no extra cost), and he also leaves him and all his friends alone to mine some gold for two weeks, then never even bothers to question why the gold he gets is perfectly smelt, even though these people never even had the tools capable of doing so.The climax is ludicrous (a couple of moderate spoilers here), and will surely live in major Hollywood infamy just like the conclusion(s) to Jaws: the Revenge.  Basically, what we are to understand is that cavemen can learn to fly 1,000 year old harrier jets in less than a week.  Boy, that means I can do the same thing, too!  And since I have  a significantly higher amount of knowledge dealing with technology than these men, I can learn it in all of one day!  And hey, these guys even learned how to fly these ancient machines with the help of a flight simulator that seems to run on a very, very durable battery.The final battle scene is basically a rip-off of the three-way action sequence at the end of Star Wars: Phantom Menace, and not done nearly a tenth as well.  Basically, we have some aerial dogfights, some infantry combat, and our hero Jonnie taking on the villain Terl in a one-on-one fight (no lightsabers, just an explosive collar).  The entire sequence, which goes on for approximately fourteen minutes, is badly directed.  Director Christian shoots virtually every scene on a tilted angle and films all the gunfights in slow motion.  Of course, there is that one scene where Jonnie runs down in slow-mo with the Psychlos shooting everywhere, with all the bullets collapsing pillars around him.  An obvious steal from The Matrix, and I laughed hard when I saw it.  How can this not be parody?I have a couple of things to say in the movie's favor.  I did like some of the overhead shots of the Psychlo center and some of the visuals are fairly impressive.  The ruins of Washington, D.C. do have a grand scale to it and the movie's strive to be an epic is somewhat admirable, but all the funnier now that I recall the film's silliness.  I also liked two of the performances, coming from Barry Pepper and Kim Coates, both of whom leave with most of their dignity intact.  Though Coates does end up being the guy who talks in a real archaic manner in the beginning, saying things like \"I see you have been fortunate in the hunt, I hope you thanked the gods\" to shouting modern-day phrases by the end of the movie like \"piece of cake!\" and \"Oh, yeah!\"Who am I kidding?  That brief paragraph is probably all the nice things I have to say.  The other performances are simply terrible.  John Travolta and Forest Whitaker deliver probably their all-time worst performances, acting more like two goof-balls working in an office than the lead Chiefs of the Psychlos on Earth.  Kelly Preston is simply laughable in her 30 second stint.  Sabine Karsenti as Pepper's love interest is pretty bland, and she also looks a bit like Alanis Morrissette.  Oh, yeah, and when Jonnie frees all the slaves and leads the revolt, she says to him, \"I always knew this was going to be your destiny!\"  Hmm, anbody care to see what's wrong with that?Battlefield Earth is, simply put, a misguided monstrosity that bombs in almost every conceivable manner.  Like Dune, it takes a perfectly large sum of money and wastes it by churning out a cinematic disaster.  But to Earth's credit, the fact that they seem to just be beggin for the return of MST3K gives me the chance to be slightly more lenient on them, hence the * 1/2 rating I gave it, not to mention all those unintentional laughs.Travolta still wants to make a sequel, and it looks like Roger Christian is willing, too.  Of course, the idea will probably soon dissipate, since it's unlikely anybody will finance the film or the fact that Barry Pepper would even bother returning.  Though it would be hilarious to think that if a sequel was made without Pepper, the filmmakers would just \"Speed 2\" the whole thing by replacing him with another up-and-coming actor and feature Chrissy acting so upset about the way her previous boyfriend just kept on acting like a wild daredevil.",

Maybe it was meant to be a farce? Not since Zardoz have I sat there and wondered, \"WTF am I watching???\" At least Zardoz had Sean Connery!So it's way way in the future - like a thousand years. Human civilization was conquered by aliens long ago, called \"Psychlos\", who have big heads with dreadlocks and wear platform Frankenstein boots! Yes, I said dreadlocks! - I suddenly feel a bad reggae song coming on - What's left of humanity lives pretty much as slaves to the aliens and have been reduced to the level of cave people. They even grunt like apes when they fight. Seriously! It's laughable to watch. But, when they are not grunting, they actually speak very good English. So one human (Pepper) is randomly selected to learn alien technology so he can perform some secret work for the big boss dread-locked alien, played by a rather comical Travolta. Pepper decides instead to use this new found wisdom to rally the humans and . . . \"Stand up! Stand up! Stand up for their rights!\" (Sorry, couldn't help it) Long story short, in 7 days (seriously, SEVEN days) Pepper and a handful of humans learn how to fly harrier jets that have been sitting for 1000 years and are perfectly clean and shiny with absolutely no rust - not to mention the fuel that has managed to stand the test of time! Which is an incredible feat because the gas in my snowblower won't last until the next winter! The special effects are sub par for the generation, the costumes are just ridiculous! The dread-locked aliens bear a striking resemblance to Klingons from Star Trek the Next Generation and the humans all appear to have long hair mullets but are clean shaving. They are very clean cave men!I'll give it a star because I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of it all. And if you need to laugh at something stupid, this is your movie!

Roger Christian apparently thinks he's Orson Welles, as he tries (and fails) to use the odd angles to symbolize things and elucidate the relationships between characters. Maybe his decision to angle everything at 23 degrees is indicative of the tilt of the Earth's axis. Maybe it's just terrible direction. Either way, it's totally lost on everyone except for him. I cared about none of the characters. When the 'man animal' (what are they? Are they men or are they animals?) blew himself up on the Psychlo homeworld, I laughed! I didn't care!

            "content": "I remember the trailers of this movie being everywhere in my old theater (like in February 2000), and even for a 1 year old, I got mixed expectations. I saw it in theaters (week after Gladiator) and man I was bored to tears from that movie. I saw it again and boy my opinion is still the same. This movie was doomed from the start since the idea of adapting a very outdated book from Scientologist L. Ron Hubbard.Anyway, the story is about a guy named Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) being captured by an alien race called the Pyschlos (bare with me) who rule the Earth in the year 3000 by scratch and haven't even checked Kentucky (you'll see why when you did survived through the movie like me). If you want to know why, it is because they all want gold (yeah, one of the Pyschlos might be none other than Mr. Goldfinger). The villain of this movie (I think) is none other than Terl (John Travolta), and he and his race are the worst villains in movie history. Because they're a bunch of idiots and Terl hasn't even checked the Pyschlo library to know what humans eat. Anyways, It is up to Pepper and his group of peoples to make the Psychlo race to an end and destroyed the Pyschlo planet (spoilers).I had HUGE problems with the script, story and plot. First being that there is so many goddamn plot-holes that are bigger than my old jeans. Like I mentioned, the Psychlos are idiots (because how come they can ruled the Earth yet know nothing about us other than that we eat rats?) and the humans aren't even better either. They're obviously monkeys that are trying to be the heroes and being the smartest ones, when reality they don't know how the whole Pyschlo race works and they always make sounds (no wonder why Travolta called them man-animals). Of course they are the obvious ones like it is really stupid to think that there's still electricity for 1,000 years despite the fact that the whole human race is screwed, but I want to go to another topic so that way I won't feel so mad about myself.The acting. Only one good thing about this whole entire movie and that's Forrest Whittaker, that's it. Everyone else looks like they don't want to be in this doomed project. Travolta's voice sounds like a overreacting girl by yelling at the co-stars and his delivery in this movie is worse. Pepper's performance is not interesting. Let's go to technical right now.The technical. There is no good things about the technical stuff either, and it's funny when you think that this movie cost like $73 million to make. The effects look cheap and unfinished. The direction is horrendous (why so many Dutch angles?), and everything else is terrible, especially the score as well.Overall: If I find something worse than this (other than Disaster Movie), I will shoot my brains out. Don't watch this movie, it's not the 'so bad it's entertaining' type of movie and it'll never be. I mean like this movie is like what..14 years old, and it's still remembered for the wrong reasons and I'm glad for that. I'm gonna watch something good tomorrow. I'm gonna watch some Die Hard.(IMDb score): 1/10. (My actual score): 0.1/10.",

This movie is beyond preposterous. It makes \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" look like an epic. The only funny thing ever uttered by Jon Stewart was in regards to this movie. He called it a combination of \"Star Wars\" and the smell of ass.Bad Sign #1: Everything is tilted at an angle. It's as if the director was paying homage to that milestone of dramatic entertainment, the \"Batman\" TV series from the 60s. Yeah buddy, great move.Bad Sign #2: John Revolta. If he's not playing a thug (\"Pulp Fiction\") or a dumb Brooklynoid (\"Grease\") he's worthless.Bad Sign #3: L. Ron Hubbard. So this was his magnum opus, eh? Well, good science fiction requires good science and good fiction. Hubbard provided neither. An atmosphere that explodes in the presence of radiation? Puh-LEEZE! Those are just the opening bad signs. It gets worse. For the grand finale, we are expected to believe that cavemen can learn to fly 1000-year-old Harrier jets against the \"Psyclos\".

No, it is not the worst film in history, I feel confident about saying that much about this film.

This reminded me of a bad episode of one of those Star Trek spin off series(although I'm not sure which). There are elements of this movie that were to be liked.--I sincerly belive that this is going to be one of those movies that will develope a strong cult following in years to come(kind-of-like DUNE did).If this movie accomplished anything it remeinded me of the original 1968 Planet of the Apes-for both various and obvious reasons. I give generously give it 2 stars out of 5- and only becase that last 15 mins of this film has some bad-ass special effects and stunts(thats worth the second star-if it wasn't for that I'd just give it 1 star)",

            "content": "Forget Plan 9 From Outer Space. THIS takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. I can't believe I even paid any money for it! I actually thought that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone says, and it did have a really cool trailer. Instead it ended up being worse than I expected. It carries the basic elements of a good movie (action, romance, etc.) and under uses them. Okay, so those elements don't always make a good movie. But they could have been excellent sub-plots in this film, as they appeared to be at first. I can't even believe this is called a \"movie\". It's more like a bunch of big actors overplaying their parts and spewing unflattering and stupid dialogue during a bunch of dumb scenes. Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, and of course, John Travolta all shame themselves in this mess. They are very good actors and I respect a lot of the choices they have made throughout their careers. But their performances in this smell worse than rabbit feces. There is a plot to speak of that's easy to describe, but it's so dumb I don't really want to put any effort into deciphering it. Oh well, here it goes.\nIt is the year 3000, and man is now an endangered species. They are scattered in groups all over, hiding from the Psychlos, an alien species that has ruled earth for the last 1000 years. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) sets out to find a beast that was described in a cave tale and is captured by the Psychlos. He then encourages all of the other captured humans to revolt against the Psychlos. The plot gets dumber and more complex, mainly because it lost my attention after about an hour and thirty minutes. What's to say? Well, actually there's a lot to say. First off, you'll know the film is going to be bad as soon as it starts with incredibly sucky scene transitions, and it continues for the rest of the film. First Tyler learns about his parents' deaths, which cuts to a second long shot of him at their graves, and is instantly followed by the cave scene. The connection between these (and just about all of the other) scenes was really choppy, and the \"opening doors\" effect just didn't cut it. To add to the ridiculously giant plot holes, only about seven of the characters are properly introduced. Sheesh! I hope that whoever edited this never works in the movie industry again. Oh, and did I mention that John Travolta sounds more like a kid in a candy store than a villain? I would also have to agree with just about everyone else on the statement that he looks like a moron. Now jump to when Jonnie is captured by the Psychlos, which is followed by scene after scene after scene of him running away, and each one ends with him getting shot by guns that look like Nerf pistols. And the guns don't even kill him! Wouldn't the Psychlos consider using a more lethal weapon after the first two or three chases? Guess not. The rest of the scenes mainly just show Terl and Ker having discussions with either each other or some guy who has a neck bigger than earth itself and Barry Pepper and his nameless friends \"easily\" finding out how to save earth. Gee, if I were a Psychlo, I think I would believe it would make perfectly good sense to not let my enemies have access to potentially vital information, even with the biggest guarantee that there would be \"nothing that could help them\". There's also the incredibly lame Psychlo language session, the freaky chick with the huge head and long tongue, and the cavemen instantly learning how to fly fighter jets. Sure they've had to hide in caves for hundreds of years, but to have them marvel at being able to pronounce \"warning\" is just plain dumb. And how many times did they say \"piece of cake\"? I wonder if it outnumbers the number of scenes showing Jonnie getting captured and worthlessly beating up somebody. As much as I love action and big battles, the jet fight wasn't really thrilling, nor was the gun duel. They were just plain bad, but the fact that the movie has most likely bored you to tears by then isn't much of a benefit itself.Another bad thing in this film is that there are parts that will remind you of better movies. Pepper's hair and the guy who looks like Aragorn are likely to make you think about Lord Of The Rings, the detonator removal scene is reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me, and the Fort Knox scenes will trigger thoughts of Goldfinger. All three are movies I should have been watching instead of this. But to ease the suffering, my sister and I did spend about 60 minutes making fun of it, and I recommend that you come up with your own plan to pass the time if you plan on watching it as well. The only positive factor I can arouse when referring to this movie is that it would make a fantastic episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But since that was canceled before this was made, there are no existing aspects of the film that are half enjoyable.By now you should get the picture. This film sucks big time. It's so bad that when I got up to get some orange juice in the kitchen, I could feel my brain rotting. It also fueled a nostalgia for Plan 9. Really, it did! Roger Christian ought to be ashamed of himself for making this. Amazing how a guy who worked on something like The Phantom Menace could be responsible for something this bad. So in short, cavemen can fly jets, Psychlos look like the Coneheads, learning a new language can be done by zapping it into your eyes, and Pepper has hairstyles that make him look like a girl.

            "content": "I have seen plenty of bad films in my time, but I usually understand the reasons behind their being made. For example, \"Saturday Night Live\" rip-offs with actors like Rob Schnider, Adam Sandler, Norm MacDonald, etc. are cheaply produced and do not face much difficulty making back their cost at the box office. The countless plot-free action movies that pop-up every summer manage to pull in cash thanks to their good-looking actors and stylish visual effects. But \"Battlefield Earth\" baffles me. This is not simply a movie that fails in the acting and writing departments. It is also a failure technically, showing a total lack of skill in everyone involved.For those of you who decided not to sit through L. Ron Hubbard's 1,000+ page novel, the \"plot\" (heh) involves Johnnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a young human who single-handedly rises up against a race of aliens that have dominated Earth for a thousand years and have almost entirely erased mankind in hopes of mining for gold. He is captured, learns of the true nature of the aliens' plans from their leader Terl (John Travolta), organizes a revolt, and so on. It's a good thing that the writers gave our hero the name \"Goodboy,\" because it's about as far as they seemed willing to go with character depth.The acting ranges from laughable to downright pathetic. Whenever something bad happens to Johnnie, Pepper is given the chance to look into the camera and shout \"NOOOOO!\" to express the emotional damage inflicted on his character. Distinguished actors such as Forest Whitaker and Michael Byrne are sadistically embarrassed in supporting roles. And John Travolta... sheesh. It looks like he didn't even bother to read over the script. He says his lines as if he were Snidely Whiplash with laryngitis, and can't even get the mandatory evil laugh (\"HOO HOO HOO HA HA HA!\") right.As I said earlier, technical problems also abound. About twelve-too-many slow-motion shots are used during the fight/chase scenes, and they are handled with such clumsiness that it looks as if someone were using stop-motion movement instead. Most of the visual effects look like something you would see on a cheap cable TV series. The lighting in the underground scenes is so dark that I had a hard time figuring out whose face I was looking at. Even the camera angles are bad- every scene has tilted shots that appear to have been filmed by the cameraman from the old \"Batman\" TV show. Director Roger Christian should have stuck to designing sets for a living (yes, he won an Oscar for his work on the original \"Star Wars\"), because he can't even set up a shot properly.\"Battlefield Earth\" looks and feels like one of those direct-to-video sci-fi movies that show on HBO at 3:00 in the morning, yet the budget was big enough to feed a small country. A critical and commercial bomb, this movie deserved every ounce of bad press it got and will be stuck somewhere between \"Glen or Glenda?\" and \"Inchon\" on the list of the worst movies of all time.",

Then there is the high quality acting from the \"man-animals\", the grunting and monkey like movements make for some quality comedic acting. The setting only helps the comedy, I laugh whenever I remind myself that the year is 3000 and yet our weapons from 1000 years earlier are in tact and ready to use. Then not only are our out dated weapons ready to use but they can apparently do now what they failed to do 1000 years earlier which is destroy the alien planet. What a great idea; in my opinion this passes \"There's Something about Mary\" as the funniest movie sequence of all time.

In all of my cinema experiences spanning across a century of filmmaking, I have never seen a movie fail so miserably in comparison to Battlefield Earth. I am not alone in my hatred of my film, nor am I the first... it has the awards to prove it if you don't believe me.In a movie, you need to be able to escape into (or at the very least care about) the events happening on screen. Battlefield Earth is more disconnected from its audience than any movie I've ever seen. Since there is no legitimate effort to get you the viewer involved, the other problems in this movie are really glaring.Director Roger Christian opts to shoot 95% of the scenes in Battlefield Earth with extreme (and I mean extreme) dutch angles to create the feel of a comic book. The only similarity to a comic I could find was the 2-Dimensional delivery, replete with ridiculous looking CGI. What results from this excersize is a good migrane and the realization that there is no vision behind the camera. Christian has much more learning to do in this department, as he was previously a second unit director for Star Wars Episode I, doing transition shots.As far as \"acting\" goes, try 5 Golden Razzies. John Travolta, playing the lead Psychlo, takes home the decade's worst preformance. Our hero Jonnie Goodboy, as played by Barry Pepper, transitions between incompetent and preforming highly advanced mathematical equations. His violent and very primitive outbursts at his superiors, and his rocket science caliber mind around his own race of \"man-animals\" is all but a lazy portrayal of a character to whom you are apathetic.The screenplay is either complex to the point of confusion, or downright silly. None of the characters are even proportioned enough to hold up the choppiness of it all. I still want to know how the man-animals imploded an entire planet with one well-placed bomb. Maybe this will be reconciled in a follow up movie.In the movie, someone says to Travolta's character: \"But when you die and go to hell, it'll be a step up from this place\". That proves to be the seminal line of the film. Even if you don't make it \"up there\", you won't have to co-exist with Battlefield Earth forever.",

And he trains his other ape kind friends to fly them.Now, if the description starts in some point sound like the movie might be ridiculous, then be assured, the movie turns pretty ridiculous far, far earlier than my plot description does. Thanks from this goes to overacting stars, who utter out silly dialog.Surprisingly enough this movie does seem to have quite decent production values, hence the three stars, but the main problem comes straight from the story, which is borderline idiotic. The director is viciously trying to hide that by using tilted camera angles and slow motion action, so that the viewer would be fooled by the flow of the footage not to think those idiocies. Sadly it doesn't work, as the over usage of slow motion and those angles makes the story even less bearable.Only redeeming aspect here is, that the movie manages to be unintentionally funny in many places.

Several titles are often cited, such as Robot Monster, Plan 9, Manos: The Hands Of Fate, Troll 2 and Jack & Jill. Another that is often called the worst ever is this film, and I agree.Based on the first half of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's novel, the film is about humans who live on Earth in the year 3000 after the Psychlos have conquered the planet. The main villain Terl (John Travolta) is the head of security on Earth and his assistant is played by an almost unrecognisable Forest Whitaker. The hero Jonnie (Barry Pepper) is a human who wants to take back Earth from the aliens.It is simply a bad movie in every aspect. The camera work is terrible with all the tilts, the music is so exaggerated at times that you think the wrong track was dubbed, the editing between scenes looks like a PowerPoint slide transition, and the lighting/cinematography also looks awful. Costumes look bizarre, especially Travolta who looks like he has snot dripping from his nose the whole film.Then we get onto the worst parts of it all - the dialogue and acting. Travolta gives one of the worst performances in film history as the villain Terl, over-acting every line as much as is humanly possible (or maybe more as he is an alien in the film). Co-stars Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker are not much better, although they never could have been with such a poor screenplay. It doesn't surprise me that writer Corey Mandell, who re-wrote JD Shapiro's first draft, has not worked since, as the dialogue is laughably bad, particularly that of Travolta's character. As well, the plot of the film is a disjointed mess which has no structure at all, and some ridiculous plot holes. Some people made their minds up due to being against Scientology, however, there is nothing about Scientology in it. That's not why it got it's reputation. It earned its reputation by being a dreadful film. One of the only times I would rate a film 0 if it was possible.",

The humans rebel and join forces to destroy these damn dirty aliens once and for all. As a person who's not quite into science fiction movies, I found out early on why this movie is often considered the worst. The laughable Psychlo designs look like troll dolls covered in moss with dirty mops on their heads. Despite being the leader of the superior conquering alien race, Terl (John Travolta) has no idea how to communicate with the humans or what food they eat. The humans also have inconsistent tendencies, the shopping mall mannequin worshippers that give away their weapons to villains, but yet know to use a nuclear bomb to take out the Psychlos' planet. Seriously, you'd think Terl and his gang would have wiped out the human race on Earth with the use of radioactive fusion, rather than the other way around. So, with that said, Battlefield Earth is one miracle of a sci-fi flop. With the horrendous art direction, baffling idiotic inconsistencies and complete stupidity in the writing and characters, this movie is one giant intergalactic dog that has to be seen to be believed.

            "content": "It is rather distressing how misunderstood this film is. I find it to be quality, even though reviewers by and large do not like it. The film is based on a work of philosophy, made by people sensitive to the philosophy, what other reason would an actor like travolta have for signing on to this project? There are several questions about the film, such as why was Fort Knox not looted, If you listen carefully the film answers the question, as \"greener\" and friends walk in to the vault, Carl makes a comment about the Psychlos satellite not being able to see through the lead walls of this \"cave\",so as far as the film is concerned the Psychlos did not loot fort Knox because they did not know to look there for gold. The Psychlos are not stupid at all, keep in mind that much of this film is allegorical, i.e. the psychlos= corporate America, the resistance= Socialists/ Proletariat for example. That is the best thing about the particular film, a viewer can analyse it indefinitely, why? because the director and the actors were familiar with L. Ron Hubbard, Imagine what The Lord of the Rings would have been if New Line had found only people oblivious to Tolkien. A film by people who care about message is better than one which does not. If people do not like this film, it is unfortunate, but the masses would rather not think about films",

He finds some surviving humans. The Psychlos capture him and others to use as slaves. Terl (John Travolta) is a Psychlo who is stuck on earth after crossing a senator. With new pay cuts coming to the labor force, Terl has the idea to train the human slaves to operate machinery and replace the paid labor. It's a secret and illegal initiative with the help of his second Ker (Forest Whitaker). They use a learning machine on Jonnie. Eventually Jonnie learns enough to start a revolt.This is an universally panned movie and it deserves it. It is ugly looking. The plot is badly written. Travolta's acting is too ridiculous. The sad part is that all of them are deliberate choices. They are all simply wrong choices. There is a nugget of an interesting idea in here somewhere. Enslaved humanity revolting against an alien mining company could maybe work. Pepper is a pretty good actor but he's overwhelmed. Whatever hope this had is lost pretty quickly.",

This is the single funniest movie I've seen all year, and I am still somewhat in shock that someone, anyone involved in this 70-million dollar-plus travesty didn't stop and say, \"Is all this really wise?\"  I'm somewhat glad they didn't, don't get me wrong, but oh my lord where to begin...The plot?  You really want to know?  Okay, it's 1000 years into the future, and earth hasn't changed all that much.  Except for the fact that humanity, and much of the known galaxy, it would seem, has been mostly wiped out and subjugated by the Psychlos.  Who are the Psychlos?  They're dreadlocked, platform-shoed, Klingonesqe morons, to put it succinctly.  These are, quite honestly, the stupidest aliens I have ever seen on film, and that includes the hapless Stormtroopers as well as those Independence Day dolts. However, these aliens don't just shoot badly-they blather on about 'the corporation' and 'leverage' like 8-year-olds made vice-presidents for a day.  You will not believe their petty bickering until you hear it, and I'm still not sure I believe it.  Someone actually had to write this.Oh yes, there's still some humans on Earth too, though they're not a whole lot smarter than the Psychlos.  They mainly only succeed through deus ex machina plot contrivances (Fighter jets and weaponry stationed at Fort Hood still work after 1000 years of neglect?  They can just waltz on into Fort Knox too?  What the HECK?!?) and the blundering vapidity of the vaunted Psychlo 'Chief of Security', yes, our very own John Travolta!  For such a self-aggrandizing vanity picture as this movie seems to be, Travolta really doesn't come out looking very good.  He makes possible nearly every step in the human's revolt, supplementing it all with the worst dialogue imaginable, and diabolical laughter over every tired joke the audience will see coming from a mile away.  To go along with the stupidest alien race, he's just about the worst evil villain I've ever seen too.  Only just about though.If you have even a shred of scientific knowledge, you can rip apart most all of this movie, so just go to town.  Oh, and don't get me started on the rip-offs of The Matrix, which was a rip-off of other sci-fi in and of itself, so that's just doubly lame.  Well, to sum up, if you like bad movies, you'll love this one.  If you don't...um, don't touch this one with a ten-foot ugly stick.Oh, and \"Piece of cake.  Piece of cake.\" is now my new catch phrase for however long till I get bored of it.  Just thought you'd like to know.

Not only did he further enhance his reputation as a big fat pile of crap who'll star in anything that keeps his plane in the air, but he also managed to ruin the burgeoning career of Barry Pepper who'd shown genuine promise in Saving Private Ryan.I suppose one could lay the blame at the doors of the ridiculous 'Church' of Scientology who no doubt had a hand in convincing Travolta that the infantile scribblings of its founder would make a good movie, but I don't know. Anyone who genuinely believes that starring in uber-garbage like Be Cool or Look Who's Talking Too is a step in the right direction must surely shoulder most of the blame.Filth.",

            "review_title": "Not as bad as you'd feared. It's worse",
            "content": "A lot has been written on this film, both before and after its release. Whoever said there was no such thing as bad publicity obviously hasn't heard of this. Prior to it's release, there was controversy over both its Scientology background, with fears being raised as to possible subliminal messages, and from the producers, talking of a film that would top Star Wars. Neither George Lucas nor concerned parents need have lost any sleep.After bombing on its release, amidst the sound of critical panning, Battlefield Earth still remains at the front of people's minds, but for the very wrong reasons. Having watched this film properly for the first time a few days ago, I can finally see what the fuss was all about.Quite simply, this is a textbook example of how not to make a film, a perfect showcase of everything that is wrong with big budget Hollywood. This movie fails on a quite astonishing amount of levels, making you wonder how anyone involved could sit back and say 'Yep, that's the one.' At least you could argue that small budget movies have an excuse for being rubbish, as they can't hire top name actors or production crew. It's incredible to think a post-Pulp Fiction Travolta or Forest Whitaker actually came within a million miles of this (well, apart from the whole Scientology thing.) So, where to begin? Well for a start, the script is simply wretched. The acting is similarly bad, although you have to wonder if any actor could turn in a decent performance reading those lines. Then there is the question of the directing and editing, the latter being quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Continuity was all over the place; for example on one scene Barry Pepper falls over (incidentally, he spends the entire moving doing that, running away or grimacing) near some steel pipes, yet lands in a patch of open ground. Or he runs into a forest, yet a few seconds later he appears to be in a quarry. That's before we even get to the pointless slow motion, the way lightning changes in between scenes, or the weird camera angles. Storyline, believability or scientific credibility you say? Well, here are but a few errors in the film; fires burn when there is no oxygen, guns destroy scenery yet only stun people, the alien baddies switch between English and alien language randomly, cities seem to have been abandoned for a decade, let alone a millennia, in one scene it's snowing yet the next it's the middle of summer, and so on. Perhaps the way the cavemen speak perfect English, yet can't understand what a square or a half is. The aliens aren't any more impressive mind you. Called the Psychlos (clever huh? Never would've guessed they were the baddies) and absolutely definitely not bearing any resemblance to a certain Star Trek race, they are so stupid you wonder how they can walk and talk at the same time, let alone conquer the galaxy. Apparently stripping the galaxy bare of gold, they somehow conspire to miss Fort Knox. They think men are savages, yet live in the remains of cities and even visit a library. They really should've watched some old James Bond films as well, as they could've learned a few things about hiding your plans from your adversary.Now you might think this is a pretty damning list, but I haven't even got to the best bits. The caveman flying the harriers at the end will surely go down in movie folklore, facing stiff competition from the cow shooting scene, or the 'falling through 4 plates of glass' part. It goes beyond being one of those films that is so bad it's good, and transcends to a whole new plain of great-badness. Even the special effects range from average to rubbish, with the dome breaking at the end reminiscent of an early Playstation game. Good points? Well there were a few nice scenery shots. For the above reasons, and more I simply don't have the space to go into, I recommend everybody see this film, especially those who want to get involved in the film industry. It's a perfect example of what not to do.Incidentally, this film doesn't play properly on my DVD player. Perhaps its trying to tell me something?",

Everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they've ever done. This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive, Two of a Kind and Swordfish, which are comparative masterpieces.The cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful. The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky, take for example: Chirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.The acting, considering the fairly accomplished people involved is laughably hammy. Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.Filled with plot holes, poor special effects, bad acting, worse writing, no direction and a soundtrack that would annoy deaf people, this 'film' has less artistic merit than a theoretical snuff movie written by Joe Eszterhas, directed by Uwe Boll and staring Brendan Fraser.

I'm not one to stop a movie halfway through so I figured we should at least let this dredge finish.  In retrospect, I wish I had.There are too many places and bad aspects in this movie to name all of them so I'll just name a few of the more annoying ones.  First, Travolta, giving the worse performance he has ever given.  He wasn't even like a real villain.  He was more like a caricature of a villain.  His incessant \"evil laughter\" became laughable itself halfway through the movie.  I half expected him to start stroking his mustache while tying a girl to a railroad track while we patiently awaited the arrival of the lone ranger.  If Travolta is lucky, he'll be getting a call from Tarrantino offering to jump start his career again.Second, Barry Pepper, who was enjoyable in Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile seemed like he was trying to imitate Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in Braveheart.  His speeches, meant to sound inspiring were annoying and made me want even more to turn the movie off even more.Third, the screenplay seemed like it was written by a three year old.  It was so predictable I knew what the next person was going to say half the time.There are so many more reasons i could give you not to see this movie, but I'm sure between my review and the reviews of others on this list a good half of them will be mentioned.

            "content": "To begin with, Battlefield Earth is not the worst film ever made. Tim Burton consistently makes worse films than this. But it remains a pretty sorry excuse for two hours and almost $80 million bucks. Even my parents, huge John Travolta fans, said that Travolta should have been slapped for making this film. That alone should tell you something about this film's lack of quality.The funny thing is, the premise of the film is actually not that bad. Earth is conquered by aliens, and the human slaves rise up in a revolt. Sounds like a worthy base concept for a film, but the details of the movie ruin it. Like naming your alien invaders \"Psychlos\" from the planet \"Psychlo,\" for instance. Or naming your hero \"Johnny Goodboy Tyler.\" Or making your alien invaders such nitwits that they actually take rebellious humans and pump their brains full of knowledge to make them smarter. Or having Harrier jets working perfectly fine after 1000 years and having cavemen easily pilot them after a few days on a simulator when experienced pilots can't even do it after years of training. Or having one nuke take out an entire planet because its atmosphere can't handle any kind of radiation (are we to believe that Psychlo has no ozone layer?). Or any of the other many, many flaws, inconsistencies, plot holes, logical lapses, and idiocies that pass for the movie's story. Seriously, just what were writers Corey Mandell and JD Shapiro (working from the L. Ron Hubbard novel) thinking, if they were thinking at all? From start to finish, the script is so ridiculous and whacked-out that there's no way you can buy into it. And when the cavemen start chanting \"Piece of cake! Piece of cake! Ugh ugh ugh ugh!\", the only response you can have is to laugh yourself silly.Making matters worse is Roger Christian's inept direction, which includes an addiction to tilted camera angles. Granted, angled shots can work when used properly (The Bride of Frankenstein and Batman, for example), but 90% of this film is canted for no reason (and at least half of it is done in slo-mo). Our first glimpse of Johnny Goodboy Tyler is when we see him striding down the plains on horseback like the Lone Ranger\u0085and the camera tilts from one side to the other every time the shot changes, and it looks so ridiculous that you just start laughing. And the slo-mo shots of the cavemen being hosed down by the aliens look like bloated Super Soaker ads\u0085and again, you have to laugh. Oh, and let's not forget the scene where they rip off The Matrix's lobby shootout, another laugh riot. And what's more, they don't even use sound FX in some of the shots, which makes it even nuttier. For someone who apprenticed under George Lucas, Christian didn't learn anything about making a good movie. And then there's the problem of the visuals. Why do the Psychlo ships look like flying shoeboxes? Why do the Psychlos all have George Clinton hairdos with Village People Leather Guy outfits, Joel Schumacher codpieces, and rubber werewolf hands? And why do the FX look so cheap (when Travolta's arm is blown off, it looks like exploding styrofoam)? Visually, this movie is so pathetic that again, it only induces laughter (and the less said about Kelly Preston's The Mask-style uber-tongue, the better). As for Elia Cmiral's score\u0085argh. A tinny, high school-sounding orchestra mixed with synth-rock does not a good blend make.Then there's the acting. I really liked Barry Pepper and Kim Coates a lot. Pepper's an intense actor in the Ron Eldard mold, and Coates has an amiable goofiness about him. Both men deserve better than this. But Travolta, otherwise a stellar actor, was just plain awful. He overdid the hamminess, his faux-British accent was annoying, and his flowy hand gestures made him look like a bad gay stereotype\u0085which had me laughing again. (While we're on the subject, what was with his Snidely Whiplash laugh?) And Forrest Whitaker's Fat Albert voice as Travolta's dippy sidekick was howl-inducing. In fact, all of the Psychlos and the other cavemen were ridiculous. They were either laughable or just plain stupid. With no story, no characters to care about, and no decent visuals to hook us, what are we supposed to latch onto?I can't help but laugh when I hear people say that this movie's too deep, too intelligent, too moral, and too truly sci-fi for the unwashed masses to appreciate it, hence its failure. Just who are they kidding? Battlefield Earth is little more than MST3K fodder at best, a screamingly funny piece of ineptitude. And if Travolta is serious about pushing ahead with the planned sequels\u0085please, don't. Once was bad enough.",

That would not have gone well in a movie. In time, you do come to accept this and John Travolta makes a great Psychlo. I love how they ended it to allow a sequel, unfortunately, that I am sure is much more difficult, hence, no sequel. It accurately portrays the Psychlo hostility but not the why. That would be uncovered in the sequel I am sure. The book, takes a long time to unfurl, 900 pages worth, to get through what this movie presents. It is a bit painful to struggle through those 900 pages, so this movie covers it much better and in an entertaining way. I would recommend reading the book before the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book, you might be disappointed in the book.\nI find the criticism of the movie quite uninformed. No one seems to know why things are the way they are nor how things developed. The movie comes in well after the take over of earth and portrays a logical condition of man falling back to a primitive society such as the American Indians.

I give it a 10...(Really on a true review scale I give it a 6.5, but it gets a 10 vote for the pure joy I've had watching mob morons trip over themselves to bash it with 1s and 0s while stating how terrible a Kirk Cameron movie is and gives it a 4..LMAO From the irrational hate to the hypocritical mob mentality it's a cultural phenomenon. As good as the book?? No, but what is really, A decent sci-fi flick? Yeah it really is.",

I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, and I could not believe my eyes. How was this piece of trash made? The lead actor in this thing (I think `thing' is far more appropriate than `movie') was unfathomably bad. Even the editing -- most notably the annoying iris-out transitions -- was hurriedness. I do recommend, however, that everyone see this movie; it is worth a good laugh. In short, when you mix bad acting, bad writing, bad story, baddirection, bad score, and special effects that look as if they were created by a 3- year-old playing with iMovie, the result is a movie that proves that there is no limit to how bad a movie can possibly be.

Robert Christian should just stick to helping George Lucas, because he obviously has very little talent to carry his own film. I mean, just how bad was this film! Granted, I liked some of the CGI effects and some of the concepts brought up in the film (like the legendary significance of McDonald's gets me everytime), but it was all so horribly rushed. Maybe this book shouldn't have been made into a film, especially after reading the book, which is truly an epic. Sadly, Forrest Whitaker prostituted himself in this movie, and his career is barely clinging on. Fortunately for John Travolta, he didn't try to go the path of Kevin Costner and make another futuristic bomb.",

Just to state, I am not a Scientology fan, or follower, and I have not been brain washed from any of Hubbard's writings. I am simply a Science Fiction fan, and have long awaited this film's release since reading Battlefield Earth some 10 - 15 years ago. Having said that this film falls miles below the depth and intrigue offered by the novel. Of course they would have needed to make at minimum a 4 or 6 hour movie, or movies in order to capture the essence of the novel, but it would have been worth while to do so. There is so much glorification of characters in the movie that the characters with the exception of Travolta as Terl are mere shadows of what Hubbard intended. I have read other posts here that state Travolta's race is depicted as cruel, and horrific, and that they thought this was Travolta's doing as his own input into the film, but he certainly hit the nail on the head with this one, as the Psychlo race is suppose to be cruel as well as highly intelligent. The film skims over important points such as the mathematics that the Psychlos build their entire empire on which just happens to be the most powerful in the entire universe. Terl's bumbling idiocy is apparent through his the film, as well in the novel, which explains his being outcast to such a desolate planet as Earth.The entire relationship between Terl and Jonnie is omitted, as well as the struggles of Jonnie as he deals with the realization that he has become the leader of the remaining humans on Earth. In addition the entire last third to quarter of the novel is left out of the movie. The charter depicted in the movie is nothing like that of the one written in the novel. This is unfortunate as you really learn to care for Jonnie in the novel and you don't get that same feeling from the movie. All in all I give this movie a 5 out of 10, perhaps a little higher than it deserves, but if you have read the book first you fill in the spaces as you go, and you tend to omit the crap inserted by the film makers to beef up the visual effects.",

            "content": "I always had been curious about this movie for 3 years since I discovered IMDB's Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 lowest rated in the site). In the old Bottom 100 (the one that required only 1,500 ratings at least) it was #63 and since the Bottom 100 changed its parameters (with at least 10,000 ratings to be qualified) is now #16 as I am writing (between FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY and DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION). And it has quite a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made in the history of cinema!!! Finally the last day of 2019 I had the guts of watching it and yes, I understood why it's hated so much by everyone but I also thought it had a FEW good points.The movie is set in the year 3000 as the title says. The human race is nearly extinct as the last survivors of the species are used as slaves. Earth is now dominated by Psychlos, a greedy and scary looking alien race that use humans in the hope of harvesting gold. Their sinister leader, Terl (John Travolta in huge makeup) wants to steal all the gold and then conquer the universe with the help of his aide Ker (Forest Whitaker) who in the end betrays him. However one of the humans named Johnnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) tries everything to save his fellows and will succedd in defeating Terl and destroy the planet Psychlo making it explode.This movie has to be dissected in its main problems and I'll talk about them one by one: 1) The acting. John Travolta overracted terribly all the time and it was clear that this was his passion project as it's based on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and Travolta was a devoted scientologist (and a few months ago left following the death of his wife Kelly Preston). Among his most excellent quotes from the movie is ''Well, I can assure you that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job that even a moron like you could perform. While you were still learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME, I was being trained to conquer GALAXIES! To do anything less is a disgrace to my entire family line.'' And it made me laugh instead of crying. Barry Pepper gives a good performance in an otherwise terrible movie and I am sure he knew he was in such a bad movie.2) The makeup: the alien costumes were so hideous to watch. They looked like Jamaican Klingon clowns and most of them had even fur on their nails and fingers. And the alien girl (played by Kelly Preston in a bit role) has probably the creepiest tongue I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie!3) The cinematography: I have to inform you that if you hate wide angle shots, well, you should avoid this movie as it's full of them! I think the cinematographers used this technique because they thought it was innovative, but I personally thought it was distracting and grating on the viewer's eyes.4) The sets: they were probably the only good thing about this movie especially in the mountain shots and they look very innovative for such a bad movie.5) The suspension of disbelief: When Terl wants to finds out what is humans' favourite food they send Johnny and two other humans on a mountain top for three days and after three days the humans eat some rats. Then Terl says ''Rats! That's what we'll feed them since this is their favourite food!'' If he was smarter he could have simply asked them ''What do you like to eat?'' and not sending them on a snowy mountain. After a while when the humans all gather for their revenge they go in a garage full of fighter jets where there are books still in perfect condition after thousands and thousands of years and with electric bulbs that still have power and function well! And (a massive slap in the forehead follows) in a matter of only few days the humans learn how to fire weapons, use fighter jets and learn how to fire from them! This is like the most unbelievable plot point in history of cinema: it's not humanly possible doing what all those humans do in a few days!However, I think I said all about one of the most loathed movies of all time and I dissected it well. Despite all the hate I didn't thought that it was THAT terrible. The idea for it (humans that rebel against evil and greedy aliens) was very good on paper. But the movie was so badly written and so badly acted that the result is atrocious and it's even hard to believe that this movie even exists! In my opinion it wasn't 100% bad, but just the 95%.",

My favorite line of his: \"When you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer GALAXIES!!!\" See, the reason this is favorite movie is because it doesn't stop entertaining for ten seconds. Right from the beginning, something cheezy is happening that makes you feel embarrassed for everyone involved in this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT!!

I sold the DVD as fast as I could. With BE, I started out with gritted teeth in anticipation of a true dog, but instead found it to be a fantastic movie, and have since bought the DVD and have enjoyed watching it twice more. What gives??To everyone giving it a bad review (this includes almost all of you): OK people, you need to check your hatred of L. Ron Hubbard, John Travolta, Scientology, etc. at the door before reviewing this movie. You also seriously need to develop some INDEPENDENT critical thinking skills. You ratbrains hear some good or bad buzz and just start piling on. Are you incapable of not following the leader? Could you please not cave to conventional wisdom with such depressing regularity?People seem to hate John Travolta, but he's been in several risky but excellent movies such as \"White Man's Burden\" \"She's So Lovely\" \"Pulp Fiction\" and now \"Battlefield Earth\". My DVD collection would be poorer with his absence. And come on, the BE novel was a HUGE milestone in SF! Think what you will about the whole Scientology thing (I personally wish we could evolve past all forms of superstition including religion) but it has no direct bearing on the quality of this movie.I'm guessing here, but I think people are offended by they way humans are portrayed in the film. Take away our technology and we revert back to the stone age in terms of our superstitions and barbarity. The veneer of civilization is indeed very thin. It is so thin you can plainly see through it in places if you take the time to look. This movie does, and so it offends our tender sensibilities.Look what this movie has going for it: It has commentary on religion: humans revealed as the primitive beings they are, flying jets nonetheless. How many times have you seen a crucifix in a vehicle in our time? It has commentary on big business, empires, etc.: much like Rome, the Cyclos control too much, become corrupt, overreach, lose control. It has an misunderstood comedic element that may make it seem over-the-top to those who don't understand it: corruption leads to inefficiency and ineptness. This was in Star Wars too, e.g. the stormtroopers, or for that matter everyone in middle and upper management in the death star. It has moral commentary: the extinct teaching race was done very effectively and thoughtfully - the meek most often don't inherit anything. It has a big sweep, good effects, the ships are believable, the towering presence of the alien costume is impressive, lots of stuff blows up.What could have been better: I hate to say this, but the main human character could have been better looking and / or a bigger name actor. He has kind of a weasel face, thus giving a 'B' movie feel to his scenes. He's a fine actor though.",

Of course almost everyone who has ever watched a film will be aware of this, since it has become universally known as a bad movie.

            "review_title": "Really bad movie [Contains spoilers]",
            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** How anyone can class this movie as intelligent is beyond me.First of all, let me start of by saying I love SF - it is without doubt one of my favorite genres.So, to the movie...The plot holes were more glaring than the sun over the Sahara Desert, the plot, camera work and editing as wandering as drunk after drinking a brewery dry, and the story line reminiscent of those really bad movies of the 50's.So, what went wrong with the story...?Let's see: Man, virtually repressed over 1000 years, manages to learn in 7-14 days how to read & write, disarm cruise missiles and fly advanced jet fighters. Meanwhile all-conquering aliens bicker and quibble like schoolgirls and don't even begin to question how repressed man can turn raw gold into perfectly shaped ingots with no visible means of doing so?We are expected to believe that mankind in the 21st Century could do nothing to hurt the Psychlo's, and yet along comes Neanderthal man's third cousin and kicks some serious Pyschlo butt? Get outa here!Oh, and I was so impressed about the incredible co-incidence that 'Appendix-A' just happened to be on the over-head projector. Not only that but it was the very same Appendix-A that they were looking for!So, what other plot-holes were there: Well apart from the fact that Terl left the humans to fly around the country in the flyer, I can only assume he left them with the Military version of Rand-McNally. How else where they able to find Fort Knox and Fort Hood in Texas so easily? (I was surprised that there were any planes there at all-surely mankind would have used them all in fighting the Psychlo's in the first place-that or the wouldn't the Psychlo's had time to destroy every last remaining piece of firepower? After all, they've had a thousand years to do this)It was also amazing to see that even after 1000 years, power still worked in Ft. Knox & Ft. Hood, that the planes were pretty much fueled up and ready to fly (obviously the tires were still at optimum pressure). The fact that at the end Terl was unable to do any more than lightly throttle Jonnie, rather than kill him also spoiled it for me. The bomb destruction of the Psychlo homeworld took an enormous amount of disbelief, but I could just about suspend mine for that sequence (the explosion itself was quite cool).I watched this move with an open mind. I really hoped there might be some redeemable qualities, and there were, albeit few and far between. I am prepared to give many films a certain amount of latitude and excuse a few sequences in the name of poetic license, but this move really took credibility just way way too far.The special effects were good, music passable and scenery pleasing to the eye. But that alone does not make a good move make.If the purpose of a movie is to entertain, then I suppose it just about did that. But given the standard of films released in this day and age, and especially considering the pedigree of the production staff involved, it archived barely 2% of it's base potential.Too all those people who said that they thought it was a good to excellent movie: You have my sympathies. You have obviously not been exposed to some really good (or even mediocre) films in your life. May I suggest you seek out some classics before making such comments again.Sure, not every film needs to be, or should be, a Star Wars, CE3K or ET of it's time. But equally the film should respect it's audience and treat them with intelligence.What on earth were John Travolta et al think when they were making this movie? 'Yeah, that's completely stupid, but the audience will buy it - they're stupid'. Well, Mr Travolta, got news for you: The vast majority of your audience were not stupid. That's why the Gross of the movie barely made back 50% of the budget...The only reason I watched it was because it was on cable. I'm sure glad I didn't actually go and do something stupid like actually pay to rent this movie or something. Sheesh!Perhaps one day it may become a cult move - the same way that Plan 9 from Outer Space is...Two stars out of ten - and even then that's pushing it...In short, it was pretty much an unmitigated disaster.",

I saw it months ago and thought it was the silliest thing I'd seen in years: wildly overacted, completely implausible, and possessing an absolutely brainless plot.The movie isn't bad because it was made by a lethargic director.  Rather, Battlefield Earth's awfulness is the product of the bizarre and feverish direction of Roger Christian.  Yes, Christian directed this movie as a man possessed: ending each scene with a rather tired-looking middle-wipe fadeout, shooting the dynamic duo of Terl n'Ker at a neck bending 15 degree angle, and coming in for a lot of disgusting closeups with the disgusting \"Psychlos\".The plot adds both badness and hilarity to this movie.  Terl is, without a doubt, the most mentally-challenged supervillain in cinematic history. Many others have been awed by the 1000 year old Harriers, their caveman pilots, and the magical simulator these top guns nee cavemen use to master their new steeds.  Additionally, there is Terl's bizarre insistence on teaching the rat-brains nuclear physics, without any need to do so.  Certain words are repeated feverishly and quite meaninglessly: \"leverage\", \"man-animals\", \"rat-brains\", \"the home office.\"  Meanwhile Travolta laughs hysterically and uncontrollably at jokes that a lowbrow 9 year old would shrug at, Whitaker growls like a second rate Klingon, and Barry Pepper does his best to act uber-heroic.  It's a mess worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.All of this is both bad and somehow quite funny.  I have read musings by Christian that he and the crew wanted to get the sequel out even after Battlefield Earth tanked so badly.  If he manages to pull this off, I might even show up to laugh myself silly - again.  Nor would I really mind seeing it again for laughs.One idea he might consider is buffing up his feeble storyline by merging it with that of another movie - kind of a Hardy Boys meets Nancy Drew type arrangement.  Here are some plot ideas for Roger:-Here on Battlefield Earth: In the year 3000, a drag race between two man-animals in ancient cars results in the destruction of the local Psychlo diner.  The evil Terl forces the two young rat-brains to work together to rebuild the establishment - and gives them both a crash course on nuclear fission.  Can they overcome their class differences and rivalry over pouty heroine Leelee Sobieski in order to take back the planet?-Terl, Interrupted: In the late 60's, Terl is committed to a mental institution.  Can his budding friendship with sociopathic woman-animal Angelina Jolie help him overcome his pathological need for \"leverage\" and poor sense of humor?-American Psychlo: In the late 80's, Terl finds work at a cutthroat Wall Street brokerage, where he becomes an accomplished serial killer who enjoys shooting the limbs off of cows and \"leverage\" buyouts.",

            "content": "Watching \"Battlefield Earth\" is like sitting through a renegade Monty Python version of \"Star Wars.\" Despite its $90 million budget, arty cinematography, and turbo-charged action scenes, this mediocre post-apocalyptic potboiler about ten-foot-tall aliens enslaving earthlings in the year 3000 never blends its die-hard heroics with its campy surrealism for maximum impact. While the straightforward humans struggle to reclaim their planet in this partial adaptation of author L. Ron Hubbard's blockbusting novel \"Battlefield Earth,\" their egotistical and wholly overconfident alien foes blackmail each other for leverage to get off Earth. \"Battlefield Earth\" suffers from director Roger Christian's dramatically uneven helming and Corey Mandell and J.D. Shapiro's conventionally lowbrow script that boasts few surprises. This mock-heroic epic never generates much charisma for its dull hero, antagonism for its extroverted enemy, or excitement in the daredevil feats our heroes perform to defeat the villainous Psycholos.Man tops the endangered species list, and the sexist, chauvinistic Psychlos are man's mortal adversary. These technically superior extraterrestrials conquered Earth in a battle that rages for just nine minutes. Afterward, they occupy the planet to plunder its mineral resources. Unable to breathe Earth's toxic air, the Psychlos wear small \"Dune\" like nose clamps that pipe their native oxygen through rope-sized hoses into their nostrils. They live inside a huge domed city (like the one in \"Total Recall\") filled with gas from their native planet. (Yes, humans must wear the same apparatus when they enter the city. Instead of breathing the potent Psychlo gas, they inhale regular earth oxygen.) Outside, nomadic tribes of buckskin clad humans that survived the Psychlo invasion live like their prehistoric ancestors. A smarter-than-average hunter, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper of \"Saving Private Ryan\"), refuses to accept mankind's subjugation.As the chief of Psychlo security, Terl (John Travolta) dreams and schemes about getting back to his home planet. He believes his superiors will reassign him after they see the superb job he has done with a mining operation. Instead, they extend Teril's tour of duty on Earth indefinitely for his indiscretion with a Psychlo senator's daughter. Meanwhile, captured and caged in a zoo (as in \"Planet of the Apes\"), a defiant Tyler foments unrest against the Psychlos. An unscrupulous Terl risks death when he breaks the law to train 'man-animals' as miners. Ker (Forest Whitaker of \"Phenomenon\") and he have found a vein of gold they plan to steal secretly (shades of \"The Mask of Zorro\") by using earthlings instead of Psychlos to excavate it.Terl connects Tyler to a holographic learning machine. The only other alien present in \"Battlefield Earth\" appears briefly as a tutor, and he is a sorry-looking specimen. Basically, images are beamed into Tyler's eyes, and he cannot move until the device is deactivated. Tyler learns to speak Psychlo as well as fly a Psychlo transporter. Later, Terl mistakenly believes Tyler is mining ore when our hero is really flying his rebellious cohorts, Rock (Michael Perron), Carlo (Kim Coates), and Robert the Fox (Richard Tyson), to an underground hanger stocked with Harrier jump jets. Miraculously, in seven days of sitting in an aircraft simulator, these cavemen learn how to fly a Harrier into combat against alien spaceships! In \"Battlefield Earth,\" learning and mental clarity (the Scientology credo) pave the way for mankind's salvation and triumph over t heir cretinous, overconfident foes.The acting and casting of the lead roles leave a lot to be desired. As the heroic Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, Barry Pepper is a competent actor, but he lacks personality. Pepper brings little charisma with him and does even less to bolster his character. He displays none of Luke Skywalker's innocence and not enough of \"Mad Max's\" vengeance. An actor with more celebrity status was definitely needed to enhance the hero's luster. John Travolta's villainous Terl overshadows him in every scene.\"Battlefield Earth\" features one of John Travolta's worst performances. Although he plays Terl full-tilt, throttle wide open, as the obscenely vain, obnoxious Psychlo that he is, Travolta leaves no room for subtlety. He's too ham-fisted and doesn't register as much of a threat as a villain. Imagine Vincent Vega from \"Pulp Fiction\" with the attitude it would take to support the outrageous wardrobe and coiffure of the Psychlos and you have Travolta's histrionic performance in a nutshell. Travolta should have veered more to ruthlessness instead of buffoonery. Interestingly, Terl is the best looking of the Psychlos; everybody else appears grotesque, almost beyond the bounds of good taste.Director Roger Christian had the right credentials to direct \"Battlefield Earth.\" He helmed the second unit scenes for George Lucas on \"Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace.\" Reportedly, Lucas told Travolta that Christian was the only director capable of handling the logistics of \"Battlefield.\" Nevertheless, not even Christian can save \"Battlefield\" from bad looking aliens, rotten costume designs, and inept scripting. The only time he drums up suspense is when he uses their gruesome shadows to foreshadow the entrance of the Psychlos. Once production and costume designer Patrick (\"Godzilla\") Tatopoulos' aliens are unmasked, everything goes south. Further, these villains are too stupid and easy to defeat. A glance at the heavily-uniformed Psychlos in KISS platform shoes, dreadlocks, and goofy wolf paws is enough to make you laugh yourself silly. In all probability, Christian may have shot much of \"Battlefield\" in tinted blue noir lighting to minimize the hilarity of the Psychlo's costuming. Another major problem is the shifting tone that robs the film of any majesty. \"Battlefield Earth\" resembles \"Lil' Abner\" in space, shifting inconsistently from straight drama to comic relief. The scene were Tyler fight an obstinate earthling over the prison chow the Psychlos serve up amplifies this inconsistency. The aerial combat scenes lack punch. Finally, because so little is conveyed in the Mandell & Shapiro script about the aliens, we never truly get a sense of who they are and what they can accomplish.If you walk into \"Battlefield Earth\" hoping to see \"Star Wars,\" prepare to be disappointed.",

I have read reviews from $cientologists here, each fullsome in their praise of this movie, but they are following Church of $cientology policy and lying. This is a bad movie, and should be taken out the back and put down. I also see it as the downfall in Travolta's career, as how can he claim $20million for a movie, when this turkey has not even made $20million.",

If this is the case, then I don't want to read the book.  The plot was unoriginal, yet semi-interesting, the acting was terrible, and the character development, non existant.  John Travolta's portrayal of a barbaric alien (with a shakespearean twist) was annoying.  The directing was awful.  Why do they refer to rats as \"rats\" but man as \"man-animals\", and the climax of the movie was pathetic.  I had no feelings for any of the characters.  The director obviously tried to invoke some tears in the audience by having two lovable characters commit hari kari, but it didn't work.  Nothing worked, actually, I take that back, the only thing that worked was the end credits, a sure sign that the movie was over.",

            "content": "'Piece of cake, rat brains' indeed. It's definitely a piece of something, all right and I don't mean 'art' while the second part of that little quote I fabricated out of the two funniest lines of dialogue in the film is perhaps best suited to describing what the makers of this dross have in-between their ears. Yes, serial razzie offender for its respective year, Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000, is as bad and as bizarre as I expected it to be. It's not just a saga of the year 3000, it's an ordeal FROM the year 2000 and while I haven't seen any of English director Roger Christian's other work, the fact he made films before this failure and has made films since suggests that he is a director whose work carries a certain competence so perhaps the blame must lie with the writers. In this case, quite possibly with the novel from which the film was based, written by Scientology creator himself L. Ron Hubbard.The film is a disaster, a 21st Century Flash Gordon but done with a stranger approach; a 21st Century Plan 9 From Outer Space purely because A; it falls into the sci-fi genre and B; it's absolute garbage. But there are always those two different types of 'bad' with films, those crazy; all over the place; complete suspension of disbelief films that come across as quite purposeful due to the demographic they're aimed at and the other, more difficult to spot 'bad' films that degrade or misinform but come across as something the makers are taking seriously. Battlefield Earth seems to want us to have fun but at what cost? The dialogue, special effects and general use of mise-en-scene are horrid, rendering the film an absolute chore when it isn't trying to worm its way into the 'guilty pleasure' realm.Battlefield Earth sees an alien race known as the Psychlo's having already invaded Earth and are now pillaging it for gold and other such resources for their own race back home on the very originally named 'Planet Psychlo'. Amongst all this is Barry Pepper's Jonnie Tyler, a young and energetic human being, of which few remain, who looks to strike back against the alien race in a bid to bring back freedom to planet Earth. In this sense, the film is a journey of self discovery raising issues to do with confidence, maturity and the ability to act on one's own following the leaving of a 'home' or 'farm' setting in which everything is normal and safe. The example here is the huge wooden wall Jonnie and his human counterparts hide behind when threat of the Psychlos emerges. But do any of us really think a wooden perimeter is going to stop these aliens if they wiped out Earth's combined resistance in something like ten minutes? From here, Jonnie breaks free of the wall confining him and goes on his quest. He will encounter Terl (Travolta) and his assistant Ker (Whitaker), the former of which spends nights in a mock-bar downing Psychlo alcohol and regressing. He'll meet other humans and engage in conversation; 'The grass is greener on the other side' says one of them, a phrase that has survived the 1,000 years since the invasion happened but the ability to recognise a mall mannequin doll has seemingly not. Jonnie will eventually be captured and placed in a cell with many others - he'll get into a fight with a fellow male human who looks like a supermodel despite slavery conditions. Meanwhile the Psychlos walk around in clothing that looks like a combination of 1970s flair and rubber fetish gear. Terl dreams of getting off Earth and rising through the ranks; his comic exchanges with Ker and the manner in which he bangs his head on the ceiling at one point just makes for wired watching. If it's supposed to be funny, we're not laughing.The film likes its slow motion which is no problem but it also likes its double takes, something that should be used sparsely if at all in films in my opinion due to the zoning out of reality it carries with it. The film carries on down a path that splits Jonnie's rise to this level of a 'second coming' being and Terl's gradual demise as a Psychlo supervisor, having him get into the odd comic verbal exchange with Terk at the same time. The finale is ludicrous to say the least; completely contradicting the Psychlo's might when at the start they said they crushed Earth's resistance in minutes or an hour or whatever but here the logic goes all awry.It also contradicts science itself when it appears a flight simulator as well as several fighter jets are available and ready to work \u0096 it appears electricity and fuel are still available. The film is a disaster but it's a grand, big budget disaster meaning there'll always be something to look at or laugh at, however unintentional it's supposed to be. For every Pulp Fiction or Saving Private Ryan Travolta and Pepper will appear in, there will be a Battlefield Earth - it's the way the universe works.",

            "content": "***CONTAINS SPOILERS***When I sit in a theater totally silent looking at the exit sign, wondering to myself if I'm missing anything on public television and looking at my watch every five minutes, that is the sign of a bad movie. This movie makes Flash Gordon (Sam Jones version) look like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and The Last Star Fighter look like a Shakespearian epic.\nI find myself asking what were they thinking?  Couldn't you see this bomb a mile away?  I went to see this movie not having heard any of the bad review but good ones and the one that stands out in my mind is the review that said John Travolta is the new face of evil.  I said okay, I'll give it a shot and went out to see the movie.  After seeing it, I was like WAIT A SECOND!!!!!!!! Now let's go back to the year 1977.  People are standing in line around the block to see Star Wars: A New Hope.  Now the movie has started, you see two of the biggest ships  you have ever seen, the good guys are running down the hall to fight the bad guys who suddenly storm in shooting.  The good guys are defeated and then out of the smoke comes this big, huge, gigantic man.  He is dressed all in black leather, wearing a mask that would make ancient Chinese warriors wet themselves and he has a huge cape on.  He steps in with authority and his men quickly come to attention at his presence.  He says nothing as he surveys the damage and then moves on.  From this point, you know this is the man who is in charge and this is a man that you do not want to mess with.  That is the face of evil.  Travolta looked like Lt. Commander Worf's, the Predator, Mili Vanili, and Jean Simmons (of KISS) love child from a wacked out orgy.One of my favorite scenes is when Johnny Goodboy's girlfriend decides to leave camp to help ol johnny and then she is captured and nearly put's johnny's life in danger just because Travolta finds a picture of her that Johnny drew while he was imprisoned.  As far as I could tell, the picture was done so poorly, I mean elementary school poorly,  that if I found the picture, it would look like everyone else who was in that prison.  Male or female.  And if I hear the word leverage one more time, I'm going to die.  Why was Travolta's obsession with leverage.  What he needs is a nice Psycholos woman to help him get over his urges of leverage.Let's not forget about Fred Flintstone flying around in a Harrier Jet with Barney Rubble as his wing man.  And what's the deal with the dome?  First of all we destroy the dome but has someone forgotten the fact that our brave men and women are still in the dome fighting when it comes crashing down.  And Travolta must have been the only excellent shot in the entire military because they couldn't aim straight to save their lives.  The only good part in the movie is the end and the scene where Forest Whitaker finally gets `leverage' over Travolta. I wonder who put the leverage on both of them to do such a stupid movie.  And John, Mr. Tarantino isn't always going to be around to do another Pulp Fiction for you so I suggest you get some leverage on your agent or get medieval on his behind and get you a better script, otherwise I see a Welcome Back Kotter reunion show in the makings.The rest of the movie is nothing but Travolta talking about `leverage', laughing hysterically at every stupid joke that you saw coming a mile away and then him giving Johnny Goodboy all the information he needs to win the war.  `Say Johnny, would you like to learn nuclear physics? Let's take a trip to the library.  Wanna learn how to fly our highly technological jets?  What was up with that?  Now I have to admit to using manipulation a time or too, but the last thing I would do is show the person I'm manipulating what I'm doing or how to stop me. And Johnny Goodboy(almost as bad as Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers) had some chances to kill Travolta during the movie but didn't take them.  Alexander the Great he is not.  And he definitely isn't William Wallace.  Those Braveheart speeches did nothing but annoy the living daylights out of me.  `Now we will all eat together.'  If you saw what they were eating, you'd just assume eat the rat Travolta kept offering you.  Either that or form a new version of Slim Fast.And one more thing, Travolta must have been the baddest man in the Psycholos' military because if they took our planet in less than twenty minutes, why were the Psycholos such bad shots at the end of the movie when the final battle finally occurred. Maybe Travolta took over the planet himself and then brought down everyone else.  And speaking of final battle, where was the Psycholos' military during that battle.  If memory serves me correctly, I only saw about four to five guards fighting at a time.  I thought this was battlefield earth? Where was the battle? Return of the Jedi.  That was a battle.  Battlefield Earth should have been aptly titled Pillowfight Earth.Anyway, before spending any of your hard earned money on this total flop, I would recommend renting something like Police Academy: Mission to Moscow or The Giant Spider Invasion, or Troll 2.  And if they aren't available, then I recommend doing something more useful with your time, such as watching moss grow or watching the birth of a newborn child by cesarean or maybe skinny dipping in zero degree weather.  Because you will regret having spent American money on this film. As I said in the summary, few of you gave the film thumbs up, MOST of you gave it thumbs down, I on the other hand emphatically extend it the FINGER!!!!",

The hero is part of a tribe of primitive people who are scared of the \"demons from the sky.\" One day our hero decides to go out and find whats going on. A 'Psychlo' alien randomly shows up to capture these the hero and two humans. Alien baddie also gets shot in the back and runs through four or five plate glass windows without getting so much as a scratch. The three men get flown away on some weird flying machine along with some other random humans. When they reach the Psychlos' main city they start to choke from the strange alien smoky atmosphere inside the dome until one of the Psychlos helpfully gives them something that allows them to breathe on their own. Just to show how intensely inquisitive our hero is, he puts on his breathing apparatus strip, breathes normally; then takes it off and starts choking again. This was to convince himself that it actually is the alien made breathing strip doing the magic. Our hero promptly bumps into a Psychlo, steals his gun, and shoots him. Terl, is dubious about the claim of his subordinate alien that this \"man-animal\" stole a Psychlo's gun and shot him with it, so he demands a demonstration. Our hero manages to do the same. Travolta's 'Terl' is stuck on Earth mining gold because apparently he did something bad with a senator's daughter back home, and now he's being punished. So he hatches a plan with one of his alien subordinates to train some man-animals to mine gold in a place where Psychlos can't go and reap the profit for themselves. That way he can bribe his way off this planet. *Special stars- John Travolta as the lead alien, Terl. Forest Whitaker plays Kerl's assistant. *Theme- Humans are too clever and persistent to keep in slavery. *Based on- Any 'sword and sandal' genre movie. *Trivia/location/goofs- Universally ALWAYS listed on the 'Worst Film' list. John Travolta dressed up in platform boots and a really bad hairdo. Just to show how intensely inquisitive (also stupid) our hero is, he puts on his breathing strip, apparatus breathes normally. Then he takes it off and starts choking again, just to convince himself that it actually is the breathing strip doing the magic. *Emotion- Probably the worst thing about this movie is that it made me actually want to try to read the L. Ron Hubbard book that this film was supposedly based on, just to see if the book was THAT bad or if the filmmakers are even crazier than old L. Ron. I suspect a little of both, frankly.",

Travolta, looking like a Klingon reject from one of the Star Trek movies, is completely wrong for the part of Terl. Instead of coming across as nasty and dangerous, he's whiny and petulant. Plus, he doesn't have the kind of deep, resounding bass voice necessary to command immediate respect. The special effects are far from special, relying on obvious matte paintings and unconvincing CGI to depict a futuristic Earth where all the cities have been blasted.

The story doesn't seem to dictate any principles beliefs or messages. The question of the film's relevance to the religion raises another question, Is Battlefield Earth intended for scientologists only or a mass audience? It is almost sad to imagine John Travolta thinking that this could do well. Seeing as his career took a nosedive after Pulp Fiction, you would think he'd try and do something a little more intelligent than produce and star in this. Dressing up as a what looks like a braided werewolf is no way to earn back respect. I know some have said that if taken as a comedy, Battlefield Earth is watchable. I do agree that there are unintentionally funny moments. Whether it makes you laugh or not, I don't imagine how anyone can see goodness in this.As the title suggests (way too obviously) the year is 3000 and the setting is Earth. Humanity is now an endangered species and most of us have become enslaved by the Psychlos, an alien race which now dominates the planet. The story follows a young tribal hunter who leaves his tribe to seek a better future, but ends up leading the remaining fragment of humanity in a war against the Psychlos to take back the planet.Here is another typical adventure premise which is executed with an eye towards sheer absurdity. The biggest problem is John Travolta. He gets ten fold more screen time than he needs, and most of his scenes have little or nothing to do with the story.The visuals are poor, but again, they are not the worst I've seen. Many of the sets look like they just came out of the box, but director Roger Christian is smart enough to light his interiors in colors which hide the plastic look. A lot of his other tricks however do not work so well. He over uses abstract camera angles (many of which are diagonal) and the way in which he uses slow-mo is an insult to photography.By now, I would imagine the only people who would want to see Battlefield Earth are those curious about its world famous reputation as a wreck. I cannot think of any good suggestion on how to approach Battlefield Earth, but treating it as a comedy is probably not enough.

            "content": "L. Ron Hubbard's 1950's-style science fiction promo for Scientology has been made into an equally bad film. The plot is antiquated and harkens back to the late 40's when Hubbard, shipped out of the Navy after a dismal service record, joined the action sci-fi genre pioneered by Doc Smith, Van Vogt and others, to create mega-hero stories about men who did everything right while they battled transparently awful villains. In his book Hubbard pitted the remains of humankind, led by an arch-hero modeled after the old space opera heroes of the 40's and 50's who can do no wrong and who always wins, against the evil Psychlos, so named because, as Hubbard states at the end of the book, they were basically a good people until someone invented psychology which taught them that they were animals and thereby divested them of any spiritual or ethical basis to their society. Whereupon they spread through the galaxy, destroying populations and raping worlds. Hubbard in his paranoia always felt that the major impediment to society accepting Scientology, which is essentially a form of psychoanalysis whose invention he spearheaded, was the active antagonism of organized psychology and psychiatry, both of which were out to get him and to stop Scientology because \"they knew it really worked.\"  Each of Hubbard's childishly-written scifi epics since the 50's has implicitly battled against Psychology, hence the name \"Psychlos\". Look no further for the support of Scientologists for the film or for Travolta's compulsive and self-destructive desire to see the movie made at any cost - it was imperative that society \"wake up\" to the menace of psychology and to their reality that Scientology provided the only truly workable psychoanalysis in existence, and that it should be embraced by everyone as Scientologists attempt to \"clear the Planet.\"But Hubbard was such a poor (yet prolific) writer that it is only the massive financial power of organized Scientology, which charges a small fortune for its \"religious\" services (i.e. psychoanalysis renamed \"pastoral counseling\"), that has moved along his books to best-seller status. That, and clever advance sales and coordinated drop shipping of titles to make that one-week punch on the NY Times bestseller list.  But that's not enough to rescue a scifi movie that is patently awful and may well spell the end of Travolta's ever being taken seriously again by Hollywood or by anyone seriously interested in the cinema industry.",

Hence, I went to see it with low expectations.I was unprepared.  It was a bit like being told by a doctor that \"this might hurt a bit\" and then being decapitated.  Nothing can prepare you for such an awful experience.  Beyond a certain point, nothing made you want to look at the screen any longer.The most staggering thing about this movie is this:  It.  Cost. $73. Million.  Dollars.  To.  Make.  Surely they mean 73 million Lira or Yen, no? This is shocking only because the film looked so impressively low-budget. It used goofy lighting effects that made everything impossible to resolve. Was this to be mysterious?  Give the illusion that there were scary \"things\" just beyond your sight?  Doubtful.  Likely, in the grand tradition of Ed Wood, the darkness hid the fact that the sets were either missing or unconvincing.And for good measure, the cameras are rotate about 30 degrees from the horizontal at random points in the film (the angle carefully calculated to guarantee you get a headache).  Why?  Just to complete a truly ruinous experience.",

Besides the fact that the action is lame and the story is not interesting, there is one element that makes this movie worse than it should be.  Without this one element, \"Battlefield: Earth\" would be just a normal, lame B sci-fi movie.  That element is John Travolta's over the top bad acting.  There is clearly an 800 pound gorilla that made this train wreck happen, and that ape is named Travolta.Normally I don't like to single out a person for a bad movie.  I prefer to blame the movie and move on.  But I can't imagine any sane director would let him overact this horrendously unless there was a gun to his head. Travolta is terrible in this movie. He laughs like an insane asylum inmate and keep spouting out phrases about \"Leverage!\"  \"Must have leverage!\"  He is the reason the movie is in the wasteland it sits.

It certainly looks expensive, and some of the futuristic designs are impressive, even if the special effects are shoddy and the camera angles weird. But... oh the rest. Where did it go wrong? Asides from the visuals, nothing else works. The script is incredibly banal for starters with so many cheesy moments, while the direction is lethargic. The story did have an intriguing concept at first, but with so much emphasis on the indoctrination, enslavement and superior alien intelligence Battlefield Earth falls dangerously close to becoming subliminal propaganda, plus there are so many holes, some are so big you can drive a truck through them. The pace plods too, while the acting is terrible. I have never seen John Travolta this bad before, but he isn't the only bad actor here, nobody is good. Overall, just painful to watch.

I mean, some of the makers of Batman and Robin were Christians, but I don't remember anyone denouncing Jesus for that. What's more, Scientology isn't even mentioned once during the film. Unless I'm mistaken, and the movement details seven-foot alien conquerors with dreadlocks. Source novel author L.Ron Hubbard was also the founder of the Church of Scientology. In fact, rather than being crammed full of religious recruitment, the movie's major problem is that it has nothing to say, being little or no more than a generic \"mankind enslaved by aliens\" picture. So, the film itself. Obviously flawed, quite dirgelike, yet also nowhere near as bad as its reputation. I guess people just love a good bandwagon. Psychlos is probably the dumbest name for an alien race ever, and there's much riffing on familiar SF territory. Maybe this was all new when the novel was written in 1982, but for a 21st century motion picture it's like watching inferior carbon copies of your favourite genres movies rolled into one. The setting is a decimated future Earth full of dubious comic setpieces, melodrama and naive speech making. You half expect Kevin Costner to walk on at any moment. Direction is adequate, but a little too gimmicky, while acting is pretty wooden all round. Only one to really break out of this rut (though not in a good way) is John Travolta, who plays John Travolta in alien make-up. His slightly smug, over the top portrayal does begin to tire quickly, while with their Rocket Man boots and noseclips, the Psychlos also look ridiculous. As it is, you're never convinced this is a real alien race, and you never care about any of the faceless humans either. The dialogue is also quite corny, with the odd \"puny humans\"-style ramblings, and the film is curiously po-faced and without real charm or involvement. Combine this with a distinct lack of narrative tension and you've got a movie that fails to really engage on any level. The climax sees a vaguely gung-ho rendition of human military technology vs. alien weaponry. The CGI used looks like it'll date very, very quickly and the whole thing is oddly soulless. And, if you pay close attention, there's also a signposted sequel opportunity. Yet despite the huge number of weaknesses I've mentioned, this is far from being the worst film ever made, probably not even John Travolta's worst film. Yes, I've seen much, much better, but I've also seen a Hell of a lot worse. 4/10.",

Everything about the book is massacred, from the characters, to the plot, the time line, the machines and world, everything. Compressing over 1000 complex pages into a ridiculous 2 hour movie length is near impossible. It might have worked as 5 or 10 one hour episodes with better writers, actors, special effects, producers, directors, etc. The movies faults are only truly revealed by reading the book.Some Major Faults -In the book the psychlos are not only 9 ft tall but immensely huge and strong - every time Terl touches Johnny he has to be careful not to kill or injure him. They are also smart, the main reason Johnny outwits Terl is that most of the time he only thinks of him as no more than an animal, and he's extremely careless and lazy. As for things like guns and aircraft - in the book everything that has survived has been sealed in inert atmospheres and special greases etc. deliberately designed to keep them in storage for decades or more. Remember that Battlefield was written in the 1970's and in the book the earth gets conquered around 2030 or something.As for the 'cavemen' flying - first it takes them years to learn, they have other stolen 'psychic' teaching machines ('Johnny could feel it reaching inside his head'), and some of the other tribes are nowhere near as primitive as Johnny's. As for Johnny himself he's supposed to be pretty smart - sometimes practically a genius.

So fast forward 15 years later and I catch this gem on DVD at a garage sale for $0.15 and I have to buy it. Why? Mostly because buying it second hand this way ensures none of my money goes to Scientology, but mainly because I was dared once before to watch this movie a few years ago and couldn't find a legit copy anywhere. So now I figured I would take that $5 challenge to sit through the whole movie start to end without interruption. Needless to say I lost $5.15 that day. This film is abysmal and is the reason why there needs to be a 0 rating on IMDb. There is not a single redeeming feature to the entire production: the credits are crap, the music is terrible, the acting is bad, the dialogue is forced and uninteresting, the special effects are not that special (this movie came out 7 years AFTER Jurassic Park and the effects in that are 1000 times better), the costumes are just ridiculous Mad Max rip offs, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever.

There are a lot of mysteries in the movie that are totally unexplainable,for instance:Why are the aliens on planet earth when they hate it so much?not because of the gold! Why are the aliens talking in this mystery language at one moment and another moment talking English to each other,so on and so forth.The climax is very anti and the closing shot is a direct rip off from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".As the whole movie is copied from classic sci-fi movies like \"Star Wars\",\"Blade Runner\" and especially \"Planet of the Apes\".John Travolta and his alien gang are in their way of thinking just like the apes in the Charlton Heston classic.All in all,a shameless effort to revive science fiction.It just doesn't make sense for one moment.  2/10",

The story is not logic and filled with quite some plot holes, implausibilities and has written Scientology all over it. Some of the scene's are supposed to be artistic and use unusual camera-positions and editing. I have a feeling that director Roger Christian really at times thought that he was making movie history with creating a new \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". All of those artistic moments are however pathetically constructed and look only laughable in the movie.The story is messy and just plain weird. 1000 years ago an alien race named Psychlos conquered the Earth, mainly for our gold. Why they want gold? I don't think its ever explained in the movie. It's amazing to see that in all those 1000 years the deserted cities had barely changed. I mean, nothing in the cities has been overgrown by plants and trees and even lamppost and yes even wooden signs are still perfectly standing like nothing ever happened to them in all those 1000 years. There also is good news for the zoo's, in 1000 years from now all of your iron gates and cages are still standing perfectly and won't even have any rust on it, so you don't have to worry about replacing any in the near future. And yes, old plains can still fly and yes, humans will be able to learn to fly and maneuver them in just a matter of a few hours/days. I am still trying to figure out what it was that killed this movie; The story or the storytelling. Most likely it's a deadly combination of the both.Still the movie deserves some credit. The special effects are quite good looking and so are the sets. And of course John Travolta is not a bad actor, no matter how odd he looks in the movie. I would hardly call it the worst movie ever made.The movie has weird character nobody cares about and some awful dialog. It's obvious that Roger Christian just finished working as a second unit director on \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\", since he uses some typical Star Wars scene transitions in this movie. Looks like Lucas inspired the wrong person...By no means the worst movie ever made, the technical aspects are simply too good for that but the story, storytelling, characters and dialog don't exactly make this a must see either.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

They are a repository of knowledge, training films for good film-makers that show how not to do it, how to cock up a great story and how stupid errors can sink the best of efforts. We all love watching inept farce unfold, but frankly there's some deeper evil in Battlefield Earth that surpasses it's poor direction and acting and becomes a grating background noise while you watch. I think it's the movies built-in dumbness.First off it's based on part of a rambling, dumb book. Not a good start, but many films have been made that can surpass the original source material and entertain us anyway. Not Battlefield Earth however, which just beats the viewer over the head again and again with it's dumb premise and plot twists so obvious they can be seen from space. The entire movie rests on the fact that these half-assed Klingons believe humans to be so retarded as to be useless, unable to even speak or master simple tasks. The whole plot rests on this one fact, yet the aliens are living in conquered human cities, have read our libraries, fought our nuclear powered, nuclear armed armies and space vehicles, yet seem to ignore this fact completely to make the film work. What?These aliens are so thick they actually do come over as the Klingons dumber cousins, with make up that seems to consist of big foreheads, huge platform boots and hands that are clearly those joke-shop rubber monster gloves. 12-year old kids could outwit these guys, yet we are to believe they have conquered masses of planets and have transporter technology that can send them clear across the galaxy in moments. If brains were dynamite they wouldn't have enough to blow their hats off, let alone conquer space and time, yet the film asks us to believe otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The final nail in the dumb coffin is that the ending rests on the fact that the atmosphere on the aliens home planet is highly explosive in the presence of anything more than minimal radiation, which makes us wonder how the hell these dummies ever evolved to their current claimed level of science.OK, outside of the plot written by pre-school kids how is the film to watch?In a word, crap. The direction sucks any pace out of the action scenes and frantic cuts during slo-mo fights just leave the viewer wondering what the hell is happening, or who is shooting at who? The effects aren't too bad, but remind me of TV sci-fi due to overuse of CGI when physical effects would have been better. Production design is very blah too, with guns that make little sense and vehicles that are a mish-mash of thousands of designs that have gone before. It's like someone realized early on that this one was going to suck, and decided they weren't even going to try and be original.That's it for me folks, it's a dumb movie that's not that easy to watch and drives me up the wall whenever I think about it. The only entertainment value is watching Travolta, Whittaker (run Forrest, run!) and a cast of nobodies hamming it up to the max. With a better plot, acting, scriptwriting and effects this might have been better, but that kinda goes without saying. 2 out of 10 for this willfully stupid movie.",

It really is quite bad, although John Travolta was okay in his role.Generally I can accept films that have flawed plots, because-lets face it- if you look hard enough you'll spot a plot-hole in every film. And generally with most science-fictions, actions and comedies, I have some degree of a 'suspension of disbelief'. I liked 'Con-Air', 'Face/Off' and 'Hollow Man'!!! 'Battlefield Earth', however, was totally unbelievable and completely insults your intelligence. Was it a satire? If it was, I couldn't pick it, but the film is definetly a joke. The Psychlos as villains were okay but they needed more depth and history surrounding their species. The plot was so laughable and corny as to how the humans fight the Psychlos. John Travolta relished in his role, and he certainly added appeal to his character, but his character was so over-the-top that you could swear it was satirical because I ended up laughing at the way he was laughing.(possible spoiler)I've never read the book, and I don't want to now!! The Pyschlos were completely stupid aliens and yes I did manage to understand the overall theme of the film about greed and so forth. And the irony of Psychlos losing to the humans due to their greed, when humans lost to them because of the same reasons...yaddayadda! Regardless, 'Battlefield Earth' desperately needed a believable plot and character depth, and a slower pace. Roger Christian direction is flawed,  his previous film 'Masterminds' is just as bad and as for L.Ron Hubbard's connection to Scientology- who cares. I've never read his book and the blame for this film should rest on the director.As for one reviewer stating 'Battlefield Earth' having mixed reviews! Are you blind? Everyone hates it...as for me I don't 'hate' it, I didn't like it, it became quite amusing, but unfortunately a movie I watched recently ('Brokedown Palace' which I loathed) before 'Battlefield Earth' was worse.

The remnants of humankind that are not enslaved and labour in the mines live in caves or isolated in the mountains.  One man-animal -Johnny Goodboy Tyler - is determined to liberate his species or die trying.It's not often that I see a movie with no redeeming features - \"Eye of the Beholder\" and \"Love Stinks\" spring to mind.  But this movie eclipses anything I have seen in decades.  It is a pathetic conglomerate that steals from almost every early science fiction movie, novel and TV show that had a modicum of success. Let's start by looking at the special effects.The matte paintings are among the worst ever to appear on a movie screen - they are even worse than the ones you find in those low budget sci-fi flicks from the seventies (\"Spacehunter- Adventures in the Forbidden Zone\" comes to mind).  Or how about the Psychlos' themselves - their prosthetic hands are laughable; puffy and ill fitting it looks like they blew up kitchen gloves and painted them brown.  And they definitely could have done with some training as to how to walk on stilts - the actors were so unsteady and walked so slowly that I kept expecting them to topple over. Also, whenever the Psychlos talked I felt like I was at a fundamentalist revival looking for satanic messages on old Led Zepplin albums - they couldn't come up with something better than playing the soundtrack backwards?  Finally, did I mention the horrible cinematography?  The film keeps switching to different angles, and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be artistic or make the Psychlos look larger.  Whichever the case, it fails miserably.  What exactly did they spend $80 million on? Okay, my head is starting to hurt so let's look at the plot.I am capable of suspending belief, but I have my limits: we are expected to believe that rejects from \"Quest For Fire\" who carry around spears, and communicate by grunting can learn to fly Harriers in less than seven days by playing around in a simulator.  This doesn't take into account the fact that said Harriers have been abandoned for several centuries and apparently work perfectly (these obviously are not the selfsame Harriers that were grounded because they got a few grains of sand in their engines during Desert Storm). Or what about a race that has scoured the universe looking for gold and somehow misses a couple hundred tons of gold just sitting around in Fort Knox? The final insult was the actingTravolta is an interplanetary Dick Dastardly - I kept waiting for him to twirl his moustache in glee while he laughed.  It is without a doubt his worst performance- ever.  What is even more frightening is that this would never have gotten off the ground if it wasn't for him (thankfully it will be a long time before any studio gets suckered into bankrolling another one of his Scientology homage turkeys). The only bright spot in this whole mess is Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler who tries to do the best he can with the material at hand - he's the only one who took his role seriously, what a shame that this had to be his first Marquee movie. Hopefully this mess will disappear from the theatres before too many people have a chance to waste their money.Don't even go on a dare!!!!",

This film was bad, but not in a \"campy\" sort of way, as ID4. This film wants you to take it seriously, yet it's stupid at times. So stupid that many of it's scenes could've made a \"Naked Gun\" episode. Example: when Jonny crashes thru windows in its first encounter with Psyclos. He must have broken 6 windows in succesion. What's with that? Also, when he runs thru a water stream and he falls as in a bad WB cartoon. All in slow motion.Also, what's up with the slow motion? They could've shorten the film to 1.5 hours (no, this is not exaggeration on my part) had they not used this trick. But then after watching the sub-par special effects, I know why they did it. Because the F/X were so bad, they simply *had* to use slow motion. They looked as if they were made by students on art class. Just look at the scene when a huge tower falls down to the floor. A \"B\" movie would have done it much better.The plot holes are so big I wonder how this movie didn't fall in one of them. But they have been covered to death (fully loaded Harriers, weapons intact, etc.), so let's not go over them.Travolta gives the worst performance of his life. He overacts every line, for example, when the representative of the Senator arrives on earth, and he fakes a laugh, he fakes it so badly you can only stare in disbelief. Terrible. Other faults: scene transitions out of Star Wars; the Cantina Scene: out of Star Wars. The destruction of the Psyclos ship: out of ID4. Overall feel: Planet of the Apes. But it's not all bad. I had to re-rate this one as a \"2\", because I just saw something worse than this. Blair Witch 2.Want a \"worst of the decade\" trilogy? Easy. The Phantom Menace, Battlefield Earth, Blair Witch 2.

Hubbard thing, the founder of Scientology, Travolta's religion.  And it's no surprise that Travolta has his wife, Kelly Preston, also appear in the film.  And that Travolta help produced this film as well. BATTLEFIELD EARTH takes place in the year 3,000; where Earth is nothing more than a ruin.  The humans are endangered spieces, and Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) is searching for food for his tribe of fellow humans.  Johnny comes across some other humans including Ker (Kim Coates), who shows Johnny the ancient ruins of a big city, and the \"frozen\" humans who were actually mannaquins and statues.  Then the humans are captured by a race called Psychols.  Psychols are about nine feet tall, have dreadlocks, bad dental hygene, and yellow eyes. Terl (John Travolta) is the head officer of the Psychols on Earth.  Terl and his assitant Ker (Forest Whitakerker) have a plan to enslave the humans and search for some gold and take all of it back to their home planet of Psychlo.  Meanwhile, Terl educates Johnny to know about the Psychlo race and history. This way Johnny could fly and understand what the Psychlos are doing.  It's also to assist the audience on what the hell is going on. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bad sc-fi film in the tradition of DUNE and POSTMAN.  There are spectacular effects and sets, but the acting, story, and pacing of all three are too slow.  At least BATTLEFIELD is under two hours.  I don't know why the camera had to do a \"dutch\" angle, (or in English terms, tilt) whenever we see a Psychlo.  Does the titlting of the camera make the Psychlo look taller?  Not to me, it just made me sicker.  And the acting by Travolta is as big as a Christmas ham.  While Barry Pepper shows little acting talent compared to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and GREEN MILE.      This is a bad movie, it tries, but it doesn't succeed.  I guess the only thing that Hollywood film director Roger Christian should have done is leave BATTLEFIELD EARTH to the imagination of the reader, instead of making this a two hour film promoting Scientology.  I was waiting for one of the Psychlos to be reading a copy of DIANETICS.  That would have make perfect sense for this trash. *1/2 (out of five)",

            "content": "Yes, folks, I recommend this movie wholeheartedly! Why? Well, it seems to me that a lot of effort and money have gone into making this movie, even down to the filming of a \"making of\" documentary, leading you to believe that nobody actually realized how bad this film was until it actually bombed. The thing is, the movies' flaws are so blatantly obvious that you can't help wondering why nobody actually spotted them during production - perhaps people were too afraid to mention anything to the all-powerful John Travolta (it reminds me of a Disney epic that was supposed to be set in a mountain top castle in Norfolk, until one of the English production crew gingerly pointed out to the Disney executives that Norfolk is as flat as a pancake.) There are just so many holes in the storyline that the \"Goofs\" section just does not do the film justice, and key elements of the story are just so hairy as to be laughable. The baddies look like Klingons in high heels, and have the mentality of the Ferengi and intellect of a Walnut. To make matters worse, Travolta plays his role like some ridiculously camp fop - if this were a Jane Austin story you could understand it, but this is supposed to be the year 3000. How a race of aliens who were hyper-sensitive to radioactivity could conquer the world is as baffling as how they could occupy it for 1000 years and still not know what its inhabitants eat. Even more amazing is that this whole conquest thing is about gold - it seems that the aliens just wanted to rob us blind. You'd have thought that an advanced civilisation like theirs in possession of teleportation equipment would have figured out a way of teleporting the gold out from under us without all this conquest business... This film covers the first half of Hubbard's book - the second half was to be made into a sequel, but poor reviews saw an end to that idea. Shame - As I understand it, the sequel would have been even more preposterous than the first with intergalactic bankers seeking to \"repossess\" Earth in lieu of Psychlo debts... You just have to see this movie, even if only to laugh at how seriously it takes itself...",

            "content": "This film is not meant to be taken seriously as a science fiction film, like Star Wars or Star Trek, it is sort of like on line like the movies: 'Evolution', or 'Space Balls'. When contrasted to those type of films - it does seem like a science-fiction comedy and does not look as bad as the critics say. I think most critics are reading to seriously into this movie and failing it.The whole movie was like a farce. Each enemy group (alien vs. human) is playing each other out. The way the aliens were defeated is hilarious. The plots of greed from the alien race is also funny. It made them look more human than alien - rather than some cold calculating alien concept like Darth Vadar that has no lower motivations. This movie is funny - it is a comedy, that is why people are missing the boat - they are viewing it like a serious film like Star Wars or Star Trek, Aliens, Prediator, Total Recall, Terminator, Bladerunner etc..., and of course, it fails when compared to serious sci-fi films. People here did that to the movie the 'Village', because they thought it would be a thriller suspense - when it was more of a romantic movie and should have been evaluated differently.I recommend this movie if you are into science-fiction comedy - if you liked 'Spaceballs', 'Evolution' or 'Ghostbusters', watch this film too, it is good as a comedy. The whole film is a big joke.On a more serious analysis of the movie reveals the following themes: The invasion of the Europeans, of the Native-Americas since 1492 is what this movie is reminiscent of and seems to portray artistically. The civilisations that once dominated America were destroyed as European settlers mined for gold and made the Natives slaves. The film sort of portrays this to alien vs. man in a science-fiction format. However, real-life does not show a subjugated people gaining victory in such a flukey simplistic way as the movie portrays. The movie would be more convincing, if the aliens fought among themselves, and relised the 'man animals' were in many ways like them and started movements to incorporate them into their society and take away the slave status. Then it would be a pure political satire. Anyway, just my thoughts....",

It's a stupefying mish-mash or post-apocalyptic drivel with an incomprehensible set of heroes and some of the worst movie logic ever.  To say I felt insulted by this movie does not even come close, and my expectations were low going in. I watched \"Battlefield Earth\" because I heard through the grapevine that if I didn't see it I would have no idea what people meant when they said about a movie down the line, \"that was as bad as Battlefield Earth.\" So, now I will know what they mean. Was that sacred knowledge worth the time I wasted by watching this dreadful movie? Only if it saves me from wasting more time on such drivel down the road. Quite simply, this film has great art direction and the film is exposed properly, but the performances are all well below the talent of the actors involved, the script is thinner than the paper it was written on, the direction is completely off the mark and the film is structured in such a way that it drains the film of any sense of irony or suspense or, well, intelligence. There is the feeling that some of the material was meant to be humorous, but unfortunately the only things funny are the ones unintentional. And they aren't funny enough. On the other hand, this film is a potentially fool-proof cure for insomnia.",

The rest of the movie plays out like an intergallactic Hogans Heroes. The humans are captured numerous times and Travolta constantly lets them go but then recaptures them..Does that sound dumb?cause it is!Travolta then decides to use the humans to mine for gold.Seeing this movie made me drop 100 iq points.

Every science-fiction film imaginable, from Planet of the Apes to Goldfinger is ripped off shamelessly, plus the film contradicts itself on many occasions: the characters have maintained phrases like `piece of cake' to show how even a thousand years later remnants of the language of twentieth-century humans remain, but on the other hand they refer to the parliament buildings as places where our `great tribes' used to meet. Which is it gonna be folks, a last dying gasp of our race or a new beginning? I somehow managed to enjoy it, perhaps because it was honestly bad fun, or because it had great art direction, but it's still a boring mess that can only be a appreciated at a camp-movie night party.

I recommend you watch this film with the idea in your head that it's supposed to be a spoof. It transforms from a failed scifi to a comedy classic!

Second, when watching this movie, I was surprised at how the characters always managed to find hidden power sources, secret stashes of explosives and magic fuel to power fighter jets. The funniest directing mistake had to be when the number of fingers on Terl's hand kept changing. Sometimes he had five, sometimes he had six! Then I was amazed at the complete lack of continuity in the film. Scenes randomly happened, and there was no connection to what just happened three seconds ago. Plus, the whole scene with the gold bars bothered me beyond belief. I felt no emotions for any of the characters and I couldn't believe how long two hours could get. I would have to disagree with one comment made about the movie- I do not believe this will end John Travolta's career.

Well, that's close, but not quite there yet.  Maybe they have a word in Russian, French, or Bosnian that we don't have that can sum up the absolute badness of this film.Okay, now movies like Super Mario Brothers and Baby Geniuses are bad, but Battlefield Earth just seems like no one tried.  The film looks like a third grader shot it.  In an obvious attempt to be stylish, the director chose for every shot in the film to be tilted.  Every last one.  There are no shots anywhere in this film were the camera is parallel with the ground.  Also, the director chose to use wipes similar to the ones they used in Star Wars. You know, when one scene cuts to another and there is this big wipe that transition the two?  Well, that would be fine, but they keep using the same one over and over again.  I swear it looks like something out of PowerPoint.Then there is the plot.  The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese... thirty seconds after you duct tape it to a pipebomb and run.  Okay, let me give you a nice run down.  1,000 years in the future, humans have been enslaved by aliens that came down to drain our planet of its natural resources.  These aliens act very much like us (though they are all butt ugly).  One of them (played by John Travolta) wants to embezzle money from the alien government. So, instead of mining gold from where he is supposed to mine it using alien miners, he is going to mine gold using humans and mine it where he is not supposed to mine it.  Now it is nice to know that aliens consider humans to be dirty, stupid animals, which most of them are.  It is against alien law to use humans for anything.  He takes one of the humans (played by Berry Pepper) and put him next to a \"learning machine\" that teaches the human a bunch of junk like how to fly, talk alien talk, use weapons, and of course mine.  This is the first MAJOR plot hole.  He actually takes this uneducated human and makes him smarter.  Another plot hole has to be that when a human revolt gets started that the humans get a bunch of old Harrier jets and fly them to attack the aliens. If this movie took place a hundred or, hell, even two hundred years from now, I could believe that these jets could still work.  But 1,000 years? Think about how long that is.  1,000 years ago, the dark ages hadn't happened yet.  These film guys want me to believe that 1,000 years from now, every machine on earth is \"frozen\" and will work no matter what.  Right... Oh yeah, and they leave instructions to nuclear weapons just lying around so anybody can find them.  Right... And if a nuke explodes on the alien planet, the entire planet will explode because their air is flammable.  Right...  Ed Wood would be proud.But the most insulting part of the movie is how damn ugly it looks.  In this modern day, when bad movies can masquerade as good ones just do to outstanding visuals (Final Fantasy and The Cell ring a few bells) it is amazing that a movie could look this bad.  The aliens are ugly and tall. Well, to make the alien actors taller than everyone else, they wear really huge platform shoes they try to cover up, only they did a bad job.  Also, the make up job on Forest Whitaker look like time was taken to make them look like aliens.  But the other aliens (the ones you see in the background and ones that have small parts) all look the same and they all look ugly. The film's cinematography is equally bad.  Like I said, every shot is slanted.  But every shot is dark.  Every shot is filled with bland sets and props.  Every shot is filled with bad special effects.   Yeah, you heard me. Bad special effects.  Now, by today's standards, The Day the Earth Stood Still and even Star Wars have bad special effects.  But they were made decades ago.  In this day and age, when movies like Jurassic Park 3 and Pearl Harbor can get made, filmmakers should at least get the effects right. But, oh no, not for this film.In conclusion, Battlefield Earth does everything wrong.  It is horribly written, horribly acted, and horribly shot.  It isn't even funny-bad.  I laugh my ass off every time I see Power Rangers: the Movie or even Super Mario Brothers, but this movie lacks so much intelligence that it actually can hurt your mind.  Consider Battlefield Earth not to be a movie, but a black hole that sucks your brain dry of any and all intelligence.  It actually made me feel bad.  The movie is so dark and bad that is made me feel bad about myself.  There should be a law against people who have suicidal tendencies from seeing this movie because if they do, this just may be the last step over the edge for them.  It is truly sickening how bad this is.  How did they not notice?  HOW!?If I ever become a film school professor, I will show this movie to my class to teach them what NOT to do.Rating: Take the number of stars in the sky, the speed light travels as it is pulled into an event horizon, pie, and the number of times Ted Kennedy has been picked up for driving under the influence, MULTIPLY them together, then you only have about .0000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000001 percent of how God awful this movie is.",

So, I very foolishly thought, at very least it warrants a try. After all, one man's bread is another man's butter, and all that nonsense. About half through the movie, I noticed that the two doors attached to my T.V unit appeared to be very slightly off balance. I then took immense delight in the prospect of turning the movie off to repair them.This, suffice to say, was far more enjoyable than the movie could've ever hoped to be.\nBetter luck next time, eh John?",

Honestly, I felt it was pretty flat, with not as much action as I would have liked. The acting was satisfactory, and John Travolta usually creates a character I can enjoy watching. But, for some undefinable reason, his skills didn't come through in this movie. You can tell he put effort into the movie, but I didn't get the same feeling from him as I did with characters like Howard Saint from the Punisher. Overall, I'd say this movie has merit, but it's really weak as far as selling itself. I'd put it on par with something like Wing Commander.",

            "content": "It is hard to know what you can add about a film that everyone hates with a passion. With over 900 reviews on this site, I would say that people love to hate this one.Were the rumours true? Was Travolta strong armed into doing this film for scientology, I would prefer to think so because if he enjoyed the book, well.....Some people say they like sticking a needle into their testicles but I wouldn't call that fun or entertaining.Phenomenon is a film that shares a similar 'if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything' philosophy running through it. The comet/ tumour was meant to be a metaphor for scientology. As we all know that apparently you can only achieve your full potiential when you are giving all your money to this strange church. I think this is basically a PR effort that backfired on the church, as the film was so bad. You know when you write a story like this, the best thing for you is to become a leader of a strange cult. Preferably a suicide cult. Not even the Scientologists with their repeated trips to the cinema could save this one.Watching Battlefield Earth is like doing amyl nitrate. It leaves you dazed, confused, sick and you have colors in your vision. However nitrate is more stimulating and better for the brain. Also the effects only last for a minute or two, unlike this contrived monstrosity. Like nitrate, everybody warns you not to do it but you did it and now your worse off for it. That is Battlefield Earth.There is a really weird subtext in this film that I noticed even through my alcohol soiled haze. I'll explain this by first mentioning a book that should be made into a film, A Piece of Blue Sky, Scientology, Dianetics & L Ron Hubbard exposed by John Atack. This book describes a dangerous group of people who dominate, control and brainwash others. The Psyclos? The group in the book exploit the time money and resources of others, the psyclos exploit Earths natural resources. In B.E. all humans live in caves, in the book they all want their followers living in caves, cause they are taking everyones god-damned money! The book illustrates a group of crazed, venal, megalomaniacs who plot and counterplot against each other. The Psyclos seem to have this behaviour down to a tee. In B.E they are led by a hammy Travolta with big boots and a manical laugh. In the book they are led by a cruel leader who probably wore big boots and was just downright maniacal. B.E shows an alien race that has sci fi technology and lives in a guarded base. In the book the writer tells us that the group lives in a fortified, guarded base with ultra modern surveillance technology that rivals the CIA. I could go on and on...Needless to say did Hubbard do this on purpose?Staring into the eyes of a cardboard cutup of Mr T  I knew there was only one way to atone for watching something like this. Placing my penis on the kitchen bench I grabbed the nearest pot from the eternal dirty dishes and repeatedly bashed myself with it. As I lay on the kitchen floor, gasping, tears coming out of my eyes. I tried to think of fantastic films like 'Good fella's' or 'Barry Lyndon.' As I did this I slowly began to feel that B.E was just a distant and bad memory that I could easily disassociate from.Please don't waste yor time watching this over-long, boring, muddy mess. This film gives sci-fi a bad name and I hate sci-fi. I do like bad movies such as Plan 9, Dracula vrs Frankenstein or even Citizen Kane but this isn't even watchable for its camp value. Maybe this is how they brainwash you in scientology, they make you watch this over and over and over....Read a piece of blue sky because its more entertaining, stranger, terrifying and true.If you ignore all the warnings and watch this well you are going to need alcohol, lots of it and the stronger the better. In fact I recommend toilet duck, cleaning fluid.",

There's a lot of things that don't add up in this movie, like if these primitive humans can't read, how can Pepper read the Declaration of Independence? If the Psycholos know of the humans history, then why would they think the humans are so stupid? Travolta's acting was way too much. Granted a bad guy can be a little over the top, but he went way, way over the top. L.Ron's novel dates back some years, but this movie comes off as a bad mix of Planet of the Apes, Babylon 5, Independence Day, Star Wars, and No Escape.It was said that George Lucas liked this movie.

I knew going in that movie was based on the series by L. Ron Hubbard, liar, con, fraud, bigamist, tax cheat, cult leader, etc, etc, yet I was still willing to suspend my prejudice in the hopes that his fictional writing might somehow be translated successfully from the trailing threads of his fabricated life. I was wrong. I managed to squirm in my seat as I sat through this miserable excuse for a movie only to be granted a brief respite to use the restroom. It was at that point that I'd considered leaving the theater, perhaps even demanding a refund. Still, there was a niggling sliver of doubt that perhaps I just wasn't giving the movie enough of a chance, that maybe it would get better near the end. So upon flushing the toilet, I'd returned to my seat with fresh eyes, and proceeded to writhe even worse that I had before, despite having just used restroom. Needless to say, the movie and I should have switch places halfway through the showing. It should have been consigned to being flushed down the toilet while I made shadow puppets in the projector beam for the audience's amusement.Honestly, I think I would have been more entertaining, and a hell of a lot less insulting to their intelligence. At the very least, they could have given me their pocket change for charity, or perhaps even pity for having suffered through the movie, and it would have been a better use of their money. Only they were in the same predicament I was in - we were all out the cost of several 40 oz. bottles of malt liquor and a swift kick to the genitals, both of which would have been preferable to this scam that we'd fallen victim to (Hubbard's soggy ashes must be gargling in laughing amid the scum of the sea floor). As far as the movie itself goes, the plot was so thin and full of holes that you could have flown a 1000 year old jet through them. The acting was so pathetic and lacking in effort that it was painful to endure, and the dialog? A cruel joke. The special effects, props and costumes all seem cobbled together with bubblegum and bailing wire and should have been piled into a steaming heap, doused with gasoline and burned along with the script and the master reels until nothing remains but ashes.Given the option to see this horrid movie, do yourself a favor, and do something else with your time instead. Even if it's spent looking at a blank wall for and hour and a half contemplating its hues, shades and textures, considering the alternative, it's time well spent.",

This is the worst plot ever and I could actually laugh at the fact that this movie exists and was released theatrically and most people didn't even go watch it and even those who saw it all considered it a waste of time and left the theatre upset and the film recieved several razzie nominations For worst actor and even worst picture of the decade and Guess what they won pretty much almost all of the awards they deserved their razzie wins and perhaps if there were razzie categories for worst cinematography worst costume designs or worst production designs this would likely be a contender to win those awards again this movie is an atrocity and must be aborted from being seen before anyone gets sleepy, irritated or bored.",

            "content": "I have seen a great deal of good filmmaking in my time. I have seen wonderful movies that have been presented to me, and that have been my privilege to view. Battlefield: Earth is not one of these films. In fact, if I had not seen Plan 9 From Outer Space, This Island Earth, or The Horror at Party Beach, this film would easily qualify for the worst film I have ever seen. Hell, it still might. Here's a pretty valid way of summing up Battlefield: Earth's plot: Think of all of the worst episodes of great sci-fi series'. Slump them all together into a loose conglomeration with plot holes larger than John Travolta's ego, and there you have it. The only real difference between the two is that the sci-fi episodes still retained good acting of some measurable nature. Not so with the unwashed inhabitants of Battlefield: Earth. Red Dwarf has finer acting than this lump of garbage, and even Doctor Who found better plots than this has to offer. The villains of this piece are the Psychlos, a nasty bunch of greedy, war-mongering idiots, who claim to have wiped out all of Earth's defenses in 9 minutes. And would you believe it, they're over 10 feet tall and have rasta-like dreadlocks! The height of the Psychlos isn't achieved by anything as crass as computer editing, oh no. Each actor portraying a Psychlo is wearing platform shoes. Each Psychlo also has six fingers, now what an oddity! And where do we turn to create this effect? To the computers? Wrong! John Travolta and his unkempt ilk are wearing prosthetics that look cheap enough to be worn on Halloween. The supposed hero of this piece is Johnny `Goodboy' Tyler (the last two names are NEVER mentioned in the film) played by Barry Pepper (of Saving Private Ryan fame). I would suppose that the point of most of the movie was designed for two reasons: 1) To make you feel sorry for the plight of the humans; 2) To move and inspire you with over-the-top rhetoric and exaggerated `heroic' poses. To put any doubt aside, there is absolutely no inspiration in this film. Travolta, Scientologist at large and the film's producer, portrays Terl, a Psychlo bent on being granted reassignment. When it turns out that he's knocked up the only daughter of a notable senator, it seems that he's going to be stuck on Earth for a very long time. So, instead of taking his punishment or sneaking back to Planet Psychlo, he concocts what is perhaps the worst scheme in the history of villainy. His `master plan' is to educate a `man-animal' on the finer points of mining (and, of course, the Psychlo language, the history of the conquests, the finer points of their weaponry, etc.) through the use of a `learning machine'. The point of this is to exploit the large vein of gold he's just discovered outside the Planetship's notice (they actually refer to Planet Psychlo as the `home office'). With the large amount of wealth he will acquire, he plans to buy his way back home. Of course, it's our hero, Johnny, who is chosen to be the lucky man-animal who gets all the book learning. With this newfound information, he decides to incite a revolt, but more on that later. I have some more gritching to do. Gritch #1: Noted actor Forrest Whittaker makes his appearance in this film as Terl's less-than-intelligent assistant, Ker. The money spent on hiring this usually superb actor was wasted. Ker is about as one-dimensional as they come, and Whittaker's acting talent is thrown aside in favor of mindless stupidity and employing him as a useless, lumbering plot device.Gritch #2: Roger Christian, the film's director , was one of the principle members of the Star Wars Episode I film editing team. This means only one thing: That he is one of two people left in the world who will willingly use screen wipes to change scenes. At least George Lucas has a little creativity. EVERY scene in this movie changes with a vertical center wipe. EVERY SCENE. I could go on and on and on. But I won't waste your time. Back to our noble hero. Johnny, in the tradition of his sci-fi brethren, incites revolt. But wait, he's educated now, and having lived with this education for all of two days, he's figured out a fool proof plan to defeat the hated enemy. By raiding Fort Knox (which is in Kentucky, not Colorado; our Johnny also learned to fly during his two day school session) instead of doing the actual mining, he has time to train his rag tag team of cavemen into a formidable fighting force. Using his `superior' knowledge, Johnny leads his men to the U.S. Armory (which, like Fort Knox, is unlocked) and finds the 1000-year old weapons not only in perfect working order, but polished as well. After seven days of training, Johnny's cavemen are fully proficient in the use of firearms and the operation of Harrier jets, not to mention the single nuclear device that will eventually destroy the Psychlo world. Oh, did I ruin the ending? Good. You won't have to sit through the movie now. Everything from this film is stolen from somewhere else and is delivered in the most unfunny, ham-handed manner possible. The only possible saving grace in this film is the fact that Travolta can be a bit giggle-inducing with his overly devilish performance. However, in even a sub-standard film, his portrayal of a dirty Kilngon-Ferengi love child would be considered the low point. That Terl is the high point of the movie speaks volumes about its greatness in the realm of the Bad Film Graveyard. It will join such films as Ishtar, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, and End of Days upon arrival. Not even the Church of Scientology can save this film.Stick a fork in it, and hope it dies.",

Right out of Stargate.  Johnnie crashing through the glass? Blade Runner.  Johnnie running between exploding pillars in slow motion? The Matrix.  The basic idea of the movie?  Planet of the Apes.  The exploding head collars?  The Running Man.  A group of average guys flying fighter planes to save the day?  ID4. The humans look like they stole their outfits from the \"Waterworld\" set.  OK.  Why this movie is awful.  From the beginning, the titles look cheap and flat.  The music is dull and forgetable.  The Aliens look ridiculous, stumbling around on stilts and waving their puffy rubber hands.  There is so much bad writing and inconsistencies I'll get carpal tunnel syndrome typing it all out.  The aliens believe that humans are incapable of operating simple mining tools. Yet, all over the planet is evidence of a past great human society, which looks more like 50 years old than 1000.  Terl himself mentions that all their technology didn't last 9 minutes against the Psychlo invasion.  Some Psychlos have Klingon style head bumps, others don't.  Why?  Johnnie's girlfriend has perfectly plucked eyebrows and is obviously wearing make-up. Not only can caveman, who have no concept of geometry, physics, technology, or haven't even seen Top Gun are flying around in A HARRIER JUMP JET after a week of playing on a flight simulator, all of which somehow works after ONE THOUSAND YEARS OF NEGLECT. The Marine Corps Harriers are also inexplicably being stored, fully armed, fueled, and pre-flighted, at Ft Hood, an Army Tank base. This aircraft, with it's vectored thrust, is the most difficult aircraft in the world to fly.  They are also flying around without G-suits making hard turns and they don't have radio headsets yet they can communicate with each other in fighter pilot slang.  The Harrier isn't even an Air-to-Air Fighter.  It attacks targets on the ground.  By the way, there isn't a Eject button, they're eject handles.  The camera work is just horrible.  Everything is shot on a bad angle, and they change color filters to change moods (Green, blue, orange, purple). A guy gets his hand shot off and it doesn't seem to bother him too much.  Huh?  Entire pages of dialogue seems to consist of \"leverage\"  \"ratbain\" \"Foolish Humans!  BWAHHAHAH!!!\" John Travolta is overacting while everyone else looks embarrassed to be in this steaming pile.

There are sequences and ideas in this film which make the fairy tales which my mom stopped to tell me at the age of 3 look like history-factbooks.

The acting in this film is at best bland but is often much worse, John Travolta take the prize for worst acting with his Psychlo Terl. This character is probably the dumbest villain in history, complete with an annoying maniacal laugh and frequent use of the word leverage.The only reason to see this film is to see how bad you can make a film despite a big budget and competent cast and crew, and I would advise to see this movie with a few friends and lots of drinks.",

I had seen the commercials, and it actually looked pretty cool, so a big group of us went to a matin\u00e9e showing. Walking out of that theater an unholy silence overtook our group. Having seen it in Tampa, FL, a city right next door to the center of all Scientology, the theater was remarkably dead. Trying to find something redeeming about the movie so not everyone would feel they totally wasted $5 of their hard earned money, the only thing I could muster up was \"the way the glass cracked at the end was kinda cool.\" Other than that there is nothing at all nice I could say about this movie. Think of a movie solely made for the purpose of perhaps finding it's way onto MST3K someday, and you have Battlefield Earth. Think \"plot convenience playhouse\" and you have Battlefield Earth. From the cheap opening that looks like it was stolen from the cutting room floor of \"Star Trek\", complete with cheesy green font. It's the year 3000, mankind has been pretty much swept out of existence by the stupidest group of aliens I have ever seen. (Really they make \"Spaced Invaders\" look like MENSA.) The Klingon Wanabees, complete with KISS boots and Rastafarian dreads, have captured some of the \"man animals\". The \"head of security\" Terl (Hammed up by John Travolta.) Takes the \"leader\" (played shamefully by Berry Pepper, who has done better work.) And sticks him in a \"smart machine\". That of course teaches him everything he'll need to know to later come back and kick alien a**. Among the rest of the things of many embarrassingly bad things in this movie if we are expected to suspend our beliefs to simple caveman have somehow figured out how to smelt mined gold into solid bars, learn to fly Harrier jets that have somehow remained in pristine condition for over 1000 years (they start on a dime too!. Laughable? It gets better! What really got me sitting forward in my theater seat, is wondering where on Earth the electricity came from for the cavemen to train in the flight simulator! Forrest Whittaker (who looks as though someone is holding a gun to his head just off camera.) works as an assistant to Terl. The filler of this plot consists of the 2 trying to one up each other and use leverage. And before I forget! The primitive humans also learn such things as quantum physics and advanced algebra and calculus, simply by a stick drawing equations in the dirt. Now, I'm no rocket scientist, but Math even half as complex as that makes my brain melt and i'm a college grad! The dialog is corny, the costumes are ridiculous, the angle at which just about everything is filmed is nauseating and no matter how much you're capable of suspending belief for the sake of a movie, you'll blow a gasket trying to do so here. Scientologists worldwide should be ashamed of themselves, as i'm sure this will ensure that no one else signs up. You want a campy movie that you can actually enjoy? Try \"The Evil Dead\" series. Avoid this unless you want a brain hemorrhage. But I do suggest viewing this synched with \"Rifftrax\" Mike Nelson & crew give it the whooping it deserves!",

My friend and I winced at Mission to Mars (M2M for you clever trendy folk) so the wincing was increased ten fold during Battlefield Earth. Hey that could be BFE! I've been to BFE, my friend lived in BFE, it took 40 minutes to get there. It was a bad movie. BAD, I didn't \"See myself\" I didn't \"relate\" I couldn't even grasp the campiness or cheese factor (and i love camp and cheese)I mean sure I disagree with critics, and sure I can justify defending a movie that was \"misunderstood\" by the general populace. I just really sat there and thought, \"Why?\". I will say this, I was also a bit angry that it did suck so bad. The concept of enslaved fyootcher humans looking at 1000 year old earth stuff is neat, but this one failed.

Anyone who has seen this movie knows that the word \"fun\" doesn't apply. From literally the credits, everything in this movie goes wrong.  Odd greenish titles come on in the beginning, and we are introduced to a land of post-apocalyptic cavemen - with British accents.  I walked out at the point an American post-feminist cavewoman declares to her Brit comrade, \"I can take care of myself, you Greener!\"  I went next door to check out a movie almost as dreadful, and came back hoping it had improved; John Travolta was laughing as one of his henchman blew a hapless caveman's head off with a pipe-bomb. We are shown the agonies of the beheaded man's friends in slow-motion. Then we are shown their further agonies as they are put in standard prison cells and proceed to shake their cages...in slow motion.   I left again at this point, so I don't know if I qualify to give a rating, but one-half star is my vote.  What I saw of this movie actually made me hostile; and it was only 25 minutes.  I'm actually planning on checking it out when it comes out on video; there are more things going wrong with this film per minute than any other film I have seen, making it an invaluable study for film students.  Alfred Hitchcock once said \"It takes a lot of brains to make a bad movie\".  I wonder what he would have thought of this one?  I am glad to see it in the lower 250, but it deserves to be under the heap, not in it.",

Some scenes like the a la Matrix firefight look cool, but you can't help but accuse the movie of copying other movies.The worst part is the humans chanting \"piece of cake\" like a mantra.  Harry Knowles explained well at the fallacy of using that phrase in a setting such as this movie.

(He was the guy in Grinch make-up in case you missed it.) Now, in the event that you've been hiding under a rock and haven't heard how positively awful B.E. was, I'll try to break down some of the measly details hopefully without damaging you beyond what's available in modern medicine. Many spoilers ahead! Consider this a warning.To be fair, Battlefield Earth begins promising enough. But so did many other notable flops like Madonna's Swept Away. Cut to a blank screen with a scrolling message, a la Star Wars, that gives us a short summary of what we should expect too see. In other words, it's your classic Sci-fi Planet of the Apes we-must-get-them-before-they-get-us story. Or at least this is what I gather the film makers were intending. To me it was just an exploitation film.Suddenly, the audience is transported to a depressing Earth one thousand years in the future where the fledging human race is living primitively once again and border on the edge of extinction. It is here that we meet our protagonist and archetypal good guy, \"Jonnie\" (Barry Pepper). Jonnie's girlfriend (?) Chrissy informs him of his mother's death (a character we are never introduced to and don't care a pile of beans about). Jonnie is sad, and for a few seconds we're somehow expected to grieve also. Chrissy then expresses how she wants to leave the clan and venture into the wilderness alone. Jonnie gives her a bunch of he-man phooey and randomly takes off on horseback. So she's left behind with the rest of their little social group and its apparent leader, The Old Inexplicably British Guy.Before anyone has the chance to ascertain a solid plot structure, our hero meets up with a few stragglers, AKA various B-list actors we have never heard of before. They seem ferocious, but upon closer inspection....um, I really don't know. That sure doesn't stop Jonnie from embracing them within the first minute though! To hell with clueing the audience in on anything, right?*Fast-forward, fast-forward, fast-forward*Ah, now it looks as if Jonnie and our precocious bunch have been captured by the big meanie creatures of the planet Psychlo! Ten points to anyone who can guess what title they go by! The head Psycho and our antagonist, Terl (John \"My career is going to Hell faster than a ten dollar ho\" Travolta) is introduced as a whiny overacted villain. Crapvolta's performance is executed with an immensely campy Drama Queen heir. Joan Crawford would be proud. Be on the lookout for tons of cheese-o-riffic dialogue. The script is straight out of some rejected mutant spider movie of the 50s. It is THAT horrendous. We learn that Terl is teed off because he was supposed to go back home after the \"important work\" on Earth was completed (whatever the heck that is). Yet, somehow he got screwed over. (boo-hoo!) Terl's henchman and sidekick Ker is bland and yucky.Oh look! Here's a clever little bar scene intended as comic relief. Well, thanks to the obnoxious blue lighting I now have a pounding migraine headache to add to my list of woes! More, dare I say, \"crap-lousy\" character exchanges?*Fast-forward, fast-forward, fast-forward*Meanwhile, the humans are locked up as animals in cells, a la Planet of the Apes. Jonnie manages to study the Psychos closely as Terl studies his \"man-animal\" behavior. The pair realizes one another's potential to further their individual causes (i.e. Jonnie to free his people, Terly Baby to make the mean green). Seeing his marginal intelligence, Terl takes Jonnie as a sort of trainee, if you will, hooking his head up to a \"knowledge machine\". Presto! Jonnie instantaneously knows everything from the Psychlo language to mathematics to complicated engineering. He is a changed man who will save the world! Yay! And, we, the viewers, are supposed to sit back in awe with tears running down our cheeks while our brains peruse the \"Knowledge is Power\" message. Doesn't happen. Can I get a refund now?*Fast-forward, fast-forward, fast-forward*Oh my...more things being blown up, more death threats, more gaping plot holes, and a woman with a lizard tongue for the obligatory sexual reference.... You know, I'm just commenting on this movie and I feel queasy! *MAJOR ENDING SPOILER* Here's the ending in a nutshell, folks: Jonnie uses centuries old WMD to blow up the planet Psychlo and lock John Travolta away. (Don't you wish life imitated art sometimes?) The end. Yeah, it's stupid.That being said, please avoid this movie like the plague! It's not even enjoyable in that so-bad-it's-good-way. It is plainly awful...I found myself begging to watch Moulin Rouge and Supernova. That right there is a tell-tale sign something is seriously gone wrong. */**********",

            "content": "No other film genre seems to have perfected the \"So Bad It's Good\" genre quite like science fiction. While other genres in this vein can offer bad dialogue, horrible acting, and bad plots, bad sci-fi films seem to be in a class all their own. What is it about bargain basement special effects like UFOs flying around on strings or actors lumbering around as they pretend to be aliens/monsters with bad makeup jobs in rubber suits that is so incredibly entertaining? While Battlefield Earth is nowhere near THIS cheap-looking, it might as well be.Yes, Travolta is a devout Scientologist. Yes, Scientology mastermind L. Ron Hubbard wrote the novel that would be adapted into this film. Yes, Travolta lobbied for years to get this made and an exorbitant amount of money was spent to do so. Yes, the movie studio backing this atrocity went belly up. Even if the backstory behind this movie weren't so laughable, this film would still be every bit the unintentional comedy that it is.We start off with an overuse of tilted camera angles and screen wipes. If that weren't bad enough, the camera tilts shift back and forth. It's enough to make a person seasick and give those who have a strong stomach a case of whiplash. Almost all the Psychlo scenes seem to have been shot through a blue filter. The lasers fired from the Psychlos' guns would look cheap in a Super Nintendo game and one character meets his death by being tossed into a green screen... I mean, off a cliff, sorry.The special effects and camera work are bad, sure, but the real failure of this movie is the plot. The plot is so bad it almost deserves a review of its own. The prologue sets up a crushing defeat by the human race at the hands of the aforementioned Psychlos. That's not where the badness begins. It's what happens AFTER.We start off with a human race that has apparently forgotten all of their history almost reverting back to a caveman state. Our bland hero, Johnny, is informed that his dad died offscreen and he gives a big NO. Whoop-dee-doo. He decides to go off hunting with some other friends where they attack... obstacles from a miniature golf course. Just when you think you can't take anymore, the Pyschlos capture them and take them off to indentured servitude. Are we really supposed to believe humanity completely forgot its entire past just because their planet was taken over? Sometime later we are introduced to our main antagonist: John Travolta. He deserves special mention because he is easily the best and the worst thing about this movie. His hammy acting elevates this movie from boring obscurity into campy romp. The movie constantly reminds you he is this ruthless, cunning, and highly intelligent security officer yet he acts and speaks like he's doing bad Shakespeare. His scenery-chewing performance will have you in stitches. He even bumps his head on the ceiling in one scene like some sitcom dad. The other Psychlos seem to laugh at and torment him too so how are WE supposed to take him seriously? While his performance and costume are enough to undermine the threat his character poses, the script does him one better by making him the biggest imbecile in the galaxy. He teaches the most rebellious slave how to speak their language, operate their equipment and read and write. He takes the guy to an old library to educate him on the downfall of the civilization that his people had long forgotten. He seems painfully unaware of Fort Knox as a source for gold and doesn't catch on that the humans are bringing in gold from somewhere else when they hand it to him in perfectly shaped bars. Why does he want gold anyway? The only use for it seems to be jewelery. I guess a man dressed as gaudy as he needs some bling. Yet we're supposed to buy that his people conquered us in, I repeat, nine minutes.As the film builds to the inevitable rebellion climax, it becomes a contest of how ridiculous the plot can get. A man detonates a bomb on the Psychlo dome on Earth to asphyxiate the ammonia-breathing aliens (I think they breathe that, who cares...) but neglects to consider that hundreds of pounds of falling metal and broken glass will probably crush to death the humans still inside. All the while, five humans are flying in 1000-year old harrier jets which they mastered in days and are in exceptionally pristine condition... and they win! Another man teleports to planet Psychlo and manages to blow up the ENTIRE planet with a bomb barely larger than a suitcase.I will admit that for all the heat Travolta took over this movie, he's practically the only thing that makes it watchable though Forrest Whitaker has a few moments. Maybe not in the way he intended, but he's so much fun that you'll be fast forwarding through the boring human rebellion scenes just to get back to him. His performance is both funny and sad. You can tell it's clear that he had high hopes for this movie. They even end it on a sequel hook.Maybe in the year 3000, Travolta.",

Seriously, how does he enthral his newly-found followers? He did not develop with his predicament and I felt no kinship with his suffering. Only the number two bad guy seemed to develop with the story. Why do highly-advanced aliens go to the effort of forcing humans to mine gold ore, when paleolithic man can just walk into Fort Knox and help himself? If they could not do it in person, why not send droids? Do they seriously expect us to believe cavemen can learn to fly 1000-year old jump jets in a week, after just one lesson in basic geometry?Good visual appeal, wooden acting and constant inconsistency.

Guess whose their leader? \tBattlefield: Earth is the adaptation of the best-selling science fiction novel of the same name. Written by scientologist guru Ron L Hubbard, Battlefield tells the story of the universe conquering Psychlos who are bent on gathering as much profit for their empire as possible. Unthreatened by a `man-animal' named Johnny, the Psychlos decide to rape the Earth of its last natural resources. Once completed the entire population humans will be eliminated. It's up to Johnny to free his people and lead a revolt. \tI guess the best way to describe this film is comparing it to other sci-fi classics of the past. The world Johnny struggles to free is right out of that great classic cartoon series from the \u009180s called `Thundarr the Barbarian' or  even `Planet of the Apes'. The Psychlos are a mixture of Klingons and Ferengi from Star Trek. The dogfight scenes are classically ripped off of films like `Independence Day' and `Godzilla'. It seems each and every element in this film originated somewhere else. Hubbard may have come up with this concept before these other references but with such a saturated sci-fi market they look like pale imitations.\tAs I watch John Travolta walking around looking like a Jamaican trapped in a KISS video, it makes me wonder was this the project he envisioned when trying so hard to get this sci-fi film off the ground. He produced and had a huge take in this film's success. His character is devilish but so over the top arrogant I wonder if he is supposed to be laughed at throughout the film. I know I laughed pretty hard. \tAs for other star Barry Pepper, he is able to unlock some charisma in his unoriginal `gung-ho' character. At least we feel a little for the guy. What bugged me is that when he sends one of his men to his doom we never see an ounce of emotion. I did however find that with every character in this film. Also some of the language and dialogue was so ridiculous you would often scratch your head in disbelief that it was actually said. For instance, they claim to have wiped out the human race in 9 minutes but they never think to scout the civilization for raw materials. How could aliens this dumb reign so supreme? \tBattlefield: Earth is one of those sci-fi films where you pray the novel is better than the film. If this is a classic story or novel no one ever told me. If this is a must see for you this summer, I recommend waiting for the next sci-fi flick. (1.5of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",

I read somewhere that the bad guys were supposed to be 10 ft tall. They sure didn't look it. They looked like 6 ft actors wearing uncomfortable 1 ft boots. It didn't look real at all. The actors couldn't walk in them in a realistic enough way. The acting way overdone, exaggerated, cartoonish. Almost every line in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes. I can't imagine what they thought they were trying to accomplish. I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a church of scientology propaganda film and that the bad guys were supposed to represent psychologists and psychiatrists.

I find it hard to believe that one can `turn off' one's brain and enjoy this movie.  What brain has settings so low that it won't notice the awful rubber gloves the Pychlos wear?  Or wonder how thousand year old Harriers can be flown by illiterate cave dudes after one week of training.  Or actually care which idiot has `leverage?'  Or not be repulsed by the slavishly unoriginal references to Blade Runner and The Matrix among others?  Or wonder why everything is shot through a meaningless blue filter and then tilted for no reason at all?  Or doesn't realize that smelting gold is a bigger deal than Terl seems to think?  Or why the radiation is only now beginning to effect humans after 1,000 years of exposure (and they look fine)?  Or credit that anyone could be so continuously amazed at the man-animal's capacity for reading, using tools, and so WHEN THEY LIVE IN THE RUINS of the human cities, littered with vehicles (the tires on which have pressure after a thousand years - now THAT is nitpicking), and Terl even knows where the human LIBRARY is at?\nAn astoundingly stupid film given what was at their disposal.  Plan 9 is Plan 9 for a very good reason - Battlefield Earth is idiocy on a scale we don't see very often.  It's amazing that they are in the same league and Plan 9 is more entertaining.

            "content": "Let me state up front that, in my opinion, Battlefield Earth is not repeat NOT a good movie - but neither is it nearly as bad as many think it is. Looking at reviews in the newspaper, magazines and even here on IMDB, someone who had not seen the movie would be forgiven for thinking that BE is the single worst motion picture of all time.  It is NOT. BE suffered from the most blatantly prejudiced pre-release smear campaign I have ever experienced.  Almost as soon as principal photography had begun, people were crowing that it was an absolute all time stinker. Hey, that's really fair.   99% of the vitriol poured on BE, at least prior to the release, was based entirely on the fact that Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote the source novel.  One might argue that having this as the reason for deciding a film sucks makes as much sense as panning a newly-discovered Wagner symphony, because Wagner was a raving anti-Semite.   I challenge anyone to find a single instance of Scientology propaganda in Battlefield Earth - the movie, that is - apart from the name 'Psychlo'.  The fact of the matter, folks, is that it is not a Church recruitment movie, but simply a botched attempt at doing a pulp SF epic.Let's take a look at the movie itself, trying for a moment to forget Hubbard had anything to do with it.  And what do we have? We have a badly paced, poorly acted, *atrociously* plotted mess of a filmthat is, quite frankly, an insult to the novel more than anything.  Say what you like about Hubbard (and many have)...the truth is that almost all of the gaping plotholes in the movie are *not* in the book. What sinks Battlefield Earth?  The casting, for one....Barry Pepper is simply terrible as the hero Jonnie Tyler.  Far too weedy and diminuitive to be credible as a rabble-rousing hero, Pepper wanders through the movie snorting and pouting and rasping out sub-Braveheart 'call to arms' speeches that ring false at every turn.  None of the other humans are any better, mind you. John Tavolta's performance as alien bad guy Terl is about the only thing that makes BE worth seeing.  Gleefully OTT, he is infinitely more likable than Tyler - this was the case in the book as well, I should add.  Nobody likes a sickeningly perfect hero like Tyler...we're all cheering for the rascally villain!  Well, we don't in BE, but that's not Travolta's fault. Forest Whitaker turns in a suprisingly average performance as Terl's sidekick Ker...nuff said. Let's get to the crux of the matter, though....the plot.  BE was written by first timers who apparently had less experience in penning good scripts than the poor people who shot Scientology films under Hubbard's frenzied direction in the late 1970s.  There are plotholes large enough to fly a Pyschlo gas drone through everywhere - I'll list just a few.  1) Our caveman heroes not only find 1000-year old Harrier jumpjets that are still airworthy, they also learn to fly them in SEVEN DAYS using only one flight simulator.  2)  Over this millennia, the Pyschlos, who prize gold above all metals, have strangely not bothered to check Fort Knox...inside of which Jonnie and company find thousands of bars of the yellow stuff.  That was handy.  3)  The method by which the humans destroy the planet Psychlo is so amazingly easy, it makes my brain bleed wondering why no other race has ever tried it before. There are lots of other things that destroy any chance this movie had of being even vaguely good...the baffling decision to shoot 90% of the footage in Dutch angle (slanted shots...think the Batman TV show), the numerous and almost sacriligeous deviations from Hubbard's book (one would think Hubbard's every word was Holy Writ, given that his Church oversaw production at every step) that cause plot problems that didn't need to exist...the enfuriating way that the story, already rushing to get finished in only 2 hours, stops every now and then for utterly pointless padding scenes (the sequence where Terl finds out what humans like to eat is the main offendor there)...the wide variation in FX quality from excellent to bloody terrible...and so on. Oh, BE is bad alright, it's ghastly - but it is not THAT bad.  There are far worse movies out there that got none or very little of the bad press BE received.  Spy Kids, for example, is one of the most peurile, plotless, intelligence-insulting loads of drivel in film history...yet it was a hit! SK makes BE look like Ben Hur. Battlefield Earth is hugely enjoyable as a cult anti-classic, and for that reason alone it is worth seeing.  An object lesson in how NOT to make a science fiction epic.\nThey're making an animated series of it?!!!  WHY?!!!",

Very little of humanity remains. The people left over are thoroughly dominated by evil, business-minded aliens called \"Psychlos\", who colonized Earth long ago. John Travolta plays Terl, a pathologically greedy Psychlo security chief who is hungry for gold. He gets the bright idea to have scrappy human, or \"man-animal\", Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (an underwhelming Barry Pepper) lead an effort to mine for gold. But Jonnie and others lead a revolt instead.\"Battlefield Earth\" is very much an expensive misfire, with all the razzle-dazzle visuals that money can buy, but no story that's really interesting or involving (or believable). Roger Christians' fumbling misdirection should have torpedoed his film directing career, while the writing and the acting tends towards the cheesy. Overall, this is a silly way to spend two hours, although it picks up marginally in its second half with its time-honored theme of mistreated individuals rising up to strike back at their cruel tormentors (and facing a time limit, to boot). The design of the alien villains is largely unimpressive.The cast (including such familiar and reliable performers as Forest Whitaker, Richard Tyson, Kim Coates, and Michael Byrne, et al) has definitely been better utilized in other things, although this viewer can't say that some of them didn't give their roles the old college try. Travolta, also one of the producers here, manages to survive with some dignity intact; if the movie has a bright spot, it's his scenery-devouring, amusing performance. His late wife Kelly Preston has a brief cameo as a devious Psychlo secretatry.The outdoor scenes were filmed in Quebec, Canada, and at least the scenery is nice.

Some day, in the future, once Travolta leaves the Church of Scientology and they do a made for TV movie about his life, there'll be an incredible scene where the actor playing him is dressed up in the horrible Psychlo costume.

Perhaps if you spent the full ticket price, you might walk out a little bit annoyed but if you go in there expecting crap, you can have a really good time watching this film.And if you don't catch it on this go around, no need to bother renting it - it'll be on USA Up All Night in a few years - or some equivalent show.Hysterical.

The special effects appear to be high-budget Star Wars like effects (I know, I'm cursed for even using the title \"Star Wars\" in a review for \"Battlefield Earth\"), but the plot, the acting, everything was just so horribly bad, the movie is basically a joke. When I told a friend that 'Mars Attacks' was the worst movie ever, she said 'No way, check out Battlefield Earth'. I did, and she was right. Travolta, playing as an alien villain brute? Terrible. The rest of the acting, let's not even go there. The plot, there pretty much was none. Psychlo? That was the name of the planet! Who wrote this movie anyway? I'm surprised that Travolta still has a career after this one. In short, this movie can be compared to something a 1st grader would come up with if he wrote, directed, and produced a 100 million dollar budget movie. I'm not entirely sure why this idea ever even got on paper, never mind the big screen. If you want a good laugh, pick this one up instead of a comedy.

It's not a fight between them. The whole film is not like the book, it's different on the bad side. It's not the same ending. On the side of the direction, it's a bad move to choose Roger Christian. He made nothing to be to real contender to direct a great sci-fi epic like that. Bad directing and also bad writing. And the editing is very ordinary. It's a 117 minutes movies with a story of 180 minutes. They cut 30 minutes (original length might be 145 minutes) for who??? The start is to fast and nobody know the story of Johnny and his group. Finally the acting is very below average. Travolta can do better and we all know that. The light is Barry Pepper who is good in is character.

Well, I finally watched this and... Yeah, it's that bad. But lets double check and run through a quick checklist of movie basics.Story? Yup, it has one of these. It doesn't make any sense, is wildly derivative and really preachy feeling, but it has a story. Ugh, watching this, listening to the exposition and the awful, horribly wretched dialogue is just painful. But hey, dialogue can be bad but actors can still elevate it right? Not here! No idea what is going on with Tavolta or Whitaker are doing here, they're both awful and while Travolta has kinda fallen into that role lately, Whitaker is still a pretty respected actor and they're both awful here. Then there's Barry Pepper, doing a great Johnny Depp impression and being absolute nonsense. There's a moment where his character is having this huge revelation and reaches up and chops off a lock of his hair and it's just so awkward and weird, not remotely as powerful as it was likely meant to be.So, story's bad and the acting isn't any better, but it looks good, right? I mean, they spent 73 million dollars on it, it has to look good, right? The Matrix came out a year before and cost less and looked pretty incredible so for more money a year later... Yeah, no. This looks more like the million dollar masterpiece from 2013, Sharknado. Except, somehow it's worse? This looks SO bad. It's downright offensively bad sometimes. It's not even just the CGI, the costumes are weird and pointless, the sets are all dingy and depressing. There's nothing here worth looking at, which is real rough in a movie with a bad story and bad acting. There's no real music to speak of, nothing that sticks out anyhow.Ok... That's all bad, but at least it's not heavy handed and preachy, right? AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yeah, this is constantly pushing nonsense on the viewer. It's no wonder this got slammed as being some Scientology propaganda piece. I have no real knowledge of that religion but wow, if this was meant to recruit for them... Yikes, they need to fire whoever came up with this idea. It's not even clever. Lowborn person rises up, becomes a slave to the higher ups and eventually leads a revolt. Never heard that before.This whole thing is a mess. Weirdly though, I could see myself recommending this to some people. Not because I think they'd like it, but as a testament to how bad things really can be! People say Transformers or Fast and Furious or Marvel movies are the worst and that just proves they need to watch more movies because, believe me, they get much, much worse. On a more serious note, this is not worth watching outside of morbid curiosity, there are low grade, made for TV movies that are better than this. Give me Sharknado over Battlefield Earth any day.",

            "content": "Oh, you already heard?  Damn.But was it really as bad as all that?  Some people have their doubts, and I can see why.  They look at the absurd, Swiss cheese storyline and wonder if other blockbusters aren't equally malformed.  Did \"Godzilla\" make sense, or show any kind of respect towards its audience?  Did \"Vertical Limit\"?  Did \"Independence Day\"?  Very well: let's say they didn't.  (Although if you ask me, anyone who thinks they were no less stupid than \"Battlefield Earth\" is suffering from amnesia).  The fact is, \"Battlefield Earth\" had something none of these other films had: brain-splittingly awful art direction and cinematography.So much of the film is bathed in a kind of dirty greenish-yellow light - perhaps the very kind of light they use in psychological experiments to put people off their food.  Every character looks ugly.  The scenery and sets are ugly.  The costumes are ugly.  Those black tubes hanging out of peoples' noses are ugly.  The tilting camerawork - sometimes the camera even seesaws, as if the director thinks that by leaning too far to the left and then leaning too far to the right he'll make it seem as if he's not leaning at all - this, too, is ugly.  Even such things as may have been meant to look ugly look ugly in the wrong way.  The psychlos, an alien race, look exactly like big, ugly, shaggy, unkempt humans; they wouldn't look distinctive even if the human characters weren't also big, ugly, shaggy and unkempt.  \"This is an ugly planet,\" says one of the psychlos, and he appears to be right, but he goes on to add, \"All those greens and blues...\" except that as he says this, there aren't any greens and blues: everything on screen is some shade of brown.  The psychlo home planet, by way of pseudo-contrast, is purple and shrouded in mist.  When I say \"the planet is shrouded in mist\" I don't mean that parts of it are - I mean that the WHOLE PLANET, as viewed from space, is shrouded in mist.  I mean to imply something as absurd as \"the planet is wearing a nightgown\".Are the special effects any good?  With art direction this bad, who can tell?  All that matters from our point of view is that they're not effective.I haven't even told you why the story is so stupid - I'm talking about a barely coherent kind of stupidity, the kind that slaps you in the face even if you try to ignore it - and why should I bother, when it's so obvious? But here's a sample.  If you asked me to nominate the central stupidity, the one that does the most artistic damage, I'd mention the following one.  The psychlos conquered Earth - Earth at its peak - in, we are told, nine minutes.  (This must be an exaggeration, even in the world of the fiction. Let's say it took a couple of hours.)  Their military might is stupendous beyond belief and their technology is so advanced as to be almost disconnected from our own.  Then, in this movie, a handful of cavemen reconquer Earth, AND destroy the psychlos' home planet, in ... well, to be fair, it takes them a little longer: seven days.  Implausible, huh?  No, it's worse than that.  The film wants everything both ways.  The psychlos have to be the (cue echo chamber effect) ULTIMATE THREAT, yet we must destroy them with (echo chamber again) CONSUMMATE EASE.  The story collapses into one with the following level of subtlety: \"Once upon a time there was a ten-year-old asthmatic and a fire-breathing giant the size of a sequoia. One day the ten-year old fired his slingshot at the giant and hit him on the kneecap.  Luckily, the giant had a self-destruct button there, so he died.\" Yeah, well big deal.",

When I first heard about the movie and then saw the previews I couldn't wait to see the film.  Then it came out and I saw it.  I truly believe now that I was in a state of denial.  I realized that it had it's share of problems, but didn't realize the severity of the situation.  Now I must concede that this film really is a terrible film. Although, the overall, broad story is a good idea, just done VERY badly.I love the idea of an alien race coming to our planet and taking it over. I also love the idea that they are so far advanced that they could take over our planet in minutes and nearly wipe out the entire human race.  Good idea, good sci-fi.I'm not really sure who is to blame here, I'm sure the fault lies in a lot of people.  I would tend to blame the director, Roger Christian, but I haven't seen any of his other directorial efforts, so I have no frame of reference.  The editing is just god-awful in this film.  What moron decided to have that wiping transition every 10 seconds?  Seriously, fire that guy/girl!!!  I also think that the screen-writers are major players in this film being so bad.  The dialogue was just horrible throughout the film. Why did they say \"man animals\" and \"rat-brain\" all the time.  If you are translating the Psychlo's language, you don't need to make up new phrases to help the viewer understand.  And what the hell is with that name \"Psychlo\"???  Good god, that is, hand-down, no contest, the STUPIDEST name I've ever heard for an alien race!!!  ...And of course, I'm sure that L. Ron Hubbard deserves a good part of the blame, although in his defense, I haven't read the book, so perhaps the book is better than the film and actually makes a little more sense.  Well, obviously there is a lot of people to blame for this film being so bad.A number of people have said that the special effects were terrible. Really?  Terrible?  Nah, they weren't bad at all, in fact sometimes they were out-right fantastic!  The ships flying through the air were excellent and the dog fights between the Alien ships and Human Fighter planes were awesome.  Also, there's the huge dome collapsing at the end of the film. Very cool!I didn't think the acting was all that bad in the film.  I thought the characters and the dialogue were terrible, but the acting was fine.  John Travolta did a pretty good job, as did Forest Whitaker as the antagonists in the film.  Although, I have to say that John Travolta's voice just didn't work, it wasn't menacing enough.  Barry Pepper, Kim Coates and Richard Tyson did decent jobs too, given the material.  So, I'm not going to put any of them at fault.  Kelly Preston also has a very tiny role in the film, very useless to the story, but she was somewhat interesting to see on the screen as a Psychlo.Also, I feel I should say something about the make-up effects.  Sometimes they were pretty impressive, and at others they were horrible.  The make-up on John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were both pretty good, a lot of the other Psychlos had some serious problems.  I was really impressed with how well they made the aliens look so much bigger than the humans.  I don't know how they did it, but I thought they did an excellent job in that respect.All in all, I would have a very hard time recommending this film to anyone. The only reason to see this is some cool special effects, make-up effects, and a few other miscellaneous neat things to look at.  Unless you're determined to see this film despite it's unbelievably low rating on this site, then I'd recommend you watch something else.  But, if you must see it, I hope you enjoy it, just be prepared for a pretty bad film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",

Unfortunately, John Travolta was the Scientologist involved this project.The movie is set in the year 3,000. Earth has been ravaged by the Psyhclos, an evil ailen race, that is from the planet Psychlo, itself subject to periodic Psychlones and attended by Pscyhlologists and Psychliatrists. (OK I made the the last three up, but the movie is about that subtle. The Psychlos are psycho! Get it?) The human race has been virtually wiped out. Those left either work mining gold for the Psychlos or hide out in caves. Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Yes, that is his name) wanders out of his cave and into the mall-like structure that it is the Psychlo mining operation. He is enslaved, and after a series of ludicrious, poorly lit scenes, ends up leading a rebellion against the Psychlos and freeing the earth.Johnny's dreary, uninteresting story benefits from being inter spliced with the wild overacting, goofy make-up, and awful special effects in the scenes with Psychlos. John Travolta is a hoot as Frankie Badguy, I mean Terl, the 9-foot head of security for the Psychlo mining operation. He looks kind of like Gene Simmons in his KISS make-up and recently deceased. If Travolta didn't have a track record of appearing in garbage and of being a Scientologist, I'd give him a little props for his awful, funny performance.The special effects in this movie deserve especial derision. The teleport device that the Psychlos use to travel is actually cheesier than the one used in the original Star Trek, made 40 years ago, mind you.The cities are obviously matte paintings (lit poorly to hide the fact), and too often, the movie mismanages the forced perspective scenes involving the 9-foot Psychlos and the humans so that the height difference isn't accurately represented. The camera is either really really close to one of the Psychlos to make him look big, or the actors are obviously walking on stilts.The shot of the Psychlo home planet: You have to see it for yourself. Really not much better than the Mystery Science Theater 3000 planet. I've never seen a worse special effect in a motion picture in major release.Speaking of camera-work, most of the shots in this film are tilted so that the scene resembles a comic book panel. Though interesting at first, this technique begins to induce nausea.The color palette, too--green, purple, black--is ugly and jarring.In the end, Battlefield Earth approaches the so-bad-it's-good threshold but the filmmakers treat the material seriously enough to help it remain on the bad side.

Secondly, the acting's borderline Manos, especially from the actors for Tyler and Terl (Barry, John, you're lucky you survived this). Thirdly, the place women hold in the film is like something out of the most misogynistic '50s films, not a 2000 SF film. Finally, the plotting is preposterously patchy in how inconsistent and erratic it is (how would Tyler be allowed access to a rapid-learning machine, etc.). Mystery Science Theater 3000 could really shred into this one.I tried to approach this film objectively, much like how I approached the book objectively.

I had followed the production of this movie on several movie sites and  when the bad reviews came out the way they did I knew BFE would be a treat. Travolta hitting all the talk shows pumping up this 'EPIC '. Comparisons to Star Wars ? Let me get out my fifty cents . People this was made just for me . Bad acting  ?  No problem. Camera angles ?  No problem . Plot ?  no plot ?  Who cares. These movies do not come every day . Do I want to sit with the rest of the planet and watch all the thumbs up crap ? Why ? I had to listen to everyone trash Starship Troopers the same way .Its not every day you get to see brain sucking spiders. Sit back,turn off your brain and relax . Giant aliens with air tubes hanging out of their noses , and ape people flying fighter jets ?  COOL STUFF .  This movie went perfect with my Raisenettes and buttered Popcorn . I will be saving up my next 50 cents for the sequel or sequels .  Look for me ,  I will be the guy with the big smile in the front row . Rock on people.",

            "content": "Warning: does contain spoilersBattlefield Earth has one thing going for it, and that is the concept. Think about it.  What would happen if somehow a species that was superior to us came here and attacked us and all we were able to do is muster up 9 minutes of resistance against them?  What we would have would probably be something like what we see here in this film.  People would probably be rounded up and used as slaves.  We would do to them what we do to other species that are inferior to us.  There is one very compelling and true scene in Battlefield Earth, and that is when Ker ( Travolta ) has Johnny ( Pepper ) by the throat and he wants to demonstrate how accurate his shot is. He aims at a field of cows and he shoots off their legs, one by one. Johnny is disgusted and says, \"that is the difference between us and you. We only hunted animals for food!\"  and Ker replies, \" that is where you are wrong.  Your kind was the only kind to hunt animals for sport and kill for pleasure.\"  I think if the film would have explored issues like this more deeply, it could have been better.  But instead it has what can only be described as a science fiction action film qualities.  And on that level, the film is abyssmal.  This is way too big of a topic and it has so much possibility that to ignore the issues the way the screenplay did, well, the film deserves the failure that it is destined for.There are so many things wrong with the film, like, why does Ker want the gold in the first place?  Why would a precious metal be worth anything monetary on a planet that is eons away from ours?  Why would the Psyclones not know about Fort Knox and all of it's gold?  Would the Denver library really contain all those books in as pristine condition as Johnny found them?  Would there really be all those explosives in some building in Texas? No, of course not.  Why would the Psyclones have to let humans go just to study what they like to eat?  They know everything about us, don't they? \nThe film goes on to tell us that the Psyclones know everything about us. They studied us and knew everything about us and that is why it took them a matter of nine minutes to eliminate us.  Why then, if they know all there is to know about us, can we discover a bunch of things that they didn't figure on?  There are too many holes in the film and probably the book for it to really be feasible.  I have heard of a book that is coming on the market in the next year or so that is called Day For Night.  It has a similar theme to Battlefield Earth. A superior species takes over the earth and such but in this story, the species that does so is sent here by God to punish the wicked.  Perhaps there will be more answers in that book than there were in this film.  It is just too bad that this film fails so miserably because it had so much potential.  But its potential is severely wasted on special effects, bad acting and terrible directing.  And that is a shame.A terrible shame.2 out of 10",

            "content": "Note: the following comment contains as many *spoilers* as a college dorm refrigerator.  Read on if you've already seen *Battlefield Earth* (or if you just plan on watching it for tremendous amusement).A gem among the bargain-basement films of our time.  Battlefield Earth was fully worth the $1.50 at the local second-rate (sorry, second-run) theater. When I first saw this with my husband, I snorted with laughter louder than the big-budget explosions in the film.  As I have never snorted publicly, we invited 2 friends and film-buffs to the second showing.  I think we may have offended the Scientologists a few rows in front of us, and we did try to keep our laughter down. We played a fun game where we tried to name all the films director Christian ripped-off.  As our memory has faded a bit, here is a partial list.  Feel free to contribute more to the `Battlefield-Earth-Spot-A-Rip-off-Game!' Of note are Planet of the Apes (city ruin scenes looked almost exact), Blade Runner (Johnny-the underdog hero--running through the exact number of window-panes as the Replicant),  Dune (overhead city shots), Braveheart (braided-hairstyles, bad Scottish fading accents, hokey `we must unify' speech),  Matrix (Johnny running through exploding building parts), Star Wars (Planet Psychlo like Death Star), Logan's Run (ruins of Washington D.C).  Let's not forget that the Psychlos themselves look like the lovechild of the Klingons and the Kiss Army.  And they seem to have this hearing problem too:  during the scene where Terl (John Travolta, the head Psychlo) finds out he has to stay on earth for 50 more cycles, the cheap-effect echo of evil laughter made me wonder if someone had hooked up their Beltone hearing aid to the speakers.Ah, the inconsistencies.they are enough to make you weep for the End of Days.  We'll just mention a few major spoilers here, but honestly, the film itself is so predictable that most viewers will be able to get the miraculous underdog plot from the intro credits. The female love interest is very suave for a cavegirl.  (Granted her 80's aerobi-chick look is somewhat primitive, but it's still a far cry from what you'd expect from a culture with no knowledge of orthodontics or plastic surgery).  Cave men and women are well groomed if they are main actors but grungy if supporting actors. In the earth city-ruins, the malls had deteriorated into dust, but not libraries, military equipment, or anything else convenient to the plot. In the Psychlo compound, the amount of backstabbing and `leverage' is so monumental that I have a hard time believing that any society could function with so much chaos.  It makes Machivelli seem like a kiddy-ride. (And they expect us to believe that Terl continues to drink from the same bartender he had blackmailed and ruined?  I guess the Psychlos haven't mastered the art of the Mickey Finn).In Battlefield Earth, Man animals were considered too stupid to mine (until programmed to do so), yet the Psychlos have them mining (and oxidizing metal) in an earlier scene when Johnny runs through without his breathing mask.  And don't they stamp the gold bars at Fort Knox with marks?  Seems I remember hearing about that in junior high school.  This would increase the chance that the gold bars are detected by the Psychlos as not mined by the man-animals.The most obvious inconsistency (noted by other critics) was that originally the Psychlos `defeated your people in seven minutes.'  Yet 1000 years later, using miraculously intact (and technologically obsolete) hardware, the skin-wearing man-animals, thanks to a crash course in Euclidean geometry, can fly fighter jets and whup Psychlo ass . . . `Piece of cake!'  (This amuses me, since I've been to the same Fort Hood, Texas a few years ago and the military weapons were already rusted.)  And if man animals are considered too stupid, why would the Psycho's stick around for a 1000 years to teach them to mine? Whittaker's character (the Psychlo second in command) has such a pained look on his face that it makes his portrayal of a tortured hostage in the Crying Game look gentle.  I have a feeling that he was a little embarrassed by this film.  Whittaker's character executes Johnny's best friend.  Whittaker then becomes Johnny's natural choice for chief Psychlo advisor.  And speaking of pain,  Terl doesn't register any pain when his arm is blown off. Hummm.I'm also not sure with all the tear jerking scenes if they were trying to make the Psychlos seem mean or not.  We see them senselessly blow away cows to humans, dangle people over cliffs and play death games.  It's all so subtle.Not so subtle were the blatant promotions for technology being man's salvation.  I ask you, would you want to learn from the invaders that tortured your race for a 1,000 years?  It doesn't make for good Scientology propaganda.  My friend got the Scientology heebie-jeebies at the concept of `Leverage.'  Characters are always trying to get dirt on other Psychlos: much like the Church of Scientology's (CoS) own techniques for extorting members and forcing them to give good PR.  (It makes one pause to think, was Travolta blackmailed into this travesty, and yet decided to make it so deliberately bad that it would fail as propaganda?)  Is the brainwashing scene with Johnny just a little reminiscent of those personality tests that the CoS gives to hapless passers-by?  And why would the Psychlo brainwashers provide their enemy with specific knowledge about how to destroy their entire civilization?The resolution of these mysteries must only be available to those who pay for advanced Scientology seminars.Religious films can be very inspiring.  But I'm sorry, I like to see people come to their faith or perspectives by insight and exploration, but not exploitation.  Then again, ripping off people's minds can be very cost-effective, especially if you rip-off other people's movies.The cynical crusaders",

            "content": "I have to wonder if John Travolta has actually seen this movie.  For all his comments, he thinks he has produced a good film version of L. Ron Hubbard's epic novel.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.Somehow, it appears that all of the plot points that allowed the story to make sense have been surgically removed.  The Scots who had managed to preserve their culture and higher learning are gone, replaced by primitives who are reduced to making ape noises.  The three month training period for the Scots that Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is able to pull off under Terl's nose has been decreased to a week with loinclothed barbarians.  The international scope of the work is also gone; all of the action takes place in the United States.To make matters worse, the additions are nonsensical at best.  The Psychlos are reduced from skilled miners to slavemasters (who are apparently highly educated).  Millennia old Harriers not only work, but are learned within a week (just try this at home...).  And the end features the most nonsensical leap of logic I have ever seen.There are some redeeming features to this movie, though.  It does manage to entertain for its length, even if it is impossible to suspend disbelief. The special FX are pretty decent, although nothing terribly new.  The cast of Psychlos also manages to perform very well, so most of the acting is relatively good.However, if you really want to experience Battlefield Earth, stay at home and read the book.  You'll get more hours of entertainment, and the novel actually makes sense.Final score: 2/5.  It has some good acting and FX, and isn't as vile as Species 2.  However, that is about the praise it merits.",

            "review_title": "Where do I start with this movie?",
            "content": "1. Acting: The acting in this movie is bad, very very bad. Anyone who isn't a scientologist who sees this movie will notice the performaces and feel annoyed or disgusted. The only thing that could have helped it wasn't included in the move. Travolta dance sequences, how hard was it to miss this incredibly obvious draw that this could have been? We could have had intense and erotic dance sequences between the aliens and the humans which would have aptly illustrated the tensions between the races. And frankly how can you really hate someone you have slow danced with? Alien war problem solved Mister Hubbard. 2. Storyline: This movie is long, very long. With unbelievable characters, dialogue and storyline this movie quickly decends into a slow moving and tiresome attempt at creating an epic. Only in movie length is that attempt actually felt by the movie viewer. The lackluster character development, incredibly poor dialogue, poor costume design and alien makeup, and incredible leaps of logic made in the story all combine to make this storyline very unbelievable and incredibly tiring to watch. I literally had to force myself to finish it just so that my previous 2 hours wouldn't have been wasted in vain. And what was I rewarded with at the end? One of the most contrived and inane endings in a movie I have seen. Machines just happen to have the capability to teach humans how to fly ships, and access to these machines is given to humans who use them to boost their knowledge which they then use to destroy the aliens. The aliens were allowing this machine learning due to political maneuvering by the main alien character. Sound believable yet?... I could go on and on and on, the plotline is really that bad. 3. Costumes and makeup: The costume are horrible, the aliens are actually wearing platform shoes and large rubber outfits. I have seen better attempts at aliens costumes from B-movies, not to mention the makeup. And those enormous alien codpieces, one of the only true laughs I had during this movie was at the first sight of those, and it was an unintended movie moment.. I almost expected L. Ron Hubbard to pop up out of Travoltas codpiece and yell out \"GOTCHA!@#\" and attempt to scramble through the screen at me. That alone kept me on the edge of my seat throughout much of the movie, unfortunately that was the only thing in this movie that could. Of course that could just be the scared reactions of the Thetan that lives inside my head who is scared of Hubbards amazing psychological brainwashing methods to remove him and who wants to avoid contact with anything of his. yeah, that is it... 4. The camera: Off center shots can add to a scene immensely, unfortunately these off center shots were used throughout much of this movie. Let me state that again, much of the movie shots were off centered. For what reason this was used, and what the director thought was gained by using it I will never know. Just one more annoying aspect to the movie. 5. Special effects and editing: The special effects are mediocre at best and for a movie of this era they should have been better. The editing transitions were awful. 6. Dialogue: The names the aliens gave for humans was amusing in its inanity. This inane dialogue is constant throughout the movie. I hated the aliens not because they were oppressive or evil, I hated them because they talked. It was a constant grating thing to listen to them converse with each other or the humans.There are so many other things that are bad or flawed in this movie, I don't have the space to list them all and elaborate on them. Please avoid this movie at all costs, the only reason it was made was because Travolta pushed for it for years. And his motivations were based purely on his scientology beliefs and his cult like worship of the cult figure L. Ron Hubbard. This movie is an insult to a intelligent moviegoer, you would best be served viewing a movie with actual merits.",

The acting was awful, the plot (as silly as it was) was just plain stupid, it was unrealistic, and Battlefield Earth had poor special effects!I now laugh at the comments John Travolta made before this movie came out: \"I want everyone to see because I was really impressed with the script.\" Yeah right, John, that's why, after the premiere, you said that Battlefield Earth was suppose to be bad.Well I laughed at it all the way through. Jonnie Goodboy (creative name isn't it?), alone, saved the day for the troubled human race. Battlefield Earth became comical when Jonnie picked up books that were 1000 years old, and just needed to be dusted, to be legible. Buildings stood up, glass intact, traffic signals and cars were lying everywhere, but after 1000 years?About 90 minutes in, I was howling. These illiterate caveman learned to use fighter jets in just a week (oh, but it was because of that simulator which taught them right? And by the way, where did the electricity to power the simulator come from?), and were taught nuclear physics on top of that. Fort Knox, with all of its gold inside, neatly stacked, was waiting for the \"man-animals\" for a millennium. How convenient.If you really want to roll on the floor though, watch the scene towards the end when one single nuclear bomb blew up the entire Psychlo planet. The SFX were lousy.

I wanted to do that *while* I was watching it.This movie fails so incredibly badly, it's unwatchable. First of all, we have a nonsensical plot which depends largely upon the assumption that 1000 years from now our jets will still be in working order, and while much of our stuff will be in ruins, it will be more akin to 20 years of neglect than a millenium. Then we have the camera work. Practically every scene in the movie is shot under one or more of the following conditions: an angled camera, a colored filter, and/or slow motion. I actually got a case of motion sickness from watching it.Amazingly, John Travolta - who, with the help of Satan himself, was the driving force behind this film - actually had a SEQUEL planned. The movie covers only the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's book. See, Hubbard may not write *well*, but he tries to make up for that by writing *long*. People are inclined to think thicker books are automatically better than thinner ones. Fortunately, that sequel, much like that one evil Pandora managed to keep in her little box when she unleashed all those others on humanity, will almost certainly never be made. After how badly this one bombed, only a lunatic or a sadist - or a lunatic sadist - would consider green lighting a second.Nevertheless, the word must be spread. This movie is PAINFULL. It is not for the faint of heart. Only experienced B-movie afficianados should watch it.

            "content": "When I saw this movie I had just come off a month of anime, which was the perfect preparation, since this is anime with live actors. If that wasn't what was purposed, it must have been something close. The plot, the characters, the voices, the combination of tones, the construction of the scenes, the storytelling rhythms, and the general outlook are the same as in Japanese cartoons, but in no other form I know, including the pulp magazine stories in whose tradition I had expected it to follow.As anime, the movie succeeds pretty well. It's sometimes exciting and often silly, as one would expect; but it kept me interested in one way or another throughout. This is more than can be said of a lot of big movies. I don't understand the widespread opinion that it's unintentionally funny, since it's in a semi-comic vein throughout-- although, again, some of the humor works and some doesn't. The performances, the sets, and the effects all suit its form. Therefore all the negative reviews the movie has collected are, I would say, beside the point. They're assessing it as a conventional movie, rather than on its own terms. Within those terms, it succeeds fairly well. It has faults, but the biggest ones are the faults of cartoons in general: the universe of the story is essentially stupid, every scene is the same, and one doesn't care what happens in the end. Otherwise, the biggest problem is Travolta's performance, which seems out of key with everything else. A better actor, or just a different one, might have been able to bring it off; or perhaps not. The second biggest problem is that for a space opera the story is short on spaceships and battles, and almost all of the action is subsidiary to the main conflict. The central situation is that the hero helps the villain while (not very) secretly intending to defeat him, but the movie takes forever to set this up and disposes of it almost immediately. And then the story has a way of stopping completely at times, as for two computer simulation sessions. On the other hand, the cutting is very brisk, and makes much use of anticipatory reaction shots, so that everything seems to be happening faster: this is probably a standard trick in action films, but I hadn't noticed it before.In summary, there's no reason to see the movie, but no reason to avoid it, either. It's a harmlessly pleasant way to spend two hours.(Note: The video calls itself a \"Special Edition,\" but I don't see anything so special about it.)",

Our hero, Barry \"who the hell is this guy?\" Pepper plays his part with such overwrought earnestness that he's painful to watch.  He lacks the charisma that's needed to carry this lame material to anything resembling a satisfactory conclusion; where's Tom Baker and Bill Shatner when you need them most?  Dang, I'd even settle for Tim Thomerson.  But I had a good laugh.  The movie comes alive every time Travolta's whiny, hairy villain lumbers on screen and dispenses such witty insults as \"rat-brain.\"  Of course, that's probably small consolation to the actor himself, who wasted an enormous amount of time, money, and prestige getting this turkey to the screen.  We can only hope that Tarantino will someday revive his career - again.Definitely not a movie for critics, or general audiences for that matter, but rat-brained, science-fiction-loving man-animals should love it to pieces.",

The director came highly recommended from George Lucas. The effects were well done. The make-up was interesting. Why was Travolta sort of normal looking and the other, lesser Psychlos covered with make-up? I know, he's a superstar and all but come on. Interesting story of Mankind's buttkicking at the hands of some very corporate minded aliens. Imagine if they had been combat oriented like Larry Niven's Kzinti. These tall, hairy, dentally challenged dudes are all about making a buck. And they really get off on screwing each other over, too.

I figured I'd try and give the movie a chance and keep an open mind and try to stay off the band wagon.After seeing this movie I can tell you that I totally agree with the majority consensus that film sucks...really sucks. Imagine the worst B-movie ever made played on the Sci-Fi channel but going back in time and inflating this films tiny $100,000 budget to 50 million dollars.What you get is horrible script, plot holes bigger than the grand canyon and some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. I'd seen Barry Pepper in Saving Private Ryan and figured he'd be a great lead actor..but boy was I wrong. I don't entirely blame him though..with such a terrible director and script I don't know who could have given a memorable performance in this time vampire. His performance was so stale and bland I was amazed. John Travolta dear oh dear.. wow..probably the lowest point in his career. The fact he was able to salvage a career after this movie deserves a massive amount of respect.The plot is just terrible!!! I mean...these ugly looking alien things conquer Earth. They enslave humans to mine gold..why the hell would these Aliens want gold so bad?? I mean..it really has no practical use except looking good on some bimbos ears or finger so why the hell would these Aliens want it so much? Also apparently flying a harrier jet is so easy a caveman could do it! Get the joke? but seriously..and the fact these jets are mechanically sound after 1000 years and are all stocked up on fuel. I wonder who put the fuel stabilizer in every 3 months? This is just.bad bad bad..whoever OK'd this film at the studio is now probably serving your cheeseburger at McDonalds.",

It's like, even if you know nothing about plot, costumes, cinemetography, reality, plot, fruit bats, breakfast cereals...you could not make a film this bad without malice aforethought.  I think Travolta is so rich, he said \"hey, I'm going to take L Ron's novel and make the worst sci fi movie since Plan 9.  And I'm going to have fun with it.\" And he did.   I mean, that cheesy \"villain\" accent he uses in every scene?  What was that, Ming the Merciless meets Marc Harris?  And here's his entire dialog for the film: \"I am the super evil guy!  I am invincible!  The only thing that could possibly defeat me is if this one human turned out to be smart!  And that can't happen!  Mwah ha ha ha ha!!!  Wait, he IS smart!  No, this cannot be! He...he shot my arm off!

And what the hell were they going to do with the gold, anyhow?   And why was the camera tilted in EVERY SINGLE SCENE!   \nThere are too many other bad things to describe.

Aside from Travolta, the acting is good, nothing spectacular, but decent enough. Of course, the special effects are very nice, but that alone doesn't make it a good movie. The plot is average at best. The idea is good, but the script doesn't follow through on the promise. It seems very choppy, it jumps forward too much a few times, and it feels like parts have been left out. That could either be due to flaws in the script, or the film being overedited.

He even conned them and his own friends out of money with fake deals. He has made so many stupid statements and false claims that it is laughable that a bum would join his church, much less a cast of Hollywood stars with millions of dollars. Like P.T. Barnum said, \"There is a sucker born every minute\". Maybe someone in the church was blackmailing Travolta for being gay all these years, and forced him to make this garbage???

From the intellectual snob of a movie buff, to the casual movigoer, we've heard the names, if not seen the movies: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, North By Northwest, The Wizard Of Oz, etc., etc. Existing on the opposite end of the spectrem are movies so horrendously bad, so awful, that they remain equally engraved in the memories of fans for years to come.  One such movie is Battlefield Earth, a unique film in the sense that every single aspect of production is poor and dreadfully uninspired.The faults of Battlefield Earth are too enumerous to count, and the redeeming factors (if any) elusively hidden between overblown special effects, plot holes the size of Lake Tahoe, overacted performances which are going to give all of the lead actors permanent black marks. And worst of all, the movie takes itself seriously.  It does not branch out into comic relief (at least not intentionally, Travolta's performance inspires laughs when it's supposed to be intimidating).  In between the frames, as well as in various interviews, the filmmakers have hinted that they think (honestly) that they have created a classic film to be long remembered in Battlefield Earth.I hear about plans for a sequel, or spin-off TV show. I hope to God that this is not true!  When I saw the film, I was first incredilous with shock at the film's astoundingly stupid dialogue and story which breezed from action scene to action scene (none of which are exciting, Die Hard 2 is better than this cheese) and how it lingered on boring, pointless plot \"revelations\" that the audience members who have IQ's above that of an eggplant must have figured out long before the characters on screen have. Then I was laughing, and I was not the only one.  Finally, I just waited for it to be over.  I walked out of the screening room, took unusually long breaks to the concession stand, meandered around the theater looking at posters for coming attractions, and when I returned to the movie, I found I had missed nothing, and was not surprised.  The film does not work on any level.  Not self-parody.  It's not even campy.  It's an embarrassment to all involved in its making, and anyone who had to endure it in theaters.

Something about the cheesy/childish nature of these movies makes me sleepy.Hearing about this movies being 'so bad it's good' , I thought I would give it a try. Forest Whitaker and Travolta are both excellent actors, the budget for the movie pretty large so I watched with an open mind.After spitting out my beer at some of the dialogue (particularly JT's) and needing to press the pause button to change my jeans I could see I would be in for a treat. We can laugh at movies and I once (only once) was reduced to tears of laughter during a movie with 'The Holy Grail'. This movie had me crying with laughter about 6 times. What makes it better is you realize that JT had total power and this was a 'classic' in his brain whilst filming. Nobody had the courage to say 'It looks good, but I didn't realize you were making a comedy'. 'Piece of cake' is a classic line in this movie when some illiterate cave dudes learn to fly sophisticated fighter jets in minutes. As a pilot himself (Jt has his own Boeing 737 I believe) Trav should have known better.The fact is he wasn't making a comedy when he tried to make a serious homage to the quite mad Ron Hubbard.However, we ended up with one of the best comedies of all time.A must.",

His acting, along with Barry Pepper's and Forest Whitaker's (Whitaker's usually a very talented man) is wooden and has no personality at all. Don't even get me started on the plot. This film rips off everything from Star Wars to other films.  I think the biggest mistake this movie made (Besides bringing the book to the big screen, which is quite a good book if you take the time to read it) was hiring B-Movie director Roger Christian to take the helm.  I guess the rule of thumb here is to never give a B-Movie director to direct what could have been a potentially good movie. Christian, on the other hand has worked with microscopic budgets. Give him an $80 million dollar budget and look what in the crap nebula happened (Sorry, just had to quote from the book there). Besides, this was a man who helped out as a set director with the first Star Wars film (The '77 one) and was a second assistant director on the highly successful first prequel.I guess what I am trying to say here is: DON'T SEE IT. Literally, as I was walking around the movie theater here at home and saw people going in to see it, I said to myself, \"Why do they torture themselves like this?\"Just don't bother.  If you want to see a good sci-fi film, just dust off the Star Wars tapes and have a great Saturday night that way.",

Perhaps it's greatest fault is it's boring and unoriginal. If you want to see a good movie with more-or-less the same plot, watch \"Independence Day.\"On the other hand I'd like to point out some of the films strengths, without implying that they mitigate this travesty in any way. Forrest Whitaker is actually pretty good in his role (which would have been a larger role in the sequel.) There were also some decent performances among the supporting cast of humans and Psychlos. People just tend to forget them because the two principals were so awful.Barry Pepper is probably the worst. I've seen high school kid productions with dad's video camera that contained better performances. The guy simply has no charisma or screen presence. He should go back to bad Sci-Fi channel movies, or wherever he came from. But let me be an apologist for John Travolta. Granted he wasn't very good in this, but he did try to appropriately channel the character from the book. Terel literally is supposed to be on the verge of psychosis, as well as being deviously intelligent and delusional. In a lot of ways Travolta pulls this off. The unfortunate thing is he didn't have much to work with. The true stinker of this film is it's awful script. Perhaps the worst in the last 30 years. The dialog is painful at best and uninspired. It revolves around colloquialisms and clich\u00e9's that the worst hack writer wouldn't touch, and nothing that comes out of any characters lips is believable. They don't even manage to follow some of the more interesting plot points of the book, settling for spectacle and silliness like resurrecting a fleet of AV-8B Harriers. (For my part, I think the Uranium tipped bullets from the book would have been cooler; causing the Psychlo's to explode on impact!)Perhaps the most telling comparison that can be made is that with L. Ron Hubbard's novel. The book is not good, but it is entertaining. The movie is neither....and could somebody put the writers out of our misery?",

OK, this is quite trashy, but I think this is \"good\" trash, and not as boring as many other stupid films made nowadays (I don't want to name examples, but think for example how bad are recent horror films, just the same as many serious dramas for that matter). Why couldn't you watch it like some trashy scifi movie from seventies, sixties, fifties, eighties, whatever? Maybe it's \"too near\" (=Too new). I actually feel very good, when I see special (computer) effects done \"non-perfectly\". It's quite unusual these days. And anyway, I haven't seen one single movie, not even the most expensive, that has really realistically looking landscapes, people or any creatures, that has been made with computer. They just look totally dead, not even dead, just computer-animations, every single time. (It's little bit hard to understand why, but that's not the issue to talk here and now...) Computer-made effects and pictures in this film look quite sympathetic to me. I think \"sympathetic\" would maybe be the word that best describes my feelings to this movie overall. It's one man's serious effort, and I respect that. He has really tried, and really failed. And that (to even seriously try) is more than some artists manage (/have courage) to do even once in their careers. It's a bit of a mystery, how can these good actors (Travolta and Whitaker) can act so bad in this movie. That makes the movie even more (funnily) worse. How can it be, you may ask yourself many times during watching. Could a REAL bad director ruin everything, also REAL good actors? But apparently in U.S. the producer has often more power than the director, so you can blame Travolta for everything, if you need a scapegoat. He's a joke character to many people anyway, just the same as some David Hasselhoff. The story is the same as in every hero/scifi/adventure-trash film, but who cares if it's stupidly funny (and bad enough)? And the prison's food looks good! Is it spinach? Chill out and enjoy.(I give ten, because everyone else seems to exaggerate in the other direction. Just for some balance.)",

And that was something to be told about.I don't really know what the director's been thinking, but they really made up a really really bad shape(performance) of both the Psychlos and the Human(animal),couldn't they make it better that all of the Psychlos look almost the same even the outfit and so are the human,that sometimes you get confused all over who is really who. The Psychlos really look like a bunch of fools that couldn't even walk in a proper way and seems to be too slow just to get themselves move along, and they also surely too easy to be defeated in a fightback, for an Alien of which almost wipe out the entire human race in about 9 minutes and enslaved human race from many centuries ago. Take that into account.After all,despites of all the lacking in the movie,we(or I) should give a credit,the only credit to the 'moral teaching' of this movie, which is to never give ourselves up on any hard circumstances and about how to encouraged ourselves to avoid the destruction, the struggle of human race against the Psychlos surely means something, it shows the superiority of human if just we put some efforts on it.

Best of all, it features one of the most delectable scenery-chewing over-performances of all time by John Travolta as the fussy, greedy, scheming and arrogant Terl. Honestly, this is a hoot! Travolta is obviously having miles of fun playing this part and the mad extravagance of his performance is thoroughly enjoyable. [I defy anyone not to laugh at the scene where he concludes that raw rat is human beings' favorite treat!] And besides its comic value, it has eye candy: the panoramic views of Earth's ruined cities are terrific, as are the makeup and costuming of the alien Psychlos, especially the females (though most of the actors evidently could have used more training before they tried walking in those stacked platform boots). And you just can't beat those scenes of fur-clad barbaric humans flying futuristic jet planes in bombing raids against their alien oppressors.

All that lasted of human creation were some of the stone, concrete and steel structures and some other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers. I can't even see this being watched for the humor value. The aliens were not written to look like this, the story only loosely follows that of the novel and Hubbard would probably hook Travolta's privates to an e-meter for his butchering of the tale.

Ron Hubbard - he's obviously a smart guy if he can create a \"religion\" that makes the kind of money Scientology does but I do consider \"Battlefield\" one of my favorite books.* For Science Fiction, you won't find any improbabilities in the book, unlike the movie (Well maybe one, with relationship to the alien's telescopic technology) and he goes to great, yet still entertaining depths to involve topics as far-reaching as interstellar finance and diplomacy and he covers all the bases when it comes to holes in the story.There is no way the book could be capsulized into a movie, even at 180 minutes, so Travolta was foolish for even trying. A mini-series perhaps but that's been tried a couple of times with \"Dune\" and we all know how that went. Do NOT see this movie. If you see it, don't blame the book for what you see. Incidentally, I do not recommend any of Hubbard's books other than this one.*As a matter of fact, you don't even have to leave this web site to see the results of his charisma and Scientology. Sort the many comments about this movie by \"Loved It\". If you take out those who are obviously being sarcastic and allow for another 10% of the comments being people who are trying to be sarcastic in their promotion of the film but are simply too stupid to make it obvious, you still have an inordinate number of people who claim to genuinely like the movie. Statistically speaking, the cross section of stupidity in the general public doesn't allow for an explanation of all the positive posts, so what are we left with? Posts by Tom Cruise and his John Travolta and their fellow adherents.People that think L. Ron Hubbard's emeter, while relieving them of their money, will also get rid of those nasty \"body thetans\" that Scientology expose. (Ancient aliens who attach their spirits to you and who can only be removed by the magical transformation of your money to Scientology. There are apparently tenets of Scientology that call for the visiting of web sites where movie reviews are easily posted and singing the praises of anything to do with Elron. Of course these are just my first amendment rights speaking, IMDb doesn't need the cadre of Scientology Attorneys descending on them and I'm sure that by now they would like to reiterate the views expressed in this post do not reflect the views of anybody with money that the aforementioned attorneys can get their \"fins\" on.",

Oh yes, John Travolta! He plays a mad greedy alien in such a ham way that it makes an Austin Power's movie look like a Royal Shakespeare Company production. His line delivery is so weird, and if it wasn't for the poor makeup and costume he's been given you would be drawn to conclude it was evidence of substance abuse. Travolta's antics unfortunately seem to have infected the rest of the cast who act in a manner that would have been rejected if given by the puppets from Sesame Street. If it isn't Forest Whitaker laughing for no apparent reason all the time, it's Barry Pepper trying to make up for his lack of dialogue through a series of grimaces. It's usually at this point that a reviewer will say, 'ah yes but...' and offer up either the story, action or effects as solace. Sadly none of these are executed any better, and in some respect much less so. The plot (and I assume the book makes more sense, please) has such big plot holes in it you could drive a Death Star through them. For example, the aliens take over earth and set about plundering it, a thousand years later they have still to notice a large building called 'Fort Knox' which is full of gold. And when I hero's want to fight back they - amazingly - come across a squadron of flyable Harrier jump jets. That they learn to fly in simulators in a few days. Moronic isn't the word. Many Sci-Fi film's are endearing enough that you can allow them some artistic license, no film is ever going to get as much as Battlefield Earth needs, ever.

Some of my favorite scenes (the more intellectual, dramatic scenes) from the book were not even covered in the movie and this is where the movie really failed.If you like the sci-fi genre, I'd rate the book at about a 7/10 and the movie a 2/10.

The concepts of a movie being 'interesting', 'coherent', and 'reasonable' were obviously foreign to the B.E. creators.And no, I am not a 'sheep' who says B.E. is bad b/c the critics say so (I never read their reviews), and it is bothersome to see certain people who like the movie accuse the majority of IMDb users of not having their own opinion.  Could it possibly be that most people say Battlefield Earth is a bad movie because it really IS a bad movie?  Heaven forbid.Anyway, on with the movie...THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS (as if there's much to spoil).  First, it's worth noting that when I went to see it, about half of the viewers left during the movie.  I thought B.E. was campy fun.  In any case, here's a couple samples of what's in this piece of crud (of course, you already know about the Harriers from 200 other reviews.):The humans have finally started to rebel against the Psychlos.  During the battle, one of the rebels urgently warns Johnny Goody-two Shoes via Walkie-Talkie, 'There's a lot of Psychlos, and they're moving fast!', Gosh, could Johnny be in mortal danger?  As it turns out, 'a lot' of 'fast' Psychlos ends up being a pack of 5 marching at about half of normal walking speed.  Thank goodness, one threat averted.In another snippet of brilliant dialogue, the humans are planning their rebellion.  Johnny Goody-two Shoes explains how they need to destroy the Psychlo homeworld (note these are cavemen w/o means of flying).  One of the humans asks if they can do that now.  Johnny sagaciously replies, 'No, we're going to need some more supplies before we can do that.'  We cracked up as quietly as we could without disturbing all of the other 4 people left in the theater.There was only one part of the movie I liked, when they showed the Psychlo homeworld--I thought it looked cool.  But that's all.Most people will be bored stiff.  If you like campiness, cheesiness and/or sci-fi, this MIGHT end up being fun, but don't count on it. \nIf you hear any hearty laughing from the direction of Waco, TX, you'll know it's from Battlefield Earth...1/10 (and not too far from being a 0)",

            "content": "It's obvious that a lot of money was spent making 'Battlefield Earth', but none of it appears to have spent to good effect. In particular, the screenplay itself appears to have cost $16.98, maybe less...I have bought $2.99 comic books written by Warren Ellis and Alan Moore that blow the doors off BE in terms of plot, dialog, mood, characterization, and general entertainment value. Ellis's recent limited series 'Ocean' alone contains 10 times more entertainment value than this 2 hour bath in bilge-water. I think we can all agree that blame rests squarely with John Travolta and director Roger Christian, who both seemed to have forgotten everything they ever knew about making GOOD movies:Rule number one: never adapt anything by L. Ron Hubbard (or whatever ghost writer churned out this crap for him). The BE books were the worst kind of space opera hack work in the first place. E.E. 'Doc' Smith did this kind of thing better 40 years before in the 'Lensman' series. Rule number two: even in science fiction, you can't throw believability out the window, like asking the audience to believe that unmaintained Harrier Jets could fly after 1000 years, or that cavemen could use 1000 year old technology to beat alien space conquerers who kicked the crap out of that 1000 year old technology in the first place back when it was new and used by expert professionals. Rule number 3: Barry Pepper can not carry a film when John Travolta is hogging center stage and camping things up like the Ziegfield follies. Nothing against Barry, who is a fine, if limited actor. I hope his career survived this bomb and the tanking of 'Knockaround Guys'. Rule number 4: Use the same camera trick as a dramatic device too many time (tilting the camera 45 degrees to connote dramatic intensity or an action climax) and the viewer will suspect creative bankruptcy. Rule number 5: If you are lucky enough to have Forest Whittaker in your film, give him something to do, and do NOT dress him up as a Klingon refugee from a KISS concert.

Everything about this movie was bad, the costumes were lame and looked like they bought them at a local kmart, the story has to be the worst thing about this poor attempt of a film, it is so loose and left and changed so may thing s from the book that it seems like it should be loosely based on the book, the names of the characters are lame for example and i am not making this up Johnny goodboy is the name of the main character and the bad guys like john Travolta are called psyhclos(lol) now tell me that isn't gay. i think the director needs to take a little more time thinking about his camera angles because normally they are chosen to be on an angle for a reason but this director doesn't seem to understand because every and i mean every shot is on an angle (maybe the guys just got a crooked neck). This is just one of the worst films i have ever seen and certainly the worst film to novel movie ever. Even the special effects sucked and that was the only thing i was looking forward to at all even tough i wasn't looking forward to see this movie. If my opinon means anything at all dont see this attempt of a movie. F. 0 out of 5 starts. crap.",

This results in a general progression of the internet, but there are numerous examples where people threw together a bunch of cool things into one web site that just doesn't work.  Some of these sites are all that much worse because the material in them isn't even worthwhile.Well, Battlefield Earth is the movie version of one of those web sites.  It is a blatant rip-off of much better material, Blade Runner, Star Trek and KISS among them.  It's nice to see cool scenes, and this film has them, but when they are wrapped into a movie that is such nonsense, they only stick out as the blatant copies they are.  The special effects were quite good and the sound was big and well done, but unfortunately it was as giant a step backwards in a big sci-fi movie as I will (hopefully) ever see.The good thing about bad web pages is that the cost of reading them is a bit of wear and tear on your mouse finger.

            "content": "Sometimes there are bad movies. Sometimes there are awful movies. And once in a lifetime there's \"Battlefield Earth\", a film so incomprehensible, dim-witted, and so torturously heavy-handed as to become equivalent to getting beat over the head by Paul \"Big Show\" Wight. And I want no part of that.\"Battlefield Earth\" is a film that so avoids even trying to be just decent that one wonders why they even bothered to make it. If you hate the project so much that you won't even bother to put effort into it, than you should just skip it and save L. Ron Hubbard the humiliation of watching his book become this garbage.\"Battlefield Earth\" the movie is a simple, and by simple I mean insultingly stupid, tale of aliens conquering earth in the year 3000. While Mr. Hubbard's book was a fascinating fable, the film is just the opposite. It's so much more focused on special effects (terrible ones, at that) and putting John Travolta's made-up face on screen that story apparently became the third or fourth priority for director Roger Christian.And what an awful director he is. Not once is the camera looking straight-on at the action. Every single second of this film is Dutch-Angled, and for those of you who don't know what that means, just imagine a fight scene from the old Batman TV show. Now you have the idea. The angles are so insane that the camera practically winds up upside down. It's like being on a boat on a really stormy sea: nausea-inducing.The film's \"special effects\" amount to cheap explosions, and someone tossing a bucket load of rocks and dirt across the screen. That's basically it. Maybe they should be called \"Special Ed Effects.\" No, wait. That's an offense to Special Ed.The alien invasion depicted in the movie is so unfrightening and boring that I wonder why I didn't just shut this junk off. If you are seriously frightened by Terl, then you are in need of serious help. The character of Terl inspires laughter rather than fear, and that pretty much ruins the whole movie. He's the main character, and you spend the whole time laughing at just how pathetic he is. That tells you something, because even the dude in \"Enough\" at least didn't make me laugh.One can't really blame John Travolta for being so bad in this film, since the script gives him zilch to work with. If ever there were a potential career killer, this movie is it. Travolta hasn't impressed me since \"Pulp Fiction\", and this movie doesn't help. This film has taken all of his dignity. I needed to watch \"Saturday Night Fever\" twice and \"Pulp Fiction\" three times to wash the bad taste of \"Battlefield Earth\" out of my mouth.Forest Whitaker has seen better days as well. Luckily, he turned in a fantastic performance in \"Panic Room\" a year after this to redeem his honor. Travolta hasn't even done that much yet. It's time for Travolta to either shape up or go home, plain and simple. It's too painful to watch him sink to such pathetic lows.So, what do we have? Poor direction, awful acting, and a story so difficult to figure out, and so insulting to your intelligence once you do, that it's better to pretend there is no story. The only thing qualifying this as a \"movie\" is, well, movement. Yup, the pictures move. That's all it has going for it. Loud, explosive, and annoying, \"Battlefield Earth\" is the equivalent of a screaming, hungry one-year-old baby that just went in it's diaper: an assault on the senses and, to everyone other than those who created it, annoying.",

I went into this movie fully expecting the same tone and I must say, I could have laughed harder at my own vasectomy. Have you ever looked at something gruesome out of a sick curiosity and wished you hadn't? Well, BE is an accident at the sausage factory.I won't go into the \"plot\" details, mainly because they are of the \"so bad they're funny\" variety only they aren't funny. I did giggle a couple of times though. First, at Travolta's portrayal of Fussy-britches ( Er, I mean Terl). Think a butch Paul Lynde on Thorazine and meth at a leather party, but also as an alien (nobody does crap like JT). Barry Pepper, in contrast, brings to mind Vanilla Ice channelling Gary Cooper as an extra in Willow. The other times I snickered were at the dialog's. If the script was written by a committee of eighth grade dropouts for eighth grade dropouts, then huzzah! BE is a screen writing triumph! Anyone who progressed to the ninth grade, however, will find swishy Predator ripoffs called \"Psyklos\" sitting in bars drinking \"kobango\" and bitching about the \"home office\", well, silly.

            "content": "Where does one begin to describe how bad \"Battlefield Earth\" is? It may not be the worst movie ever made as some claim, but stil, it does manage to suck beyond the point of stupidity.The first huge flaw of the film is its story and script. The story goes a bit like this: an evil alien race (there obviously are no friendly ones in the entire galaxy...) called the Psychlos (now that's a cool name i guess the eviltrons was taken...) has taken over Earth. They think that humans are simple animals and thus they keep them imprisoned in cages. Until one day, a handful of humans led by a guy named Jonnie Goodboy (whoever came up with these names realy lacks imagination) decides to revolt against their alien enslavers and to no-one's surprise they succeed (more on that later). As far as the script goes things couldn't go worse... Dialogs were probably written by a five year old and contain every cliche in film history [\"I promised not to kill him\" (hands over gun to his friend) \"but he didn't!!! Mou-A-hahahaha\" (gunshots ensue)]. The Psychlos are really badly written and never forget to remind us how bad they are by finishing each sentence with a mou-a-haha laugh: \"Good morning, nice weather we're having MOU-A-HAHAHAHAHA\" Oh my aching sides...  The humans are given no depth at all and the fact that they just decide to revolt one day after 1000 years of slavery without any previous attempts at liberation is made really ridiculous because of this.The direction is also horrible and terribly uninspired. For example the film always cuts to another scene in exactly the same way: via a very old fashioned sliding door like effect. Every single action scene is also ruined by very bad shaky camera work which sometimes puts The Blair Witch Project to shame! Also some scenes (like the lobby shootout from \"The Matrix\") are ripped verbatim from other movies!The actors are also doing a horrible job except for Travolta who is clearly having the time of his life, since the realisation of this movie is a dream (probably a nightmare) come true for him. And what the Hell is Forrest Whittaker doing here?But the worst thing about this movie is that it is totally illogical and unbelivable. I mean ,sure, its is Sci-Fi, but even Sci-Fi has its limits. For example, we find out that Earth fell to the Psychlos after just a nine minute struggle in which every country in the planet threw everything but the kitchen sink at them. But in the end, a handful of humans (who can't be more than 20...) manage not only to free our planet, but also to destroy the planet of the Psychlos... How did they do that you may ask. You see they stumbled upon an 1000 year old military base which was conviniently housing a working nuclear bomb, a bunch of Harriers in mint condition and a flight simulator... But wait, it gets worse... You see these humans who have been reduced to something resembling the Neaderthals, manage to learn how to fly a Harrier better than Tom Cruise in \"Top Gun\" in just 7 days... 7 days... It takes people more time to learn how to play a flight sim on the PC for God's Sake...So all in all, \"Battlefield Earth\" is an excellent unintentional comedy! The only good thing it has going for it, is the Psychlos' make up! Avoid at all costs, unless you' re looking for a realy good laugh!! My rating: 2/10",

You better believe it is! That's actually one of the things I enjoyed about the film. There's no mental/emotional heavy lifting here. That's OK sometimes.I have a hard time believing the movie was made to be taken that seriously in the first place. LOL ... If that's what you're expecting, then yeah ... you'll be disappointed. There's plenty of glaring plot holes, and other inconsistencies. They're very, very easy to see, but my personal take on it is that It's just for fun. It's practically a farce. The actors do a wonderful job hamming this thing up (it's completely over the top) and mostly, it makes me laugh. I think they did a great job in this context.I give extra props to Whitaker and Travolta here. They play their parts (greedy, self-serving, arrogant aliens) to the hilt here. Pepper sticks to his role in earnest. That's mostly what makes this work for me.Again, I don't know if the filmmakers intended to make the next \"Star Wars\" or sci-fi blockbuster here. Seems to be what the public was expecting. If that's the case, they might very well have been disappointed. I didn't approach this film with those expectations, which may be why I accept it for what it is: a pulp science fiction film that doesn't ground itself in \"reality\" any more than is necessary to advance the plot! It also has a certain unique cinematic (almost comicbook-like) styling to the film that I actually liked.Want to say also, (after reading some of the other reviews) I don't know anything about Scientology or Hubbard. This had zero influence on my viewing the film. I did not perceive that the movie has any religious bent or major social/moral message to it. There's \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" - that's about it. Certainly nothing overly profound or complicated.If being completely implausible is reason alone to dislike a sci-fi film, than I should like very few of them. Sure, if you're willing to sit through an intelligent sci-fi film like \"Interstellar\" you might feel smarter for it, but I'm not afraid to admit I thought it was ... well, (gulp) kinda boring and depressing.

I'd read the reviews and wanted to see if it was as bad as they were all saying it was.It was! Then the second time was about a year or so later, this time on DVD loaned to me by a friend. At the time, I wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered.It was.And now today - April 9th 2006. I'd begun to develop fond memories for it and was curious to see if time had mellowed my opinion and allowed it to finally cross over into the 'so bad it's good category.' It hadn't.My original thoughts on the film had been and remain that if only every one involved had just tried a measly ten percent extra it would rank as perhaps one of the worst films ever made.Sadly, it stops well short of the classic 'so bad it's good' category and instead ends up committing - the worst movie crime imaginable - being mind and arse numbingly boring.I hate films that bore me, it's infuriating, it's insulting and it's unforgivable! Battlefield Earth is a mess, the acting is more ham than human, the effects shoddy, the script shocking beyond belief! This film is an abomination against nature and a crime against humanity. They should amend the Human Rights Bill and have a clause added outlawing it or at the very least banning it.It's cinematic equivalent of a bag of urine run over by a truck carrying excrement to a vomiting convention.I think Elvis Mitchell writing in The New York Times summed it up best when he wrote in May 2000 - 'It may be a bit early to make such judgements, but \"Battlefield Earth\" may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century.'

Thus, I always thought that the trashing this movie has received over the years was probably undue - more of a snowball effect than a true reflection of the actual film. Well, I was wrong. The acting is truly horrible (Travolta in particular is embarrassingly bad here), the story riddled with holes, the dialogue truly laughable. The visuals had a few interesting moments, but they were too few and far between to pull this stinker from the crapper. So, all I can think now is that I was horribly wrong when I enjoyed the book so long ago. Must remember to not read it again.

Obviously this movie was done as a quich cash-in on the book, but BE didn't do very well at the box office, and neither will it on video because even people who haven't seen it know it's a bad movie; nothing in the script ever got revised, and no one ever said something like this during shooting a scene: \"Ummm, I don't think it makes much sense to have the humans mine for gold, which is somehow in bars, even though they have no equipment. Even the cinematography is just horrible: Most of the movie is at about a 47 degree angle! And to make matters worse, most of the scenes are in only two colors, like the chase scene ripped from Blade Runner, only it's all in one shade of green and black, at a 47 degree angle! Also, the aliens, the 'Psychlos' look like tall potbellied humans with messed up hair. There are also many illogical scenes in BE that just can't be ignored - even the acting is bad (one of the lines in BE when a character gets mad at another: \"You arrogant greener!\" What the heck does that mean!?) and John Travolta overacts more than Captain Kirk in Star Trek. Hell, the humans are portrayed so stupid in this movie, you'll want the Psychlos to win, even though they have a bad sense of fashion. Also, they have conquered galaxies (as said by the pointless opening words) but they need gold. Why? Don't know. And somehow the humans know how to make a nuclear missile out of nothing which literally destroys the Psychlos planet into a million pieces somehow.Unfortunately, unlike other bad sci-fi movies, which are so bad they are good (Like 'The day time ended') this one is just bad, and not laughable.Oh, and one last thing: Travolta has talked about making a sequel, even though the first is a universally bad one and made no money at the box office.

It sets up the situation quite well. It seems that the original idea was to make this into a mini-series on TV depicting the entire saga. It also seems that once the backers realized what they had, they pulled the plug on funding and the rest was completed as best as they could manage on what was left of the budget.Surprisingly enough, John Travolta plays Terl pretty much as he is described in the novel, but only for the first half of the movie. Who knows what he was playing later on, but it wasn't Terl. Terl didn't talk to people in the novel, he talked at them.Making Battlefield Earth into a two-hour movie was roughly the same as it would be cutting up the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy into just two hours. The result was a mess. In the book, the time-line is stretched over a period of three or four years with every action meticulously described.

            "content": "This movie is indeed bad, but also worth watching. I will first get out of the way the Scientology thing. I don't care about it. Hubbard was a science fiction writer when he invented a religion, so for me the religious aspect is less relevant. That being said, the storyline in this film is very similar to a French book I read once, L'Empire du Baphomet , written in '72, which showed Knights Templar double cross a stranded alien, steal his knowledge and technology, then wage interstellar holy war in the name of their god. Only here we are talking about post alien invasion humans, reduced to animal status, fighting against their oppressors, an alien species that seems to be the result of Klingons and Ferengi interbreeding.Now, if you take the silliness of the story away (after all it is just a Dunning\u2013Kruger type of idea), you have to contend with the bad quality of the production. The special effects are dreadful, the slow motion scenes being especially tiresome, while the details are always shrugged out of the way because everyone was too lazy to think about them. It has the feel of a dream, something like one would imagine during a fever or something like that.But there is something in the way the movie feels that shows more about film making in general. This is a film produced and distributed for political reasons - it feels like it was made by the Psylochs themselves - so it is different from other films. It has the low quality associated with zealot projects, but a budget which is probably a lot bigger than normal B movies. The backlash against Battlefield Earth comes in part from the origins of the story and the reasons for making the film, but also from the feeling throughout the movie that someone has misused a lot of money to do something so mediocre.Bottom line: I feel like this is a film that should be taught in movie history in school. I know they don't have this yet, but they should, since they have literature and nobody reads anymore. It has the approximate quality and plot of America 3000 and that one is 4.3 on IMDb. Clearly such a controversial film, created with a 19 century mentality and script and so hated by most people that watched it, can teach something useful.Lastly, I must say this is not as bad as to watch it drunk and consider it a comedy. Strangely enough, John Travolta and Forest Whitaker played naturally in the film and Barry Pepper really did act the part he was given. It was the overall management of the film that was wholly defective.",

During the first Apeplanet-half of the film I did start to question my ability to absorb a cinematastic experience of this magnitude, and I had to take several breaks as I searched the IMDB for advice on how to stand the pain. But with a few of the more humorous comments in mind I ventured on into the second half. To my great surprise and pleasure, Battlefield Earth now evolved form its dull apeplanet remake form - over a MadMax/Army of Darkness inspired 'well-fight-them-with-science' where all of the human-animals suddenly develop an evolved way of thinking, plotting and gesturing - all in a matter of days - very fascinating. The last part of this - dare I say - Epic, is nothing short of an ID4 clone, and I can seriously recommend that you force yourself to see this part through - its very rewarding.Conclusion: Yes its bad!! - one of the worst actually...

We both knew about the Razzies (Worst film of the year goes to Battlefield: Earth!!! ...oh yeah AND worst actor, supporting actress, worst screen couple, supporting actor, screen play ...and about 5 others) and we knew about all the reviews. But the negative reviews didn't sway us from renting it... it was the reason we did! We were obviously waay to hyper (I wonder if there's a legal limit?) when we watched this\u0085 but! I did laugh so hard I almost peed my pants (twice!) and if it had been a comedy up front I would think it was the best one of the year... sadly however, VERY sadly.. it is NOT. It was trying to be serious\u0085 amazing. We kept replaying certain bits of scenes or words that sounded funny over and over.. and they get funnier EVERY SINGLE TIME! (Try it!.. don't rent it or buy it though.. maybe if you find it in it's rightful home, the gutter) for example.. when some guy dies in the jet and it blows up. Some guys yells his name.. it's like \"Pashaaaaaaa\" or something.. he looked so stupid! and the \"emotion\" was SOO forced. (The fact that he was probably staring at a blue screen anyway probably didn't help)... also\u0085 the best part (worst?) is the ridiculous and pointless scene where Terl (do they say his name even once?-maybe once-)hits his head on the ceiling! It so damn funny it hurts! (Probably more than his head.) John Travolta really should stayed faaaar away from this one.. (I guess everyone's gotta pay the bills for their $5 million home)Here's all the bad stuff about it here--First of all.. once you get over a few not-intendedly funny scenes the movie itself really IS painful to watch. It hard enough watching the strained and forced emotions and dialogue between the \"actors\" , the screenplay does NOT help.. and adding gasoline to an already humongous BOMB is the cinematography.. --I'll admit we rented the DVD (the VHS were all out -don't even ASK me why-) and watching that stupid \"making the 'movie'\" crap.. they were actually BRAGGING about how every SINGLE frame is crooked and hurts your eyes!- The movie itself, when you take away all the 'special effects' and stupid costumes\u0085 isn't ANY better! (Sad, I know) There doesn't even seem to be anything resembling a distant relative of a plot until the movie has almost reached its blessed conclusion. There are dozens of scenes (If not the whole movie) that could have been left on the cutting room floor. The characters are more annoying than lovable. The hero is weakly played by Barry Pepper and not even John Travolta can salvage his cardboard bad guy into anything more than 2-D. If anything.. he makes it worse.There are also plot holes the size of Canada (which is incredible seeing as the plot itself is as big as Rhode Island in comparison.) and the fact that a bunch of cavemen with an average IQ of 56 could learn to fly military fighter jets in less than a week boggles the mind. And that whole bit with dogs (not 'dog animals'???) being the superior species and that pointless scene of trying to find out their 'favorite food' when there was nothing around to eat but rats anyway was really inane and forced the movie to drag on and on EVEN more if conceivably possible. (It was 6 PM and we BOTH fell asleep!) Also, all the people acted like imbeciles and it was embarrassing, they all acted like monkeys! (People don't devolve just because they don't know quadratic equations!) and they made it look SOO easy to escape this supposedly 'advanced species' that has been ruling the earth for what..1000 years? (..and should probably have the ropes down.) Furthermore, there is that whole Fort Knox business, and why Terl was so nice to Johnny. (He spares John's life OVER AND OVER after escaping 40 times, yet kills a bunch of his guards who were just doing their jobs!) Also.. what was with having him use the 'learning machine'?? That's the ONLY reason they win in the end anyway! And it never really explains why they need the minerals in the first place, why they look so freakin' ugly, why they needed to put that air-breathing stuff in there, why the radiation bomb made a huge explosion, why that one guy always looked like he'd just crapped his pants, why they put that whole pointless s*** about the 'good luck charm', why the cities look as if they've only been neglected for 20 years, why there's still electricity, why they started TRYING to make the main guy 'hot' as he got smarter towards the end of the movie, why the only girl aliens in the movie were portrayed as being whores and tramps, why there were so many brawl scenes, why when that guy said 'Watch your tongue' he had a Scottish accent for a minute, why they chose to have the world invaded in 2002 when the movie came out in '01, why that Forrest guy didn't even FLINCH when his hand got blown off, and why in the BLEEDING HELL ANYONE would think this movie is ANYTHING more than the worst movie of this millennium, if not the last as well.

The story is a complete circle with an exciting start, a middle filled with peril and action and a satisfying ending.Fans of Star Wars/Trek/Galactica/Gate are missing out BIG TIME by skipping this just because of religious propaganda and misplaced ignorance perpetuated by the media.",

Often effects and action leaves you alone, sitting on the couch as if there is nothing to relate to. Characters and what happens too them almost leaves you cold and indifferent as if they're just fantasies...the only thing you hope for is that your imagination isn't as sick as the characters in this movie. It is a pity as the basics of this movie, maybe even some of the actors, give a right direction, which in almost every sentence, action, special effect or camera move is blown into pieces. Slow motion action shots, overdone computer graphics, too much make-up (Travolta looks like a misshaped Klingon), bad character building and development, and all the cliche's that could be put into text, graphics and photography make this movie a good example of how things should not be done if you want to tell a sci-fi story. One should at least leave the audience a peg to leave their coats on... one remainder of the real world would have been nice, and i think just one figure to identify with or one character to at least be able to recognize a little isn't too much to ask with this cast. In fact that's the only reason i did not bomb this movie completely. Admiration of people being able to movie at all in these costumes may be called a miracle. No denying there... i didn't envy those actors....not even with the money they get payed to produce this kind of movies...and to see all your efforts gone, blown to pieces in special effects...",

To me, Battlefield Earth is like The Room's sci-fi equivalent, combined with the most ludicrously bad parts of the Star Wars Prequels. The performances and writing are laughably terrible, the characters are all either complete idiots who act like geniuses or have absolutely no development, the plot is just as absurd as you'd expect given the source material, the special effects look like a low-budget YouTube film, and most of the movie is shot like the director had a broken neck and had to tilt the camera to compensate.In short, even though I'm running out of adjectives to describe how bad this film is, I highly recommend.

I do, however, have to argue with and chide those who have related this movie in any way to Scientology. It was not in any way an attempt to brainwash people (what a RIDICULOUS idea, considering brainwashing is a fundamentally wrong thing to scientologists) and, as a scientologist myself, I can ASSURE you that this movie reflects nothing about Scientology. Even the book had nothing to do with Scientology but this movie, this piece of crap that somehow passed as some sort of film is so far from Scientology I almost had to LAUGH when I saw people comparing the two. Just because the book that this movie was (not quite really) based on happened to be written by the founder of the church in no way means there is a relation!!! I would simply appreciate it if people would stop associating the two, it's quite insulting to us.....or at least those of us that actually saw that travesty of film!!!!",

Now this was a long time ago, but I remember being excited at the prospect. Anyway, months and years passed and no films appeared. I guess they got canned by the studios, or it was wishful thinking on someone's part.Anyway, fast forward to this movie and I have to say it isn't really much like the book I remembered. Oh, the basic story is the same, and the character names are identical. But that's about where it ends.The book was entertaining, no-thought required pulp. And the movie is exactly the same.I'd recommend watching this film with a plentiful supply of alcohol and people who enjoy a laugh. Travolta hams it up big time as Terl, the Psychlo security chief. He's by far the most entertaining thing in the picture. As for the rest, they are forgettable.As has been already mentioned, the concept of people learning to fly harriers in a few days is idiotic.

Ron)  Psychlos are an obvious play on psychotic, since all members of the race had implants which made them that way.  John Travolta played Terl just like the character was written.  It was written in the book that Psychlos knew about other elements that we did not know about here on Earth, and their atmosphere was susceptible to catastrophic explosion upon exposure to radiation.  Imagine if you were a fish and someone dropped a couple of grains of potassium in your water - same thing - just a pure chemical reaction.There were some liberties taken with the book, of course.  There had to be - otherwise this would have been about a 9 hour movie.  If you can dig your way through the book, you'll understand the movie more.

Barry Pepper and Forrest Whitaker both have talent, so i can write off their performances as either due to some personal difficulty or just a crappy script. But Travolta takes the cake. Ever since \"Broken Arrow\" (which was pretty good), he's had the idea that the way you play the bad guy is to completely overplay your role. He's so over the top that it's almost sad. I wish he would just give up acting. If he's not playing over teh top bad guy in a poorly written script, he's doing crap like \"Lucky Numbers\".

            "content": "Actually more like a pre-adolescent script from a child whose entire worldview and life experience are based on bad comic books. I wonder if I could have seen the badness on paper, in the script, before the bulk of the $73 million budget was spent. Before looking at the shortcomings of the script and how to fix it, lets look at the other problems that make a bad script into a worse film. Have you seen the fabulous low-budget blaxploitation spoof \"I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka\"? One of the characters dies from Over-Gold, wearing so many gold chains it chokes him dead. This film suffers from Over-Drama. Everyone is trying way too hard. Its like the Prince in Shrek who was overcompensating. Maybe everybody knew how lame this was and just took a handful of Pacino pills and started foaming at the mouth and chewing the carpet. The actors are all over-projecting and it just makes them sound fake. A good sound person could have helped in post-production, but if the actors were instructed to talk like the were around the office water cooler maybe things would not sound so cheezy. Slow motion. Stop. Stop the slow motion. Please. It is not dramatic. It is lame and fake. It blends seamlessly with the fake dialog and just makes the whole movie crappier. This is a story about a slave society revolt. It should look very ordinary and boring and pedestrian. Until the revolt. Then it should get dramatic. Since everything is dramatic, nothing is dramatic. I saw the TV version so it was probably cut down and that can only be an improvement.I think it was \"City of Angels\" where the IMDb reviewer said \"It's as if Ed Wood had 50 million dollars\". I love when the actors go uuhg uuhg uugh. It is both stupid an incongruous. The American people are a wonderful and sophisticated species. There are no common men. Each of us is remarkable for a host of reasons. All of us have a unique and interesting life. I think you could wait outside of any theater in America where this movie has played and ask any American what they thought. The response would be \"Really dumb\". That is what the movie is, and that goes right to the script. That might go right to book, but that does not mean the producers and money-men could not have saved it. Fortunately, the movie is not trying to make an overt religious statement vis-a-vis Scientology. So hopefully John Travolta won't walk off the set when the rewrite hits the desk. The first realization for the producers is that they're making a B-movie and the budget should be 40 million and not 73. That will take out a lot of pretentiousness and Over-Drama. The re-write team needs to study real slave societies and real slave rebellions to at least get some plausibility. There is a structural problem in that you have a really boring slave society followed by a really dramatic revolt, and a movie goer needs a big shot of drama in first ten minutes. So you have to fold the time line, which I hate with a passion, but beggars can't be choosers. Put some dramatic conflict up front. The leader having to choose between saving the pretty girl or helping his friends with the revolution. Get to the brink and then fold back to the beginning and do the boring exposition of the boring slave society. Since the budget has been slashed, all the high-dollar alien costumes and makeup are out. So have the aliens all look like handsome TV newscasters in Armani suits. And get some girl aliens in there, gheeze, just 'cause the book was pre-adolescent boy stuff does not mean we have to be misogynous. The rebels definitely need more gender equality. The woman lead that is imperiled in the beginning has to be hot and competent. Every office in America has at least one hot competent woman, so I think we can work one into our little dystopian epic, OK? For the plot everything needs to be more plausible and then the dialog needs to be the same. A superior alien race is not going to do high-drama things like demand all the gold in 7 days. This is not American Chopper. So they will have reasonable expectations, not the feeling like the script was written by a 12-year-old trying to convey how unreasonable mom is expecting his room to be cleaned in 7 hours.We set the movie up with having the hero have to choose the girl or the rebel friends right in the first ten minutes. That pretty much lays out the whole movie. Now you have simple choices. 1) Hollywood ending: He saves the girl and he saves all his rebel pals. 1a) Hollywood with Oscar: He save the girl, since she is hot and competent she saves the pals and rebellion. 2) London: He saves the girl but all his rebel pals die. The revolution fails. 3) Berlin: He lets the girl die and saves his pals and the revolution. 4) Cannes: The girl dies, the pals die, the revolution fails, and he kills himself.So; a simple $400k B-movie rewrite, take away all the costumes and sets, get the actors to stop shouting every single line, and epoxy the speed setting on the cameras to normal to eliminate all that slo-mo. This was made in 2000, but the swell allegory these days would be to make all the space aliens like our masters at Goldman Sachs looting the economy and the rebels be some combination of far right and far left extremists that systemically hunt down those privileged Yale pricks and exterminate them. One by one. 85 million domestic gross. Guaranteed.Worst line: \"What kind of crap-lousy game are you playing?\" Best effect: I really liked the light stream into his eyes when he was in the alien learning machine.",

            "content": "Based on a portion of the L. Ron Hubbard sci-fi pulp bestseller, BATTLEFIELD EARTH presents the story of earth some one thousand years after it has been colonized by invaders from outer space, who seek to rob the earth of its precious metals. The human race has been almost eliminated: most have been exterminated, a few have been kept for slave labor, and a handful survive in pockets of tribal communities. When one member of a tribal society (Barry Pepper) is captured for slave labor, a combination of circumstance and personal heroism provide him with the opportunity to lead a revolt.All that sounds very well, but there are three things wrong with the movie: John Travolta, the script, and everything else. Travolta's work has always been up and down, sometimes great and sometimes truly dire, but his appearance here as the evil invader Terl is easily the single worst performance he has given in his entire career. No matter how you look at the thing, Travolta is as much like a bad guy from outer space as banana pudding--and really, I do believe that any self-respecting dish of banana pudding could have done a better job.As for the script, it's really one of the strangest things I've ever heard. In scenes with the aliens (called Psychlos), the dialogue actually sounds rather like a bad parody of a Noel Coward drawing-room farce. The dialogue for the humans is equally absurd, playing out like a cross between BRAVEHEART and the more uninspired pages of a Barbara Cartland novel. And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, the plot has zero plausibility--even to the point of insulting viewer intelligence.As for everything else, to give the film its due there are occasional design ideas and shots that seem interesting--but they are buried under a ton of very bad ideas that have been very badly executed. The costume and make-up designs for the Psychlos look rather like bad drag at a leather bar for the fashion-challenged, the lovely braids of our hero and his tribe seem to have been lifted from Malibu Barbie, and all the big-scale special effects are very obviously miniatures.Now, I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'd gouge my eyes out with a kitchen spoon before I'd sit through this debacle again, but I will say this much: someone would have to pay me, and even then I'd demand a remote control with a fast-forward feature. My recommendation? Well, if you're like me and you just have to see the film to find out if it's really as bad every one says it is... go ahead. But for all others, just trust me on this one, okay?

Several other reviewers have drawn comparisons with 'Plan 9', but this is worse. *Spoilers* The plot, such as it is, revolves around a cliched hero in the year 3000, fighting against the rulers of a ruined Earth. These hilarious 'aliens', who look more like some kind of mutated Klingons,  are nine foot tall: achieved by simply putting the actors in big boots with stilts inside ( move over 'Lord of the Rings' and all that scale double/blue-screen/false perspective work, just put the actors on stilts! ). Some of the acting is so OTT, especially by the dread-locked Travolta, head of security for these vertically endowed freaks, that it beggars belief. Only 'Dungeons and Dragons' rivals this for sheer lameness.  See this movie if you only expect an unintentional comedy.

Seven Razzie Awards, where it won in every category nominated, seem to have been well-earned, from the clips shown in this video. John Travolta must have been 'on something', when he did this. His performance is bizarre, to say the least, and perhaps the point he was trying to make, but it annoys in ways that seem unimaginable. The viewer can judge for her/himself.Mr. Stuckman took two days to finish this pile of celluloid dreck. He put it a special category of 'so bad it's good', as it assailed his sense of logic and what makes for a decent movie.

At the time, I was never really all that interested in things like plot holes, logic, or in-depth storytelling; I just wanted to see cheap CGI and random stuff blowing up. So naturally, the film delivered! The older and wiser I get, the more I see how bad the Battlefield Earth film really is. However, I never found it boring; the film has its share of action and spectacle, especially in the last act, which features cool harrier jets flying around shooting things up! The film suffers a little drag in the middle, but otherwise, I always found it fairly engaging.The story is not a bad adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's book, per se. A lot of the film's scenes and concepts are translated effectively from the novel. That being said, the film only covers the first half of the book, and it does muck things up a bit; the film's exposition is scatter-brained, and completely lacking in some areas, making most scenes appear random and lacking in logic. The film never really explains that Psychlo air explodes upon contact with radiation, so the ending doesn't really make sense. The film never explains much about the Psychlo corporate system or their obsession for gold. The film shows a little blip about Jonnie's father, but it serves little purpose. Worst yet, the film takes some really stupid shortcuts: it takes a huge suspension of disbelief when the humans use a flight simulator to become avionic experts. With all the stupid things the humans do to achieve victory, the film makes the Psychlos out to be even more stupid, as they sit back and let themselves be routed.All minor nitpicks aside, the film's story has a good enough structure, but the characters are as shallow as they can be.The filmmakers went really happy with the Dutch camera angles; nearly every shot is angled or tilted in some really funky way. Aside from that, the shots are pretty solid, and editing is okay. Acting is pretty silly: Barry Pepper probably offers the best and most earnest performance here, but can only do so much with what he's given. John Travolta is the big star here, but his performance is infamously cheesy. Writing generally gets the gist of the original novel down, but flounders with the smaller details, rendering the plot rather flimsy and stripping away the power of the dialogue. This production uses some rather cheap sets, props, costumes, and special effects, although at times it doesn't show as badly. I think this film actually has decent designs and a very interesting color scheme, but it also tends to be a bit gaudy at times. Music is not bad.Battlefield Earth is an awesome novel that deserves to be an awesome film. This film gets so much right and so much wrong at the same time; as a fan of the book, and a sci-fi fan in general, I found the film enjoyable enough, and I was hoping for a sequel to tackle the last half of the novel. Obviously, that'll never happen. The best I can hope for now is a remake that could to perfect justice to the story. As it is, this film will suffice as the ultimate guilty pleasure.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Poor)",

            "content": "In all honesty, I expected a lot worse from Battlefield: Earth than what I saw. I had heard universally negative reviews about the film, so I expected it to be bad. However, it was not as bad as some movies I have seen. True, this film is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie, but they way people have criticized it, you would think it was no better than some of the straight to video tripe that surfaces in obscure corners of the local Hollywood Video or Blockbuster. If this movie would have been made for cable, and would have wound up on HBO late one Friday night, I think people would have thought better of it. Instead, it is a bad B movie trying to make it in a summer of many potential A movies. After seeing Gladiator last week, this film reminded me of why Hollywood has gone down hill since the epics of the forties and fifties. However, I don't think it is fair to compare the two. Fans of the book will be inevitably disappointed. I never finished reading the book, but I can tell you that many things had changed from what I saw. I don't expect anyone to be able to take a book like Battlefield: Earth and do the movie justice. It was written on such a huge scale that it would be impossible. The story followed a similar arch, with some of the events being as I remembered them, but they added and changed much. John Travolta did a decent job as the main bad guy, and I had to like his performance. He was so ridiculously over the top that he constantly brought a smile to my face. Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler was a different story. He was excellent in Saving Private Ryan, but made a bad choice for his first major follow-up. The special effects, which have become almost standard in Sci-Fi fare, are not bad, but not the quality of recent big movies like Phantom Menace. And that is not to say that Phantom Menace was good, but it DID have some incredible effects. The fighter combat scenes at the end of the movie were well done and had a few pleasant surprises in them. Of course, special effects should not have to carry a movie on their shoulders (like they did with Phantom Menace, which would have been a really clunker if the effects weren't so good). I would not recommend this movie to the casual viewer, but as a fan of B movies, and cheap sci-fi in particular, I am not disgusted by it. Of course, I was not entertained much by it, either. If you have nothing better to see, and Gladiator is sold out, and you're significant other is at away and you have to see a movie, this will kill time. Who knows, you might find some parts of this movie actually good. I did.",

Why a movie like this would be a classic of the sci-fi movies?For three simple reasons:1) It's fun, witty and also have pure action. I'm from Italy and i assicure that the movies we are shot here in the 80's have the same style of direction of this cult (see the Castellari classic ''I nuovi barbari'' of 1982 if you want an example of sci-fi post-apocalypse movie extravaganza)2) It's John Travolta man!. Remember that young guy of Grease who serenade Olivia Newton-John with a witty and funny serenade that became a cult of the 70's? Well, now that guy is disappear from nothing, and now he's became very serious in this years. He have his funny-serious style of acting, so why the hate on him?3) L. Ron Hubbard was not only the founder of Scientology, but also one of the controversial sci-fi author of all time, in front of Frank Herbert, of course, which with his Dune make a revolution of the sci-fi genre, like Hubbard of course do with this classic.\nNow, after i tell you 3 reasons why this movie is a legendary cult of the sci-fi movies, go watch again this cult and tell me if is good or bad. It's going to be good right? Yes, because your change your point of view on this movie. And this should be the effect of the reading of my defense review of the greatest sci-fi movie out of sight of the cinema, after of course Dune.Now, where's my damned SEQUEL?",

I hated all the characters and didn't care what happened to them. The plot was laugh out loud \"yeah, right\" even by summer movie standards. The dialogue was beyond pointless by same standards. And as one of the reviewers put it, someone had better audit the special effects team to see what happened to all the money. Why? Why was this movie made? Who besides John Travolta thought this movie was a good idea? Maybe this movie got made just to shut him up for awhile. Roger Corman, I mean Christian, would do well to brush this one under the rug.

Pepper has the right look for a swashbuckling hero, but in general, the cast is not well directed. Special effects aren't all that bad, and there is a flying sequence or two right out of \"Star Wars.\" My guess is the director was not really in charge. I think Travolta was. And it shows.

There are so many other movies out there that are much, much worse.As for the cast, well not too shabby, some pretty interesting and fairly good actors here. Like Forest Whitaker and Barry Pepper, and of course, John Travolta (given, in one of his least interesting roles, though).The story might work great on script, but didn't really transfer all that well onto the screen. But it was coherent and pretty straight forward, which is a plus.The effects were alright and the make-up was alright as well.

They aren't like Terl and the companyman in Aliens, \"fucking each over for a percentage.\"The fact is that Mr. Hubbard has pulled no punches and has hit people who are being evil right where they live.

When the movie begins it just starts, and that in the middle of something, with no character presentation or anything who gives the audience any chance to understand who this people that all of a sudden appeared in front of them, are. -and then it goes on like this- things just happens and characters just appears from nowhere, and that until a rebellion all of a sudden begins and the movie mercifully ends. Another thing i wants to mention is the painful, ear killing sound track. Elia Cmiral who did the wonderful music to \"Ronin\", are here involved in an experiment to find out if it is possible that a symphony orchestra can emulate a nuclear weapon. I found it by some reason, impossible to lower the sound on my Tv-set, because every time i did, the sound track added a megaton, went BOOOOM and almost wiped out my living room.

Man has been forced back to the Stone Age, slowly dying out in small, ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods \u2013 a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not 'the worst film of all time\u0099'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms \u2013 something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.The film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn't that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd \u2013 like a Klingon but with more bits! It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fist-ed that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it \u2013 a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.With such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled \u2013 so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just so\u0085obvious and easy \u2013 there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material \u2013 but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.Overall this is a very poor film and, although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination \u2013 a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time.",

I've had it on DVD for ages but not re watched it. Seeing it on TV, probably cut for violence, I really enjoyed it, but.. of course can pick holes in it. Its not a perfect movie. Was it supposed to be? Many ideas nicked from other movies. I'm not going to recheck the years of the movies I recognised in it to see who came first. For any SERIOUS sci fi fan.. the most striking nick was as the 'greener'(?) smashed through the plate glass time and time again.. aha.. Bladrunner? Of course. There were many ideas in this movie but people seem to be more interested in slagging it off than realising. No, the aliens didn't 'think' about what the men ate.. after all that time, apart from that porridge. OF COURSE one wouldn't expect to learn to fly a harrier after a stint in a simulator.. especially if the brain isn't that advanced... BUT THATS THE JOKE.. isn't it? Huh? The Harriers MAY have been more manoeuvrable than the box type alien ships. Yes.. when the dome collapsed finally.. girders, glass... so? Many comments suggesting differences in race.. the Aliens of course thought they were superior.. why shouldn't they.. arrogance, BUT Travoltas Alien... realised this greener was different, realised he could be handy.. and used him. I did recognise Travoltas side kick but so much of it was tongue in cheek.. so.. the people slagging it off.. have either just joined the band waggon.. OR all this went over their heads? How old? Slag off what you don't understand? Happens a lot on this site. Bad effects.. yes, in places. Maybe I'm the age thats thankful for any effects.. I still consider what Kibrick did in 2001 was groundbreaking, because it was. The money spent though. Now computers.. much easier if maybe expensive.. Star Was still infancy effects compared to now which is why Lucas redid them. I'm glad to now get a clear picture on my TV due to satellite.. having had bad terrestrial reception for years. HD? Maybe one day. Many messages in the film.. tag lines.. but sense. OK, ignore all that if you want to slag, but you just show yourselves up. As one comment said, in the cinema, many laughs.. I would have. I did.. in my flat. Well worth watching, I had no idea how it would finish.. so.. superior race thinks it can be the master, but is proved wrong at the end. Due to more thought from what they assumed was a savage man. Doesn't THAT sound familiar? Many films state the same message yet not many seem to get it.. because THEY themselves think they are superior? Thats not a put down, it seems to be a fact. What do under 30's know of film history. Unless they have parents that have enjoyed it. You do know the UK has a Home Office? That amused me. Many things did. Well, I enjoyed it and thought it worked well..",

However, I love b-movies and horror flicks, and I'll even tolerate a little sci-fi if the film has some sort of supernatural twist to it.  So never having been a sci-fi person, whatever compelled me to wanna see Battlefield Earth?  I'll never know.  While this movie took one of the heaviest critical bashings in history, it certainly isn't near as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  While it's true that the thing doesn't flow just right, the editing is a disaster, and the pacing is just off,  I found Battlefield Earth to be a somewhat enjoyable experience. I really dug the sets, the Psychlos were kinda cool looking and the special effects looked good.  I also thought that Travolta was good.  He has taken a ton of grief for playing this part (so willingly at that) but the campiness hit right on target for me.   Again, let me say just how cool I thought the sets were.  True, I hate sci-fi, but they made everything here look really cool.  And yes, this is a junk-movie, pure and simple. \nPerhaps, my biggest complaint would have to be the pacing and some of the camera work.  If the director had left the idea of tilting the camera well enough alone, and gone with the straight-forward approach of \"point and shoot\" he would have been a lot better off.  I just didn't care for the odd angles and the color shadings.  Also, there seems to be a lot missing here. It feels like they pulled an \"All the Pretty Horses\" here and cut away half the film.  Everything just happens way so fast and characters hop-scotch from place to place way too quickly, with little information about their journey.  Other scenes are drawn out way too long and bored me to tears. Also, the whole thing ends way too quickly.  I know, they left it set up for sequels, but after the reputation established here, the film-makers would have to be out of their minds.  I'm sure that in the hands of a more experienced director, Battlefield Earth could have been something really great, but as it is, the film is not a total loss.",

It addresses the idea of earth as a wasteland in a screenplay that goes from bad to worse right up to its ridiculous conclusion where violence solves everything. Idiot plot regards man as an endangered species made slaves to the nine-foot tall Psychos who is the head security adviser wishing to leave Earth but his request is turned down. To get revenge he secretly has human slaves dig mines so that he may possess the gold for himself. Among the slaves is Barry Pepper who was on an expedition from his village before his capture. Horrible directing by Christian with John Travolta delivering one of his worst performances. He even sounds bad delivering dialogue that consists of name calling. Barry Pepper spends much time dangling from Travolta's grasp. Forest Whitaker plays Travolta's henchman and that is about the height of his involvement. Kelly Preston appears in a cameo because when you're married to the film's star then it is only right that you suffer for the same bad career decisions. The production values are well done otherwise the extent of the screenplay seems to be a pointless ugly stupid mess. This film should be tossed in a bomb fire. Score: 2 / 10",

            "content": "I agree completely that this is one of the worst films imaginable: both with the over 20,000 people who rated it so low, numerically; and with the bulk of the verbal reviews that try to warn others away from it.However, I do not think that the lead or supporting actors are to blame. I suspect the formerly Oscar-winning director should also take less blame than the public assigns to him, for this filmic atrocity.Even though I only bought a (used) DVD of this film so I could study a number of films on IMDb's \"Bottom 100\" list, to see what I could learn from films that tens of thousands of people hate ... I still want my two hours back. Stunningly, unbelievably, \"mouth hanging open in shock\" bad! This is the sort of film that you have to watch two really good films immediately afterwards, to counter the emotional assault. And it still leaves a bad taste in your mind, after that.The sheer beginning-to-end consistency of the film lets many of those who have taken the blame in other reviews -- actors, director, etc. -- off of the hook, in my opinion. Here's what I mean: take 100 people off of the street, totally at random. One at a time, give them some lines of bad dialogue to read, out loud. Tape the results, and study how each of those persons delivers those bad lines. What are the odds that all 100 random people would give the exact same STYLE of line reading? Same speed of delivery; same tone; same, same, same, every time. What are the odds they'd all sound stupid, in the exact same way? The odds are probably better that you'll win the Lottery (without buying any tickets) and get hit by part of a visiting comet, in the same day. The fact that all the actors in this thing look and sound like perfect clones of one another is beyond highly suspicious, in my opinion. It tells me to look elsewhere, to assign due blame properly.Take that thought experiment a step farther. Take a quality actor like Forest Whitaker, and recalculate the odds. Here's a person whose past body of work clearly shows that they are more than capable of a wealth of fine, subtly nuanced, always entertaining, sometimes simply wonderful performances. A person who gave decades to study and practice, so that you completely buy into the illusion that this actor is who he or she is pretending to be, within the context of a given story. Or Barry Pepper \u0096 \"Saving Private Ryan\" alone, in my mind, shows that he can act very well; and hold a viewer's attention; and make that viewer care about the character that he's portraying.What are the realistic odds that several trained actors with excellent prior credits, would all act in the EXACT same way? Specifically, that they would all look and sound like a parody of a mentally challenged person who was told to make fun of really, really bad actors. No way! It's beyond any statistical probability. It's simply not possible.Someone with a lot of power -- more power than any director, I'd suspect -- had to be treating this group of actors like mere puppets: telling them what to do; when to do it; and exactly how to do it. A classic case of micro-management, followed by blaming the victims -- who always knew better, but were not allowed to disobey their orders.This person or persons had to be pulling everyone's strings, from just outside of the camera's field of view. I say that because I've been on over fifty sets, as an Extra -- the ideal \"fly on the wall\" situation, for seeing what REALLY happens on movie sets. What I saw, in a lot more cases than the bulk of the public would ever think was possible or likely, was the director or producer simply over-ruling an actor's acting decisions. In too many cases, quite rudely telling them \"No, no; that's wrong: do it this way\" and then demonstrating. I'm talking big stars here, as well as highly respected character actors. It happens.Having seen directors do that, as if it were their sole prerogative, I have to wonder how much influence the financiers had, here? If a person coughs up several million dollars, out of their own pocket, they are going to want creative control. And they'll get it. It's a given; or the film won't get made. I think that's the real problem at work here.In summary: I think this film is an incredibly rare example of \"studio interference\" -- without a studio really being involved. I'm sorry the actors, directors and others took the blame for the final product. I'm sure they expected a lot more creative freedom than they got. I hope their careers will recover. In the end, I'm marginally glad that I studied this bad film \u0085 if only to have a clear warning of unusual dangers related to the creative funding of films no one is in any hurry to make. However, that doesn't mean you should ever watch this film. Do yourself a favor: run away!",

It is a tangle of under-developed plots and situations...and it assumes the viewer has already read the book...a grave fault. The film was made ten or twenty years too late...the plots characters and situations have all been visited before...and in better form in other films. To have a film like this boil down to a matter of who gets the gold and who gets the girl is nearly an automatic cheap shot at the intelligence of the intended viewing audience. People walked out because there was nothing to see that they had not seen before, and there was no incentive to make them stay. Perhaps the main grave flaw of this film is Travolta himself. His imprimateur is all over the film, from production to acting. But, to my view, one of the most fatal flaws of the film is the awful acting of Travolta. I am a Travolta fan, but Travolta simply failed to demonstrate that he had the depth of feeling... the broad spectrum of acting that was needed to pull off his character simply was not present, and support from the cast could not lift him to where he needed to go. He needed to be more oily, more villainous, more focused and more concentrated. I saw none of this in the film. His pitch--tone and timbre--simply did not match up to what was needed in this role, and I suspect his heart was not fully into playing this character. Travolta thought he was a bit old too play the protagonist...I dis-agree. Reversing the roles for Travolta--from villain to hero--could have made all the difference in the world as per the outcome of this very sad sci-fi romp. My suggestions might have done little to save the film...but there were some things he could have done to keep the film from being so bad that even the dogs in the pet shelters wound up panning it. I did not see much that would be suggestive of Scientology to my eyes...they seemed to be playing it \"by the book\"...trying to deliver sci-fi entertainment, not so much \"message\" speak. Though the film was a hard watch for me, it did have--as said before--good production values...but it falls short in continuity, in flow, in ideas...and, most tragically ...in acting. I can recommend this only to those who are sturdy of heart and who can manage to sit through this dreadnought. There are worse films, but though this film was really bad, it does not fully qualify for the \"worst\" film designation...however it does deserve the bad ink it got. Travolta could have done a better job.",

This move has theall the earmarks of project that was made with enthusiasmby people who were blind to how flawed the project fromthe concept stage.Let's talk about the plot for a second. Why would the chief ofalien security train a \"man-animal\" with information thatdetailed? Does Terl not suspect something is up when Johnny somehow mines MINTED BARS out of a mountainside? And the physics of the finale, where a single nuclear weapon destroys an entire planet, is ludicrous. No matter how much the atmosphere of Psychloreacts with \"radioactivity\" there is still a limit to the amountof energy that a nuclear bomb releases. Period.And the acting. Pepper needs to find a character. Travolta isripping off licks from Brian Blessed, but Brian would neverbe in a movie this bad. Whitaker is the only person whostrikes the right tone, but man, he needs a better agent. Ihope he got paid well.And finally, the style. The director of this film has worked onsome good movies (not as a director), and he knows whata good movie looks like, but not why. Roger, dude, you'resupposed to use tilted camera angles for emphasis. Whenevery other shot is tilted, it doesn't mean anything!The debate will rage eternally: Is the worst movie sinceShowgirls? Or is it the worst movie since Ishtar?",

            "content": "This is known as not only as one of the most badly made futuristic science-fiction action adventures, but as one of the biggest box office flops, I had to see why. Basically, it is the year 3000, and Earth has become overrun by the alien race from the planet Psychlo, making the humans an endangered species. The aliens, led by the powerful Terl (Razzie winning and nominated John Travolta), are stripping the Earth of all its natural resources, and the humans seem the only species capable of helping, in slavery. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Razzie winning Barry Pepper) is the only human that seems to want to do something to change the world back to what is supposedly used to be and that everyone left has forgotten. Terl, as human security chief, with deputy Ker (Razzie nominated Forest Whitaker) try to keep an eye on the human slaves, but it is obvious Terl wants to get off the planet with any scheme he can come up with. Tyler and fellow humans manage to go beneath the Earth to find the truth behind the rise of the Psychlos, and he leads his fellow men to fight for their freedom. Also starring Kim Coates as Carlo, Richard Tyson as Robert the Fox, Sabine Karsenti as Chrissie, Michael Byrne as Parson Staffer, Sean Hewitt as Heywood and Razzie winning Kelly Preston as Chirk. The acting ability isn't good enough, and the special effects and make-up look a little cheap, a big waste of millions, I got into it a tiny, apparently it is based on the idea of Scientology, but I certainly wouldn't see it again, it is awful. It won the Razzies for Worst Director for Roger Christian, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him, Worst Screenplay, Worst 'Drama' of Our First 25 Years and Worst Film of the Decade.

Anyone familiar with Scientology knows that they engage in an all out war approach to its critics. If some of the reviews below had been written in a somewhat intelligent manner, this might have been different. But \"best movie ever?\" Being a huge sci-fi fan, and having seen this movie giving it my best intentions, I can truly say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. To say it is the best you simply have to have below par intelligence or be a Scientologist yourself. Given the brainwashing, soul stealing, hypocritical, totalitarian, dishonest, and even homicidal (do an investigation on the web) nature of this cult, it's pretty easy to guess where some of these reviews are coming.",

Humans on earth have somehow been sent back to the tribal ages and are seen as any other animal on earth by the aliens.

The story of an overpowered Earth taking back its freedom was a staple of sci-fi during all those decades. Sci-fi is by nature a genre field of literature, and sci-fi movies are therefore not mainstream movies, either. Scenes and plots that read well because you bring so much of yourself to the reading experience,  often don't translate well to the screen, where you are really watching someone else's interpetation of a story.This is a pretty good attempt to film one of those novels.

            "content": "There are some movies you walk out of thinking, well that could have been better. Sometimes movies are just pretty bad overall. Others are so bad it's funny, like, say, Evil Dead. Battlefield Earth, however, is several steps below them all. There is nothing funny about how bad this movie is. You have to wonder, what were they thinking? How on earth could anyone ever even imagine that this might be even slightly worth making? There is not one redeeming feature in the whole freakin' movie. The dialogue is so incredibly lame, the only time it evoked any emotion in me at all is when I laughed at it. It wasn't the kind of laugh where you go, ha! This is so awful, I love it! It's the kind of laugh where you go, Ha! I'll bet the writers are sleeping in cardboard boxes in some alley somewhere! The movie is really just embarrassing. How could this slip past all the production heads? This movie has nothing going for it. The characters are as cartoonish and one-dimensional as the Road Runner, and their dialogue is about as good; they could have gone through the entire movie saying only \"beep-beep\" and it would have had the same effect. The countless noble self-sacrificing scenes are emotionless and just annoying after a while. The only direction evident is in the awfully consistent scene transitions. The director could have made this entire movie using only his butt and a pencil sharpener. That goes for anyone else involved in this movie as well. Final VerdictCompletely useless. An embarrassment to society. It should be rated U for unwatchable.",

Now that is faint praise, and I wouldnt go further than that.  The acting is overdone, some of it hammy.  But the effects are pretty good, except for the overuse of the tilted camera angles... the storyline no more outrageous than \"V\" of several years ago.The Moral is pretty darn obvious and ending is easily forseen.. but the movie is no dumber than \"Planet of the Apes\".. which remake I just CAN'T wait to see (irony).Watch it if there's nothing else to do, you might like it 4 of 10",

Some people have complained the sequences were stolen shot by shot from far better films, but I can hardly use the word \"stolen\" in good faith. They're just plain pathetic, bearing a closer resemblance to Saturday Night Live than anything approaching Independence Day or Bladerunner. If this weren't enough, the storyline and screenwriting are cataclysmically bad- To get \"leverage\" (repeated relentlessly throughout) the evil Psychlos deviously decide to use their superior technology of video cameras to \"watch the man-animals choose their favorite food..",

Hardly anything has been left out of it and therefore almost half the movie is story building. This was based on the first half of the novel. If a sequel comes out then that will be based on the second half. All I hear from people that see novel adapted films, is that too much was left out. This had everything but for some reason everyone is still complaining. I personally loved Battlefield Earth. It's not for everyone. It's sort of a hard core sci fi fan's movie. Everything that I've ever wanted in a sci fi film is there. The plot is not over explained. Roger Christian (director) gave the audience a little credit when he assumed that we'd understand the storytelling in this movie. Unfortunately not everyone likes a complicated plot. The best way to describe Battlefield Earth would be a Braveheart for the year 3000. The special effects are incredible and the entire look of the movie is spectacular. John Travolta and Barry Pepper steal the years best good guy/bad guy award. As hard as it is to see, you can actually believe that John Travolta is a sadistic alien from another world. I would not recommend this movie to the casual film goer. But if you are a REAL huge sci fi fan then you can not be disappointed. It is an entertaining movie with INTENSE ACTION. Don't let all the bad reviews fool you. Battlefield Earth is a very fun and entertaining movie.",

Independence Day...this is not.Travolta was lost in this part. Or more accurately, he was in his own movie despite the other actors on the set.  The result was an over-the-top comic melodrama, but only on his part.  There he is, half dog half ape. The evil Alien Capitalist Intergallactic Hanseatic League Aspiring Home Office Weasle.  He would be doing Snydley Whiplash, laughter and all, in the middle of a scene with the other actors trying their hardest to 'move the scene along'.  You can just hear the sighs as the board goes 'clack' and someone yells Cut!  I think they were actually expecting some set-hand to run out and slice Travolta's throat for destroying what could have been a decent film.I'm buying this one and placing right up there with Mothra.  I won't even go into the insane technical mistakes other than if you believe a thousand year old Marine jet can fly with no maintenance, and be flown by a savage trained in a simulator, then this is your film.

            "content": "Years after the fall of human civilization, Human Johnnie (Barry Pepper) finds himself an unlikely hero in an uprising against the alien Psychlo race as he leads mankind to take back the planet from Terl (John Travolta).Released in 2000 to abysmal reviews and worse box office, Battlefield Earth was a longtime passion project from Star/Producer John Travolta. The movie is based on the first half of the L. Ron Hubbard science fiction novel of the same name, and was intended to be a massive blockbuster franchise complete with a toyline, sequel and a thirteen episode animated series (the latter two were cancelled). Battlefield Earth ended up being not just a massive embarrassment, but a monumental example in how not to make a blockbuster sci-fi action film.The movie's cast for all the film's faults aren't boring (albeit not exactly good). Barry Pepper brings enthusiasm to the rather flat role of hero Johnnie Goodboy Taylor, and noted character actors Forest Whitaker and Kim Coates are as reliable and effortlessly watchable as ever, but John Travolta as Terl steals the show with an overly hammy performance wherein he over enunciates every other word resulting in a hypnotically strange delivery that can't help but draw you in. The movie is worth watching just for Travolta's weird performance alone.Every other technical aspect and story telling aspect is absolutely awful. The cinematography with its dark murky colors that range from washed out grays to oppressive dark violets and navy blues results in a dreary looking film that is just hideous to look at. The framing of shots with 95% of camera angles being dutch angles feel disorienting and like the movie might fall off the screen. The movie also overuses curtain wipes to the point where most if not all scene transitions are done with them. Director Roger Christian was nominated for an Oscar for Art Director on Alien and WON an Oscar for set decoration on Star Wars: A New Hope so the fact he made a big budget sci-fi film this ugly and this incompetent is simply baffling. The story is also filled with massive holes and contrivances but strangely enough the movie has some dumbness dialed down from the book such as a sequence where Terl mistook Johnnie riding a horse for ONE whole creature as opposed to two separate creatures. Individual story elements were improved upon from the book, but it was essentially putting band-aids on bullet holes as the overall inanity of the source novel was very much kept in tact.Battlefield Earth is an awful movie, but I can't say you shouldn't see it. I myself have seen it five times (yes seriously) and while no one can say its a good movie or even passes the test of basic competence, it's a mesmerizing experience wherein every aspect is done counter to not only basic film-making but also basic common sense. This is a bad movie, but a quotable, memorable, and intriguingly bad movie.",

Battlefield Earth Co Stars Kim Coates, Richard Tyson And Kelly Preston Who's The Real Life Wife To John Travolta Who Her And Travolta Characters Have a One Moment Scene Together. Like i Said Before Battlefield Earth is Alright Movie is Kinda Like Playing a Viedo Game Or Computer Game And Of Course There's The Not So Good CGI Visual And Special Effects Ahead Of it's Time Which To Me it Didn't Look Bad i Mean it's Okay Special And Visual Effects.",

Quite fed up with films that have to explain everything, this film you have to fill the gaps and watch carefully.\nLove the weapons, they can knock someone down as well as kill, if you think of it this way, the aliens may have had a tech that allowed them to travel in space, maybe shared with a neighbouring planet. The mind machine hints to that, they can't learn things well so they use this.\nSo here you have these dumb aliens striping planets of gold, all makes sense to me.\nA few things wrong, like the planes that are 1000 years old but work. Film needs to be 4h long to explain how they spent a year fixing up the planes, but the milenials can't sit and watch a film for that long so they skip a whole chunk out of the potential story line.\nI feel sorry for the people whos' reviews that slate things that only need imagination to get. The nuclear thing is good too, imagine a race that did not discover this, its easy to see how if they were given tech that allowed them to travel to other planets, advantage humans.\nOriginal story, crappy mine, small minded profiteers underestimating what appears to be dumb animals. Love the film, watched it many times. Just watch it and try hard to imagine what could be.Just wish, like every other film no matter how good, a girl that lives off the land in squaller has perfect trimmed eyebrows, lovely skin and luscious hair... All wrong and it's the first thing I see in all movies.",

But how the good does so you will have to watch the film.Since i was a fan of ID4, i enjoyed this film. Some people found the performance of John Travolta to be one of the worst in film history.

Butter would melt would it?But the one thing that makes me almost as angry is when aliens try and invade our planet. Well, I say our planet, but it's mostly America, and normally New York for some reason. But whatever the alien's country of choice, I get pretty riled! Personally, if I were an alien I'd invade Wales.\nIn this film it turns out that aliens have enslaved the whole world. In fact these aliens are like intergalactic globalisationalists who use the people of our defeated planet to mine precious minerals, much like evil capitalists do at this very moment with the third world! All these aliens care about is profit, and they're not afraid to admit it!But guess what? Those anti globalisation protesters are nowhere to be seen? Do they wave placards at the aliens, form sit-ins or deface statues of Winston Churchill? No they don't. Where are they when we really need them? The cowardly soap dodgers are probably working in an intergalactic chain of McDonalds and wearing clothes from Gap! Shame on them!Well it's all left up to this guy called Jonnie to do something about it. Does he stage a demonstration? He certainly doesn't, he uses good old-fashioned violence to prove his point, and give the aliens a right royal kicking! He enlists the help of people who look like they support Spurs to help fight back against the aliens by piloting some Harrier Jump-Jets that he finds. Thankfully, as in \u0091Independence Day' aliens have yet to come up with a space fighter that is a match for our contemporary jet aircraft, and as the RAF will tell you, it only takes a couple of hours in a flight simulator to become a pilot.I don't have a grading system for films about alien invasions, so instead I'll use my aquatic monster/cruise liner catastrophe marking system.Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 gets a reasonable 2 shrimps and a cuttlefish, which ranks it alongside \u0091Casablanca'.",

I was of course tainted with what I have read about this movie over the years but then I saw one article that the production team did not think that this was a bad project and after watching it, I believe that they did set out to make a genuine SciFi movie.The costumes and practical effects looked good. They were not done lazily. It was obvious that the team did their best to create a planet overrun by alien beings.The story had potential and the movie had some good moments and all the actors did what they could with the material.As a huge Barry Pepper fan, this is obviously a lowlight on his portfolio but his performance here still showed how professional an actor he is. I may be biased because I just adore Barry but he did his best with Jonnie and the kind of direction that was given to him.It's an okay movie so I guess the hatred it got was really about John Travolta's ego or believing in this movie to much?",

The movie makes little sense, has plotholes so glaring that only an infant could ignore them. The direction, acting, even the music is banal and boring and not even fun to laugh at. The consensus of critics is that this movie is awful and they're absolutely right. DO NOT waste your money on this whether in theaters or on video. You'll spend your time scratching your head and saying, \"What?\" and \"Excuse me?\" a lot as the film makers ignore logic and any intelligent thought to tell a completely ridiculous storyline. I never read the book and won't now for sure. The only people who could truly enjoy this film are ones who indulge in illegal substances before going to the movies.\nAs one reviewer said, the aliens on the Simpsons, Kodos and Kang seem to be the main inspiration for Travolta's character Terl. He overplays him as a complete idiot who hands victory to the hero on a silver platter. He's supposed to be the Head of Security for the Psyclo's on Earth but isn't bright enough to be Mr. Magoo. If they'd advertised this as HISTORY OF THE WORLD: YEAR 3000, they would have been more accurate and probably made more money than this stupid waste of film. If you must see it, buy tickets for another movie and sneak into B:E rather than pay any money to fools like the ones who made this mess.Dave",

Although being a fan of Sci-Fi, I only find the story so-so, plus I have a feeling that a lot of the points from the book got lost in translation (haven't read it). The sum is a story which is thin like \"butter spread over too much bread\" (or however Bilbo puts it), somehow hollow and fragmental. The plot seems sometimes going too fast and sometimes too slow. The worst thing is the special effects though. It's like these \"Babylon 9\" Star Trek spin-offs (I'm not that into sci-fi!). Some of the locations looks like they're filmed at my local rail-way station. Although steady, the quality of the picture is sometimes handy-camish. The only thing that kept me going through the movie (and kept me from giving it a 1 or 2) was that the acting only sucked a little (I'm a Forest Whitaker fan), some scenes were a little interesting to watch, plus the curiosity of seeing the \"worst movie of the decade\". To sum it up; I think Sci-Fi fans have endured worse moments than this. But maybe the people behind the movie (John Travolta?) should have waited for a bigger budget grant so that it could be made with contemporary effects plus more space for the story to develop in good pace.",

            "content": "I've seen many worse movies that got better reviews by IMDb users. That said, I think the main reason that this movie didn't get the good reviews that it could have gotten was that the script writers didn't follow the book very well. I've read the book several times, and loved it more every time. The same can't be said for repeat viewings of this movie. I applaud John Travolta for his intention to get the book made into a movie, but I feel that more time should have been taken in the scripting before the production started.Some basic corrections:The book is over 1000 pages long. You can't take the middle 300 pages and write the script from that without destroying your audience. The problem is, you're dropping them into the story with no background, and then cutting them off without the ending. Mr. Travolta, you should know better - this is one of the simplest mistakes to avoid. If more time would have been spent developing the Psychlo teaching machine, that would have handled nearly all of the criticism of the humans learning to fly Harrier jets and build bombs so quickly. Also, in the book Johnny had to do a lot of traveling (to other continents) and learn to speak several languages (with the Psychlo teaching machine and archive language tapes) to recruit his rebel force before he could train them. This wasn't covered in the movie at all. So, Mr. Travolta, if you want someone to help with a sequel, perhaps I'm your man. At least I am familiar with the storyline!Finally - people shouldn't be using IMDb movie reviews to beat the soapbox of religion - unless it is an integral plot point of the movie being reviewed. L. Ron Hubbard did start a religion - it is recognized in every court of the land as such (including the Supreme Court of the United States) - but it has nothing to do with this book/movie. Get over it. I have read better than half of the reviews on this movie, and the best that I can say about them is that most were written by illiterate cavemen/women who shouldn't be allowed access to computers! Perhaps that explains why this movie was reviewed so badly - it was over their heads! 7.5/10",

However the all but extinct human race is about to make one last bid for freedom!Based on the novel by scientologist L. Ron Hubbard Battlefield Earth is the critically panned project from John Travolta who had longed to make it & star as the hero Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. The advancing years meant that when finally given the green light he decided to play the evil alien Terl instead. He shouldn't have bothered. Pushing aside the claims that this movie is a recruitment drive for scientology it remains a contender for worst film in cinematic history!With any big Hollywood blockbuster suspension of disbelief is of course normal but even these movies should adhere to their own internal logic. Battlefield Earth has none! How on Earth did gold-loving aliens miss Fort Knox? How do cavemen learn to fly fighterplanes within a week? These are just a couple of the gaping plot holes in an already sparse script. They could be overlooked if the film had good fx, acting & action scenes to cover the flaws but alas it does not. Everything has been seen before & been done better, from the post-apocalyptic ruins of Earth to the spacecraft dogfights. The aliens themselves appear to have stepped out of a 1960s episode of Star Trek with make-up consisting of dreadlocks, joke-shop monster gloves & KISS reject big boots. This is not helped by the laughable panto-style acting & unintentionally hilarious dialogue.The man responsible for this film is Roger Christian. He has previously worked with George Lucas but this film doesn't compare favourably with any of the Lucasfilm output & that includes Howard The Duck!  He has used the familiar wipes from the Star Was films again & again & again. For no visible purpose other than the fact that he can do it. The other remaining trick up his directorial sleeve is an unnecessary & bizarre over-reliance on slo-mo. This may have been used to try & add something to the uninspired action scenes.Overall this is that rare thing, a movie totally devoid of merit!

Yeah, yeah, I know, video release, Blah, blah, but this movie had a pretty large number of detractors even before its release.  Negative rumors and outright lies filled the Internet well before it had even really started production.My review?  Good story, pretty good acting, and an excellent translation of a book I never thought a good movie could be made out of.  I'd give the movie a 7 or 8, but of course, I've actually seen it so I can give it a fair grade.For now on, I want everyone to try and watch movies with an open mind. Don't allow garbage like Mummy Returns to make 70 million in one weekend while good movies like Battlefield Earth, Memento, and Waterworld suffer.And enough with this nonscence about only intelligent people can enjoy this movie, or posting your SAT scores to prove you're intelligent and still hated this movie.  The fact you've taken the SAT means you should (SHOULD) have grown out of these childish arguments.",

John Travolta's pet project Battlefield Earth is an unintentionally funny masterpiece.  It is rolling around in its bloated budget and hammy acting, basking gleefully in its own filth.  The film is based on a bestselling novel from scientologist L. Ron Hubbard.  Being a film student, I watch this film with constant grin on my face as I try to figure out why the cinematography felt it was necessary to shoot the entire film in a canted camera angle.  Granted, that canted shots create mood, but the entire film is slanted.  The chiropractors across America will make the most money from this film, since whoever views Battlefield Earth will receive strong neck discomfort.  A special edition DVD should be released which has a feature that straightens the film horizontally.  This film is not only a $70 million dollar catastrophe, but is so bad that it may become immortalized.  Every bad film will be compared to this film for years to come.  Walking out of this film I was absolutely positive this was the worst film in nearly a decade.  One enjoyable way to watch this film is to take it from a comedic point of view.  Travolta constantly says \"leverage,\" and \"rat-brain.\"  Why?  I don't know, but boy is it funny.",

They should see it not so much because it's uplifting or inspiring, but because it will make all the other movies they've ever seen seem better.  It's kind of like a big summer blockbuster that's all special effects and no content, only without the special effects (ok, the alien ships were kinda neat, I admit it ok, but other than that the effects are pretty unoriginal,...hang on, now that I've said something positive about this movie I need to go take a shower...ok, back).  Of course you've heard most of this before, about how the dialog is poor, the acting is terrible, and the costuming brings out aliens who have apparently advanced in every way but hygiene, but what really astounds me are the plot inconsistencies.  Now, I'm not the kind of person who knit-picks every tiny detail of a movie looking for errors.  I believe that you have to ignore some problems that crop up in the making of a film simply to enjoy the underlying story the movie is trying to tell.  Considering this idea, Battlefield Earth presents two problems: 1.There's no underlying story 2. The mistakes are not just noticeable, they're insultingly prevalent. It's actually pretty amazing what leaps of logic are required to take this movie in at all.  From the fact that both human buildings and the English language have survived remarkably well over 1000 years to the group of machine-less tribal people who learn to pilot one of the most difficult military planes (Harrier Jet) in a matter of days as though it were a \"piece of cake\" (stop . . . think...it's been 1000 years, so how do they know what cake is?) the mistakes in this movie are so abundant that it's really hard to take it all in for one review.  Of course, I've been saying \"this movie\", when I should really say \"these movies.\"  Because, to borrow from MST3K, there are really three.  See, movie \"A\" is about some tribal peoples who live in a big wooden fort up on a mountain somewhere.  Movie \"B\" is about these aliens who conquered Earth.  Finally, movie \"C\" is about a group of humans fighting in a last-ditch effort to save the world (see also: Independence Day . . . no, really, go see it, it's better than Battlefield Earth).  For extra fun, watch how quickly the scenery changes in movie \"C\" \"we're on a plain, I mean a mountain, hey it's snowing!!\"  But, in the end, one aspect of Battlefield Earth really stands out . . . the 117 minute run-time.  I mean, come on, if you can't make a good movie, at least make a short movie.  But ultimately, Battlefield Earth has to be seen to really understand, so just remember: when you see those planes come over that hill, and you start to question how they flew that far in that short a time...it was simple, they just flew through the plot holes.Ok, wait, that didn't quite do it.  See, this movie is bad, it's really bad, it's Mortal Kombat: Annihilation bad, it's Manos: Hands of Fate bad. It's bad on so many levels.  I mean, I can forgive Travolta for believing in Hubbard's phony religion, but starring in his terrible, terrible sci-fi movie, that's just not right.  Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure liking this movie just because Hubbard wrote it pretty much defines \"cult.\"  The only way this movie could ever entertain you is by either making fun of it or counting the number of times they say \"man-animal\" and \"leverage.\"  Ah, ok, I feel better now, thanks.",

Oh, yes, there -is- cheese - plenty of it, in fact. But overall, I've enjoyed less well-made movies. I think the negative expectations on this one was due largely to the negative publicity by anti-Scientology critics, who tore it to shreds simply because it was associated with L. Ron Hubbard. Had it not been for that, I think it would have been much more well-received.Now don't get me wrong - it's far from \"great\" by any means. But while I know this is no huge compliment, I'd say it's better than most flicks put out by SyFy. The visual effects were fairly well-done, too.Damaging to its believability first and foremost is the way that people living at the level of cave-dwelling Neanderthals learn to fly fighter jets in just a few hours - and maneuver like pros. It's also less-than- believable to think that an entire planet could blow up just from exposure to a low-yield nuclear bomb, or that the Psyclon's breath would explode if exposed to radioactivity.So yes, there are definitely absurdities.

It is hard to make a good sci-fi movie, especially when it involves aliens and requires special effects and heavy make-up. Usually one aspect or another of such a movie isn't so great, especially if the move doesn't have a huge budget. I am used to all of this, but I still wasn't prepared for the terribleness that is Battlefield Earth. It's a movie in which everything form acting to plot to editing is really, really bad.Let's take the acting. Seeing the names of John Travolta and Forest Whitaker one would expect to see performances which are at least decent. Here both the actors are terribly overacting their parts and making what was supposed to be big bad aliens look like parodies of the Klingons. I'm not sure whether it was entirely the actors' fault or if the screenplay just didn't give them enough to work with, but seeing such good actors do such poor job is really sad.The plot is similarly bad. The protagonist has no character besides being good. We don't know anything about him and I found it impossible to care about him. The antagonists on the other hand are just evil and driven by greed and cruelty. The plot is not only really generic, but it takes big leaps without stopping to show how the characters feel about the changing circumstances. Even the design of the alien race is lazy and seems to be a rip-off of the Klingons.Special effects in the movie made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. They look like something out of a low-budget television movie and not a production which was released in movie theaters. Or they look like they were made in the 1980s and not in 2000. Either way, they are truly pitiful and make the movie look even more like a parody.Even the editing of the movie is poor. I suppose the cuts between the scenes were meant to be interesting, but they are annoying, especially considering the fact that the same effect is used over and over again until it becomes unbearable. In addition to this, the movie often goes into an inexplicable slow motion, which doesn't seem to serve any purpose at all.To sum up, watching this movie was an ordeal for me, even though I've seen a considerable number of not-so-good science fiction productions and I'm willing to forgive a lot if a movie has anything interesting to offer. I can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Cross my heart and hope to die.",

This entire film seemed like Stock Footage from other films.  It also had a scene that ripped off the Matrix so directly there had better have been some sort of pay-off.      John Travolta's (villain) character was ssooo over the top he might as well have worn a sign that read \"Hi I am EVIL!\"  My friend put it best when he said that the only thing that Travolta did not do was kill a few Kittens. I am surprised that there was not a scene in the film where Travolta's Psychlo character tied a woman to train tracks and stood over her snickering and cackling while pulling on his air hoses like a mustache'!!!  The film was so bad it broke 1/2 way through, and we missed about ten minutes and I got free tickets...I'll go see Gladiator.",

John Travolta's Scientologist beliefs led him to create a crappy movie based on a (slightly less) crappy book.  This could have been at least a decent schlock film, but Travolta had too much reverence for the source to let it get dragged down like that (for those who don't know, L. Ron Hubbard, the author of the novel this movie's based on, is the Scientologist equivalent to Jesus), so it just ends up being a hideously boring experience, and one I'd rather take a bullet to the brain than repeat.

The action is way too confusing at times with no idea of where or what is actually taking place (probably purposely, thinking that the general public likes big explosions and no plot...and if you do, this is your movie!).  It's basically Independence Day with worse acting, a futuristic set, and a really bad pseudo-plot.  The acting was not good...especially John Travolta!  The editing and effects were absolutely stolen from the Star Wars films...complete with sweeping cuts from center to edge of screen.Hardcore sci-fi fans might like it...but I would not recommend it to anyone else.  I gave it 1 of 10, just because there was no zero.  It is not the worst film I have seen (see:  Christmas Evil), but you'd expect a lot more in the decisions of a so-called star.Mr. Travolta...you are actually a good actor, but you've made maybe three good movies in your lifetime...think before you take your next role.

The cinematography is pretty nice. Most of the Visual Effects are good, so are the Sound Effects. The Aliens (the Psychlos, what a stupid name) have cool guns and look rather cool, apart from the way they sometimes have 6 fingers and sometimes only 5. And some of the framing is interesting. The problem with the film is that everything else is bad. All the characters in the film are pathetic and mostly badly acted. I really hate Terl (Travolta). He is such a boring character. Travolta overacts and seems completely unreal. He deserved the Razzie. Johnny, the hero character, is also a bit annoying and I don't like the way all of his friends apart from his stupid woman friend, who should die, die. My favourite character in the film is the Alien from the learning machine, who didn't even get credited. Some of the things people say in this film are just really annoying and stupid. Towards the end of the film Carlo starts saying `Piece a cake' all the time. This becomes a stupid joke. The Humans occasionally make weird monkey like noises, as if they had evolved into apes or something. And the Psychlos are always laughing and it's not even real laughing. It's just `Hahahaha. Haha.' laughing. After seeing this film three times, there are still some things I don't understand (Who is the guy with the weird neck supposed to be?). I think some stuff probably isn't explained in the film. Maybe it was edited out. Speaking of editing, the Star Wars style transition effects between some scenes are really unnecessary. I give this film 2 out of 5. Although it has many flaws, it is actually quite entertaining. I've seen it three times now.",

If you are not a fan of John Travolta do not go see this movie as his face is seen every other minute.The book spans 3+ years and the movie zips through a series of events that took a year in the book.  The book explains that after 1000 years equipment such as cars, tanks, and planes will turn to rust.  This is a very good assumption.  But not according to the movie it seems that Harriers somehow managed to survive this time span intact.  In the book as well as the movie there is an alien learning machine that can fill the users mind of knowledge in minutes that would normally take years.  But trying to compare a Harrier flight simulator to one of these is not going to cut the cheese but yet it is still full of hot air.  Training to fly a Harrier should at least take months of training for a technology literate man, yet the movie leads us to believe that a regressed man with no technology base, no alien learning machine, and with seven days to train can learn to fly, and excellent flying at that.Needless to say that the charactor development in this movie was lacking.The special effects, acting abilities, and action were all good. That is the only good thing that I have to good to say about it.If I had not read the book, I might have been able to halfway enjoy myself.To sum things up.  Given all the raw materials for a great movie, story, actors, special effects, director, and budget.  Why did they have to butcher the book so much is beyond me.5 out of 10 if I had not read the book but 3 out of 10 after reading the book.",

            "content": "I watched this on the 'small screen' off of DVD.How can you make an 'original' film in a genre nearly wiped out from the abuse of the numerous attempts? Well, they tried - sort of.Some wipes/dissolves reminded me of Star Wars. Some costuming and creature effects reminded me of Babylon 5 and a few others. And, yes, there was a lot of nice scenery/sets. But I shouldn't really be distracted by being reminded of other movies while watching this one.The plot had big problems with believability. Are we supposed to believe a broken, isolated, struggling tribe of earthlings, who are fixated on producing their next meal, somehow produces the human race's ace-in-the-hole? How about that these technologically challenged people with a mystic-based philosophy (they don't even know how to read a map or a book!) learn to use advanced laser weapons, fly alien craft (not to mention Harriers), and, in 14 days, learn enough about nuclear weapons, radiation, the atmosphere, and explosives to enact a plan to save the Earth from the aliens. Of course, that was after they all agreed to fight to the death to support a cause/plan they didn't and couldn't socially or technologically understand.WHEW!And now more bad news: the special effects had flaws. There were numerous scenes with obviously implanted CG. The CG was often unrealistic, especially when handling movement of characters/objects. There were a lot of effects in the film, but the level of quality was a couple of notches too low, especially for a production this big.I enjoyed, overall, Travolta's and Pepper's performances. Pepper's charisma really drove the movie. You wondered how far his character was going to make it, skirting death the whole way. Whitaker (miscast?) didn't inspire me, nor did most of the others.Some of the subplots involving Terl's career were worthy of a quick mention in that they helped keep the story interesting and layered.\"The Making Of\" on the DVD was mostly boring. They briefly showed how they built and crushed the city (near the end of the film) which was nice. I guess the people involved were way more interested in the movie than I was. According to them, this rivalled Star Wars. I think not.CONCLUSION: I would watch this movie again, but not without reduced expectations. I enjoyed it even though I struggled with plot believeability and cringed at some of the special effects. I remember thinking \"Independence Day + The White Mountains = Battlefield Earth\".",

            "content": "Battlefield Earth was the most predictable, frustrating, and illogical movie of the year.  It had loose plotlines, symbols which the director forgets to make important, and worst of all, it was the most unrealistic scifi movie I have ever seen.  Needless to say, it was a 120 minute countdown until the final curtain was finally drawn.The symbols shown throughout the movie are bizarre, and they don't really ever show up again.  I won't go through them to spoil the actual story, but if you see something early in the movie that you may think is important to the plot, don't worry, it won't be.  You can usually completely forget the scene you just saw, because it doesn't really have any bearing on the rest of the movie.On the level of pure scifi, it was an even worse movie.  One of the great ideas behind Star Trek is the believability of the technology.  Even if we cannot build a transporter or a teleporting pad, we the audience have an idea of how they work.  This is one of the great strengths of star trek, it's accessibility.  Battlefield Earth throws out many fancy gadgets, but tells you nothing about them, or it shows many other items which have been lying around for about 1000 years, and they still have power.  The logistics of the movie are very poor to say the least.  1000 years is a long time for equipment to sit, some cars can't sit a week without running, or else they will die.So, if you're looking for a good time, go else where, if you're looking for action, go elsewhere, and if you're looking for integrity and acting, you'll really want to avoid this one.(ps.  count the number of times the word \"leverage is used, or the number of times the main character is choked.......goodness guys, c'mon, be kinda original...)",

            "content": "I knew things were serious right away when I learned during the title sequence that the name of the movie isn't even \"Battlefield Earth\". That's only an abbreviation used by haters and naysayers. Its true full name is the much more appropriate, \"Battlefield Earth: The Saga of the Year 3000\". Immediately after that bombshell drops in the title screen and some epic bombastic music, the shocking subtitle appears: \"MAN IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES\". Whoa. That is serious. I did not sign up for this.A quick summary gets us oriented: An evil gold-loving alien race known as \"Psychlos\" (from the planet Psychlo) subjugated Earth in a nine- minute invasion back in the early 2000's and have been mining the land for precious metals ever since. Humanity, broken and enslaved, reverted to a caveman lifestyle over the ensuing millennium. Known colloquially by the Psychlos as \"man-animals\" and \"rat-brains\", humans are considered to be sheep-like in both their behavior and intelligence. Head Psychlo commander Terl (Travolta) fancies himself a brilliant strategic mind destined for great things but underutilized and disgraced by his position on the detestable planet. He is assisted by a lazy-eyed lieutenant played by Forest Whitaker, who in makeup in this film looks very much like the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz.Psychlos have giant heads and dreadlocks. They are bigger than humans, an effect achieved by having the actors wear stilts and giant platform boots. As a result, all the actors shuffle around awkwardly as though they have a dump in their pants. Either that, or Psychlos as a race actually have trouble with pooping themselves. If that's the case, I take back my criticism, but incontinence wasn't addressed in the film. Psychlos also have large, ill-fitting rubber hands. Terl, for reasons unexplained, actually has six big rubber fingers on his right hand. (I guess it might be a \"Princess Bride\" reference).The future humans also have dreadlocks. Most of them also have dirty faces, except for the love-interest girl. She has Clearasil skin and L'oreal makeup. The hero, \"Jonnie Goodboy Tyler\" (Barry Pepper), is known as a \"greener\" (as in \"the grass is always\u0085\" get it? It's subtle) because he is an optimist and a modern-day Moses hoping to deliver humanity from bondage. We know he is both a hero and a bad boy because he rides his horse in slow motion. This movie is literally all jacked up. Every single shot is at an angle. In the making-of featurette the cinematographer, in praising his work, said, \"If we found a shot that was straight-on, we threw it out.\" He also threw out any shots that had good acting, dialog or logical plot developments. Not to be outdone, the editors added slow motion at random and dug deep into the Powerpoint transition toolbox to blend awkwardly from one scene to the next with 70's era wipe fades. Anyway, Jonnie gets himself captured and taken to the main Psychlo processing facility. Seeing that Jonnie's a dangerous human, Terl decides to hook him up to a knowledge machine and teach him everything in the universe so Jonnie can mine gold for him. Because that makes sense. In one of my favorite scenes, Terl takes Jonnie to a devastated library. He says, \"You can look at whatever you want because there's nothing here that will help you.\" Evil laugh. Jonnie randomly selects and reads a perfectly-preserved 1,000-plus year old pristine copy of the Declaration of Independence. Single tear. Let's take a brief detour to define John Travolta's two acting methods in this film: 1) Talking through clenched teeth, and 2) speaking in a loud colonial British accent and laughing maniacally. That's it. Detour over. Terl's primary motivation is to have Jonnie lead a group of humans to a vein of gold in the mountains near Aspen. There, the revolutionary-Terl- enhanced-smartest-man-animal-on-the-planet Jonnie is to be left unsupervised with a human crew for 14 days to mine gold. Jonnie learned how to fly the Psychlo ships during his knowledge-machine session, so they leave him some ships, too. What could possibly go wrong? I guess in Terl's defense: Probably not a whole lot could actually go wrong in two weeks. Maybe some of them would run off into the woods. Two weeks isn't a very long time to mount much of a resistance (it took me more than three weeks to paint one room in my house), and the Psychlos destroyed most of the human race in nine minutes, so I get why he wasn't too concerned. What he didn't realize, though, was that in two weeks Jonnie was able to do the following: \u0095 Using an old one-page map of the entire United States, fly from Colorado to Washington D.C. to look around a bit. \u0095 Fly from DC to Ft. Hood, Texas, finding a secret bunker filled with fully-functional, armed and fueled 1,000 year old Harrier jets and a flight training simulator. The other cavemen, who previously only had experience riding slow-motion horses, quickly learn how to pilot these jet fighters in a couple days. Just like real life. \u0095 Find and arm a nuclear warhead. \u0095Again using his advanced navigation technology known as \"flying over the country and looking around\", Jonnie and his caveman crew find Fort Knox and load up the gold so Terl won't realize they've been using their borrowed spaceship to sightsee for two weeks instead of mining gold. Jonnie and the Cavemen use their newfound Air Force and nuclear arsenal to destroy the alien spaceships in a super-weak air battle and blow up the entire planet Psychlo, respectively. The end.In summary, while I do not recommend you watch this movie ever, I do highly recommend that you get the DVD to watch the making-of featurette because everybody they interview is convinced, CONVINCED, that this is the best movie ever made.",

What I would like to say is that this is not the worst film of all time. It is not even nearly the worst film of all time. Comparing this film to the likes of Plan 9 From Outer Space,  The Creeping Terror and Santa Claus versus The Martians makes it look like a masterpiece.The badness of this film works on another level. The problem is that this film obviously had a huge budget thrown at it. It had (some) excellent actors. Although this film is undoubtedly better than a hell of a lot of low-budget tripe, it is hilariously incomprehensible how with such money and talent somebody came up with this pile of decomposing tortoise guts. This film got a major cinema release for pity's sake! That is why this film is so entertaining. It just transcends the plane of ordinary mainstream suckitude. I've seen enough bad movies in my time and often enjoy them because they're so bad, but this is a bad movie with class! The Rolls Royce of bad movies, if you will. Anyway, if you've not seen this film, go and watch it! It is truly a remarkable and landmark achievement in movie history.",

This is understandable, as it is hard to compile a complex book of 400 to 1000 pages into a movie length that modern audiences will sit through and theaters will show. However, Battlefield Earth has reached a new low.The first time I saw this movie, in the theater in 2000, I fell asleep about 30-45 minutes into it and didn't wake up until the credits. What I saw of the movie was bad, but I felt that it might pick up.I was sooooooo wrong.When I (finally) rented it on DVD, I was appalled. The only thing this movie and the book had in common were the names of some of the main characters and the title. Everything else had been (badly) adapted for the screen. Half of the greatness of the book was exploring not just the conflict on Earth, but of the politics that a newly freed Earth is subjected to. That aspect is completely missing from the film.This was maybe the most wasted 2 hours I have ever experienced.",

The only feeling I got was that I had somehow irretrievably lost 2 hours of my life while trying to be either amazed or entertained.  So let's go over some of the obvious points:Character Identification:  The hero had the approximate personality of a brick wall, or Lawrence Welk--i.e. none.  The characters all practically define the term \"one-dimensional.\"  Quite frankly, they all could have died, and I could have cared less.  And if they died in some unusual and twisted manner, which unfortunately they didn't, I would have laughed because I was that apathetic about them.Plot:  It's your basic rebellion story served up again.  Neglecting the gaping holes other users have mentioned, it still is nothing new or significant.Dialogue and Acting: Dreadful.  Given that the character concepts were so cheap, the actors didn't have much to work with, but they still managed to fall short of the mark set for them.  Travolta particularly annoyed the hell out of me with his \"evil\" portrayal.To the people who liked this movie, all I can say is, \"silly man-animals.\"",

John Travolta, having come back from the dead in Pulp Fiction, chose to return there with this ill-advised career move. All that Scientology must have curdled his brain. Good science fiction is measured by its degree of scientific plausibility. The plausibility co-ordinates of BE are several million integers into the negative section of the graph. SPOILER. I particularly like the ludicrous ending, where a WWII fighter plane is flown through space, and manages to destroy the enemy planet which - get this - has an explosive atmosphere.

You can't replicate them (Mars Attacks and the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra went close) but you can enjoy them on a comical level. This movie costing millions and millions must now be christened the grand daddy of bad cinema. Plan 9 From Outer Space cannot begin to compete with this movie.It had it all cameras on tilts, weird colour filters, silly acting, hammy acting, bad sets, illogical sets, ridiculous costumes, insane plot and almost worst of all a scientology sub text. That's a home run when it comes to bad movies, Ed Wood had every one of those but he had a cast and crew full of heroin addicts, and the movie was funded by fundamentalist Christians.What excuse has this movie got? It was directed by George Lucas' right hand man (hence all those tacky transitions), production design by the man who designed Independence day, starring the guy from Pulp Fiction, the guy from Ghost Dog and the guy from 25th Hour. The cinematographer also worked on Swim Fan. And most importantly the book was written by L Ron Hubbard, the creator of the cult Scientology, surely with that sort of creative team this move could have least been OK.Sadly this is not the case.This movie has significant problems in every department, firstly the acting.Barry Pepper shows the same emotion when is horse is killed as he did for his dearly departed father, and that emotion is hammy acting. Most of the movie he winces like someone has stolen his marbles. John Travolta looks as if he was auditioning for the cowardly lion, it is hard to take his character seriously as he prances around with extravagant hand gestures. As for every other actor in this movie, you were OK, but not good, take this off your resume and have a good day.The Script. Well with dialogue and a plot straight from 1950's sci fi this movie was off to a bad start before filming. Any first year film student could rewrite this movie and take out all the leverages and man-animal lines, that are peppered every 10th sentence. The writers of this are not world renowned writers and never shall be. I know the book was bad, but surely it could have been better than this.The direction. If I think really hard the only thing I can think of that the director did right was casting. Forrest Whittaker and Barry Pepper, both fine actors, but the craptastic nature of this film ruined them. There was nothing this movie did that made sense, why tell us they are in Denver, who cares, they could be in outta space for all it matters. I know john Travolta put a lot of pressure on this Roger Christian but damn man this is your career we are talking about, you have to put your name on this.The Producers. Bad sets, Bad acting, Bad Directing, Bad Camera-work, Bad Screenplay and bad pretty much everything else. You have to wonder whether the producers were on set for any of this. I mean this is dribble and how did the producers expect to sell this, its unwatchable to anyone except people who like bad cinema. All the producers can do is hold it till L Ron or John dies and try and market it as the worst movie ever made.The Plot. So many holes, so little time, firstly why is it they say dog, but then man-animal. Secondly how does one wipe out all armies in 9 minutes, then lose to a bunch of cave dwellers. Thirdly, how do said cave dwellers teach themselves to fly jet planes in only a few hours, and what powers the flight simulator? Fourthly, why does the hero not shoot all the Psychlos when he has the gun? Fifthly Psychlos? Sixthly John Travolta? Lastly, but definitely not least, L Ron Hubbard. You sir should be ashamed of yourself. Sure you invented a cult that millions around the world are members of, sure you are rich because of it, but mate, why waste 78 million dollars on this, a remake of your book, a book that doesn't make sense as well. Please just leave this planet and take all your thetans with you. We will try and get through life without you.Finally I must make mention of the fact that this movie is essentially just L Ron Hubbard helping us poor un-enlightened people understand that Scientology is the answer. That is what the hero does, he is more intelligent so he teaches everyone that there beliefs are stupid and they should trust him. Although in the movie he doesn't ask for cash, like the Scientologists do.",

But if the story (I'm playing armchair director here) had been carefully constructed and allowed to take its time - like a low budget mini-series on the sci-fi channel - it might have been worthwhile.The book is not very deep (and despite its connection to Scientology, devoid of any real strong philosophy). The story is like a science fiction Horatio Alger story. Like the movie, Tyler - the main character - comes from a village that has lost most of its knowledge of civilization - to the point where the villagers don't even understand how livingnear radiation is causing birth defects among them. He also finds a quarter in the dirt and doesn't understand that it was a type of currency.From this level of ignorance, he's able to learn about his alien enemies' language and technologies while he's their prisoner. Then, when he's able to escape, he's able to find and to bring together human allies from diverse cultures (Asian, Scottish, etc.) that were thought to be extinct (it's like the \"working together against an alien oppressor\" idea that Independence Day briefly touches on). From there he's able to bring real opposition to the aliens and even gain a position in a type of intergalactic government with other peaceful aliens.All that's lost in the movie in order to make the story fit two hours. Much of the book gets long with the problems - one after another - that the humans must explore and solve as well as the various skirmishes they have to fight. But that continual progression and process from nothing to something - even though it's sometimes slow - is what makes the story interesting.We'd have to really get to know a main character who has ingenuity and passion, often when he's working with no resources - and we're not allowed that in the film.And making the aliens look too human really hurts the plot. In the book, they're basically monsters - that, while intelligent - have a sociopathic Nazi or fascist mentality. They look at humans as animals that are for their purposes better off dead, they can't stand the earth (or it's blue sky) and want the planet for its minerals.I understand that creating such creatures would have been much more complicated than actors in makeup. And the movie makers might have been worried that an audience would tune out if they had watched scenes of dialogue between inhuman creatures (especially if it was difficult to make those aliens expressive). But if the aliens look too human, we start to identify with them too much and maybe expect the two races to establish some connection.Though humans in real life are capable of horrible things, this story wants to believe that we're basically good (especially if we're the underdogs). It works best for this plot if our negative traits are projected onto a narcissistic enemy that looks nothing like us. Then it's easier to understand how they can be so mentally removed from us, and how they don't understand why they should even let our species live if we pose an obstacle to their imperial aims.",

I think I would've felt more inclined to take it seriously if the scene transitions alone would've been better, but alas!On serious notes, one of the biggest things holding this movie back was that characters constantly felt the need to tell you what was going on instead of letting you come to that conclusion on your own. It's annoying when characters in movies unnecessarily narrate their actions and explain their motives because people don't just do that in real life. There's more subtlety.\nAdditionally, all of the action sequences are quick-cut, nonsensical messes.

It seemed mildly interesting, so I watched it.WORST MISTAKE EVER.First, I was so confused to the point I didn't even learn the characters names. I had to go on Wikipedia afterwards to figure that out. The acting was atrocious, and I sat through every single episode of Cavemen. I'm a bit of a Trekkie, I admit it, and I swear the makeup makes them all look like Klingons from that one Enterprise episode where there was a disease etc! I half expected Michael Dorn to walk out! Now, I think maybe three years after watching it, its awfulness still haunts me. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I waste of my time.DON'T EVEN WATCH IT TO MAKE FUN OF IT'S HORRENDOUSNESS. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.",

The movie was pretty faithful to the book and Pepper was ideal as the hero.  As I read the book I visualized what I was reading.  I wondered what the  movie would be like and to tell the truth, the movie was different, but then I am not the director and I looked at the movie through his eyes and I liked that. The Psychlos were bad, the heroes were good and the action had my attention throughout.  Hours after the movie is over I am still thinking about it, and to me, that is a good sign. dougers-2",

But back then the spin-off book factory we know and love nowadays had not been created so after reading Star Wars & The Empire Strikes Back I fell into a Sci-Fi Desert!!!!Then on one visit to the Big Smoke (London - village to none Brits) I saw an advert for Battlefield Earth, advertised as the \"Best thing since Star Wars\". I duly bought the book and was blown away by the 1000+ page story.So imagine my delight when through the Movie grapevine comes the news that one of my favourite Sci-Fi books is being brought to the screen! OK, the first hurdle was John Travola but hey, Tom Cruise wasn't exactly everyone's first choice as Lestat and on the whole that turned out OK (Even Anne liked him!)But by now the rot had set it, this was not going to be a glorious masterpiece of Sci-Fi history to rank along side Stars Wars (just the first three films mind you), The Matrix, 2001, ID4 (well each to their own). Instead this was an embarrassment, a shame, a humiliation.Instead of this book living on in fans minds as the greatest film never made, we were presented with a half cocked, half hearted, half film. The acting - bad, the CGI - bad, the editing - bad, the whole idea - bad.Other reviewers more verbose than I will outline all the specific issues and will advise you the same as I to avoid this film at all costs.",

The effects were as stunning as we've grown to expect from sci-fi lately. Travolta was as gleefully evil as the novel had his character.  Everything was up to par as far as the movie was concerned.But maybe that's the problem.We've seen evil before so no big deal.  We've seen fighters vs. alien ships before, no big deal.  We've seen the planet devastated and the cities in ruin before.  Same old, same old.The movie's flaws were the same as the book:  One thousand years would cause more damage to the earth than was shown.  Rubber degrades in just a few years, fuel evaporates, batteries would no longer even be able to hold a charge.  Even nuclear warheads have a shelf life much less than a millennium.Also there's a problem of language.  When isolated, language changes. Right here in America, we have several different dialects after a few hundred years and we're in constant contact with each other.  After a thousand years no one would still speak english well enough to read the Declaration of Independence yet Johnny can talk to every human he meets.I'll never understand how anyone can see a 1050 page novel and believe they can tell the story in a movie.  They would have been better to have made a TV mini-series.  But the movie as a movie, wait for it to come out on video.",

I must reiterate, however, to drive home the point: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  Or, if you must, buy a ticket for an actually worthy movie and theater hop, don't reward the people who put out this wretched abomination with your money.  I was a fortunate one, one of my friends paid for the ticket, not me.  And if he thinks he's ever getting his money from me, he's got another thing coming.  However, I will never get back the precious, wasted hours of my life.  Save yourselves!  At many points, I must wonder whether the script was in fact the fault of Hubbard or a five-year old child.  One or the other thought that it would be really cool to have a bunch of stone-using tribesmen zoom around in Harriers. But wait, not only are the tribesmen able to restore thousand-year-old fighters, fuel and arm them in a magical military base that still has power after those thousand years, they can also talk to each other without any headsets or other radio equipment while flying around!  Psychic tribesmen!  Who, after that thousand years, know phrases like, \"Piece of cake\" and, \"I'm on his tail\".But even if the screenplay was written by this hypothetical child, Hubbard is still responsible for the \"hero\", Johnny Goodboy.  Who the hell names a character Johnny Goodboy?  And why does he have no personality at all?  I mean, none!  He strives to emulate Braveheart with little, failed attempts at rousing speeches, but they come across as flat and pathetic as the rest of the acting.  The Psyclos aren't nearly as intimidating as they should be, just how much can the audience fear an ultimate enemy that you could defeat with an egg in a jar with an opening too small to fit their fist through? On top of that, they still manage to trust the Terl guy despite the fact that he goes out of his way to screw over everyone he passes by.  You could easily cause a Psyclo to have a seizure just by asking, \"No means yes and yes means no, do you want me to hit you?\"In any event, if you think that a galvanic skin tester can cure your spiritual ills and that giving $400,000 to become an Operant Theta VIII is a good idea, then run to see this movie!  If you are not yet in the clutches of Hubbard's happy family, then avoid it at all costs.  I'm convinced it's a Scientology plot to numb the brains of the viewers so much that their warped technobabble makes sense in comparison.",

On the cover of the book was \"Soon to be a Major Motion Picture\",  I've been waiting since then, and I am definitely disappointed.  After reading the book, a trilogy or mini-series would be needed to tell the whole story, so I had my doubts when I heard a movie was finally coming out.The one thing that I disliked the most about this movie, was John Travolta's acting.  I like John Travolta, he's had some great roles, but he tries to pull off the \"Jack Nicholson's Joker\", the bad guy that steals the show. Why does he slip into a British/Scottish accent? Maybe since the entire story line of the Scots was taken out?The time-line was way too rushed, the book takes months to develop the story, the movie a couple weeks.The camera work will be an excellent example of how not to film a movie.The score was so overbearing!  The theatre we went to had the volume cranked, I usually like this, but the score tried to be so grand, it was almost laughable.There's so much more I could list.Read the book, and see how important some of Terl's actions are (leverage!), and share in the Psychlo's fears of the \"home office\".

A long time later we have lost our society, skills and most people with the remainder slaves. The baddies are greedy and self centred and everything else that is considered poor in human kind. Anyway because of their greed they re-train a human, with their advanced technologies, to learn skills to operate independently from them to obtain gold in a radio-active zone (somehow they cannot cope with any level of radiation and have not figured banks are full of it). This eventually leads to their downfall after he figures how train to fly helicopter gunships and fighter planes that are about a thousand years old and teaches his mates the same skills.Not a great film. But then it does not deserve the relentless criticism. It is just clumsy and fails to really run anywhere. Its nearly a morality tale but that's too much credit.It is somewhat allegorical in the way religiously derived films intend to be. The short comings in the plot are not that important and really no different to Moses opening up the Red Sea in the Ten Commandments. Very loosely, it has a backward go at psychiatry (Scientology link from the author and source material) and promotes learning and training as the road to a equality along with trust and comradeship and a sexy woman.About the characters and general criticism. The Psychlos are an abstract factor which we could refer to in our society as the infamous Big Brother or International Corporations running wild. The human characters have to appear as they do so we can relate to them (no point in seeing futuristic cavemen). The Psychlos are ultimately back stabbing and self indulgent with little interest in human ideals such as common goals and even trust. An underlying philosophy is that of control (leverage), one element of the writings that this is derived from.What happens is the humans eventually bond together and compete (fight back against the bad guys) to achieve a common future with benefit for all mankind (or what's left of it).But they also use nuclear weapons (an apparent evil) and are ultimately protected by radioactivity and then gold (the basis of our monetarist ways) is the key to their rise. Elements of our current society that are so often criticised by those on the outside.After seeing this for the second time all (most) the way through I am beginning to warm to it. Yes it's poor but it also has some symbolism and is not that much worse than many other films I have seen.",

The scene about humans liking rats as their favorite food stands out. It is especially enjoyable after hearing Scientologists brag about how aware and cosmic conscious they are. This movie makes about as much sense as Dianetics. There are so many inconsistencies it boggles the mind.

Killer Klowns cost only two-million dollars to make, \"Battlefield Earth\" could have done so and it be just as such-- no one would notice, nor care.I'm not going to clarify why this movie isn't just another stinker, and an unintentional comedy-- 1,200 people have already stated why.This isn't the worst movie of all time, but it's certainly one of the worst.

            "content": "To summarize: It is the year 3000. Earth has been conquered by the Psychlos, a race of arrogant miners. Mankind has been reduced to a few remaining barbaric tribes who are nearing extinction. What ensues is mankind's last fight to free Earth from tyranny.I read the book about four years ago, and it was one of the best stories I have ever read. Now, I realize that any movie adapted from a novel is not going to be able to incorporate EVERYTHING from the book it comes from, I still missed some things that were in the book. However, that doesn't mean the movie story is bad.Acting was a mixed bag somewhat. Though I felt the problem was a little more the screenplay than the actors themselves. Travolta is good as Terl, the Psychlo security chief(though I could have done without the accent, which seemed to come and go). Some might see him as incredibly stupid to overlook some thing which goes on with humans. You have to realize something, Psychlos, and Terl in particular, are so arrogant in thier alleged superiority to humans they don't consider humans to be intelligent, let alone sentient. Whitaker I thought did a commendable job as Ker. The part is written differently than in the book, where Ker is a midget Psychlo outcast, but Forrest makes Ker work in his role as Terl's lackey. Pepper has his moments as Jonnie, though I couldn't quite entirely get behind him as the hero. again, though I think it's more the screenplay than the actor's ability. Kim Coates was interesting as Carlo. I'm dissapointed that they turn one of the more interesting characters in the novel, Robert the Fox, into a painted, spear throwing tribal leader.Special effects were excellent, though I thought some of the battle scenes were a bit too dark to really see the action.Directing was............well, lets just say Roger Christian does an excellent job of being George Lucas Jr. Though I guess I can't really blame the guy, you could pick worse directors to emulate.The story was basically good, and keeps the main points of the book, and is entertaining. but it doesn't quite allow you to suspend belief enough to go along readily with the notion that Harrier jets have managed to survive 1000 years intact. But hey,this wouldn't be the first movie in the world with plot holes.To sum it up, this was a good movie. Not great, but good. It's one you should check out at least once.",

The first half of the book takes place in a period of 1 1/2 year (enough to actually learn the stuff Johnny learns), instead of about 3 weeks in the movie. They do not raid Fort Knox in the book. And they don't find fighter jets in working conditions with simulators. They also recruit people from all over the world, instead of the \"America IS the world\" type of patriotism of the movie that is getting really, really boring.There has been wildly different numbers thrown around about how much money was poured into this movie, but $80 millions seems to be a good average. I don't know how Travolta was able to pull off getting financing for it (certainly, he didn't show the script) but I do hope, truly truly hope this movie will become one of the worst cash losers of all time. I am insulted and feel robbed that I paid money to see this.Any studio/director/actor with a fraction of an ounce of honesty and integrity would have trashed the movie instead of trying to steal the hard earned money of the population by releasing it.",

            "content": "The movie based of the 1982 C.Ron Hobbard Scientology novel \"Battlefield Earth\" has to do with the aftermath of an alien invasion of the earth in which almost the entire human race was wiped out. Those humans still alive some 1,000 years after D-Day, when the invading Psychols defeated all the armies on earth back in the year 2000, are living in more or less cave man times being hunted down by the evil Psychols to do manual labor in their coal and gold mines.Jonnie, Barry Pepper, living in the caves with his fellow surviving humans in the Colorado Rockies decides to take off for civilization in the nearby destroyed city of Denver with him not knowing what's in store for him and his fellow humans that he later hooks up with. Running into a group of Psychols Jonnie & friends are quickly captured and inducted into the human, or man-animal, work gangs. The human work gangs do mining for gold in around the Boulder Colorado area by the Psychols who's head of security on earth is Terl, John Travolta, is in charge of.Terl who's being eaten up by the fact that he has to stay on earth forever by his boss, back on his home planet of Psychol, which makes him even meaner and more despicable then he already was. Were later given to understand that the sleazy Terl had a secret tryst with the boss' daughter that lead to him being banished to live out his last years on earth the worst, according to Terl, planet in the Milky Way Galaxy. Finding out from a satellite photo that there's a secret and large mother-load, or vein, of gold in the Rockies Terl plans together with his not too bright Psychol sidekick Kar,Forrest Whitaker, to get the gold mined and dug out by the captured human, or man-animals, and keep it for themselves without the Psychols big shots knowing a thing about it. Training Jonnie with this Psychol learning machine to mine the gold Terl doesn't realize that he's also teaching the illiterate human the history of freedom and democracy and the men and women who fought and died to attain it over the centuries. Jonnie is also thought how to fly USAF F-15's and F-16's combat planes and even detonate nuclear devices that in the end will do in both Terl and his fellow Psychols on earth as well as those on his home planet of Psychol.Outragous looking aliens with what looks like clothespins attached to their noses, as breathing aids, as they completely come apart from the determined attacks of the fearless and newly revived humans who almost overnight come alive with a fleet of fighter planes, that they got from the deserted US military base in Texas Ft Hood. The revolting humans also grab weapons from the fleeing Psychols as they not only defeat the hated and brutal aliens but, by teleporting a super nuclear device, knock out and totally destroy the aliens planet of Psychol as well.Both John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker look and act totally ridicules fighting and screwing with each other, like Cramdon & Norton in the TV comedy show the Honeymooners, over who'll end up as the big banana with the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Travolta talks in such a strange and uncommon, for him, weird tone that I think that his voice was dubbed in by someone else. Whitaker is so blown up that he looks like he added, or filled himself up with, over 100 pounds for his role in the movie as as Ker.The battle scenes between the humans and Psychols are completely unbelievable with the humans lead by ace fighter pilot Robert the Fox, Richard Tyson, who just hours before didn't even know what a plane looked like much less being able to fly it. The Fox knocks out dozens of Psychol aircraft that are light years ahead, in combat ability, then his fleet of outdated flying jalopies that are over 1,000 old years old. Fox does all this without his fighter planes having being maintained during all that time, and yet somehow has their tanks filled up with jet fuel that hasn't been pumped out of the ground and refined for over ten centuries! The movie \"Battlefield Earth\" is only good for a few laughs and that's about all with nothing really making any sense and even the special effects, that were about the only things that could have possibly saved it, coming across as phony and primitive as if they were from a sci-fi flick made in the 1950's.",

There is not much more I can add to the decades of derision that has been deservedly heaped on this canonical example of how not to make a big-budget science-fiction extravaganza. The plot is nonsensical, the script laughable, the cinematography vertiginous, and the acting borderline amateur at times. Star and Hollywood-powerhouse behind the film's creation John Travolta channels a rogue Vinnie Barbarino as the greedy hydrocephalic space-bully Terl and his snide, 'jocularly menacing' delivery is so clich\u00e9d as to be almost self-satirising. Forest Whittaker mugs it up as Terl's put upon deputy Ker and Berry Pepper is the paper-thin rebel leader Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (aka \"Ratbrian\"). The ludicrousness of the film's vision is apparent from the earliest frames, which see the ragged human survivors living like primordial savages in primitive villages, all with perfect teeth and most of whom look like they just stepped out of the make-up chair at a fashion show. Everything goes downhill from there until the show-stopping stupidity of the discovery of the seemingly everlasting cache of arms and jet fighters at what was Fort Hood (after a detour to Fort Knox, at which the last person to leave had forgotten to shut the vault). From this abyss, the film has nowhere to go but up, and the final battle and comeuppance to the miserably snide Psyclos is preposterous but fun to watch. Needless to say given the source material (a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard), the film's back-story is as interesting as the film itself. 'Battlefield Earth' is marginally more watchable than 1953's legendarily dumb 'Robot Monster', but at a cost: Travolta's salary was 625 times 'Robot Monster's' entire budget (100 times if corrected for inflation). Sometimes you don't get what you pay for but a least the more recent film's critical assassination didn't drive the director to attempt suicide.",

And BOY oh BOY does this film suck. Everything about it sucks, the characters (who don't develop) the effects are crap, the story is confusing at points, the movie itself drags, the acting is a joke, and I kept finding myself pointing out stupid points as well as plot holes.I won't really talk about the story much but in a nutshell, earth has been ruled by an incredibly stupid race called Psychlos for one thousand years, and the humans (or Man animals as the psychlos call them) are in constant hiding from the psychlos and are on the verge of extinction, and the hero johnny tries to come up with a plan to take back earth. One of the psychlos called Terl is forced to stay on earth as chief of security for reasons unknown, and he wants to buy his way off earth by training the \"man animals\" to mine gold, because apparently gold is the rarest of all minerals.While the plot sounds simple, its hard to follow and full of plot holes.The psychlos are perhaps the DUMMBEST alien race known to man, they let the humans roam free to the point where they actually kill a couple of psychlos, Terl lets a machine teach Johnny all about the psychlos, all the psychlos underestimate the humans, and apparently the psychlos have so many health problems I keep asking myself how in the mother of God did these morons conquer ANY planet? Travolta (who plays Terl) I believe didn't try in the slightest to act in this movie, and he's the dumbass who's responsible for this movie! However, his role actually made me laugh at points, as well as a lot of the psychlos stupidity did. But the crappy trophy award for worst actor and character goes to Johnny (Pepper). This guy is easily the worst frigging actor I have ever seen! his character is unrealistic and psychotic and just unlikeable.Now The reason why I give this movie a star more than twilight or son of the mask is because this movie made me laugh and some of the action was some what enjoyable, but then again saying this movie is better than twilight or son of the mask is like saying it doesn't hurt being stabbed my this knife as much as it does with THIS knife.

Those were getting old 1000 years before the film took place! You'd think a superior race such as the Psychlos would be able to come up with something a little more creative than that. Although the acting was all very good, it was a mistake to put John Travolta in this film. This is a complaint that I have about numerous films like this, John Travolta is just too well known to suddenly play such an intensely evil character as he did in this film. One of the main problems with this film comes mainly from discrepancies in the believability of the plot. (possible spoiler ahead!!) The one that jumps immediately to mind is the fact that the 'man-animals' managed to conquer a superior race like the Psychlos using primitive Harrier jets, which they learned to fly in a matter of days using a flight simulator which, along with the jets, they found to be in perfect working order after sitting for 1000 years!! The downfall of Battelfield Earth stems from this blatant disrespect for reality. True, this is characteristic of science fiction, but L. Ron Hubbard must realize that our current military is unable to build jets that could be left sitting until the year 3000 and still be made to work. You'd think at least the TIRES would have rotted away, if nothing else. Battlefield Earth is entertaining, but also ultimately disappointing.",

I am the type of person who roots for the underdog, so for the first one third of the film I was just thinking up minor things that could have helped make this a better film, and there were quite a few.

Travolta gives his smarmy best playing against Forest Whitaker as the dolt sidekick trying desperately to get off the boring apocalyptic planet Earth.First they must make enough profit to bribe the Psychlos home bureaucrats to issue a ticket home as a reward for enriching the oligarchy . Alien NWO capitalist mining Gold with human slave labor & despoiling the environment all at the same time. Picture the Psychlos as British Petroleum mining for oil in the Gulf of Mexico...that's a stretch but I understand where L. Ron Hubbard was coming from.Now the two are trying to do this without being issued a mining permit from the Psychlos home world and shipping the wealth home on the sly. To do this the two miscreants must use the human slaves as pawns(Iraq Wars) as mindless draft animals to pull of thus heist (Oil) but unbeknownst the human slaves will rebel with the help of hero Johnny Goodboy...campy but still interesting in the grand story that reflects are New World Order of today. Not many movies will tackle geopolitical scams & schemes of today wrapped around a campy Alien invasion Sci-fi story line, they usually go hardcore preachiness that defeats the message Only reason not to give this a Ten is the human hero is miscast, needed a stronger personality as Travolta & Whitaker carry the show . This movie should have been made in the 1980's by John Carpenter and it would have gone down as a classic. I think much of the hate is directed at Travolta , Scientology & parroted by the internet herd mentality and not the story. Everyone says it's bad so it must be so. Star Wars # must be great because everyone says so, no critic wants to say the whole franchise is garbage now because social/ media wont allow the honest truth without seeing the back-end of the unemployment line. Just as everyone has the cowardly Lion courage to troll Battlefield Earth ...it's an easy mark. A taste of junkfood Star Wars cinema leftovers is enough but you just might catch yourself watching B.E for the second or third time on antenna or Netflix for a late night snack.This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material but in an odd way a enjoyable romp across time & space.

Even the least discerning genre fans in the world could smell the stink coming off this one (and not just because everything looks so grungy and foul). Story about mankind fighting back against their enslaving alien overlords isn't an especially interesting one; required to sell it are well-utilized tropes, punchy dialogue and characterizations, visually exciting design and effects, and flashes of wit and excitement. Unfortunately, this film has none of those things (unless shooting about eighty-five percent of the movie at a Dutch angle is considered \"visually exciting design\"), with astounding lapses in logic and laughable performances to boot--either shapelessly generic (Pepper) or incalculably weird and over-the-top (Travolta). One of the worst-looking would-be blockbusters ever released, and not even that amusing to watch for purposes of ridicule because of how boring the whole thing is.

            "content": "Battlefield Earth is a film that cannot be taken seriously.  This film is one of my personal favorites.  I have fun whenever I watch the DVD.  Well the plot to this story is easy to follow.  The film takes place 1000 years into the future and we have been conquered by a race known as the Phyclos. The Phyclos reminded me of overgrown Ferengi from the Star Trek Spinoffs. They are only concerned with wealth and Power.  John Travolta does an excellent job as Teryl the Psyclo Chief of security, who hates being on Earth and desperately wants a transfer.  Well his superiors decide to leave him them permanently.  He then launches a plot to buy off his superiors by using humans (the lower species) to mine gold in a high radiation zone, which interferes with the Psyclos breathing gas.  Well he gives an earthling Psyclo knowledge so that he can operate complex Psyclo machinery which will have dire consequences in the end for the Psyclos.  Well This earthling named \"Johnny\" (portrayed by Barry Pepper) outsmarts the Psyclos by giving them gold from Fort Know (which still exits).  It was hilarious when Teryl finds the gold and wonders how these earthlings can smelt the gold into bricks.  During the time they are supposed to mine the gold they plan an attack from abandoned U.S bunkers.  Well enough with the plot.  I want to talk about how great this movie is.  First of all I loved the camera angles, there isn\u00b4t one straight shot in the whole film.  I also loved the effects and lighting.  Lastly I thought this film was highly amusing.  Watch Teryl and his assistant trying to get leverage over each other was quite amusing. I mean it was directed by Roger Christian, and designed by Patrick Tatopoulos who both worked on \"Independence Day\" and \"Star Wars\" Battlefield Earth shouldn't be taken seriously, though it isn\u00b4t my favorite Sci-Fi film I enjoyed this one very much, and I know I am in the minority.

I can't help but feel pity for the poor ignorant fools who actually seemed to think they had a good movie on their hands. I have a hard time believing John Travolta will be able to regain a reputation after starring in a movie in which the logic behind characters' actions is even less balanced than the camera which is at a tilt on every shot. Mr. Travolta's character plans to find out what humans like to eat best by starving them to a point of desperation and seeing what they eat. Simply presenting this logic as something that anyone, especially someone who proves himself clever throughout the rest of the movie, would use is completely ridiculous. In their plan to save the world, the humans plan to collapse a dome made with glass and metal beams that covers the city, thereby letting in gas that is poisonous only to the Psychlos. What doesn't seem to pose any problems is the fact that huge steal beams will falls from the sky. But hey, it's the future.

However, I definitely do not think that the film is as good as the Scientology cult shills are making out, either. If anything, I would describe this film as being hopeless in its mediocrity. It also makes me wonder how a man who wrote something this stupid could possibly have formed a new deathcult... oh wait, the Christian bible is even worse.Anyway, the plusses of the film are extremely simple. I went to this film wanting to be entertained, and apart from a few moments where the film drags, I was entertained. The leading lady was wonderful to look at. I'd repopulate the planet with her any time she asked me to, that's for certain. The special effects were nowhere near as bad as I was led to believe they were, either. Sure, they were patently unconvincing, but I didn't mind that at all.The bad points of this film? Well, the acting is attrocious, even from Travolta, which leads me to believe that the real problem was with the script rather than the actors. Instead of trying to verbatim copy a portion of the novel, it would have been more prudent to make an independent story of its own and, should that prove more successful, get a more talented writer to translate the actual novel to the screen. Then there's the Psychlos, who seemed to be about as menacing as a schoolteacher and about as frightening as a child abuser. No offence meant to other people who've been victims of either, but once you take away their weapons and technology, these guys would really have been as weak as a Catholic inquisitor without an army.Another low point of the film is that we are never given enough opportunity to form an attachment with any of the characters. Their dialogue is recited in a very contrite and false manner that prevents any connection, making it very hard to want to root for the cavemen. Firing at the week-long training in jump-jet flying is a bit weak... obviously they had to make some kind of shortcut like that in order to get the story moving ahead. Shooting at Terl's constant superiority pose is another weak move on the part of critics, as this is exactly what weak little bullies do in order to reassure themselves of their position. Trust me, I should know, having recently confronted one of the teachers of my boyhood and suddenly finding that I outweighed them by ninety pounds (not because I am fat, either). It's just a self-assuring pose, guys, it's actually a nice touch.All in all, I give this film two out of ten. It's entertaining both in spite of and because of its stupidity, and that's more than what I can say for such films as the Blair Witch Nazi Propaganda, which still makes me want to perpetrate violence upon the directors because I value my own freedom to think. Give it a shot expecting a patently stupid movie, and it might keep you laughing for a while.",

The presence of John Travolta playing a stereotyped but charismatic villain who enjoys the best dialogues and moments of the film helps a lot to the quality of a film that is not so cumbersome and compares with many current \"B or Z series jejitas. Asylum roll that populate so many video store shelves. This at least has some decent Fx, and I mean it, they are not as crappy as they say.The prota, Barry Peeper fulfills his role well. The typical sacrificed and noble hero who seeks the good and freedom of his race. It is not perfect but it is correct.And well, in what is already the direction, production design and such ... well, that is not a big deal but it is not the worst thing I have seen, it is a film that is entertaining and enjoyable if it is not It demands too much, and I don't know why a clearly commercial product should be demanded of anything that failed in large part because of the bad reputation of the Scientology Church, since the history of the film was written by its founder, Ron L Hubbard, and in large part because of the fierce specialized criticisms that circulated word of mouth that it was the worst film of the decade and that it was rubbish, these two factors greatly affected the film he intended, as he said in his advertising posters Become a saga.But I, who am neither a professional critic nor anything I say very clearly, is not the worst film in history, nor of the past decade.It is simply one more science fiction film, with its eccentricities, defects and also its good moments and peculiarities and that in my opinion, it does not deserve to be dilapidated more than other bodies that circulate around and that have even made it up to a film of worship.Thank you.",

No, it's beyond stupid. A \"supreme race\" called the \"Psychlos\" have conquered earth and are tyrannizing the last few human beings, who have fallen back into stone age culture. One of the humans is revolting. Therefore, Psychlo leader John Travolta (the horror! the horror!) puts him into his learning machine that teaches him all of Psychlo science and technology in a few minutes. (Bulls***, you say - that should make him even more dangerous, right? Wait till I'm finished).Travolta sends the cavemen to dig for gold in the mines. But instead they get the gold from Fort Knox, claiming they have molten it into bars(!) for the Psychlos' convenience. Instead of digging for gold, the cavemen break into an ancient military depot. After several thousand years, all the equipment is still working, all the aircraft is still fueled up, and the Psychlos are attacked with bombers and jets. Finally, one of the humans beams to their homeworld and blows it up with a nuclear bomb. Now, do you still think this learning machine thing was kind of stupid?:END OF SPOILERSExtremely moronic movies from Hollywood are nothing new (the indescribable \"LXG\" comes to mind), but normally they are not as expensive as \"Battlefield Earth\". There must have been some gross mismanagement here, because the movie looks decidedly low-budget, with really cheesy CGI effects that are clearly below the standard of TV shows like \"Star Trek\", let alone state-of-the-art sci-fi cinema. I could guess where all the money actually went, but I don't want to be sued by Scientology, so I won't do it. The cinematography is ridiculous: virtually every scene is shot from a tilted angle with a different color filter, and they keep changing the tilt of the camera from shot to shot. Must be nauseating when watched on a big screen, but perhaps less so than the mercilessly overacting John Travolta. There was an evil star shining on Forrest Whittaker when he agreed to appear in this impertinent mess.And how stupid must THEY think WE are?1/10",

            "review_title": "Somewhere between mediocre and bad",
            "content": "This sci-fi adventure based on L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same name is bad, but not as abysmal as its reviews and the public backlash would lead one to believe.  Hubbard, of course, is the controversial author of `Dianetics' and the founder of the Church of Scientology of which John Travolta is a devotee.  The story is supposedly allegorical of the psychological imprisonment that human beings face.  The hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), is thought to be Hubbard as he saw himself, a savior of the human race from psychological bondage.  There is probably some truth to the charges that Travolta produced this film as a tribute to Hubbard to legitimize his name.  He reportedly staked $5 million of his own money to foot part of the $78 million budget.  Claims that it was intended to be a recruiting film for Scientology are probably overblown.  Though I have my own feelings about the danger of cults, I will confine my review to the film itself.The story started out with interesting possibilities.  An advanced alien race, with a preoccupation with accumulating wealth, invaded earth for its natural resources and pushed the human race to the brink of extinction. The humans were scattered and reverted to tribal behavior.  Their daily lives were guided by myth and religious superstition.  Humans that were found by the Psychlos were imprisoned and forced to work as slaves.  Johnny is a bright young man known as a `Greener' because he rejects accepted ways and is always looking for greener pastures.  He is captured by the Psychlos and he hatches a plot to defeat them to win the freedom of his newfound slave followers.To this point, the film is fairly solid.  It is tough to believe that established religions such as Christianity would have died out and that in 1000 years there would be no remnants of our technological advancement and no attempts to unite an underground resistance, but I'm always willing to give sci-fi a wider berth.  However, once inside the prison, each scene becomes less and less probable, until one is left rolling one's eyes in incredulity.  We have Stone Age mentality people learning to fly fighter jets in two weeks and flying gloriously into battle against an alien race that supposedly defeated the entire planet's defenses in nine minutes. Between flying lessons, they teach themselves how to rig a nuclear warhead, which they intend to transport to the Psychlos home planet to exterminate the entire race.  Not bad for a bunch of illiterates.The acting is the biggest minus in the film.  John Travolta is an inconsistent actor, who can often be brilliant, but is sometimes awful. His performance as Terl, the Pyschlo Chief of Security is probably the low point of his career.  It is as if he was trying to play Julius Caesar with Vinnie Barbarino's personality, turning the character into a pompous moron. Clearly, his passion for the project blinded him to how poor his performance was.  Barry Pepper proved that he is not ready for leading roles with a portrayal that could serve as a clinic on overacting.  Other than Forrest Whittaker, who provided the only thing even close to acting, the rest of the cast seemed to have been recruited from L.A. homeless shelters.Roger Christian, who has proven himself a talented Art Director, Set Director and Second Unit Director, took an enormous budget and made it look like a TV movie.  The best production credits go to the miniatures and special prop supervisors for the models of the ancient cities and the dome.This film was punished at the box office, grossing less than one-third of its enormous budget.  I rated this film a 4/10.  It had some interesting elements, a decent premise, and some good visual effects, but the acting was abominable and the screenplay was butchered.  For most, this is a film to avoid.",

OK, they are bigger, stronger, breath some other kind of air and drink nasty stuff. BUT they do have the same nasty habits like humans, cheating, greed (gold, surprise!!), sex, and like to dominate others. Their political system seems to be as rotten as on earth.The Aliens laugh at each other when something goes bad, even when a human happen to kill one of the aliens. Hey, they are rotten inside, just like real bad people, so we do not have to feel sorry for them, when their planet is blown up.And I like that the greed make the responsible for the operation take a human to train him in their technology, to make more gold, which leads to his own downfall.IF the amount of years of repression had been less - and IF they had found a way to use the aliens aircraft's and tools to fight them, the scenes would be less hilarious.I have watched more times, and I always like when Aliens are as bad as human politicians :)",

The only good thing about Battlefield Earth are some of the ideas it explores (a new beginning for humanity after a great catastrophe), the special effects, sound effects, and some of the lighting.The director claimed he was going for a \"comic book\" feel in the DVD commentary, hence the massive plot holes and the 'drunk man leaning on a steep hill shooting style'.

            "content": "Franchise Pictures hit a major bump after relative success with the Bruce Willis vehicle The Whole Nine Yards with the wildly infamous Battlefield Earth, which was slammed by critics, went drastically over-budget due to the company's shady practises and marketing, and grossed only $29.7 million at the box office out of an overall $73 million budget. Franchise's later lawsuit, which would bankrupt them, were over accusations of purposely inflating this film's budget.Described by Travolta himself as the Schindler's List of science-fiction films, Battlefield Earth's long and outright hilarious production history basically boils down to despite what everyone thinks, most people in Hollywood considering Scientologists to be a bunch of freaks, and what's worse, not a viable intellectual property, and therefore no major studio, in their right mind, ever producing something akin to propaganda for the cult.Luckily for Travolta, who had just failed to convince Quentin Tarantino to direct the film, that Franchise pictures was neither a major studio or indeed in their right mind as they had possibly scammed some German investors with a package deal in order to finance what finally became the Roger Christian directed and the too many re-drafts to credit written Battlefield Earth for the new millennium.Now, given the Scientology rub and Travolta's fanatic zeal during the marketing campaign, it's easy to see why critics at the time saw this as a gross and highly ill advised vanity project, cause it is, and therefore see the film itself as a poorly produced, wonderfully acted, exceptionally cheap looking dumpster fire, cause it is.However, accusations of the film being dull are only warranted if you are looking for a serious film experience here, which twenty million memes later would be beyond expectation.The film can be only judged realistically in 2020 by how hilarious it is as that's where it's entertainment value has now been reported to lay.Well let's run it down. The CGI is cheap as balls, the matte paintings are twenty years out of date, the dutch angles and colour filters are really that awkward and the acting is the most genuinely entertaining aspect of the entire movie. Travolta was, and still is, a true believer in this production and that's wholly evident as he leaves everything on the frame and nothing for his self-respect. Combine his ridiculous makeup and graduate level, or Marlon Brando level, British accent and you have a truly absurd, truly camp presence that is a gift to us all.OK. screenplay. Terrible. Most novel adaptations run the risk of having dialogue sound overwrought and completely terrible and let me tell you boi about this L N***e Hubburd. Featured in Battlefield Earth is the distinctively American combination of bull**** pseudoscience and exceptionalism and such is born a British colony uprising framed within the post civil rights, Pre Reagan self-help mysticism of the late seventies. In short, it's truly special, and uninspired and i expected nothing more from the Hubbard.Battlefield Earth is camp as all hell. It is cheap, it is at times meandering and whilst meme worthy in short bursts, the overwhelming mediocrity of the special effects and the storytelling make it a near unwatchable film to sit through from bell to bell as it struggles hard to maintain your attention. Maybe not for a solo watching. But I'm guarandamnnteed certain that at the right party with the right people, this **** be lit.",

I'm not kidding - this is the kind of bad movie that made me laugh harder than any movie since \"South Park\".First, you have John Travolta.  He looks like a refugee from GWAR, Beavis and Butthead's favorite band, and his intelligence in this film remind me less of a rapacious corporate raider, like I suppose Hubbard intended, and more like Torgo, the disgusting \"monster\" in \"Manos\".

Maybe he owed Travolta a favor, I don't know...As for the plot... embarrassingly enough, I actually read the whole book back in 3rd grade, in my devouring-anything-remotely-sci-fi phase.

Now, some unhygenic cavemen from Colorado learn how to fly Harrier jets (Harrier?  even knowing as little as I do about military aviation, I know that they're basically just ground-attack jets, and not exactly cream-of-the-crop in reliability) and destroy not only the vastly superior aliens on earth, but their entire planet????  Huh?  And let's not even mention the morality of that - basically, we're expected to cheer that these cavemen just committed a horrible act of mass murder against billions of sentient beings.

            "content": "(spoiler included)I've seen a lot worse films than this one, so the criticism has been somewhat unfair - but it is still a terribly bad movie. It is badly shot, over ambitious, symbolic to the point of breaking and has a story that is incoherent, inconsequential and weak. Not even the special effects were anything out of the ordinary, it just looked a lot like Independence Day but fuzzier, dimmer and harder to follow. Near the end, two really weird logic leaps are taken: the humans have degenerated to Cro Magnon (with first and last names!), but it takes them just a week to go from wooden spears to AV-8B Harrier jets (that function perfectly after a thousand years of unuse). When the dome is finally destroyed and falls down, it's enough for the humans to lie down on the ground to survive - but the debris hits all the psychlos standing up. Hmmm... Several other questions arise: if gold is valuable to psychlos as well, isn't it strange that they haven't scavenged the Earth for this precious metal once they learned that humans also favored gold? It wouldn't be too great an effort to realize that there must be gold deposits here and there, and from there to assume that Fort Knox and such places would be empty before long isn't too difficult. And what of the nuclear weapons (that can blow up an entire planet) that are still lying around waiting for someone to use. If Jonnie took all his knowledge from the psychlo learning machine, it's safe to assume that the psychlos know about the effects of nuclear weapons and would at some point taken a detailed look at the human arsenal (because Jonnie suddenly knows how to arm a device). They just left it at that? I don't get it.But there's another, a lot more serious hole in this story: Travolta's evil psychlo character, Terl, states that it took the psychlos 9 minutes to conquer Earth, and that all the knowledge the human race had couldn't help them - so Jonnie Tyler can't expect to beat the psychlos. And yet he and a band of degenerated cavemen topple the psychlo reign in just a week, using almost exclusively human technology. They learn to fly Harriers so well that not only do they not crash - they actually gain air superiority over a species that conquered the fairly advanced human race in 9 minutes. Whoa! That's really something.Another question that pops in to my head is this: if the psychlos were to conquer the Earth in 9 minutes, that would mean that they are a helluva lot more advanced than us - I mean, taking over a planet in nine minutes is basically landing and just claiming it. But I see nothing that points to the fact that they should have been thousands of years ahead of us - ray guns and the giant dome doesn't impress me, and spacecraft that can be downed with a sidewinder missile - pfft! Naahhh... to make a positive impression on me, this film would have had to be reworked so fundamentally, there would be no point in it having the same title as L. Ron Hubbard's novel in the first place. I expect a reasonable amount of logic, even in a movie such as this. As it is, \"Waterworld\" is more intelligent - and infinitely more entertaining.",

There were some parts of this movie that you REALLY had to suspend disbelief for (like the whole Harrier jet stuff), but hey... It's a movie.  As for the tilted camera angles, I liked them. Also, the lighting was extremely well done.  When the movie was showing an area that had breathe gas in the atmosphere there was a blue-ish hue all around, but when there was air in the atmosphere the movie used orange-ish hues. There were also many other things that made this movie stand out.  I give this movie a 9 out of 10.  (I minus one for the Harrier jet stuff.)By the way, I'm NOT a scientologist...

Travolta's character feels like someone lifted a cackling villain from the very worst of the Roger Moore period James Bond films, gave him a ray gun and a Klingon costume, and told him to play for laughs.  I suppose we have him to blame for this - without his name on the credits, this would have gone directly to video, which is still a waste of tape, but at least not a waste of $8 for the average moviegoer.

The camera was tilted at an angle, and it was almost all in blue and black or green and black, reminding one even more of seasickness than the movie itself. The psychlos are terrible, sort of a homeless (dirty)-rostafarian (dreadlocks)-conehead (coneheaded)-Klingon (take a guess, stupid)-kiss costume wearing (stage platform boots about 3 feet high)-Rob Zombie impersonator(they really do look like Rob)- with a HUGE package (I mean, seriously, they must have modeled them after horse penises, they're the only intimidating thing about the aliens).  There are more plot holes than actual plot, and they're usually pretty obvious. These aliens are supposed to rule the universe, but they aren't quite as smart as  a below-average rock. Also, there were blatant, badly done, rip-off's of scenes in other movies, noticably, the 'lobby scene' in \"the Matrix\", and the 'death star trench scene' from \"Star Wars\". This made the whole movie ludicrous and just plain stupid.However, this movie did have several good points. One, the end. This was probably the best part of the movie. Not that the ending to the movie was any better filmed/acted/written, but that it was good when the movie ended. Also, though it was unintentional, the movie was hilarious. If it had been billed as a comedy, it would have been somewhere approaching first-rate. I rarely stopped laughing, except to point out what NEW idiocy was on screen. Well, that's about it for the good.Finally, I recommend seeing it once, and on the big screen, but preferably not in theaters. Wait until it's on video, then show it on one of those small projectors.

Sure i understand that some part are truly badly executed, like the scene where group is taken out for mining tests, where some cavemen attack, and like in 20 seconds after a short speech, the pledge their life to a man, a leader that the just met and they will obey everything he wants. Also its really fun when they find a nuclear bomb and open it up after 1000 years and its operational and they fiddle with the trigger and the bomb is making all kinds of warning noises. Really nukes do that didn't you know. Also amazing that they had electricity after 1000 years in that building, and of course the Harriers, a marvel of human engeneering, lasting a 1000years with filled tanks.Yes some loopholes in the plot but the acting from Mr Travolta is amazing, and of course his co-partner in crime Mr Whitaker, one of my absolutely favorite black actors does an superamazing job in this movie.The aliens are surely somewhat Klingon-looking but i think there are quite drastic differences. They are much smarter than Klingons and highly profitminded, and much funnier walking. I truly enjoy their hunt for profit since it very much resembles human hunt for profit. My own observations of todays world is that profit nowadays conquers altruism and true philanthrophy.One really fun plothole that i think everyone else has missed it that leader is taught maths from a completely different extraterrestial life form but the math is having earth symbols and number format from 1 to 10.

He should just stick to playing the shallow villain in budget action movies.As for the actual content of the film, it would have been better had they made it less Sci-Fi and more like a dark action-drama. Deeper meaning would have been nice here. As for the special effects, they were just unnecessary.

            "content": "Battlefield Earth is one of the most infamous films of all time. Battlefield Earth was intended to be a big box office blockbuster for the summer of 2000. Obviously, it was not. Battlefield Earth was PANNED by literally everyone and is often considered one of the worst films of all time. Do I think so? Well..... more on that later. Battlefield Earth is based off of the novel of the same name which was written by L. Ron Hubbard who is the founder of scientology. Even I don't even know what scientoloy is and personally I could care less. After the book was released, the author wanted a film adaptation to be made. Well, John Travolta was a scientologist and for years and years has been wanting to do this film. So this film was a passion project. The film had lots of merchandise and was really hyped up but upon release, failed. The film is directed by Roger Christian who has not directed anything really notable (besides this film) but has worked as Set Director for the Star Wars films. The film stars John Travolta (who also produced this film), Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile), and Forest Whittaker.The evil aliens known as the Psychlos invaded Earth 1000 years ago and now in the year 3000, humans are endangered. Basically, human hero gets captured and eventually makes an attempt in defeating the Psychlos who are looking for gold on Earth and whatnot.For years I have avoided this film because why would I want to torture myself and watch a film with this much negative reception? When it came to watching this film, I decided to just turn my brain off for once and not view this film under a critical lense. I will admit that it was hard to do (with the obvious flaws being very....well.....obvious). With that being said, I do not think that Battlefield Earth is the worst film of all time. Yes, it is a bad film but not a bad enough film to make me wish that I have never watched it. It is bad in an interesting sort of way. I am entertained by how bad it is. So, the obvious negatives. The camera work is really really bad. Everything (or a very very large majority) of the shots are shot at an angle. Why? No clue. It is just very very strange. The story and script are just as equally bad with plot holes and what not. There is no build up to anything in this film and stuff just kind of happens. The Psychlos are very dumb in this film and the whole plot is just really dumb and in itself. Now, that is where most of my negativity ends. Everything else about this film, while does not make for a really good film, makes for an entertaining sort of film. Well, somewhat entertaining. The acting is not great overall and would not typically be classified as good. John Travolta gives a really over the top performance but I am somewhat entertained by it. Barry Pepper as our hero, while not a good hero due to not being written very well, appears to be trying really hard with what he has been given. The special effects themselves range from mediocre to well...... that did not age well. The practical makeup effects are pretty neat despite the Psychlos looking butt ugly. The whole color scheme of blue and gray does not really bother me whatsoever. The music for the film is not bad which is strange because I do personally think that everyone who watched this film decided that this is the worst film ever and critiqued everything like the music without giving it a listen. Sure, it is pretty standard but if I am to think of anything in this film that is not terrible, this would be it.Battlefield Earth is not the worst film of all time. Far from it. Sure, for a big budget film it really blows. When it comes to the big flaws, it is really bad. Had it had a better script and story, I think the film would have been much better.",

Do you ever wonder if people who are making movies like this, the really bad ones, like Leonard Pt. 6 or The Haunting (although I think this is the worst of the bunch), have moments on the set where they look around and think 'Oh my God, I'm involved in a huge bomb!'Do you think Travolta ever went home and said 'I don't know, honey, when I'm on the set and I'm in those KISS boots I'm feeling pretty good, but then I look over at Forest Whitaker and I think 'He looks like a cute, fluffy dog. He doesn't look like a bad alien', and then I get kind of scared.  But at least he's fatter than me.'Really, it's pointless to mention, but the F/X in this movie are soooooooo bad.

Which is the final chuckle!At 2.3/10, this movie is ranked somewhat low...And, as a movie, it deserves lower. It's dreadful! Plot? Well, I'm used to Hollywood driving around plot holes, but this movie is so full of them it resembles a sieve that's been riddled with bullets. There's no point in even trying to justify the many many flaws of the story without descending into the realm of headaches. Suffice to say the plot is about liberating man from aliens, who've repressed them for years. Blah. Who cares really? It makes no sense. The script also comes with some fine one liners, so full of cheese and ham you could feed a country. They're so mind numbingly awful - they even have evil laughs - that they border on the right-out hilarious. You think they *have* to be taking the mickey, they can't possibly expect us to swallow that.The acting? It's nice to see that the two leads - John Travolta and Barry Pepper - had their dreadful work recognised here with Golden Razzie awards. Travolta again provides laughs as he camps it up as the evil overlord Terl. Pepper races around the place trying to look stern, as the earthman hero, and commanding but looks, instead, constipated half the time. It's awful all round, but again so bad you can't help but laugh.However it's the direction by Roger Christian which really makes \"Battlefield Earth\" a classic. I'm not quite sure where they got him from, but they should send him back to class...there's an incredible over-use of cameras tilted at 45 degree angles - for NO reason. Action shots are done in laughably weak slow motion or incredibly confusing cuts - does Christian even know the concept of where to place your camera? Lighting is generally cranked up to become annoyingly monochrome at times - is there a need for this?! It's done so poorly you would think a 12 year old was the helm. There is not one iota of goodness about the dreadful direction - and again it's so awful that I spent a fair amount of the movie laughing at Christian and wondering how he got the job. I eventually had to persuade myself that he's making an ironic statement about directing or something....Bad in every single area, \"Battlefield Earth\" should be watched once to see how bloody awful a movie can be. From a camp, hilarity point of view you may gain something from it, and it's certainly a great precursor to any other movie because that movie will, in comparison, be inevitably all that much better. For the sheer gall of this flick being made, I'd give it 3/10, but as it's utter tripe I'd give it 0.5/10 (the .5 because I got to laugh at it).",

No one can't say that they aren't stars cause they are. I'm really disappointed with Whitaker's performance. He is so bad that I have no words. Travolta, on other hand never really cared about this role. He did his part as professional and took his money. Maybe he realized too that there is no reason to act good in such a lousy movie. Barry Pepper is in range with Whitaker. Equally bad. But in Pepper's case I had no real expectations.Special effects. What special effects? Whole movie was made so bad on that and on all other fields. Probably all the money went for securing Travolta's name in this project. But even without special effects it is possible to make a good movie. This isn't that case cause it hasn't got good story. From potentially OK script this turned to a disaster.

A brief summary of some of my favorite movies.I admit when I saw this movie on opening day I thought some of the elements in the films story were a little ridiculous. The flight simulator, the fact that the humans were a little slow on what the function of things really were, but the idea of taking back the planet wasn't so terrible and neither was the carrying out of that idea.The acting was fine. The SFX and the Art direction are not as bad as some say, with sixty million dollars how could anything look cheap. I read a criticism on the dialogue, what do we know about how aliens talk anyway? Aliens have personalities and attitudes and they have to put them to use, they're in a business to make money and rule the universe, treachery is a way of life.I recently started reading the book and it cleared up a few things in the film, it's disappointing that the producers wanted a 2hr action-SiFi movie instead of what L. Ron Hubbard wrote in his book, but it doesn't take away too much of the story and is still worth your time.For the bored at heart and those who thought is was stupid, go back to watching made for TV movies that the have brains, acting, directing and the same moral point and cliched story line(at least THIS was original), with a box of tissues. For those who aren't so quick to insult a group of well established film makers who made what they KNOW to be a good movie(or else they wouldn't have wasted they're time making it, do you think John Travolta needs another twenty million dollars to waste a year of his life to make a crappy movie?) see it. It doesn't play so well on the small screen but it's still not a waste of your time.",

Roger Christian uses different angles, close-ups, and slow-motion to emphasize his \"drama.\" All it does is make everything on screen look completely pathetic.

I suppose I see this movie in that vein. Put aside the clear departures from reality, and enjoy it for what it is. It's a bizarre, strange tale, but it held my interest.

Train of thought; Travolta, a video camera, a few actors and a _real_ script would most likely be infinitely more rewarding.

For one, John Travolta could not act worse in this film if he tried. He prances and cavorts about like an intergalactic fairy, overdoing every single one of his lines. \"Oooh, Mr. Chairman! I just luuuv your new ma-ooon boots! Ooh-hoo-hoo!\" That's basically it. As for our hero, whose name isn't given until about 45 minutes in, this guy can't act either. There were about 9 instances where 'Jonnie' gets choked by one alien or another, and he makes these exaggerated gasping noises that sound like they belong in a Looney Tunes short. Then we have the makeup. Sorry, but in this day and age when we have The Lord of the Rings, the rubber and plastic of Battlefield looks ancient. Anyone who plays an alien must walk around in a dreadlock wig, stilt boots and clawed hands that look like something you would buy out of a novelty catalog. Honestly, how could anyone involved with this project not be embarrassed to see themselves like this? Now for the huge plot holes and idiotic ideas that appear every few seconds. It boggles my mind how bad the script is. The whole Let's See What A Human's Favorite Food Is bit was laughably bad, as well as the fact that the aliens put cameras in the buttons of shirts to spy on people. Yeah, and these are the same guys that took over the planets in 9 MINUTES? Please.

            "content": "Was i the only person, in this world who enjoyed this movie ?! I really don\u00b4t understand why so many people attack Battlefield Earth, when we have lots of pretty good examples of plenty of movies wich are a million times worse than this one and yet they were big box office smashes. And i\u00b4m talking about cinematic empty plotwise trash like Stargate, Independence Day... the list goes on and on.What many people fail to compreend, is that Battelfield Earth is a 50\u00b4s space-opera, writen more than 40 years ago, and by that time this kind of plot would look pretty good and very exciting to watch. Maybe the filmakers of this movie should had tried to update the content in the story more up to date instead of just updating the special effects attached to this story, but in my opinion if this had been done, the whole original atmosphere of the original novel would have been lost. What i realy liked in Battlefield Earth the movie, was that among all those special effects, it still kept the original spirit and inocence of the original Battlefield Earth the novel. And that is a thing we don\u00b4t get much this days ,when a sci-fi novel is addapted to the big screen. For this i think this movie should be praised and not putted down.As novels adaptations go, this is one of the best i\u00b4ve seen so far, and altough it loosed a big chunk of the plot in the middle, the original story is very well stitched between the begining and the last act, altough during the second half everything happens to fast, wich  is a shame, because the best parts in the book begin by the middle of the story, and some of them simply disappeared from the film. For example the idea that \"caveman\" would learn so fast to fly combat planes. This doesn\u00b4t happens in such a fast way in the novel, and many other details tha make the movie look like it\u00b4s filled with stupid details when in fact the original story kept its \"slow\" pace and had time to introduce us to every bit in the plot. But because this is the movies, i can understand things had to be accelerated, and this is what makes the second half of this movie feel a bit idiotic, to someone who hadn\u00b4t read the book. For example the movie ends up giving the idea, that were the americans only who saved the world, when in fact the book tells us that all was a battle fough around the world at the same time. There are to much fragments of plot lost in the second act of the movie like some great  scenes in Scotland for example.But despite all this the film still kept the spirit of the novel, particulary in the characters of the Psyclos wich are perfectly depicted, and everything is exactly like in the book. I can\u00b4t understand why John Travolta is so attacked for doing this movie as he plays the character of the book exactly as it should have been done, and Forest Withaker is also perfect in his role creating a great duo of characters wich end up being very funny to watch altough they say no jokes at all. And this is a compliment, not a bad critic. The treatchery funny feling present in the original novel is all there.I couldn\u00b4t care less about Cientology, if it\u00b4s a rip-off or not, that\u00b4s not my problem, but i can\u00b4t help feeling that this movie is being attacked more for its connection to cientology than everything else, because otherwise, with so much successfull movie trash out there how come Battlefield Earth is being so put down ?...Because it doesn\u00b4t look cool in a time when sci-fi seems more about cool heros, cool styles and coolness that you can hook the teens with ?... And i bet most of the people who now attack this movie now, are the same who think that Matrix has a very original plot just because it looks cool and are the same who thought that a movie like The 13th Floor for example who deals with the same concept of Matrix was boring just because it was done in a simple style and it wasn\u00b4t MTV style cool all the way. I\u00b4m not attacking Matrix, because i like it a lot also, i\u00b4m just saying that i don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s much diference between that and Battlefield Earth at the core. Both are great entertainment movies. And both are as good or as bad.Battelfield Earth, is an old style movie, one with good guys, invasions and ugly bad aliens classic style all the way and this is how it should be viewed. This is a classic 50\u00b4s sci-fi story. And a good one, simple as that. Why people go to watch this expecting some serious sci-fi concept ? This is just a good old fashioned adventure movie, based on a story that was one of the first to deal in a large eopic scale with this type of plot in a time when no one had dared to write something in this style. And to my knowledge it\u00b4s a very good story. Simple in our days, but still fun and effective. And this is why i think the movie of this book is a good movie,I wish all the sci-fi book were all this well adappted to the big sceen as this one is and i only reggret this wasn\u00b4t a three hour movie, because if it would have been, all the things in the book could have been done, and perhaps, people now would be looking at this story diferently.In reality the only things that disapointed me were some of the little bit \"rip-offs\" in design, from Blade Runner, to Star Trek, to Dune, to Matrix, there was always something on screen that we had already seen before, but with so many stuff being created nowadays i guess it\u00b4s tough to be original this days. One good thing that i liked was that the special effects were always used to serve the movie plot and not just to look cool.Not the best sci-fi movie i ever saw, not even in my favorites list, but definetely a very, very good sci-fi adventure, and a million times better than 90% of the crap wich comes out of Hollywood this days. The filmakers of this should be proud of their work and not disapointed by the reviews.Good old sci-fi fun. Recomended to everyone who goes watch it with an open mind.",

By sticking to the overdramatic wordage of the penny-a-page hack Hubbard, it destroyed any possibility of connecting with a general audience.  I was fortunate enough to watch with a former Scientologist who got some great laughs for the apparent propoganda in the film.  Besides the horrible overacting and that crap-lousy faux British accent of Travolta's, I couldn't get past the major plot holes to get into the film.  Some of the ones I noticed that haven't been discussed much on here: 1)  Johnny uses a learning machine that teaches him Psychlo language and culture.  Yet he discusses \"Euclidian Geometry\".  Why is Euclid, an Earthling, discussed on the machine? 2)  The \"man-animals\" seem to have no written language (evidenced by the lack of writing, other than primitive cave drawings) yet, by studying Psychlo culture, he can suddenly read books in English in the Denver Library and understand a complicated manual for a nuclear device. 3)  Even getting past finding a WORKING flight simulator, these machines do not instruct those who have never flown.  Understanding the hover systems, as well as weaponry, of a Harrier in a few days is inconceivable. 4)  The Psychlos have been searching for and mining gold for 1000 years. Apparantly in that time, they did no research on the subject.  Magically, in his short time in the Denver library, Johnny picks a book which discusses the huge gold reserves at Ft. Knox. 5)  Travolta's character (like I ever worried about remembering his name) questions why the gold has been put into bars yet never questions how!And there are so many more.  Put this movie up there with \"Look Who's Talking Too\" as painful to watch a fairly talented actor sinking like a stone.",

The 'good guy' humans are so boring and annoying you start to wish the invaders would get rid of them *now*.

They were immediately impressed how it has been declared the worst film ever, and just saw a pretty picture on their televisions while claiming how terrible it was.I also think that anyone who connects this film with Scientology should be smacked really hard with a copy of Dianetics.  I am no Scientology advocate, but the book was just another of L. Ron Hubbard's novels.  That's it. Travolta made this movie as a homage to his mentor, not to promote his religion.And of course the movie is rife with plot holes.  Unfortunately, the story is too deep and complex to make a 3 hour movie complete, let alone a 90 minute one.  The universe in the book in far more expansive, and Johnny's plan of taking back the planet is far more in depth.  The difference between books being made into film, and original screenplays, is that the screenplay is written with such time limitations in mind.  Every book that has been made into film has had plot holes and missing elements.All of that said, the only truly bad part of Battlefield Earth is the cinematography, but really only one aspect of such.  Too often the camera seemed tilted for no other reason than to depict a chaotic scene, and this just did not come across well.The acting was done very well, the sets and special effects were for the most part done well.  The costumes were not perfect, but I am sure it is not easy to make a 6 foot man appear to be an 8 foot alien.I understand there are going to be some people that truly don't like this movie.  But for the rest of you, please watch it for yourself, and don't listen to other people.",

Needless to say, the cliche works: \"The book was better\".  The characters are more limited, of course.  They rushed things a lot, making it far less realistic.  Just about everything is worse here, and less entertaining.  In fact, the action scenes are even worse!  How's that: a book beating a movie in action scenes.  Perhaps the sequel will redeem it in this department (this is only about 1/3 of the book), since the best action sequence, the fight with the Brigantes, is in that chunk.",

All of these are problems but together they wouldn't be enough to put this film on the bottom 100 films of all time. The one, all-encompassing thing that really kills Battlefield Earth is the enormous amount of stupidity that is omnipresent through all of the 118 minutes. A few examples of said stupidity (SPOILER ALERT): According to the film all the well trained soldiers of earth lasted a total of 9 minutes against the Psyclos but ragtag team of cavemen beat them with our technology.The Psyclos know about the level of technology humans had before the invasion but still think humans are only good for manual labour.They have lived on earth for 1000 years and still have not bothered to learn our language or teach us theirs.Twentyeth century weapons have been lying around in a bunker for 1000 years without becoming even slightly rustyThe humans don't know math such as what a triangle is, but have still managed to build a complicated gate for the wall around the villageThe list goes on but I don't want to write down the entire movie.

First of all, the acting is simply atrocious - no-one, repeat, no-one is believable. Adding to this is that in shortening the book to fit in the obligatory 90 minutes, almost all of the important/exciting/interesting bits of the story were ignored or, at best, changed beyond recognition.I'd still recommend the book, but as for the film, avoid enriching the church's coffers!

I think John Travolta really did mean for his and Forest and the rest of the aliens to come across as more comedic than evil characters. They gave Barry Pepper an award for worst actor I think.

It is unbelievable that Travolta agreed to say such empty and childish lines in a movie. The extremely predictable plot is also something that shows how poorly this film was made. People this century should know better than to have shallow plots such as this one. The movie drags for two hours. Very boring. The special effects certainly did NOT reflect the huge budget of this film. Take for instance, the part that Terl, character of Travolta, throws the \"man-animal\" down an abyss. I found it incredible the obviousness of the screen on the scene. (Don't forget to notice the bad acting in that scene, too.) To topple it up, the names, places, histories were extremely unbelievable. Yes, it is a fiction, but Artificial Intelligence and even Lord of the Rings are more believable than this! In every aspect, this is one of the worst displays of human talent yet. But hey, life goes on. Let the Matrixes and Godfathers come.

Your head will explode trying to figure out what on Earth possessed them to make such a God-awful film. From the outstandingly terrible performance of John Travolta to the script that seems like it has PAGES ripped out, this movie is the picture-perfect image of what should NOT be done during the making of a movie. The creation of this train-wreck should be put into one of those \"Don't Do What Donnie Don't Does\" books and shown to every film student and potential film student in the world. I don't know what's more pathetic, the fact that they MADE this monstrosity or that it cost somewhere around $70,000,000 US. I'm wondering how much of that was spent on the drugs I'm SURE they were on to be able to create such a thing as this. Oh, and don't mistake it for one of those \"It's so bad it's good\" films. It goes beyond good and right back to bad again. In fact, my head is starting to hurt just thinking about it so I'll leave you with one word: **BEWARE**",

But religion, almost without exception makes lousey film - remember the Greatest Story Ever Told?  The reason is that realism goes out of the window, but is not replaced by humour, or horror, or even the avant garde. Its replaced by homage.  Battlefield Earth was a hymn of praise to L.

            "content": "OK, let's get this turd out in the open:Mankind had been enslaved for 1000 years by aliens, & humans have reverted back to basically stone-age mentalities (although some people speak like they live in the middle ages while others sound like they live in modern day L.A.) & yet... 1. in 1000 years, electricity & computers (like flight simulators & overhead projectors) still work somehow, & fighter jets still have jet fuel in them. Also, books & paper are slightly dusty, but perfectly preserved (in Denver no less, which I'm pretty sure gets a lot of damp weather.) 2. these stone-age humans who live in caves & have never seen any technology can master in one week advanced weapons & flight simulations enough to defeat the \"superior\" (dumb-ass) alien race at dogfights & combat. (also, how did they learn modern-day combat lingo???) Apparently, in the year 2000 when the aliens showed up, they conquered earth in 9 minutes. 1000 years later, !cavemen! can beat them & destroy their home planet, with only like 3 people dying. 3. why do the aliens make Barry Pepper so smart & then give him access to all of their records & passwords & equipment, etc? They just want him to mine gold, so why not just teach him only to swing a pick ax, which the human slaves are already doing? 4. why is the dialog so stupid? I read an earlier review that said he watched the movie on cable, so he wondered if he missed anything. Let me tell you buddy, you didn't. At one point Forrest Whitaker said something like \"crap-head\" & they seem to think \"rat-brain\" is a hard-core insult. 5. the best the production design team could come up with for alien alcohol is... glowing green liquid with a straw in it? Seriously, this movie was made in the year 2000, & that's the best you could do? 6. the same goes for the special effects. They're terrible! This movie cost $70 million. It also looks like it was shot on video. & what's with all the dutch angles? There's only 1 or 2 straight shots in the whole movie. & the extreme shots of humans getting sprayed with water? I've seen episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess that look better than this. 7. The acting is disgusting. John Travolta & Forrest Whitaker ought to be ashamed of themselves. How can they deliver lines that sound like they were written by 12 year old kids? I'm not kidding. 12 year old children. Why do the aliens call humans \"man animals?\" If they think of people as animals, why not just call them \"man?\" They don't say \"rat animals\" or \"dog animals.\" 8. The plot is just plain stupid. Why does John Travolta take Barry Pepper to a library for a half hour or so, where he finds... the constitution??? Why? Seriously, I want to know why. 9. Oh yeah, that reminds me... when Barry Pepper is in the prison, he draws a sketch of his girlfriend on a piece of old leather, & somehow... some... how... he's such a good artist that the aliens recognize her when she's out in the wild on her horse, so they can hold her hostage & get him to behave. I mean come on! To sum it up, this movie is more or less a Scientology sci-fi story (sort of) written by LA dick-heads who think they are being deep when they come up with ideas like \"if civilization was destroyed for 1000 years, humans would think mannequins were once people who had disobeyed the gods... dude, that's freaking smart!\" Anyway, that's only about .000001% of what's bad about this movie. I've always liked post-apocalyptic movies, no matter how bad, but this one is just an absolute turd, no matter how you slice it. There is no way anyone could reasonably say this is not one of the worst movies ever made. It sucks. But, I recommend it if you like seeing cave men flying jets (which I kind of do.)",

John Travolta is brilliant as Terl, with his fixation on \"leverage\", status and rats. It's a study in the fantastic and yes, it IS meant to be funny in many places. You just have to look closely to see parallels between the Psychlos, and some of the sadder specimens in modern human society...The special effects are also convincing: Travolta and Whitaker really do manage to be eight foot aliens for a couple of hours!Battlefield Earth is a very fast-paced film, and even though it only reached the halfway mark in the book (wait for the sequel), there's a great deal of action and data to assimilate: keep up or be left behind. An extra half hour would have left us less breathless - particularly if we haven't read the book - and we could have savoured Terl's plottings for just a little longer.\nBattlefield Earth may be in a similar SF genre to Soylent Green, the Planet of the Apes series, or THX 1138 -and probably more of a classic.  It illustrates a pretty dystopian future for Earth and the galaxy, so despite Johnny Goodboy's heroism it may best lie alongside that 'blacker' class of film, rather than the good clean-shaven futuristic swashbuckling of Star Wars or Independence Day. Watch out for the satire, follow the outrageous intrigues, and be entertained.",

Slow plodding, with the only exciting bits being worse than the boredom. I think everyone should see this once, so they can appreciate other movies more. The only positive thing in all this was the hilariously huge codpieces in the aliens' suits, but since Hubbard loathed psychiatrists, I will not mention the word \"overcompensating\"...I can see how this was made to resemble Star Wars with the visuals and the main plot outline: the cosmic Rastafarian bad guy wearing all-black and having some devices implanted to make him resemble Darth. All we'd need is the good guy in white pajamas, some headgear on Travolta and a bunch of irritating 'funny' aliens to bring in the younger kids.Some reference to how bad this really is is the fact, that I loaned this on VHS from a friend who never throws anything away.

I went into this film skeptical about the claims made about it by so many. Yet here I am, 2/10.The best part of this film is whenever John Travolta is on screen. His overacting is the only aspect of the film I have any amount of fun with because- while I'm laughing at the film- at least it's getting something out of me.My biggest issue with this film is its pacing. I'e seen this film a few times and every time I come out of this film exhausted, feeling as if I sat through a film that was 3 hours long or so. I guessed that it was probably 2 1/2 hours long only to find out that it doesn't even reach the 2 hour mark. This film progresses in such a slow way and so little happens in it. If a proper film was made from the material covered in this film, it would probably be closer to 80 minutes. It's such a slog and there's no real payoff in the end.The action scenes are extremely slow-paced and boring. It almost feels like all of the action scenes are in slow motion. My memory is a little foggy, but none of the action is interesting and the bland cinematography doesn't help either.The visual effects used in this film have aged badly. A lot of them now look like they were rendered on video game hardware. Of course the use of visual effects to this extent was still pretty ambitious at the time and the only contemporary of this film that really holds up at all is Star Wars Episode I but...I wish I could say more positive things but everything I could possibly ask for in a science fiction film or science fiction action film is barely present in this film and, even then, not executed well at all. John Travolta is the only thing I liked and that was because I love it when he overacts. I was not invested in his character and I was, instead, looking forward to his over-the-top line delivery and physical acting. This is a film which manages to be only 117 minutes long yet feel longer than films significantly longer than this. It's inept, and that's unfortunate. My only hypothesis is that, maybe, the source material wasn't very strong to begin with? Who knows, though...",

Of course they would, but that doesn't make for a good movie. For a movie to be good you need to actually care about the characters. These cavemen are leaderless mongrels until Barry Pepper's character shows up & gives them a 30 second speech, & then all is well. There is no depth to it at all. The same positive review said it had a good message about how we treat those weaker than ourselves. Again, it was totally on the surface, no depth whatsoever.

            "content": "FIRST IMPRESSIONAs soon as the movie, Battlefield Earth: A Saga of blah blah blah, ended, I jumped out of my seat and applauded.  Because right there, before me, was the movie I have been searching for my entire life; a movie in which a long stream of endless jokes could be accumulated.SUMMARY\nThe story takes place on Earth, of course, and a group of goofy looking aliens take control, and ultimately put every human into slavery.  Then, one day, a puny human (played by Barry Pepper) decides to fight back, and once again reserve control of the Earth for the human race.  Armed with basically pitch forks and grade-school brains, the humans prepare a final assault against none other than.......John Travolta.  The movie is also based on a well-known book explaining about Scientology.First off, Battlefield is the worst movie I have seen EVER.  Lets look at the different components that make up a movie:ACTING: 35%Terrible acting.  I admit John Travolta and Barry Pepper are decent.  You can tell John enjoyed playing this alien guy and his energy on the screen allowed us to hate his character more and more.  Still, just about every other character is terribly one-sided and unrealistic.\nSTORY: 10%Now I'm not bashing on Scientology.  I think its an interesting topic. But the movie doesnt even touch the topic.  The film has the background story, but doesnt bother to explain ANYTHING about the history of Scientology. This is how the movie is structered: an interesting premise in the beginning.......then...........ACTION...and more ACTION.  And I mean mindless action.  Oh, and one part quickly comes to mind, that greatly portrays the filthy nature of this piece of garbage film.  Towards the end of the film (dont worry, I'm not spoiling anything), a group of humans stumble upon an old air base, with fighter jets still intact.  So, after a few practices in the simulator, they're off and flying around in the jets and successfully blowing up strategic targets.  This just shows that the writers just didnt spend much time in writing the story.\nDIRECTION: 0%There just isnt any direction.  Nothing.  No style, just rubbish.  But, who knows.  Even the mastery of Steven Spielberg probably couldnt save this film.\nMEANING: 10%I guess theres a theme some where in there.  Most likely the theme is minorities breaking out of bondage and taking control of their lives and stuff like that.  But anyway, the theme is so not-original and well yeah, just so overused.  Tough luck for making this movie so late.  I'm sure that if this movie was released in the 60s, it would become a cult classic. Still, the only things going through my mind after the movie were evil, evil jokes.  Pure and simple: NO SUBSTANCE.F.F. (a little something I call \"fun factor\") 60%Yes, this movie is moderately fun.....and funny.  If you just want to see a movie for the pure excitement of action, or if you and and your friends are just too drunk to watch \"Aliens,\" then Battlefield is your movie.\nFINAL IMPRESSION  ---25%-Terrible, unrealistic, and one-sided acting across the board.-A script that seemed to be conceived by 4th graders.-Absolutely no direction or style in this movie, just a mess to watch!-Without the crucial Scientology topic in, absolutely no point to the film.-Kinda of fun to watch if you're drunk or dead.Well, to sum up: Worst movie in history, and that inlcudes Dumb and Dumberer.",

            "content": "I'm blaming Roger Christian for many of the failings of Battlefield Earth. But truly he's hardly the most responsible party. I could blame L.Ron Hubbard for writing an insipid book. Or John Travolta's ego for making the insipid book into the insipid movie now available. I could blame Giles Nuttgens for some truly ugly cinematography. Or the entirely special effects crew could be blamed for seemingly spending 75 million dollars to create cheesy \"afterburner\" effects on cardboard looking space crafts. But ultimately there's just too much blame to go around. All that can be said is that Battlefield Earth is possibly even worse than you may have heard. And that's impressive.The plot is a mishmash of science fiction clich\u00e9s, the kind of things a Phillip K. Dick or Robert Heinlein would be embarrassed to even think, much less write. Battlefield Earth takes place a thousand years in the future. Now, we're told on at least two occasions, Man is an Endangered Creature. The planet Earth is ruled by tall, ugly aliens called Psychlos. The Psychlos don't really like the Man-Animals and, for no good reason, keep them locked in cages. But it isn't as if Man is doing so well even without the Psychlos. We're living in caves again and nobody has developed proper grooming standards. That's the premise. There isn't really a plot beyond the fact that Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) wants to lead a rebellion and Terl (Travolta), the Psychlo Security guru, wants to stop him. Things blow up, people say stupid things, and there's a stupid subplot involving Ker, another Psychlo played by Forrest Whitaker, who must have desperately needed this paycheck.There isn't a single piece of the alien technology that looks cool, or even interesting. That's a flaw for a science fiction film. Similarly, none of the images of destroyed humanity (like the shell of the Denver Public Library, or an old mini-golf course) are the least bit evocative. That's a flaw for a post-apocalyptic drama. And none of the action scenes achieve any kind of pacing or momentum. And that's a problem for any film.For some strange reason virtually every shot in the film is at a jarring angle. If Christian's point is that this is a world askew, he probably could have made it was one slightly tilted camera angle. Instead, the artistic pretension just seems silly. Ditto the lengths Christian has to go to to make us believe that the Psychlos are really tall. He'd have been better off using actors in stilts rather than the low angle shots and other tricks he uses. Also, is there any reason why the film keeps going back to slow motion over and over? Slow motion, even used in moderation, is kinda tacky, but it just pulls me out of an action sequence when you add that level of contrievance.While Barry Pepper's performance is just awful, I have no way of telling what the blazes John Travolta is doing. He speaks with a strange stilted accent (British, not Psychlo), his hand gestures are wooden, befitting the silly suit he's wearing, and it all just smells like a bad Saturday Night Live skit performance. Remember the skit where he played a potentially gay vampire? Imagine that gay vampire in an alien suit in a really horrible movie and that's what you have here. My point is that Travolta is funny. Sometimes the humor is intentional (the scene where the Psychlo discover the Man-Animals' food of choice is a hoot), but why does he keep using the word leverage? I kept waiting for Inigo Montoya to arrive from the Princess Bride saying, \"I do not think that world means what you think it means.\" It's all just a mess.I watched the movie with a friend who has extensive experience with film editing and he insists that Battlefield Earth was fairly well edited because it looked like the cutting covered up a lot of even worse work. So with that in mind, congrats to Robin Russell for her excellent work on a 1/10 mess.",

It takes certain elements of Scientology such as using the Psychlos as allegories of psychologists who, according to Scientology, only seek to control the human mind and without forgetting to mention alien life as the true creator of humanity. It's a simple story of a future dominated by aliens and humanity's struggle to reclaim their world. It's a pretty good story for a sci-fi epic, but sadly despite the budget, this movie failed to materialize this story in the way it should have been. Most of the characters are very basic and generic without much depth. Travolta's character is seriously a cartoon character to the point where he becomes inept and is funny instead of intimidating. Only the character of Forest Whitaker shows some common sense. The directing and editing are so rampant to the point where you can get lost and have to use your imagination to figure out what's going on. It is as if the film were trying to make the viewer dizzy. The slow-motion sequences are really good, but you have to keep up or they seem eternal. The digital effects are basic and simple which makes this movie made only for home format. The script is seriously quite mediocre since there are certain inconsistencies, holes and some errors that make one wonder how such a thing could happen. There are even things that become meaningless. Battlefield Earth is a movie that you either have to watch with your brain turned off and let yourself be carried away by the action it has or you have to use your imagination to understand things that it doesn't fully explain. It is not the worst movie that has ever existed since at least the story is good, but it has so many flaws in its development that it ends up being a mediocre movie that few can like. Even so, it is a rather rare and bizarre tape that turns out to be entertaining and more so because of Travolta's overperformance that sadly ended his career, but at least he left a villain so cartoonish and funny that it is not easy to forget.

I don't want to ruin the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet (you'll thank me later) but this was the role that put John Travolta back on top after he almost ruined his career starring in that flop, Pulp Fiction.

Travolta still has that excruciatingly annoying 'dependable cool' thing going only with twice his body weight's load of makeup on. It is utterly ridiculous that the species managed to destroy the human race or most of it and let alone in 9 minutes. And if Terl/Travolta graduated the top of his class it baffles me to think what the low acheivers are like.Jonnie starts off Ok and remains pretty Ok throughout 80% of the flick but the ending is where this thing really de-rails.WARNING: SPOILERS PATROL BEYOND THIS POINTHow the hell could a species who had never before worn anything more than animal coverings or used a gun learn how to fly harrier jump jets, let alone in 7 days, and how did power stay, where was it coming from and how did the global leveling have no effect on the condition of the craft or the instructing machine. If the movie took two hours to get to that point how boring must the 1000+ page novel be. By the way, a previous reviewer named Star Wars EI and The Matrix as writing creditors, way too recent to be named, this movie would have taken two years to make, these books came out in the 80's but if the movie is anything to go by they are a splicing of Star Wars E4 and Planet Of The Apes, they borrowed much of the human-psychlo situation and relationship from POTA and the climax and humans fighting back is lifted straight from Star Wars.This page must currently hold a record. The fifth comment down is the most recent one to speak for the negative. You'll find a crowd rebel on every page looking to make a statement against the rest not supply truth about the flick, but it's funny I don't think I have heard the \"too inteligent to be appreciated\" line used seriously before. One major plus however is the quality and scope of it's effects, they really are something special and I am surprised this was not nominated for them. This flick has only them to recommend it however.4.5/10.",

Ron Hubbard and I imagined it would be hard to make a movie about the story. Maybe it was good that I read the book so many years ago so I lost the imaginary image I had about the characters in the book but I remember that the Psychlos was supposed to look really grotesque! But in the movie they only acted bad, they didn't look repelling enough to be believable and that is pretty fundamental for the story.I was pleased to discover that the move wasn't half as bad as the earlier mentioned Armageddon and despite some over exaggerated scenes the movie was quite enjoyable and the story pretty engaging. The story was however very compressed and I can see that considering the move was 'only' about 2h long.I was expecting a B movie style special effects but even the special FX was better then I had expected. Some of the actors was not so good but what movie doesn't have it's share of them?Summary: If you like SciFi and have a couple of hours to spend I can recommend this movie.",

This piece of cinematic tripe is one of the worst films I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and the fact that is only at number 44 in The Internet Movie Database's 100 worst films list makes me wonder what on earth the other top 43 films are like.I have no sympathy for anyone making, or related to anyone involved, in this battlefield of a project. First of all, the script is a right and honourable flawed, with some of the most irritating insults I have ever hear, and one of the most annoying and poor insult in the history of cinema on a repeatable basis. I was fed up by the number of times I heard \"rat brain\" from Travolta's screen-hogging character, that I lost faith in listening to another line of dialogue ever again in this film with tolerance.And you thought slating the script was going to be my main argument for this appalling film. Well, you will be wrong. That is only the tip of the iceberg of such rubbish! The imagery made things so bland and flat, that if failed to make me understand what is going on throughout the whole film, which is has not been helped in the least by some of the most shoddy slow-motion effects I have ever seen, especially when it comes to seeing those long-hair humans getting hunted down by an alien is extremely dull. Even a fly landing on the TV screen would have been more entertaining to watch then that sequence, and, while I am still slating it, for the rest of the bland sci-fi action.The effects don't do justice either, as I have seen more better effects in films made 40-50 years ago then watching the attempt of some poor blue-screen work making some scenes in it almost unbelievable. Moreover, if anyone finds this effects believable should seek therapy immediately for the sake of humankind! Well, that's it! I am even fed up of writing a review of this film, so I want to conclude as quickly this film grabbed my attention, which was not that long! This film is an insult to sci-fi film-making, I will never trust John Travolta as a respectable actor after a performance so poor as that, and I advise anyone that really wants to watch it, to view something else, with effects that are more effective (The Day the Earth Stood Still, anyone?), a film with better imagery (like 2001:A Space Odyssey), or has a script with sharper dialogue (may I suggest Aliens for this one, for its much better insults to the aliens.) And, have I mentioned that it is definitely the worst film I have ever seen? I have? Good. I shall leave you to watch this film at your own risk.",

Imagine Independence Day (a slice of crud livened up by several charismatic actors) without the occasional wit and operatic drama. Imagine the TV show Falcon's Crest, with aliens. Imagine if Ray Liotta's character in HANNIBAL, after having his brains fed to him by Doctor Lecter, decided to adapt a generic sci-fi novel for the screen. This is the sort of dross he'd probably have created.Let's start with the plot, because it's a real hoot. Aliens have taken over the earth, and enslaved mankind. Originally they enslave dogs, but are surprised to find out that they are ill-suited to manual labour. Uh-huh. Despite their awesome technology, the aliens are about as intelligent as - hey, whose idea was it to adapt an L Ron Hubbard novel again?The film is deeply illogical. We humans (called \"man animals\" by the aliens, which in itself is both stupid and illogical) made a last stand, using fighter jets and tanks, before the Psychlos conquered our puny armies. However, the aliens are baffled when a human gets hold of one of their weapons and manages to work out how to use it against them. Hello! We had tanks and planes, remember? It's not rocket science to pull a trigger.The one thing worth praising about this film is that it is free from Star Trek TNG hokum. There are no proton torpedos that can be reconfigured to solve any possible problem, no matter how absurd, nor are there any cringe-worthy nosedives into soap-opera territory that so plague the Star Trek spin-offs. However, this is a small blessing. Battlefield Earth is certainly not the saviour of contemporary sci-fi. It is a stupid film, riddled with rubbish that should have been abandoned in the rough-draft stages.Shame on you, Johnny T. Here's one film that certainly won't stay alive.",

So, when I was stalking around the video store on a Friday night, I thought that \"Battlefield Earth,\" would be a good thriller to keep me awake. I mean, how bad could it be?I've decided to stop renting movies.Not really, but I have decided to stop assuming that all sci-fi movies have something good about them.  The cover of this particular video falsely hints at a film with plenty of clever action to cover up a most-likely thin plot. Well, I was right about one thing.Yes, the movie does have action; in fact, the last half hour of the movie is crammed with large-scale battle scenes, including an eye-appealing dogfight between alien ships and harrier fighters (I'm not even going to ask what BRITISH-MADE harriers are doing in the UNITED STATES).  But, as so many movies have shown us before, expensive special effects cannot always cover up a really, truly, AWFUL movie.  Believe me, no film to date can attest to this as much as \"Battlefield Earth.\"  The story isn't the problem; as a matter of fact, L. Ron Hubbard's idea of an alien-controlled Earth in the next millennium is quite intriguing for a sci-fi audience.  It's just the horrible way the film was made that makes it, shall I say, Mystery Science Theater material.First, the movie plows right into an already underdeveloped plot, giving virtually no background for the main character (an achingly bad actor with whom one finds it very hard to sympathize).  Then it continues on, boring its audience with unbelievable plot twists and annoying scenes transitions, each one with a screen wipe.  What's with that?Anyway, I am essentially trying to tell those of you out there who find some of these bad movies intriguing, beware.  It is rarely, if ever, worth it.",

These include, but are not limited to, \"An entirely new style of science fiction film-making\", \"Good scene transitions\", and (my personal favorite), action that will leave you \"exhausted\". Sadly, the box said nothing about inane dialogue, ineffably awful acting, and a plot that has so many holes in it, it could be used to strain spaghetti. In my opinion, before watching this movie, you must check the logic centre of your brain at the door, lest it shut down permanently from the strain of trying to make sense of the fact that a highly technologically advanced alien species was still unable to discover Fort Knox.If you want a fun drinking game (and I firmly believe that generous quantities of alcohol can only improve the viewing experience) take a drink/shot every time a Psychlon says the phrase \"Man-Animals\", and every time you catch a glimpse of John Travolta's and Forrest Whitakker's grotesquely over-sized...uh...packages.Speaking of Forrest Whitakker, the man is an Oscar winner. Did he not know what he was getting himself into? Why did he stay once he realized what was going on around him. Some of his dialogue seems like a cry for help. It's unfortunate that his career had to suffer through this movie, although maybe it's just as well that he got it out of the way early. Unlike John Travolta.Improbably, Travolta is worse in Battlefield Earth than he was in Broken Arrow. The man puts in the performance of a lifetime, an awful performance in what he must have known was an awful movie.I have run out of words. If you really must watch this movie, watch it with a group of people with whom you can mercilessly tear it to shreds. At least you'll get some enjoyment out of it that way.

After the first hour of the film, people in the cinema walked out in disgust that they wasted their $10.50 to see this garbage.  I admit, the special effects were one of the best effects I've seen in a long time, but what so good about the special effects if there's no storyline to back it up? Take \"Star Trek\", \"Star Wars\", and \"Independence Day\" and you get \"Battlefield Earth\", nothings original.  My advice to you people out there is, save your hard earned money, and go see \"Gladiator.\" If you want to see a classic, then watch \"Independence Day\" and any of the \"Star Wars\" sequels.  oh, did I forget to mention that the acting was even worse than the movie? Come on \"John\", you can do better than that!",

I really wanted to like this movie, hoping against hope that the critics were wrong. Turns out they weren't that far off. As I feared, this movie is more disappointing than \"The Postman\". After seeing this, I have come to two possible conclusions: 1) John Travolta, talented actor he may be, cannot direct worth a dime.2) L. Ron Hubbards' brilliant science fiction writing cannot be simply translated into another \"Independence Day\". If Travolta had bothered to throw in a scene or two of how Johnny and his band managed to get those harrier jets working, electricity restored, etc., I would have sat through it. I also find it hard to believe that some uneducated tribe members can learn to fly harrier jets better than air force pilots in a week. If it was Travolta's intent to dumb down the translation from book to film, he overdid it. Travolta manages to insult his audience by leaving gaping holes in logic and storyline, laughable scripts and dialogue. Don't worry about any subliminal Scientology messages, the film isn't that sophisticated. If you read the book, don't see the  movie. Save yourself the disappointment and retain the good memories you have of the book.",

Lots of action, the movie is basically one long action sequence. The movie presents Hubbard's satircal humor well and if you have not read B'Earth (as most of those commenting here) and are into fiiillmmm (as it seems most commenting here are) then you will be too busy trying to figure out \"why the film angle?\" or looking for \"subliminals\" that some idiot claimed were in the movie.

Travolta spends most of his time slapping around the other actors and his performance is light-years away from the finely judged delivery of THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,or GET SHORTY. But then his mis-understanding of good science fiction is already well-known from his public comments about Hubbard's novel being one of the keystones of modern SF. Oh yeah? Roger Christian's sole contribution to this mess seems to involve shooting everything in slow-motion. There's no feeling for character development, or respect for the audience's intelligence.

Basically, stories this large, for example 'Dune' cannot be told in the amount of detail necessary to do them justice.Another problem with this format is that the 'bad guys' always come over comic-book style.

            "content": "What I can't figure out is how such an amazing Si-if book could be so badly turned into a screen play. This book needed the Peet Jackson treatment, but instead got mutated into some weird Frankenstein of a re-write. L.Ron Hubbard would roll in his grave if he was forced to watch his masterpiece be mutilated in such a poor fashion. The screen writer (Corey Mandell) and ultimately John Travolta, who produced the film, departed from the script so often, that any fan of the original book is bound to be disgusted. Often times in screen play adaptation, it is necessary to change portions of the original book to better suit the film going audience. However, in this case, they might as well have renamed the film and not credited the original author. There are so many bad choices in the form of cuts and additions, that the film in no way resembles the original piece which inspired it. In fact if Hubbard was alive today, I would wager he would disassociate himself from the film work entirely. I personally loved the book and disagree with screen writer Corey Mandell, who stated that the original book was \"clunky and the dialog awkward.\" In fact his adaptation, coupled by the worst direction of any big budget Si-Fi movie ever, is the only \"clunky\" thing in the room.For example, The idea of Phyclos looking exactly like humans on stilts in 70's lift shoes, is a total embarrassment to all costume designers everywhere. In fact the awful costuming, dismal set design, and off kilter cinematography, totally killed any real fear that Hubbard intended to create when he wrote the world of Phyclos into existence. In addition, the use of 1000 year old Earth tech to overcome the Pyclo's is ridiculously unbelievable. In what reality would 1000 year old fighter jets fire up and destroy a Psyclo compound? Finally, the movie starts with green letters flashing across the screen. They say,\"Man is an endangered species\". The weird thing is that the idea never comes up again. In the book Hubbard dances on that string as a steady dis-tonic note of fear throughout the story line. Mandell totally fails the audience, by not keeping the essence of that tension in the film. Truth be told. The only way to really recreate Hubbard's work on the big screen, would be by breaking it up into 3 full length movies. Conveniently, Hubbard writes the book in 3 distinct sections. He starts with a fractured picture of humanity hanging by a thread. Moves into a section where a thousand years of lost knowledge is recovered and fragmented society is reconnected. Then finishes with a twist when Humanity crushes Phyclo, but then has to fight to stay afloat in galaxy filled with alien races out to fill the void left by the fall of Phyclo. It all ends with a huge political grand finally, where Earth emerges as a universal leader, and humanity is saved.In truth, one real criticism of the book is that it starts out a touch slow. But, after chapter 1 goes into high gear for 1,000 amazing pages. However, the first chapter info is very important to the plot. A creative way to have handled that issue would have been to filter that info into the first and second movie via flash backs. In that way the movie could have started off at a strong pace that would grab a film audiences attention, but still kept the integrity of the story. Any way you slice it up, there is no possibility of packing an Epic novel like Battlefield Earth into a 120 minute quick flick.To boil it all down to the lowest common denominator. The only thing Epic about this movie is how epically it fails all film goers. Whether you are a fan of the book or not, this film was so badly made it fails us all. I highly recommend the book if you are a Si-Fi reader. You will love it! For years it has wowed new and old readers alike. If all you have seen regarding Battlefield Earth is this film, you are missing out. If you haven't yet seen the film, skip it and go to the source. You will be happy you did.",

I was quite looking forward to see who got picked for that part), it was set in about the right area, and the bare basic story was about right (but only the absolute basics - humans trying to retake their world from aliens. Practically *all* of the subplots from the book were missing).However, right at the very beginning the movie starts deviating from the book.  And it goes downhill from there.  Most of the happenings in the movie bore absolutely *no* resemblance to *anything* in the book.  How Terl captured Johnny, the vehicles used, where all the other \"man-animals\" came from, the layout of the company complex, the size of the Psychlos, the relation between Terl and Ker, how Johnny got the bomb to Psychlo, where the humans got the gold - none of these happenings in the movie bore any resemblance to the book.  They weren't even close.When viewed as just a movie, it wasn't too bad.  I'd say about a 7 out of 10.  The FX were pretty good, and (as much as I hate to admit this) Travolta did quite a good job as Terl.  But when viewed as a movie adaptation of the book, it was a miserable flop - 2 out of 10.  The only thing saving it from a 1 was, again, the FX and Travolta's portrayal of Terl.  This was such a bad adaptation it was almost unrecognizable as such.",

Most of the worst parts are lifted straight from the book, and they've been a standing joke in the science-fiction world for years.

Why let the slaves fly around with a spaceship that doesnt have a homeing device on it to track them with.\nThe plot is terrible.  The badguy aliens are here to strip mine the earth of its valuables.  Why not look in all the banks and national reserves before you start mining?  Why not build a cost effective robot to do your digging for you?  Your technology obviously could support it. At least the robots wouldnt need guards to watch over them.Thats right.

I love post-apocalyptic movies and I have had a doubt if I should watch it or not, but now when I finished watching it I can say that I am satisfied.Acting is bad, but not by everybody. I can't believe this is the same Travolta as in Pulp Fiction or From Paris With Love. He produced this movie and did't even try acting! That is really not understandable to me. Camera angles, too much slow motion, weird sound design... These things are really bad. But...The story is good! Costumes are funny, but original. Scenic Design is great, I love the way they created post-apocalyptic Earth. I can not tell if the CGI is good or bad, but on DVD it was good. Maybe it is not the same on BluRay or TV... I don't know that. It is not top quality, but it was made in 2000 or even 1999. We can't compare it to today's CGI. Sure, some other films from the same year had way too much better animation, but that is not something to judge the whole movie.I read somewhere that Travolta wanted to make a sequel, but the negative critics made him to change his mind. Well, John, if you are reading this, maybe now is a good time to do it! Or maybe remake, the story is really good! Think about it...Overall, this is not a bad film, it is not a great one neither, but something in between, I would say. Watch it if you like post- apocalyptic theme.

Especially after what happened with the book in 1990, and the Church of Scientology got busted for paying their members to buy 6 and 7 copies of the novel in order to boost sales and keep it on the bestseller list.  All I thought was that the theatre was going to be filled to capacity with boatloads of Scientologists just waiting for their crack at convincing me and my family to join them in their quest to *Clear* this planet.  And then my brother tells me that I fit the profile since I almost went to an \"est\" training seminar 20 years ago to impress a guy I was dating who had way more looks than brains. But that's another story. It's time to\nPrepare for BattleBattlefield Earth  (Roger Christian) I don't know where to start.  First of all, I would like to say that this must qualify as the most awful film I think it has been my utter displeasure to have attended in my entire life.  So many questions kept mulling in my very busy mind as I succumbed to the ravages of the writers' non-imaginations.  From the novel by L. Ron Hubbard (Church of Scientology founder accused of many bad things) and screenplay by Corey Mandell  (no other screenplays to his credit) and JD Shapiro (Robin Hood - Men in Tights), there is just no way to sit through this film and even try to suspend your disbelief when there are just way too many holes, horrible acting (John, Forrest, please, tell me, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?) and other stuff that bothered me (like, why did their hands look like they bought them at Spencer Gifts after-Halloween sale bins??)  John Travolta, Forrest Whitaker and some other  greedy alien overlords are using what is left of the human race in the year 3000 as a means to their own ends, teaching them to speak their language, fly ships and mine for resources with the intention of exterminating them after they were done. Of course, the slightly evolved neanderthals not only learn these things, they learn to fly Harriers in flight simulators that are over 1000 years old that function with magic electricity and learn to fly like pros in a revolt against the aliens.Then... oh never mind. There is no then.  That's it.  It's a piece of garbage. And I can't BELIEVE they're working on a sequel.   Of course, if you studied your L. Ron Hubbard books and know about the hatred he had for Psychologists and Psychiatrists, it would make sense why the aliens were called \"Psychlos\" and the other bad people were called \"ciatrists\".. hmmmmmm I was wondering if there were more examples of find the Scientology reference in this film, but frankly, I couldn't be interrupted from my yawning marathon. There is so much rip-off in this movie from other films that it's quite offensive.  And what IS it with camera tilting? I don't see the point. The theatres I called were sold out and this one was almost sold out, but when it started, more than half the theatre was empty. hmmmmmm Makes you wonder, doesn't it? In the end, the only thing I liked were the special effects, and the cool, old hologram language teacher and his five minutes of coolness, but they would not be the saving grace of this blunder that won't even be crucified by the now cancelled Mystery Science Theatre and too bad,  because they would have had a field day with this one.Remember.

Really, so lame events that you can see here can't be described unless you see it by yourself - first, stupid nonsenses like \"human animals\" that does not know how to read and then, at the end of the movie, driving combat, supersonic planes and operating nuclear bomb without problem. Then, training for flying (!) in a flight simulator (?!?) without explanation how they manage to get power-supply (?!!) Then, total strange occurrence of snow in one scene (freezing cold and city covered with snow) while in the other scene, everybody wears short sleeves on warm sun. Also, incredible crappy acting (especially of main character who make such incredible stupid faces all the time that is so irritating)... And finally, really annoying and \"over the top\" usage of slow motions in almost every action scene (what the hell was director Christian thinking ? He is not John Woo or Sam Peckinpah , for God sake!)Well, the rest is impressive - and that is last 15 minutes of stunning battle - I mean, battle itself is stupid as the rest of the movie (almost lame as airplane battles from ID4 etc.) but FX made here is simply amazing - especially landscapes and final destruction of Dome, explosions etc. are pretty spectacular.So, because of that last 15 minutes, I will give it 2/10.

            "content": "John Travolta has said in interviews that \"Battlefield Earth\" (written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, of which  the actor is a follower) is, in his opinion, the greatest science fiction novel of all time.  That it may be; I've never read it.  But if it is, you wouldn't know it from watching this dingy, plotless, frenetic-but-deadly-dull mess of a movie. Travolta's comeback was a long time in coming, but this film may kill it outright.The film takes place in the year 3000, a millennium after the planet has been invaded by the Psychlos, a tall, claw-handed gang of stupid space pirates who killed off as many humans as possible and turned the survivors into prisoners (apparently, Whoopi Goldberg's hairstylist was kept alive, as all the aliens sport elaborate dreadlock hairdos).  Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) is part of a survivor commune hidden in the mountains, but while out foraging, he too is captured by the aliens.  Terl (Travolta), the Psychlos' greedy head of security, has found a vein of gold in the mountains, and sends a detail of \"man-animals\" led by Jonnie (who he has schooled in all things Psychlo) to mine it.  However, Jonnie has plans, and with his newly acquired alien knowledge, engineers a revolt to overthrow the alien oppressors and take back the earth.Standard sci-fi stuff, except for the fact that it's done much, much worse than usual.  Director Roger Christian has no distinguished feature credits (most notably, he was a second-unit man on \"The Phantom Menace\"), and judging by his work here, he STILL has no distinguished credits.  This picture is a mishmash of dankly lit, choppily edited action sequences intercut with weakly emoted cliche dialogue.  Apparently, cinematographer Giles Nuttgens was suffering from a crick in his neck during shooting; virtually every shot in the picture is an unmotivated tilt.  Also, someone got a good deal on center-screen wipes when they bought the editing software for this turkey, as about nine thousand scene transitions use this outdated '60s-style device.The characters in this film are so poorly drawn it's almost an effort to come up with something to say about them.  We are given no real reason to root for Jonnie aside from the fact that he's not a Psychlo, and Pepper's colorless performance does little to help his case.  I wouldn't follow him into a buffet restaurant, much less a battle to the death (especially if he'd expect me to eat raw dead rats, which he does in perhaps the film's most disgusting scene).  The rest of the \"man-animals\" don't really register, except for Sabine Karsenti, who plays the single most colorless and pointless romantic interest in cinematic history (and if that's how she was told to play the role, kudos to her; she nailed it).\nThe Psychlos, for all their elaborate gear and weirdo makeup, are a pretty colorless lot.  Travolta apparently forgot everything he learned about playing a bad guy from his \"Face/Off\" sparring partner Nicolas Cage, and instead gives us a bland, one-note cackling evil goon, complete with phony pseudo-British accent and veddy scaaaaarry leer.  Forest Whitaker unremarkably plays his henchman, and Kelly Preston, Travolta's wife, has a rather revolting cameo as a Psychlo temptress.The film's biggest failing is that the screenplay (by first-timers Corey Mandell and JD Shapiro) gives the Psychlos nothing interesting to do. Their motivation for invading  Earth is never really explained; indeed, they just seem to be rapacious destruction-mongers like the aliens in the far-from-great-but-ten-times-better-than-this \"Independence Day\".  They are stupid, greedy, and self-serving, constantly double-crossing one another and devising ill-planned get-rich-quick schemes.  The film almost seems to be playing them as a bizarre parody of sleazy American corporations that gobble up everything in their path.  Still, if American businesses were run as badly as this outfit, there would be even less left of Earth than what the Psychlos failed to destroy.Though it's got the requisite effects and big-time battle sequences, \"Battlefield Earth\" has a chintzy, cheap feel to it that just makes the threadbare script and meager characterizations even more grating.  Can I think of anything positive to say about this film?  Well, it certainly was...loud.  The soundtrack is full of bombastic music and thrumming sound effects that actually shook the speakers in the theatre.  Of course, that may not be such a good thing.  After all, it kept me awake.\"Battlefield Earth\" was Travolta's passion project, and he nursed it for years before inflicting it upon us.  It's ironic, because passion is just what this soulless, sad mess of a picture could use more than anything.",

But the blame can't be all placed with the director, John Travolta has sunk to a new level of shame. In the scant 2 hours of this movie he has undone all the hard work of Pulp Fiction and Tarantino. What a waste! How can such a good actor do such an awful job?! Personally I think he needs to avoid villain roles all together.

Please, if you value two hours of your life, avoid this film at all costs!!!",

            "content": "How can I begin? Well let's start with the price I paid for this err film. \u00a37.99 was \"On Special Offer\", unfortunately Blockbuster sold me this on special offer with the disk still inside.If John Travolta would like to maintain his fan-base, he needs to steer clear of film which incorporate his bazaar religious beliefs. OK, it's an interesting theory, but complete crap to be fair. I can't even bring myself to say the word because of it now being a recognised \"religion\".However, when you start making films based on Scientology and one of L Ron Hubbard's insane novels, you are crying out for a mauling form the critics and anyone who just loves to make a mock of crap films.Remnants of a Semi-developed human race, throw-backs from several centuries of Alien subjugation, OK this is a good idea, but not a new one in fairness.However, the rot starts not with the 45 degree angle shots where the director appears to be wearing an orthopaedic shoe, no, it's with the unexplained imminent self-destruction of the Psyclo planet and the miraculous crash-course these throw back humans take (and complete) in learning how to fly and attack in Harrier Jump Jets.The special effects aren't too bad, good cast includes John Travolta (I don't mind him), Forest Whitaker (should be in better films with his calibre), and Barry Pepper, but the thin story development and ridiculous finale leads me to conclude that the \u00a37.99 I invested in this will ultimately only pay for one viewing of this joke.Severe constipation is far more tolerable.",

The movie tour of Europe consisted of the director telling people \"It's not as bad as everyone in America says it is\"The movie is terrible. The book was terrible. Travolta's career is forever tainted by this bomb. The real shame is that Barry Pepper may never recover from this, and he has serious potential as an actor.What is this film like? Imagine a solid gold statue of a retarded person. Imagine Michaelangelo's David carved out of human feces. All the Scientologists that have come here and said \"read the book\" are only fooling themselves.

            "content": "This film was based on a novel by L Ron Hubbard novelist and founder of Scientology, was Travolta's labor of love for his faith. It was bad on many levels. People feared that this film would have sublimal messages which lead people to scientology. Never fear, people ran from this film in droves.My Fellow humans all critized the effects and cinematography, aside from the bad camera angles. I found the sets and effects to be little above average. besides from Travola and Whitaker in embarrasing Psychlo cosumes I have seen worse effects.Still this film could of ahd knock out costumes and effects and it would of still did not matter. All films depend on the same foundation, Plot. This film's Plot and story was just bad. Poor Dialogue, and a bad story.Blame the writer of the book, Battlefield Earth, The book it was written by L Ron Hubbard. This was the man who wrote many non-fiction \"Scientology\" books. In \"All about Radiation\" he claims gamma radiation is water soluble and the sacred Operation Thetan III level of Dianetics auditing, Scientologists learn humans are descendants of \"thetans\" who were blasted apart by XENU the Galactic Federation warlord.Good Science Fiction is based on science fact, L Ron was not the one for science fact or any method of reason. This film's plot has faults of mythic porportions which many are going to go down in history.Lets review the mythic disaster that is the story.This film takes place in the year 3000. But Denver only looks like it was vacant for 75 years. Put it in perspective The Roman coloseum is over 1,000 is it looks like hell. How come the city did not get overtaken by plant growth. After 30 years of negelct the coloseum was covered in vines and weeds. The streets are clean, sure parts were under the Psychlo fun-dome, even the uncovered areas looked untouched. How are building in Denver still standing after Earth in conquered in 9 minutes, and 1,000 years of Psychlo domination?Then there is Fort Hood, ignorant cavemen find an army base which is still standing and has a bunker with pristine M16 rifles and working harrier jets and a running simulator. USMC pilots spend over 100 hours of flight time to learn the harrier jet. These illiterates are flying like Top Guns in 10 days. According to one cave-idiot, flying a harrier is like breaking in a wild horse.The Psychlos are defeated by these humans because they are mentally handicapped. Terl(played by Travolta) takes the most dangerous and rebellous human Johnny Goodboy Tyler, and teaches him all he needs to know for revolution, H een taken him to the denver library, where paper has lasted for 1,000 years. Yet my dads old playboy's from the 70's started to wither and fall apart after 10 years.When handed bars form Fort Knox Terl totally buy's Johnny's line \"We smelted then in bars in your honor.\"With all these screw-ups, it appears the screenwriter was comatose at the keyboard. With all these inconsistencies, I'm suprised I did not see a scene where Johnny find a pristine 7-11 with electricty, working slurpee machines, fresh milk and hot dogs still revolving on the warmer. That would still be more believable since we know 7-11 Hot Dogs and pizza sticks have shelf life of 1,000 years.This film is the second worst Sci-fi I have ever seen, #1 is Theodore Rex. This film was created to push an insane religon, Theodore Rex was just plain stupid.",

In what was once the United States, what's left of humanity struggles along in primitive, remote, hidden communities in the Rockies. The Psychlos are intent on stripping the planet of its minerals. The plot concerns the eventual resistance of subjugated humanity. I won't give anything else away. Amazingly, there's little blood or real violence. Those who judge movies by their body count will be disappointed until the end. If there was any propaganda from the so-called Church of $cientology, it sailed right past me. The movie also goes on a bit too long but, though no masterpiece, it is undeserving of the brutal reviews it has received. It's just a typically silly Hollywood sci-fi film, more intelligent and interesting than witless junk like, say, Starship Troopers, but Star Wars, it's not.",

This preview crowd was enormous, as evidenced by the square yardage the whole flock of us took up in the food court outside the theatre. Believe me, this was a huge gaggle of folks. And they all seemed excited to be there. Why was I there? Well, I somehow knew how it would all turn out in the end...But my dear sweet heaven... I had no idea that a movie could really and truly be so incredibly bad. Words do not begin to describe the times when the stupidity of the dialogue or the inanity of the plot smacked me cross-eyed with embarrassment for whoever directed this monstrosity.Okay. Okay. Calming down. Surely there were good points... Ever want to see John Travolta stomp around in Gene Simmon's KISS boots and an 8-inch forehead? Well, this is the movie you have been waiting for. Ever want to see a poor agrarian tribesman fly a Harrier jet with Luke Skywalker-in-the-Trenches precision after seven days training? Then step right up, my friend...The plotholes are enormous. The acting is so over-the-top that it drops over the visible horizon, whirls around the equator and smacks you right across the back of the head. Yes, there were funny parts, but not the ones that were intended. When it tries to be chilling in its post-Apocalyptic view of our modern world from the eyes of our millennium-yet-to-be born heroes, it simply comes off as cornball and hackneyed. This kind of hike through an overgrown and disintegrated cityscape has been done before, and done so much better. Bruce Willis wandering around a decayed Baltimore in 12 Monkeys, or even the boy rebels of The Tripods (BBC) skulking around an abandoned future London, both of those had more believable emptiness and loss than BE's incredibly obvious models.The score is suprisingly reminiscent of Vangelis's contribution to Blade Runner. Almost too much so. Come to think of it, the alien domes in BE look a lot like the android pyramids in Blade Runner. And a lot of the alien technology has kind of a Blade Runner style to it. Even when our hero is shot in the back (there's one, set for stun) while running through a dusty old mall, the impact sends him running and crashing through about four plate glass windows, much like the first android Deckard shoots in Blade Runner. Hmmm......Is it worth seeing just from a \"its so bad its good\" perspective? No, but I suspect that it will develop a summer cult following of those who appreciate unintentional camp, even if its not so good. So there you have it. The anti-Scientologists were right. This movie will have an effect on its viewers, but perhaps not the one that good old L. Ron would have approved.But then, I guess I'm just not the Operating Thetan I could be....",

This was hilarious, the whole demeanor of this character.Meaning he thought that being depraved of food for days in severe cold, with no possibility to make a fire, they (The escaped, or more to the point they'd been allowed to escape), they come across a rat.\nSo, with little choice they, after some hesitation, sinks their teeth into this rat. All in order to survive.\nThe conclusion of Travolta's character: It's their favorite food!\nThey've also been spied upon with hidden cameras.If you just ignore basically the whole script (Which really isn't that bad, really!), and just watch it for the comedic parts it's a good movie.I'd say that without Travolta and Forest Whitaker as aliens, this would indeed be worthless. In my opinion they're perfect as the ever scheming, dubious plotting. black mailing aliens.\nSo, ignore the mediocre costumes and other stuff that seems bad and focus on these two characters as kind of stupid aliens with low expectations.\nThese clowns couldn't possibly invade a planet, could they..?See it, laugh at it, enjoy it!",

My first bit of advice is do not go to this film expecting to see what your head has dreamt up in the process of reading the book. If you haven't read the book, then you might enjoy the film more than I did. I have been following Travoltas' attempts to make this movie happen since the late '80s. This was back when he was trying to get Romero to do it, but Romero was too tied up doing one of Stephen Kings' books to try. The scope of the story in it's book form is huge. I always wondered how whomever made this movie would manage to wrangle this story into a solid film. Well, in my opinion, it didn't happen here. So much of the core of the story was left on the cutting room floor or in Travoltas' head. The only character that I believe stood up to its literary counterpart was Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, played by Barry Pepper. Good job Barry. The Psychlos were visually believable but the nowhere near as intense as the book portrayed. To all of you who keep comparing the Psychlos to a mix of the Ferengi and Klingons from Star Trek, all I have to say is  weak, weak. Be a little more original in your comparisons. You should count yourself so fortunate to have those two character types to use as a comparison. This movie could easily have been made in '89 or '90 had there been the money and interest and who then would you have used to draw upon for character comparisons, hmmmm? Weak. There are major segments of the book story that are completely gone in this movie. This event by the book was *supposed* to be a global event, not an \"American\" event. The planet was attacked, not just the good 'ol USA. Oh well, I could ramble on for 2k or more about it's shortcomings. It was less than what I had expected considering the amount of time, money and desire Travolta had invested in making this movie. It is, in my opinion, an epic ruined. I sincerely think that had this film been lengthened to 3.5 to 4 hours long, maybe with an intermission, it would have been a massive success. Anyway, off to hopefully enjoy the X-Men I go.",

The sets and special effects may not be awe-inspiring, but they're reasonable nonetheless; in other words, it may not look \"cool\" but it does the job.My main gripe is that it drags on quite a bit near the end.

Battlefield Earth provoked me like no cinematic experience ever has. The intricate matrix behind the weave of negative energy, the sheer vastness of it, had triggered a physical response.Then it struck me: How many movies have tried and failed to trigger such a response? I've been exposed to so much strong, thought-provoking, heartfelt human drama, and felt so much that I wanted to scream, but I've always managed to tether if not the emotional response, then at least the physical. But Battlefield Earth made me scream in agony. The dimensions of its torturous badness are simply incomprehensible. It truly IS the worst movie ever made and that is an important landmark.Plan 9 From Outer Space, Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait, Bride of the Monster - they're bad, oh man they're bad, but in a way that makes you giggle. Ed Wood movies are bad in an endearing way. The poor broke man was doomed from square one. He wanted so much and had so little going for him it just breaks my heart. Ed Wood's fate is a testament to the human spirit, duly noted by Tim Burton.But Battlefield Earth is bad in a scary way. None of Ed Wood's excuses apply here. It had $22M and serious studio and distribution backing it. Every nauseating 45 degree tilted shot (i.e. 95% of the movie), every inexplicably drawn out dramatic slo-mo action shot of non-dramatic non-action, the demise of a wooden cow, every cringeworthy piece of dialogue, every gaping black hole of plot antimatter... is for REAL. Planned, executed, approved and widely distributed. They wanted you to see this sculpture of crusty snot.The bad guys in this movie, the Psychlos, fail miserably to convey evil. But the movie as a whole is shockingly successful in conveying it; This pitiful movie is the essence of pure evil. It invokes vertigo, nausea and pain like no theme park will. It is the ultimate bad experience. All artistic merits herein are immeasurable even on a negative scale.",

This was a major motion picture with tons of money pumped in to it, a cast of some fairly accomplished actors, full studio support, an experienced crew, and all the other makings of a good film. Nobody died during filming so there was no sloppy reediting to accommodate unfinished scenes. This was the film the production wanted to make and did. You can't compare this to bad grade B or Z movies where there is no budget or talent attached or films where inexperienced directors, crews and editors put together shoddy work. Nobody expects a kid in little league to hit a pitch thrown by a major league ball player, but we do expect the 30 million dollar a year player to be able to. I can't think of a worse major film than BATTLEFIELD EARTH (and there have been some real stinkers) with its choppy slanted camera work (why was every shot at a severe angle? was the director trying to hypnotise us into believing the movie didn't suck?), embarrassingly inane dialogue, horrible makeup effects (note the aliens' constant change in stature next to humans from scene to scene-the alien is 3 feet taller than the human, now he's the same size, now he's taller, etc.) and complete disregard for logic and natural law.

The HELL of a ride.The movie kick off rapidly and introduce you rapidly with the concept of the movie and when it start it never give up.The chase scene with jonnie running are well done and keep acumulating this feeling of \"it`s gonna explode by the end of the movie\".Did it explode?OH yes it does.The last 30 minute of movie a pure mess of action scene over action scene. Battlefield Earth is one of those rare movie that give a real sense of confusion to a battle.The camera work move from character to character and never give you time to breath,moving from harrier combat trought the city to Jonnie runing from psychlos. Well on the bad side,not everyone can understand the true aspect of the movie who is to entertain.The backstabing story is a real fun to watch and not everyone can understand that the movie don`t take itself to seriously and let you laugh with the bad guy,a thing rarely done in holywood.Some may say that John Travolta`s laugh is anoying but it`s another part people don`t understand about the movie.The psychlo`s laugh is there to show how the bad guy are \"evil\".It`s like the old good comic book when the bad guy laugh at the end and say \"i`ll be back next week\".It`s part of the humour that is there to show that the movie don`t take itself seriously. Another point people don`t get when watching the movie:it`s an HEROIC movie.Most people kept complaining about the 1000 years old harrier jet piloted by caveman with 7 days training.Well that`s part of the heroic movie.Look at a John Woo film,character jump in the air while shooting people and fire 50 bullets with the same two gun without reloading.Well that`s part of the heroic style.It`s not believable.SO? Ok compared to the book the movie lacked the scots but they were restrained by budget.Final note:Battlefield Earth is a great thrill in the mummy branch.The feeling of high adventure is present and the epic feeling is present in every minute of the movie.It`s not a perfect movie but if you want to see a great blockbuster with a good bag of action a subtle humour then this movie is for you.Oh and don`t forget to leave your brain at the door of the theatre,you won`t need to feel the pure essence of Battlefield Earth:The pure form of entertainement",

However Battlefield Earth (the movie) might be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The movie is filmed in very dark blues that give the film a gloomy washed-out look and feel.  The pacing is very bad and John Travolta's performance as Teal is humilating.The basic story takes place in 3000 A.D.  The human race is nearly exterminated back in the 20th Century by a cruel race called Psychlos. The security chief Teal (John Travolta) captures a human, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper - much better as the Southern Baptist sniper in \"Saving Private Ryan\") to have him dig gold.Jonnie enlists the help of some Scots and decides to kill all the Psychlos and free the planet.  Well good enough.The worst thing is the way the movie mishandles the Action/Adventure sceens. In the book there are several great action sceens that should be slamdunks but somehow the movie is more a set design piece than trusting the narrative.For example, somehow they messed up one of the key sceens in the movie where Jonnie substitues gold-filled coffins teleporting back to Psychlo with Nuclear weapons.All in all simply a dreadful movie.  In fact I was hoping the Psychlos would win so there wouldn't be a sequel.  However since the movie tanked at the box office I don't think a sequel is in the cards.Regardless I want my money back.",

From the opening, you're sucked into a fantastical world unto itself, with dark images of giants pitted against the last survivors of the human race. Reminiscent of `Planet of the Apes', with man -- stripped of technology and thrown back to his roots -- `Battlefield Earth' is an epic adventure the whole family will enjoy. Not your run-of-the-mill science fiction film, it delves into man's age old quest for knowledge and the delicate balance of technology versus nature. If you liked the novel, you'll love the movie with its visually stunning and unique approach to the material. It takes Hubbard's characters and colors them with the 21st century in sleek costume designs and state-of-the-art make-up effects. John Travolta as the Psychlo villain looms before us, employing humor in his evil antics so effectively it will make your skin crawl. Barry Pepper proves to be an engaging and likable hero, leading the enslaved humans in a winner-take-all battle for the planet. `Battlefield Earth' is a great escape from the summer heat!Vivian Schilling Author, Actress and Screenwriter",

            "content": "Battlefield Earth is the story of one man's search for something better, not for himself, but for his people -- a people who had no concept that any other way of life was possible. It was offered simply as a pure science fiction story, yet its allegory is inescapable. Written at a time when the 70s were just giving way to the self-indulgent 80s, it chillingly predicted corporate America emerging as a gladiator ring of loathsome back-stabbing ala \"Bonfire of the Vanities.\" The Psycho corporate empire embodies the worst of 80s corporate life -- Wall Street without the social conscience -- while individual Psychlos are obnoxious, insensitive, corporate drones. Indeed, the concept of an alien invasion force being driven by economic and not military imperatives is unusual for science fiction. Jonnie's message is that individual initiative can accomplish the impossible. And to bring this point home, both L. Ron Hubbard and the makers of this movie have set for Jonnie a truly impossible task: teach an illiterate population how to throw off the yoke of an alien occupation with vastly superior technology. And do it before the aliens have a chance to react. Truly impossible. But he did it. The movie embodies the spirit of the book through rich imagery. Humanity is a ragged mess; the rotting carcass of the old culture whose history is quickly being replaced by superstition. The aliens are at first perceived by Jonnie (and portrayed on the screen) as darkly foreboding, all-powerful gods, whose very presence instills fear. Yet, as Jonnie acquires more knowledge he -- and the audience -- begin to see them as the bumbling fools they are. By the end of the movie, we know these villains as lumbering incompetents whose loyalties can be bought and sold. We as an audience see it first, but then Jonnie and his friends see it. And as they do, the portrayal of the aliens on the screen changes. This simple movie can be enjoyed for its pure entertainment value, or for its rich satire and allegory. Either way, it is a gem of a movie.",

But a novel allows a reader to suspend all rules of physics and imagine. Films, not so much. First time I watched, my opinion was similar to all the others. But there was a feeding frenzy when this picture came out so everyone - including this reviewer - emphasized every little problem with it. But I read the book again this year, and it still thrills me. And watching the picture - actually the first time all the way through - I have changed my opinion. First off, it would be next to impossible to make this movie with live action instead of animation; 9 foot aliens are real difficult to present on the big screen. Second, the depth of character development presented in a thousand pages can't be told in 120 double spaced page of script. Third, the depth of plot ditto. But if I take this picture, knowing well the book, I think it's pretty well done and that it would be hard to do better. The CGI - for the time - is first rate, the capture of 500 pages into 2 hours would have been an enormous challenge and it has a beginning, middle and end. I loved it this time; think it a better picture than Star Wars as one of a similar genre. If you look for technical stupidities in an SF flick, then you can't only look here, look at all the time travel futuristic movies: they depend on defying the natural rules of the universe, so this picture shouldn't be held to a different standard.

I spent most of *that* movie wanting to scream at the screen.Battlefield Earth I could at least create a suspension of disbelief with, and be entertained for a bit.Battlefield Earth is entertaining \"meh\". The worst 100 movies of all time are so bad that you can't even follow the story, or understand the characters motivations (Aliens vs Avatars, Plan 9 from outer space, Sucker Punch (ok, so the story there is understandable, but stupid)).If you think this movie belongs on bottom 100 then you haven't seen many movies. If you ignore that it's based on Scientology (or whatever) then it's just another Hollywood meh.",

I read some other 'positive' reviews on this to see if there are more people out there like me, but it seems nobody really got it and most people thought of it as a 'hilariously' (didn't see anything funny in the entire movie but OK) bad movie. Well, it's CLEAR you all missed out on what could have been one of THE best cinematic experiences of your life.The plot is one of sheer brilliance, it was adapted from a sci-fi book but no way a book could fairly display the emotion and impact the story brings us in this movie. It's an epic tale of oppression and rebellion, far exceeding the standards set by more mediocre flicks on this subject like Star Wars. This story binds us together as humans, as inhabitants of earth, it shows us that race and nationality are ultimately irrelevant issues and we should work together as one if we want to survive. Apart from the great moral it's still a breathtaking movie, with very clever dialogue, a passionate love interest and fast-paced action scenes which set Sonny Chiba to shame.The cinematography is mind-blowing. The SFX are so well done this movie could have come out last year and nobody would have noticed. And last but not least, the camera work and editing should be an example in film school. This part of the movie, if you have an eye for it, is especially good. The creativity in use of camera-angles, slow-motion and scene cutting is why I found the Star Wars films to be only mediocre in comparison.All in all definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys cinema on a higher level.",

I had just finished reading the novel (although enjoyable... and I can't believe I'm about to say this... could have ended about 300 pages sooner) and wanted to see how a two hour movie could do justice to a 1200 page novel.  I waited for the movie to appear at our dollar theater.  I went with a bunch of friends and afterwards we all came to the conclusion that it was a waste of money.  Why?  I'm really still trying to figure that out.  The acting was underdone.  The direction was at times pointless... the screen play was... well, left a lot to be desired.  I realized that I was so not into the movie that I saw it on sale someplace for less than a dollar, and still couldn't bring myself to buy it.  The other day it dawned on me that I would have paid a buck for the DVD case alone and gotten a free coaster to go with it.  Oh well, live and learn.  I know that somebody must like the movie, I would definitely like to know who.  And by the way, had Travolta made a good movie since THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER?",

When I rent this DVD, I had no idea what this movie was about. (I had heard the harsh critics, so I thought that this movie was really bad),but after the completion, I was not frustrated or in laugh because of the petty Special FX, it was OK for a DVD rental ... for a Friday night movie. Personally I love post-apocalyptic movies, so the theme was fine with me. Of course there was a lot of inconsistency (like the fuel in the planes that was still okay after 1000 years... ) but it's a movie and I didn't expected it to be perfect...

Along with Gladiator, I expected it to be among the first \"summer\" movies that I intended to see.  I never got around to seeing it, mainly because of the fact that it came and went through the theater in about 2 weeks.  The reviews were so bad that I didn't immediately go to see it (as I had planned) but waited, hoping that someone I knew would see it first.  (I even picked up the book and staggered through about 350 pages before putting it down).  I finally got around to seeing it tonight, and obviously by this time, I did not expect much.  In that regard, it didn't disappoint.  I've never in my life seen a movie so totally bereft of a plot.  I've seen deeper substance from bold, unashamed \"B\" movies that are designed only for late night cable.  This movie just sort of blunders along with no guidance whatsoever.  It seems to be somewhat based on the portion of the book that I read (which wasn't bad, just not compelling enough to finish), yet in no way did it capture my interest for even a short time. Even though I knew the plot of the movie (from the book) and was able to perhaps appreciate it slightly more than someone who had no previous knowledge, the movie just doesn't do anything right.  The action scenes are unimaginative, and would feel right at home among the Sci-Fi networks' collection of failed 1970's space shows.  The special effects are passable, but underwhelming, and really don't make any attempt to \"show off\" as did \"Independence Day\"  In the end, I just get the sense that \"Battlefield Earth\" is quite simply a decent book that is entirely too long to be made into a two hour movie.  It was obvious that the film's producers were desperately trying to incorporate a 1500 page book into far too short a timespan, and as a result too much plot and characterization is left behind. The most disturbing news is a rumor that John Travolta is trying to drum up support for a SEQUEL of all things.  I've heard that he will partially fund the production himself, if necessary.  Hopefully he'll get a grip on reality and realize that almost no one cares to see any more of this storyline...",

I wouldn't say it's as good as Donnie Darko or interstate 60 or a few of my other favourite movies of all time but this movie definitely fits into my top ten movies of all time. Along with Pulp Fiction, Evil Dead 2 and Beowulf. I fear that Beowulf will probably be suffering the same slandering as battlefield earth on the message boards. Just because a movie doesn't have multi-billion dollar effects it does not mean it is a bad movie. Just because a movie does not deliver its dialogue in a clich\u00e9d manner does not mean it is a bad movie. Just because a director tries something a little different does not mean it's a bad movie. This film contains some hilarious moments and Travolta has a certain charm about him that made me a fan of his for life. His wit is so dry that I found myself smiling every time he was on screen.

Its gritty view of the future gives you an idea of what being conquered by plundering aliens might do to the Earth.  It's set in the year 3000, a thousand years after the aliens arrived -- man has become \"man-animal.\"  B.E. is simply 18th Cen European colonialism in a futuristic setting.  To get into the spirit of B.E., you have to suspend credulity and go with the flow... Don't get sidetracked with \"But that can't happen,\" or \"They couldn't do that in 7 days!\" Sure, Harrier jets would not be able to fly after a 1,000 years (or even ten years) of neglect.  The alien humor in B.E. is right on -- the Psychlos (why not spelled \"Syklos\"?) comment about and treat the man-animals exactly the same way the British did the wogs in India.

Another thing you will need to set aside is any knowledge of how things REALLY work, and what their shelve lives are. Matter of fact, just set aside everything, dumb down a few levels, and you can enjoy this movie.Overall, there are so many gaping holes in this story, it is absurd to even remotely think it could be \"remotely possible\". Of all the alien invasion films, this is the least believable. After a 1000 year occupation, I would have to believe the Earth's resources would have long been depleted. Especially since the aliens are vastly technologically superior to humans. And, on top of that, I would have figured that an uprising would have taken place LONG before a thousand years would have even come up.This is why L. Ron Hubbard is referred to as a \"Failed Science Fiction Writer\" in many circles. Come on, even his Xenu based alien mythos that is the basis to all of Scientology sounds like a really bad, and borrowed, science fiction story. Go to Wikipedia, and look it up! Aside from the Canyon like plot holes, the acting, special effects and musical score are NOT that bad. I have scene a LOT worse than this, trust me. I doubt many of the humorous lines were intended to be as humorous as they were, but that is one of the little quarks about this film that make it a guilty pleasure to watch.I would dare say that this films is a good \"starter\" sci fi film for the youngsters as it does not require thinking to enjoy the action and adventure qualities. For the more astute viewer, there is a lot of films out there that are better, and don't even come close to the standard that Star Wars and Star Trek have established.Don't buy this film.

I watch it with my kids who are grown ups now, and we laugh as we remember some of the scenes, it's part of our lives. Fun like the 5th element, Demolition Man, Enemy Mine and other curiosities.",

Most people were against this movie because they either heard someone else give it a bad review, or they are against Scientology and L Ron Hubbard for making it. I'm not going to get into the religion thing, if it is classified as a religion, just the movie at hand. It had a good deal of badly done scenes, but most the plot (not all) is justifiable. The utter stupidity of man, for instance, seems like bad writing, but after 1,000 years of mostly primitive life, that can be expected. The fact that all the \"tribes\" speak the same language is bad writing. Watching the movie with a clean slate, and without judging the writer for his religious beliefs, the movie is not bad at all. Personally, I think it deserves between 6 to 8\u00bd stars.",

The people in the cinema reacted quite enthusiastically whenever the humans were beating the Psychlos, so the movie does create an effect.The \"sci-fi\" was done well, and contributed to the story line. The Psychlos use their technology in a familiar everyday way, so that it seems like an action movie which just happens to be 1000 years into the future. The whole technology thing just makes sense and there are no stupid oddities, thank god. These days it is common that the technology doesn't get exploited fully by the characters because it got to powerful, or some things just contradict each other. I guess Hubbard's years of experience in writing this stuff show through.However, I read the book a year ago, and many things that make the book so much fun are missing from the film. Perhaps the right order would be seeing the movie first, and then read the book. The movie relies on graphics to do what the book did with details. So you have to keep them independent from each other to some degree.Basically, if you saw the movie, you _have_ to read the book. And if you have read the book, go see the movie and see all the scenes come alive; I think you will find them very real.",

Unless Buck Rogers could fight off the evil space invaders!      Do you miss those days? Those movie serials?  The simplicity of good and evil where good always triumphs????      Well I got the movie for you!  John Travolta decided to resurrect one of L Ron Hubbard's old science fiction books from that era.  Bring it to life with modern effects, sets, and all the glitz that Hollywood and lots of money can produce!  And he even stars in it, with another great actor, Forest Whitaker!  It doesn't get better then this for all us teen age males pining for those golden years of the 1950's!!!!!!! \tOh\u0085..one problem, not a major problem, he forgot to update the story\u0085.make it believable\u0085., make it entertaining\u0085., make it\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.watchable. \tImagine a marriage of Buck Rogers and John Travolta.  A Buck Rogers movie updated with the latest technology, but the story/plot the same.  This is how bad this movie is.  I kept waiting for someone to interrupt the movie(like a Woody Allen movie) yelling CUT!  This stinks!  We got to throw it out and redo it!  No such luck, the movie just keeps grinding away getting more and more insane and unbelievable as it groans to its finish: the one lone woman kissing the hero while all the men cheer, the evil guy imprisoned, the evil home planet destroyed, mankind saved from the Psychlos, who by the way, look like Klingons with dreadnaughts! \tWhat can one say?  One can only shake one's head in disbelief that they made this movie, spent all that money, forever embarrassed themselves.  What is the lesson to be learned here? Pride goeth before a fall comes to mind, or just because you are a great actor does not mean you are a great director/movie maker, that old science fiction should stay just that, old!\tUnfortunately this movie is not so bad that it qualifies for a fun campy bad movie, the kind one can sit around and laugh at.

I would suggest that some of the poster's should maybe take the time to read the novel which is a little convoluted but ultimately worth the effort. The novel may in someway explain more plainly the use of the learning machines employed by the Psychlo's even though they are a fairly prominent feature in the film , maybe the watchers should have spent more time watching the movie instead of thinking up \"witty\" comments to post on how bad it was.

You know, where you just sit back and say to hell with all the technical flaws and just take it as it comes. forget about the 1000 year old weapons and jet fuel that still work fine. Forget about the 1000 year old tritium in the nuclear warhead that really only has a half life of 20 years. Forget the fact that the aliens knew that the man animals had built all the buildings and technology on the planet and now don't even think that they can mine ore. Forget that,,, okay, wait, maybe I'm asking you to forget way too much. Anyway, I'm an engineer so technical flaws are usually pretty abundant in any sci-fi movie, so I just eventually decide to forget about them.With all that behind us, the movie was actually pretty enjoyable. The special effects were very good and Barry Pepper was performing some very impressive action scenes. This was a way that I've never seen him before and I thought that he did one hell of a good job. If nothing else, this movie showed us what he is capable of. Anyway, Travolta as a arrogant alien was also pretty good but a little overdone and simplistic at times. His endless interaction with Whittaker was on the verge of too much though. All in all it was a pretty good escape fantasy type movie though.\nI wonder if all these negative reviews on it are really the way people found it or just anti-scientology propaganda. I think scientology is a joke but I'm not about to hold that against this movie. I enjoyed it.",

In such a way, Battlefield Earth is the satisfying next chapter in filmed science fiction that \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" was supposed to be. It has all the raw energy and crisp, brilliant storytelling of the original Star Wars, along with it's own blend of intense, relentless action and ironical humor that made that film a landmark offering. The classic sf book, Battlefield Earth must have been a major headache to adapt; action scenes spanning the universe, intrigue, political drama, speculative science, and a long cast of unforgettable characters.  That the team that brings us this new film managed to capture the spirit of the book as successfully as they have is a testament to what could only be an intense personal dedication to \"getting it right\", and audiences will reap the benefits. The actors do a magnificent job.  Barry Pepper looks like he worked his ass off doing this part. His intense, chiselled looks and expressive determined face really sell the heroics, and you believe his dedication completely. John Travolta takes a chance on his career that no other leading man would- an evil alien.  And he finds a way to have the most fun doing it.  I laughed and laughed at his evil glee. Forrest Whittaker, as well, takes a huge gamble and pulls off one magnificent performance. Kim Coates is delightful.  His contribution is really key, and in the final battle, really drew me into an understanding of why one makes the ultimate personal sacrifice. The special effects are the best I've seen since \"The Matrix\".  In particular, the space vehicles are full bodied, \"real\" and compelling, not \"lean\" like most CG spaceships we are now bombarded by in any sf offering on TV or film.  You could feel the mass of them.  Awesome effects in the finale. Some have found cause to criticise Battlefield Earth because of the religious beliefs of the producer/star Travolta.  I find this sad, particularly since the message of BE, as in many other important movies, is the sanctity of all life, respect and tolerance of one another.  For some reason, though one never reads (not since nazi germany) of \"Jewish messages\" being a reason to avoid a work of entertainment, such courtesy is not extended to Travolta, whose Scientology status is well known and publicized. I find it in very bad taste to let one's intolerance of another's religion get so out of hand as to bad mouth Travolta's talents, which are formidable, because of it.  Must we behave with such rudeness? Battlefield Earth is fun, fast, loud and funny, and is a great tale of the struggle for freedom, a theme that continues to resonate and have deep meaning to all.  I highly recommend it.",

OK, the locations and special effects were excellent and the way they filmed it so that no blood would be needed was good, but the simple story and believability of it was just too much to ignore. I am pretty flexible, but I literally began to laugh at some of the points in the movie!The Psychlos were an interesting race, but they were totally two-dimensional. This is also the fact with the human characters. Jhonny seems to be a cross between Braveheart and the usual hero stereotypical hero and doesn't seem to develop at all throughout the movie, well apart from becoming a math wizard, physicist, psychlo speaker, and weapons expert all thanks to the learning machine. Terl as well seems to be a cross between a giant turkey, a Klingon, and a Ferengi. He laughs alot, speaks with an English accent, and doesen't seem to have many brain cells.Plot wise, the story is coherent, but again dull. It is the year 3000, people have degraded in to tribal people and cave people after the psychlos conquered the Earth a thousand years ago in 9 minutes! As the people rummage around the planet like monkeys, the Psychlos mine it for precious metals. Terl, determined to leave the planet, is told that he has to stay for another 50 years on the planet. He freaks and decides to bribe his way out, when he discovers an unknown gold vein in the mountains. He decides to get a few humans (to the Psychlos, they are considered animals and are appropriatly called man-animals) and make them mine the vein for gold. He picks one of the humans to be their leader, but needs him to be smart. So, he throws him into this learning machine and makes him learn the Psychlo language. In the process however, Johnny, learns other things and manages to get himself onto it a couple of more times, in order to learn mathematics. Being smart he plans a revolution to take back the planet yada yada yada. This is when it becomes more and more unbelievable. He reads the declaration of independence and gets patriotic and recruits some of his human friends to join him. Now they all speak intelligently, but whenever they get riled up, they act like monkeys again. This I do not understand! Almost like they are two different people. Then later on when Jhonny manages to find a bunch of \"in working order and fully fueled\" 1000 year old harrier jets, he tells a bunch of cave men to fly them! Of course, they learn by using the flight simulators that are there, but they only have 7 days in which to fly them! Ok, TODAY it takes more that 2 years to even learn how to fly a harrier jet, which happens to be one of the more difficult fighters to operate. But these cave men manage to do it in 7 days, quite biblical if you ask me. Then as they attack, they also seem to learn flight talk too! But ayway, at this point I gave up. Finally they manage to blow up the planet Psychlo with a nuke the size of a beer keg! OK...The theme if this film was basically the freedom from oppression and that learning is the key to freedom. But then of course theres the whole deal about leverage! If you got it, you got power! At first the psychlos used it alot, making it seem like an evil thing, but at the end of the film, the humans use it too! And as we left the film, my buddy and I thought, \"So leverage is good?\" Very confusing, of course there is sequel potential, but I truly believed this film would have been better off as a series instead of this jumble of effects and bad unbelievable plot.There also seemed to be a camera problem, since it always was tilted and I found my self tilting my own head to watch the film. Finally I laughed out loud when there was a whole Matrix sequence which didn't even need to be in the movie! Oh well...A **out of***** for good effects and scenery, but everything else bad.",

If you think you can watch this movie for just the action part you are wrong.  Nothing happens until the end and that is just so terribly done you are left laughing.  Apparently the aliens don't speak english, but you don't realize that until the middle of the movie.  And then there are these cavemen that somehow can learn to fly fighter pilot jets in like less than a week and the plot holes are all over the place.  It's funny to watch this movie however, because you know all these actors think they are going to be in this great blockbuster and they are all over-acting. This movie won the Razzie for worst movie of the year and the director accepted the award personally (first time that has ever happened.)

But at least we didn't get some garbage about reversing the poles or extrapolating the giggahertz or something.  I had fun watching this movie.  John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker make a good team (as evidenced by Phenomenon, a much better sci-fi flick).  I enjoyed the political satire and how even aliens play political games to get ahead in life.  Suspend disbelief a little and enjoy it.  Its not quite as bad as everyone says!Buy Rating 2 out of 5 stars (wait for it to come on cable)",

There are a ton of plot holes, and sometimes, even the scene progressions make no sense. The sets are decent, nothing great. The costumes and make-up are all good, there are some good special effects, and I like the whole idea of the film. I can't call this a bad film, so I will just call it a good attempt.

            "content": "With interest in science fiction movies and television at an all time high, it's not surprising that BATTLEFIELD EARTH, L. Ron Hubbard's massive (and massively popular) SF novel has finally made it to the screen. What is surprising is that noted director, Roger Christian, was able to condense the essence of Hubbard's long, action-packed epic into a two-hour movie. And produce a film that's easy to understand and follow and is entertaining for audiences from eight to eighty.The basic theme of BATTLEFIELD EARTH is humanity's battle against alien invaders. However, unlike recent hits like INDEPENDENCE DAY, STARSHIP TROOPERS and THE MATRIX, Hubbard's story begins long after the conquest of earth. It's a thousand years later and mankind has become an endangered species. The Psychlos, lords of much of the universe, mine Earth for its precious minerals and treat humans as annoying pests. But, as in all great adventure stories, a hero, Johnny Goodboy (played convincingly by Barry Pepper) rises up from slavery and by using the Psychlos own technology against them, frees the world.John Travolta plays Terl, the vicious Psychlo security chief for Earth, with just the right touch of nastiness and humor. Though often cast as a hero in films, Travolta is at his best \u0096 think FACE/OFF, BROKEN ARROW, and PULP FICTION \u0096 playing a villain, and as Terl, he's in top form. Forest Whitaker, as Terl's henchman, and numerous lesser-known actors play their roles admirably.Special effects are top-notch. Earth, after a thousand-year occupation by alien strip miners, looks nattered and bruised. This isn't the bright shining utopias of so many SF films, but the gritty, harsh wilds of a world in ruins. The neo-classical soundtrack worked well for a refreshing change, the music didn't drown out the actors' voices.All in all, a terrific start to the 21st century of science fiction films.",

I haven't even rated this movie... it just doesn't deserve a rating.The acting was at best vain, John Trivalta was doing a fine job of showing over acting at its finest. The main guy, can't be bothered to remember his name, did such a bad job it was like he was reading of Que cards. He was so wooden and unbelievable i'm not joking i've seen people in my 9 year old cousins plays that where better. The rest of the people in this film where so forgettable i've forgotten them.The Story must have been written under the influence. I am a writer myself, and Mr H.L Hobberd (Or what ever his name was) must not have been a very good writer to come up with this shameful story. He either wasn't a born writer or he must have been high and thought 'I know, I'll have an earth 1,000 years in the future, a race of the Stupidist Aliens to ever become Space faring in control and a disgruntled ex monkey lead a fight against them... yes! brilliant' This could have worked, if you gave it to a man like Isic Asemov or some one, but here it doesn't.The story is simple (Not in the good way) Aliens have taken over, force humanity to mine gold... for some reason, and reduce Mankind's numbers to the miners that work for them and a few isolated tribes scattered here and there. When one man, the protagonist, leaves his tribes camp, again... for some unknown reason, leaving his girl friend and all, and travels to a ruined Denver where he is captured by the camp Aliens. These Alens, known as the Pychelo, make him mine gold. He escapes (Yeh, cleaver Aliens huh?) but is caught again. Then promises to mine them gold from the Rockys with equipment, Which they agree to... for some reason, wouldn't it give the humans a sense of independence? Where the humans discover a stash of 'old' U.S. Militery equipment, yet, they are brand new, shiny, clean, and fully fuelled ready to fight (again, for some unexplained reason)The humans begin to learn how to use them them using a flight simulator (Which is powered by magical fairy dust i suppose?) and when the Alien's come to collect there gold the humans (This is my favourite part of the whole film) pay them off with already smelted Gold that they found in a nearby castle with a big nylon sign saying 'Fort Noix' pointing to it... OK, it was a big exaggeration but that's almost what it's like. 1,000 years occupation and these morons that claim to be superior to us in every way and with an unexplained unquenchable thirst for gold has not found Fort Noix. Now these cleaver Aliens have given our hero an 'Inteligance Machine' from which he can learn everything about the Alein's race, Militry, Langige and Culture. I suppose it's a reference to the 'Stupidity Machine' every one who worked on this film was forced at gun point to go though. That will not make the Humans more dangerous now will it? and on top of that, They take him to the great library in Washington D.C. and show him a 1,000 year old book (That is still legible? impressive) and the Declaration of Indipendance (That's in perfect condition, wow how time flys)That will not give the humans further drive now will it? Then, I must have fell asleep as there was a small skirmish, a plan that made less sense than one Paris Hilten getting a Deploma, Planes flying around not doing a great deal (That they learnt how to fly in just a week? Has anyone in this film have any form of knowledge on planes at all?) and preforming all kinds of menovers that I know myself a British made Harrior can not do. Then the Aliens give up and retreat. Then the humans get an Atomic bomb that is so new you can imagine it still in it's Argos package and send some poor sapp on a suicide mission to the home planet of the Pychlo by means of a Teliport system. Then more stupidity and the bomb explodes, destroying the entire Pychlo planet... I kid you not... I guess with Nagasaki and all we where very lucky.The Camira work was a joke, it was always on a slant and my neck hurt by the end of the movie trying to get the full picture. At first I thought there was something wrong with my TV set so I changed it over to BBC 2 and it was fine... Mock the Week was just finnishing and I was depressed with the other channels so reluctantly, I switched over to BBC1 and Battlefeild Earth. Now don't get me wrong, the 70 million they plundered on this movie was not entirely wasted (just mostly) the visuals where stunning. The overview of earth at the beginning was a real bit of eye candy that taken my very breath away... shame it was on a tilt.The production and execution of the film was the worst of all Hollywood's history. I wouldn't have been surprised if they had captured a Monkey from the Amazon, put him in a suit so no one would know it Animal Cruelty, and forced him to work on this film under punishment of castration.As a film, this was eye bleedingly bad, as an Epic is needs to be destroyed, as a story it had the odd power of draining your very I.Q by a massive 40 points. The most embarrassing part of this entire movie is John Travalta's performance... he tried way too hard to do anything right in this film and it was so wrong.Not one to avoid at every and all cost.",

The story is actually pretty realistic, thinking of how people have made theories, stories and even religions based on ruins left behind by earlier cultures. (like the stone henge and the pyramids in Egypt) The way humans live in small tribes in the movie, full of superstition and fear of what's unknown is exactly how we lived only a few centuries ago.I will agree that this movie turned out a bit sketchy, but the idea and what they manage to tell us in the movie is actually a deep and concerning truth, of how we treat weaker countries and animals, just that in the movie, we are the new losers. The only thing that really irritated me in the movie was the quality of the feet and hands of the alien specie.All in all I think the movie was a charming piece of work, coming up a little short, but still getting the important message through.If people is watching movies based on a hunger for multi-million animations and special effects, may be they should keep their mouth shut, so people that see the movies for their story can do so.I say give us more movies that's not afraid of setting the human race back to the stone age.

            "content": "I've read a lot of the comments, and a lot of people have mentioned the scenes that were so obviously stolen from other movies.  But for me, there was one scene in particular that stood out as having been, let's say \"inspired\" by another film: the slow-motion shot where Johnnie is avoiding shots fired by the Psychlos, and is running through a hail of dirt and debris.  Was I the only person who thought of The Matrix, and the scene in the lobby, with Neo and Trinity running in slow-mo with broken pieces of marble flying everywhere?  That was one cool scene in The Matrix, and I suppose the people on Battlefield Earth felt the same.\nAnd another thing which I just HAVE to mention, even though many others already have, is the totally ludicrous \"cavemen flying Harriers\" thing. These cavemen have been without ANY kind of technology aside from \"sticks and stones\" technology, and yet they're able to learn how to, not only FLY these planes, but to DOGFIGHT with them, in one week's time!  Okay, it takes a person more than a week's time to really learn how to drive a car well. An airplane -- I'm fairly certain -- is a little bit harder to learn than a car.  Now, consider this as well:  these aren't JUST airplanes, they're freakin' Harriers!!  They can hover!!  I would imagine that learning to fly and hover a Harrier would take quite a bit more time than learning to fly even a regular airplane!  Now, I already have a headstart on these cavemen, because I can at least drive a car, and I at least have SOME understanding of basic airplane physics, and technologies.  But if you were to tell me that I could teach myself to fly even the simplest airplane in a week's time, I'd tell you to lay off the booze, or whatever item you were smoking. There is no way in Hades that this makes sense, no matter how easily you can suspend your disbelief.  I can let a lot of things go when I'm watching a movie, cause it's just a movie, but that was TOO much.There was one thing I enjoyed about the movie, though, and that was Sabine Karsenti as Chrissy.  My compliments, and thanks to the casting department. Excellent work.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILER ALERT I can't help but wonder if so much of the negative publicity that this movie has received was due to the current public opinion regarding Scientology. Okay, so the book was written by L. Ron Hubbard. So what? Yes, it was a dry read at times, but it was still an enjoyable read, despite being over 1,000 pages long. Therein lies the problem with the movie, however, in that they needed to take such a lengthy book and condense it into a feature film. Now, add to the fact that the movie stars John Travolta, himself a Scientologist. Two strikes, right? Travolta is a fine actor. Who really cares what his spiritual beliefs are? He could be a Muslim for all I care, the fact is, his acting is very good. This movie is no exception. Yes, it's cheesy, but in a \"Face-Off\" or \"Broken Arrow\" sort of way. He has fun with the role, and it shows.Whitaker's performance is also in this same vein. You can see that he liked the role (else he wouldn't have taken it) and because of that, his performance shines as well.There are really only a couple of things about this movie that I personally didn't care for. One was the training simulator being the be-all and end-all of people who know NOTHING about aviation now being able to expertly pilot a Harrier jet. As a pilot myself, a simulator is great to learn from, but it will certainly not give you the ability to fly in formation and engage in dogfights. Okay, so this is Hollywood, we can let this slide. But the second part? Pepper's performance. It is far too rigid. Here, he is along the same lines as Ben Afflec in \"Daredevil\", and it is the movie's one serious weak spot.Other than these, however, this movie is a great rainy weekender with a bag of microwave munchies. Don't be put off by Mr. Scientologist. Rent it and watch it without any of the pre-conceived notions of the religious beliefs of its main star and its original author. Instead, approach it with the idea of some science fiction fun and you just may find yourself enjoying it! I did, and I'm very cynical when it comes to my Sci-Fi!",

I couldn't wait, but it took twenty years until the movie finally got made.One thing to know going in is that the aliens aren't smarter than humans. They are actually stupider. The alien home world fears a hostile take over from its own citizens so most citizens are born stupid intentionally. The alien culture is very different from ours. Additionally it's very mean spirited and deceitful. The acting was meant to portray all this. It wasn't \"bad acting\". It was done this way intentionally. But if you haven't read the book most movie goers and critics won't understand.The first third of the book was hard to get through. The movie covered a bit over half the book and changed many things in a bad way. But the second half of the book is where things really took off. It's a shame the movie got such bad reviews that the sequel will never be made. The sequel would be spectacular. The sequel is where the real battle occurs.Even still, I don't see why it got such bad ratings. There is much worse sci-fi out there, it's just low budget sci-fi. Anyway the movie diverged somewhat from the book and made humanity's rise from slavery much less believable. It appears that for many, the only way to enjoy the movie is to read the book and fill in the gaps of the movie and know what it could have been. But I feel like a few people gave it bad reviews because they didn't understand it all and then everyone else just dogpiled on with more bad reviews.Watch it with an open mind and decide for yourself.",

As I think about it now, there's a real casting problem when the (supposed to be despicable) villain or villains in a movie (I'm thinking John Travolta here) have more \"presence\" and charisma than the hero. Yes, I think that's the source of my initial negative impressions: the villain (Travolta) out-classes the hero (Pepper). Yes, a movie annoys me when I find myself rooting for the bad guys.

            "content": "Ok, this WAS a truly awful film, but blame for it's sheer awfulness has been sorely misplaced, proving once again that people don't read very much. *Stepping down from the literacy soapbox now...*As an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy I began reading Battlefield Earth upon hearing of plans to make the film adaptation.  I had previously been wary of the book, noting that it had several sequels that were published after the author's death (rarely a good sign).  I was hoping that I had just mistakenly overlooked a classic gem of science fiction writing authored by a misunderstood genius and founder of a cooky, wingnut religion.The main fault I found with the movie was its somewhat successful attempt to be faithful to its source material.  Filming nearly the entire movie at a 30 degree angle was totally unnecessary, and as with all book-to-movie adaptations, something was lost in the translation - namely the process by which the 'man-animals' became humans and took back their world.  What seemed to happen in mere days in the film was described by the author as happening over a period of months in the book.  The man-animals did not learn to fly Harrier jets, learn trigonometry, and work alien technology 'overnight' as depicted in the movie.Terl was perfectly portrayed by Travolta - he was EXACTLY and in every way what I imagined after reading the book.  He was never an omnipotent, monolithically evil alien menace reminiscent of ID4 or Star Trek's 'Borg'. He was a crooked, short-sighted, and intellectually challenged bureaucrat. His assistant, Ker, was well-played by Forest Whittaker.  Barry Pepper could have been a much better Johnny Goodboy Tyler had the time constraints usually imposed on book-to-film adaptations allowed more of his relationship with Terl to be more evident on screen.I believe that this poor movie has not exactly been given a fair shake because of various Scientology conspiracy theories (Travolta's belief in Scientology and his clout in Hollywood pushing this accursed project through production), and numerous weaknesses in the plot (Psyclos coveting gold as mush as humans, working 1,000-year-old Harrier jets, properties of Uranium mixed with an alien atmosphere) that should be attributed to the author of the book rather than the filmmakers.In short, the filmmakers probably did as well as they could have, considering the second-rate source material they were given.  Sadly, I do see myself paying money to see the proposed sequel just out of morbid curiosity, and because there is no way I can see myself finishing the second half of this truly awful book.",

Sure it's easy for someone to say: \"Oh, I saw that in Star Trek: First Contact, and that in ID4, etc.\" just to give a movie a \"bash\". The effects were well done, and captured the audience.

This was a project of Travolta, which all the studios rejected and he had to fund it himself.\nObviously the movie suffers greatly from the lack of good actors and directing. The lack of money is evident.\nBut this movie is great fun and very comical. I was laughing hard at some scenes, not that they were good, but that they were so obviously bad, and I know everyone in the movie knew that it was bad.\nI mean John Travolta and Forest Whitaker are brilliant actors, and they knew that this is gonna be bad, so they just had fun.\nThis was done in 2000 so it's morally old, but so are other movies. If you take it as a joke, you will enjoy how bad it is. I mean we are always watching stuff like this in YouTube and not complaining.On a separate note, I would like to add that this movie is WAY WAY WAY better than stuff like Charlie's Angels 2019, Birds of Prey and other propaganda nonsense movies which are not even funny, but have huge budgets, trying to push some agenda on us. So enjoy this indie movie and remember to not take is seriously. There are much worse movies out there in 2020.",

I am ashamed at the academy for dropping the ball and snubbing Barry Pepper, John Travolta, and the movie itself at the oscars (I mean was the bland and boring Gladiator and it's star Russel Crowe really better than this movie and it's stars? I think that Battlefield Earth is light years above Gladiator and most people will agree with me on that at least). In closing I think the people of the world just needs to look a little deeper in themselves and evolve to higher plane of existence and thinking before they can see this movie the way I see it; a masterpiece that is equaled by no other and perhaps the greatest achievement in film making that we are likely to see in this lifetime.",

I liked the use of green in the exterior shots and thefact that the director decided to use dutch angles didn't bother meat all.  The special effects were fine.  Nothing spectacular but theydidn't ruin the movie like so many have said they did.Now for the bad:Instead of putting together a laundry list of the numerousproduction flaws in the film I will just touch on a few.  First off thedirection of the movie is so incoherent that by 20 minutes into themovie you have no idea what the hell is going on.  More importantlythough, is that the whole man vs. alien theme is completelyunbelivable because the Psychlos prove themselves to be soincrebibly stupid, that there is no way anyone could believe for asecond that they would be capable of conquering any world, letalone worlds.  Combine that with the Psychlos dialogue that consists of such \"alien\" words like \"home office\" and \"corporation\",it certainly doesn't distinguish them as being very different orsuperior to the \"man animals\".  Are these really the words that L.Ron Hubbard used in the novel?  The screenplay is like a badcreative writing paper from a 3rd grader.  The most dissapointing aspect of the film is I was hoping that itwould have that cult status of really awful movies that are fun towatch like Tango and Cash and any of the Ed Wood films. However, this movie is so incoherent and unwatchable that it evenfails on that level. 2 out of 10",

I was skeptical before renting this movie before watching it for the first time but while watching it, I was immediately gripped by it. The movie is great for those who like the idea of independence from tyranny or ruthless occupation, organizing a great revolution from scratch, winning a battle which had no chance and against all odds and also how humans from this planet can outsmart an advanced alien race with help such as re-education of one man in science-history-physics-language, everlasting human spirit to be free and unity amongst all humans for one cause. Some critics fail to understand one more point about this movie. One of the possible reasons why Earthlings failed to defend against this alien invasion 1000 years before the time in this movie is because as most times, most Earthlings were divided into various governments, countries, regional powers, etc. Even today, if Earth were attacked by advanced aliens, we may have no chance to defend against them especially because we humans are always so divided as countries and groups. Most of our energy goes into greed, money making and useless conflicts instead of advancements. I think the movie is very well made, the idea and concept are amazing and the urge to know what happens next never goes away. Although it's been more than a decade since this movie was made, the graphics and special effects are still amazingly advanced even for today's standards. Heck, there are major movies made these days which appear less advanced than this one. The alien vehicles, the simulators and lots of new ideas which were utilized in this movie are impressive, even with a few negligible factual errors on the part of Earth technology and weaponry. Yes, some directorial and cinematographically errors could be improved but overall the movie is good entertainment. If you are a true science fiction enthusiast, you will not be disappointed.",

With him in charge(producer), and as the lead there is no one to blame for this travesty but Travolta. Even though I was sure that 'Broken Arrow' had already settled that argument.Anyway. This movie has no legs to stand on. L. Ron Hubbard was a crackpot with barely passable writing skills. So your screenwriters had nothing to work with. Then you have Travolta basically running the whole thing. Even choosing the director and basically directing him (or so the stories go) since he didn't want his beloved cult leader's story messed up.The plot is MIA, the acting horrible, the cinematography so-so, the FX average or less with a scene or two that are exceptions.Even though I usually enjoy a \"good bad\" movie, I can't think of anyone that deserves to be made to watch this crap.

With ferocity so far unparelled in the movie world, Terl learns how to fire a gun, hunt for gold like a ferocious lion and use his master wit to persuade a foolish rebelling earthling and his companions to help him.  Between these truly elaborate and well formed scenes a decent plot developes.  It's understandable that Terl would let the truly unique and well thought-out character of Jonnie the Earthling know all of his secrets.

How could Terl know that Jonnie would manipulate the system and teach his friends all about the truly horrific aliens.

I do have to say that I lost even more respect for Scientology having seen the film. I mean how could they let one of their own star in such a film? I'm not exactly sure where it places LRH's opinion of humans on the food-scale of Xenu's universe (even though he had not had \"the grand realization\" when he wrote the story). It seems contradictory to some of the precepts of Scientology, but that is a natural trait of religions. Am I reviewing Scientology or the movie, you ask? To me the viewer cannot be adequately informed to appreciate the film without the backdrop of having at least heard about the wall of fire, or whatever it's called that people have to confront to reach OT III.

Most humans are enslaved, and those that are not, have degenerated to a low level of technology. In spite of a significant difference in technology, the humans revolt, and incredibly, win. But given this interesting story line, this is an incredibly idiotic film. These aliens rule the universe, but are incredibly stupid in how they relate to each other. In spite of much evidence to the contrary, they believe that humans cannot think. They are so obviously based on the Klingons that the story borders on plagiarism. Some of the special effects were very nice (as when they aliens teach Johnny Tyler their language). For all the hardships humans face, all of them appear well fed, well groomed, have great teeth and look great in general. The movie is lost in execution \u0096 a nice opportunity lost.",

I understand that the book was too long to make a movie out of the entire novel, but even only going as far into the story as it did left out too much to make this a worthwhile venture.

Possibly the worst offence (from a technical standpoint, that is) has to be the Dutch Angle -- normally used sparingly to \"throw off\" the viewer's perspective to create feelings of unease and/or discomfort, but in Battlefield Earth is literally the only shot used. This film is the cinematic equivalent to having your genitals mangled by rabid weasels with dull teeth while laying in a Taco Bell dumpster in July. I highly recommend it.",

Had it never been made, the money that was used to produce it could have been used to make several better, smaller-budget movies, or perhaps the money could have fed children in refugee camps somewhere. But that's neither here nor there, since B:E was made, and it's here forever.So, like the many unfortunate youths that have uncles with boundary issues, we need to come to terms with what just happened to us. Battlefield: Earth is bad. It's horrible. It's an affront to all that is righteous and beautiful in this world. And it's also extremely entertaining, if you view it correctly. Here are my suggestions:1) Get drunk while watching. Take a drink every time somebody says \"Terl,\" or \"gold\" or something like that. 2) Invite your friends over for a bad movie night and rip on it as much as you can. Nobody cares if you talk over an important plot development, because let's face it, there are no important plot developments. 3) Watch it in a language you don't understand. Seriously, I caught in on Univision one time and I found that the Spanish dub was extremely enjoyable. It was the first time I liked watching the movie, and since then I have gotten more and more enjoyment with each subsequent viewing.Watching this movie is akin to drinking what you think is tea, only to find that it's soda. Your brain doesn't recognize the soda flavor and for a moment you are convinced that you've consumed a poisonous batch of tea. When you first watch this movie, you're expecting something wonderful, but once that bad taste wears off you're left with a beautiful experience. It's bad, but it's not that bad.",

In other words the greed of the psyclos led to thier destruction. and Terl ends up inprisoned in a prison made out of gold. the whole thing is poetic. the action sequences have plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy. i was shocked this film didn't do better than it did at the box offce. this movie was based on one of the most popular books of our generation, ranking right up their with Charles Dicken's \"A Christmas Carol, and Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" or Edger Rice Burough's \"Tarzan\". this is a timeless classic novel. and it made a fantastic movie",

            "review_title": "A highly entertaining piece of sci-fi cinema!",
            "content": "Just before the opening of John Travolta's Battlefield Earth (based on the book of the same title, authored by L. Ron Hubbard) I ran across something I found very interesting.  I read a review in Entertainment Weekly magazine which attacked the film in a way I had never seen done with any other film before it. Now, it is a very well known fact that John Travolta is an outspoken practitioner of Scientology, and that L. Ron Hubbard is that religion's founder.  What I found unusual was the amount of concern dedicated to both figures. Surprisingly, the entire first page of the review was dedicated to only a catty criticism of John Travolta's hair and makeup.  The writer of the article, Owen Gleiberman also stated that \"it may take a blind zealot to believe that L. Ron Hubbard is an inspired science-fiction writer.\"After researching the possible truth of this statement I discovered that L. Ron Hubbard is actually one of the top sci-fi writers of all time by sales volume alone and is also widely regarded as a master of his craft by people such as the legendary Robert Heinlein himself, who said of Hubbard's Final Blackout, \"as perfect a piece of science fiction as has ever been written!\" and called Battlefield Earth \"a terrific story!\"  It makes me wonder whether Gleiberman has ever even read any of Hubbard's work.In his article, he mentions Hubbard nearly twice as often as the film's lead, Barry Pepper.  I've never seen an author get that much attention for a film.  I therefore had the sneaking suspicion that Mr. Gleiberman may have some sort of personal grudge with either Hubbard himself or Scientology at large. In any case, the curiosity of all this was such that I just had to see the film.  I did end up seeing the film and I would swear I was watching an entirely different movie than the one Mr. Gleiberman commented upon.  The experience was so startling it inspired me to write a review of my own.Lacking Gleiberman's religious fervor and interest in cosmetology, I decided simply to stick with the basics:  writing, directing, acting and production value. While a film can rarely live up to the book that spawned it, I thought the screenplay beautifully communicated the themes which made Battlefield Earth a best-seller:  the resilience of the human spirit, the power of truth over deception, and the triumph of knowledge over might. Two-time Academy Award-winner, Roger Christian, the film's director and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of George Lucas proudly displays the hallmark qualities of his mentor.  Expertly capturing the themes of the story while simultaneously allowing the talent on his set to shine unhindered, each in their own unique way, Christian leaves us both curious and enthralled.  He paints a grimly contrasting picture of both the oppressed populations of Earth and our affluent alien captors, one culture dead of technology, the other dead of spirit, one pulsating with the will to be free, the other long ago resigned to live as slaves. Travolta (the film's villain, Terl) performs with the same brilliance which has come to be expected by most movie-goers from a long and successful history of cinematic bad-boys.  Like many of his other films, I couldn't decide whether I loved to hate him or whether I hated the fact that I loved him.  In either case, he was as thrilling to watch as his creepy eyes were disturbing. Both Barry Pepper (Johnny, the film's hero) and Forrest Whitaker (Terl's devious sidekick) brought with them the same honesty and realism that made them famous for their roles in Saving Private Ryan and Good Morning Vietnam respectively.  Pepper definitely lives up to the larger than life reputation of Hubbard's Battlefield Earth hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler.  Expect to see Pepper's already impressive career flourish grandly in the years to come. As far as the film's overall production value, all I can say is that apparently, when a film has one man in charge of production design, creature design and costume design (in this case, the supremely competent Patrick Tatopoulos of Independence Day)  you get an artistic continuity unmatched by almost any sci-fi film ever made.  An excellent call on the part of the film's producers, Elie Samaha, Johnathan D. Krane and John Travolta.  In addition to the film's superb look (credit to Lucasfilm alumnus, cinematographer, Giles Nuttgen), the Academy Award-graced special effects team on this one definitely put in their overtime.  Gripping action sequences, terrific spacecraft realism, and wonderfully subtle alien enhancements make Battlefield Earth one of the best films of the summer lineup. No doubt, Battlefield Earth will be remembered as a highly entertaining sci-fi action thriller and anticipation of its sequel is already bubbling wildly both in the Hollywood community itself and in sci-fi and Hollywood fandom alike.  Like the best-selling sci-fi novel which inspired it, Battlefield Earth is truly a work not to be missed. As an end note, I loved Travolta's hair and makeup.  They make him look like exactly what he plays, a deliciously evil intergalactic bad-ass!  Go, John.",

Yes, of course there were less believable sequences as in the USA flight simulators, and how quickly the human characters were to learn. With this in mind, you have to remember one detail. Think for a moment; there is NO, I repeat NO reality check needed here. This is a science fiction film. And as far as the acting goes, I thought it was great. Maybe I am the only person to have enjoyed the alleged \"worse movie of the year\", and maybe; everyones opinion is inflated based on critics reviews. I thought it was brilliant how the ruthless aliens pumped all of they're own knowledge into a human. They were so indulged in they're own superiority, they didn't even consider the possibility of a measly little human accomplishing an uprising. The acting was great, above average at the least. The directing was perfect, shots were lit well and original angles for action sequences and \"close up\" shots. As another plus, the musical score was perfectly in tune with the action, and allowed me that \"alien world\" feel to enjoy as I watched the story unfold. So as everybody cold shoulders this piece of originality, I pity the man who has the same opinion as everyone else. This movie reminded me of \"Planet of the Apes\", with primitive characters that learn of the past, and shape the future. This film had my attention glued to the monitor for the entire production.

Especially since a handful ragtag cavemen were able to overthrow their whole settlement.I couldn't find myself caring too much for the 'hero' of this movie either. Motivation that comes from where; his horse getting shot?  The hero himself couldn't be more of a stereotype; never making a mistake and having seemingly endless reserves of charisma to command his followers.John Travolta, I cared more about what happened to him than the hero. Travolta is a good actor, and will portray any role that he is given well; and that isn't to say that he did a smash job of acting in this film.\tI don't recommend this film.

            "review_title": "Not Plan 9 . . . more like Dune",
            "content": "Reviewers are already calling this movie the \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" of the year 2000. That's a bit overstated; \"Battlefield Earth\" is worse than you ought to expect from an $80-million movie, but not as bad as many of the media reviews have said.  It's more like \"Dune\" than \"Plan 9\": not REALLY bad, and not terribly good either, just proof that some decent talent, cool special effects, and a few creative ideas can't save a poor script.\"Battlefield Earth\" is based on the 1982 novel of that name by L. Ron Hubbard.  The year is 3000.  Earth has been overrun by the Psychlos, a cruel, opportunistic race of giant aliens that mine entire planets of their precious metals.  A thousand years earlier (that'd be around now) the Psychlos routed the entire human race in only nine minutes.  What is left of humanity now cowers in caves in the mountains, where the Psychlos can't go because the radiation levels are too high (radioactivity ignites the gas they breathe).  Unfortunately, the radiation is slowly making the humans extinct as well.  Enter Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, the Bible-quoting sniper from \"Saving Private Ryan\"), a young human who is trying to find a better way of life for his tribe. While exploring the ruins of the city of Denver, he is captured by the Psychlos and pressed by their corrupt security chief, Terl (John Travolta) into mining a secret vein of gold.  He takes the opportunity to motivate the remainder of the Psychlos' slaves into revolting against the aliens.This ought to be an OK premise for a space opera, right?  Unfortunately, in this script, illogic carries the day.  Although it is supposedly illegal to teach non-Psychlos how to mine, you never see a Psychlo so much as pick up a shovel. The humans do the mining, and the Psychlos are more like taskmasters (something like the Egyptians in Exodus).  When Jonnie proves to be aggressive, untrainable, and rebellious, he is marked for termination, but instead Terl hooks him up to a teaching machine and gives him the knowledge he needs to stage an effective revolt.  Although Terl gives Jonnie two weeks to mine the vein, appparently the Psychlos were too dim to raid Fort Knox, so the humans simply take that gold and spend their two weeks hunting for weapons.  Fort Hood has been a ruin for a millennium, but luckily the Harrier jets stored there are in working order and still full of fuel; what's more, the fort still has electricity to run the Harrier simulator so that the cavemen can become Top Gunners in a week. (Heck, someone even left the light on in the simulator, and after 1000 years it hasn't burnt out yet!)  The gas that the Psychlos breathe is poison to humans, and vice versa, but at one point a suffocating Jonnie is able to escape from the dome the aliens have erected over most of Denver simply by diving into a pipeline that goes to the outside.  And so forth. To their credit, the scriptwriters managed to avoid some of the plot howlers in Hubbard's novel, such as the atomic bomb that can vaporize a planet but not the other atomic bombs sitting next to it.Technically, \"Battlefield Earth\" is a freaky mess.  Evidently director Roger Christian thought it would be cool to film most of the movie at odd angles, but it just ends up being disorienting.  The human characters are at times difficult to tell apart, since they are all long-haired and shaggy.  The Psychlo atmosphere is purple, so all the scenes inside the dome are dark and indigo-tinted.  Unfortunately, since the Psychlos are also long-haired and shaggy, in the dark good guy and bad guy alike are identical silhouettes. Travolta appears to forget about Terl's pseudo-British accent about half the time.  At the beginning of the movie the Psychlo weapons shoot gobs of green energy, but at some point they start firing bullets instead.  The sound effects are good, and the computer-generated effects are OK - though better suited to \"Babylon 5\" than a big-budget movie - but the musical score is loud and overdramatic.But despite all of \"Battlefield Earth's\" faults, and being forewarned by dozens of negative reviews in the press, I actually had a hard time not enjoying it.  It was just fun to watch.  Certainly the novel it's based on is overlong, poorly edited, and in places just plain weird, but it isn't the worst thing Hubbard ever wrote.  I enjoyed the way the director switched between the Psychlo and human points of view - humans perceive Psychlos speaking gibberish, while the Pscyhlos regard the humans as apes.  It was evident that Travolta had fun hamming up his role as the Machiavellian and arrogant Terl.  Unfortunately his lines, consisting primarily of diabolical laughter and childish semantic games, did get tiresome after a while.  Multiple variations on the theme \"I agreed we wouldn't spy on each other, but I never agreed *I* wouldn't spy on *you*\" can only go so far before getting silly.  And the Psychlo technology is more or less the way I pictured it while reading the novel: grimy, metallic, and more functional than decorative.The idea of an influential Hollywood Scientologist producing a film based on a novel by the founder of Scientology has, understandably, raised some concerns that \"Battlefield Earth\" might be a subtle promotional tool for the controversial religion.  But as reprehensible as Hubbard and Scientology are, these fears are unfounded.  A few of Hubbard's ideas come through - most notably that psychiatrists, like the Psychlos, regard humans as mere animals (Psychlo/psychiatrist - get it?).  But nothing in the film is intrinsically Scientological.  Face it - Hubbard was about as subtle as a bull in a china shop.  Note, for example, the good guy/bad guy dichotomy in this film: the hero, Jonnie Goodboy (get it?) Tyler can do no wrong, while the evil Psychlos manipulate, exploit, blackmail, drink a vile green intoxicant called kerbango, and shoot the legs off cattle for kicks.  If you want Scientology propaganda, go read the 10-volume \"Mission Earth\" series, a heavy-handed monstrosity replete with obvious Scientology references.Rather, \"Battlefield Earth\" is a self-indulgent act of hero worship that John Travolta has finally put to film after nearly 20 years of trying.  L. Ron Hubbard was an over-hyped, self-promoting, mediocre writer with an inflated sense of his own worth to society, and in that respect \"Battlefield Earth\" is reflective of his character.  But as an SF movie, there have been worse films in the last couple of years.  \"Armageddon\" and \"Soldier\" come to mind.",

            "content": "I put off seeing this film until 2 for 1 night at my video store, and even at this price I felt ripped off. I'd read the novel this is based on years before and wondered how something so talky and philosophical could be made into a film? The answer is, very very badly. The filmmakers wisely played down the philosophy, but were left with nothing more than a tangled & lame sci-fi tale that was dated when it was new.Now I'm a sci-fi fan and cut my favorite genera flicks a lot of slack, but here different sequences seem to have been done by different directors, as the tone shifts from bad to worse with awkward scatterings of forced humor. These shifts seem an attempt to disguise a confused screenplay that would have us believe that everything from paper books, to Harrier jets and atomic weapons will function just dandy after a millenium of neglect. This comes after we've seen that a few sessions on a teaching machine will enable an ambitious aboriginal and his pals to teleport atomic bombs and destroy entire planets. We also learn that humanity has sunk to the tribal edge of extinction and speak in `Me Tarzan' phrases that also include `Piece of cake' and `Get the hell out of here'. It all feels cut down from a much longer film, which could only have been worse then this one. The bombastic score tries to make us care about characters that we've never been introduced to, and tell us Johnny is doing something important while leaving us to only guess what that could be. Such important points are lost as we hear a lot of people talk about the importance of `leverage'. The special effects are a bright spot, as they are up to industry standards, however they hardly justify sitting through this film.What does justify you seeing this film is John Travolta's wondrously bad performance as the villainous alien Terl. With his beehive hairdo and giant high-heel shoes, Travolta looks like an outer space drag queen, which must be why he tries to be evil but only comes across as bitchy. His entire performance is delivered in an exaggerated effeminate manner that will remind you of some evil queen in a fairy tale, or of the cult classic `Vegas In Space'.  Alas, it doesn't make `Battlefield Earth' bad enough to be fun, it only makes it very very bad, so bad that you have to see it to believe it.",

            "content": "Battlefield Earth takes on the challenge of turning an epic, 1000-page novel into a 2 hour movie and pulls it off in a very interesting way. Fortunately, the novel has a logical dividing point half way through and the movie takes on only the first half of the book.To capture the spirit of the book, the film makers had to combine fast action with complex plot elements, humor and aliens who are developed characters (not just cartoon adversaries for the hero). Even divided in half, the book had 500 pages to do that.The film makers do it by stripping the plot back to it's key elements and turning up the speed to maximum velocity. This is a fast movie and you'll probably end up seeing it twice to absorb it all. If you've read the novel you'll have a few favorite characters that you miss seeing. Of course, if you haven't, there's a whole lot more story to look forward to in the book.In any case, Travolta and Whitaker pull off their performances as the scheming aliens while the cinematography and special effects give the film an unusual and cohesive visual style. Once you get caught up in the rhythm of it there a lot of humor in the very exuberant script.Another thing that I liked about Battlefield Earth is that, like Star Wars, it maintains non-stop action without turning to the blood and gore that mar many films these days.As a fan of the book I was nervous about what the film makers might do to the story. I was very happy with the movie. I put it among my top sf films of all time along with Star Wars, 2001 and Bladerunner. I think a reviewer once described the book as a combination of Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie manages to capture that. It's a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to part 2.",

The problem with this movie, and why it will probably not become even a cult classic like some have said, is that it is almost good. It hovers just below the line of good and bad, so I was unable to even enjoy riotous laughter like I did at Starship Troopers. It's a strange thing to say, but this movie is neither good enough nor bad enough to be enjoyable.As for the elements of the movie, the acting is terrible, the effects are so-so, and the story develops at a good pace for the first hour then speeds through the next two hours of story in less than one. A pet peeve of mine as well, and George Lucas could deal with hearing the same thing, is that the quick scenes and all the wipes really do look ridiculous. Maybe when wipes were first introduced in film, they were cool for their novelty, but these days they are just annoying.To review: Definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, and that may be to its detriment. Travolta really messed up here. I've never read the book, but it seemed like many of the sequences in the movie were just bad puns and cliches, and I would hope Mr. Hubbard was a better writer than that--although, Psychlo is a pretty awful pun.Definitely stay away from this film.

I'm going to have to re-watch some good SF movies to get back to enjoying that genre.Before I get to the announced game part, I'll list three things I found highly annoying about this film [semi-spoilers below]:The entire dog concept was, sadly, never developed on. Some interaction between Psychlos and dogs would have added a lot of humor, warmth and intelligence to this movie. The linguistic implications of this film are mind-boggling. Psychlos are depicted as a species fairly keen on intelligence work and surveillance, but still don't bother to keep anyone on staff who can a. figure out that human languages work about the same as psychlo ones and b. spoil the entire human liberation thing by even listening in every now and then. Truly sad. Another one would be the phrase \"man-animal\" which is either a bad translation from an Elron fantasy or a tiresome contradiction; if the Psychlos are unable to communicate with man, how come they would use a phrase like that? Flash Gordon is beginning to look like a really good film.What's up with the symbolism? Take the necklace, which was clearly introduced to be mockingly destroyed by the psychlos. Was there any effect in that?Now for the official rules on how to be able to enjoy this film and make it worth watching:Load your DVD player with Battlefield Earth. Put the movie on auto-repeat. Lean back and enjoy:Every time Travolta says \"leverage\", take a swig of beer.Every time Travolta says \"man-animal\", take two swigs.Every time Pepper is choked, down a shot of tequila.Repeat. Eventually the word \"leverage\" will start to bug you, \"man-animal\" will make you cringe and you'll have forced yourself to enough empathy with Pepper's character to appreciate every minute he goes un-choked.This movie proves, like so many before it, that a couple of big names or a big budget cannot save a project destined to doom. I will say this: I noticed today that this is just about the only non-R-rated movie in my DVD collection. This is perfectly fine, except the lack of blood is contrived to the point of making the viewer confused (my room mate didn't quite figure out what happened with some of the arms here). Are Scientologists really that desperate to get underage people to watch their 3rd-level propaganda?",

This film is different, it's not a copy or is not inspired by an other film. It's more like a research of an new way of filming. Some kind of a preview of new science fiction.

Aside from being too long a book, the pulp formula made the characterization shallow and cheesy. Aliens talked as if they stepped off the street of an American city so there was little hope of anything good coming out of it. Combine this with heavy backseat driving from Travolta and the church of Scientology and you have the Ideal film to show students what not to do. It was not an accident they chose Christian to direct. The book spent a lot of time justifying and explaining the improbable story, a luxury you can't afford in film. It festered Right down to the ludicrous alien costumes with their huge over-sized boots that actually had made the Psychlos smaller and awkward. I believe Travolta and Kelly will need some extra sessions on the E meter to get back up on the Scientology food chain. They should take a tip from Mr. Hubbard who was never blinded by Faith and adoration. They might also read up on Heinlein one of his best buddies who wrote \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" the basis for Rael and company. Both men hated Psychology and loved a good joke. Great guys, but they would have choked on their pop-corn had they seen this film",

The biggest problem is that after 1000 years there would be no harrier jump jets; the fuel would have long since turned into lacquer and hardened into semi-plastic, and every rubber seal would have long since disintegrated into dust. Not only would would there be no functional aircraft, these people with the mentality of 3-year-olds cannot believably learn to fly fighter jets and achieve what the worlds greatest military powers were unable to do 1000 years ago.

As an avid reader of science fiction and adventure stories during my youth, I read Battlefield Earth and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would actually go as far as to say it was one of my favourite books at the time [perhaps my tastes were less refined]. Even then I was aware that L. Ron Hubbard was a rather unbalanced character, as his Scientology church headquarters were less than 10 km from where I lived, and thus the ravings of the church were general knowledge in my home county. I wondered then if the book would ever become a film, hoping that it would. So when the film finally made it, I was concerned by the reviews it was getting, surely it couldn't be that bad. Now I have to be honest, I have not seen the entire movie. Battlefield Earth is the only film that I found so bad that I was unwilling to endure its entirety. I have seen many bad films in my time, but normally they begin to take on a comical character which allows their continued viewing. Battlefield Earth has no redeeming factors whatsoever.

I went to see Wild Wild West twice, and The World is not Enough four times, so that should tell you something about the kind of movies I like. The negative reviews (I think if critics could give negative star ratings, they would have given them to this film)  were part of what drove me to this film, along with my love of science fiction movies. I found the movie quite easy to watch, and the plot easy to follow, unlike what most film critics have said.  And when people complain about how the movie copies from all sorts of other movies, Planet of the Apes, Independance Day, and Godzilla, I have to say that this is not the first time those concepts have been copied, and those movies were not the first times the \"cliched\" sequences were put on celluloid, either.  Dog fights and bleak future worlds are a staple of science fiction, critics should know to expect them, instead of moaning when they show up. The movie was good for what it was, a summer popcorn science fiction movie.  Lots of action, explosions, and special effects, which is what I go to movies for, anyways. There were a few problems, though.  The lighting was bad, and for a race that dislikes all the blue and green on Earth, the Psychlos use a lot of blue and green lights inside their own buildings. Also, I find it a little hard to belive that the human military hardware would work after 1000 years gathering dust.  These are about the only two points I agree with the critics on. If you actually go in to watch the movie, instead of concentrating on the fact that L. Ron Hubbard started Dianetics, you'd probably find most of Terl's plan made sense. Overall, not a masterpiece, but certainly not worth the scathing reviews it has received.",

After having condensed the lengthy and improbable plot laid out in L.

By far the worst mistake of the film was hiring the idiot that decided the movie needed to be filmed entirely at a 45-degree angle. The camera doesn't lay flat with the horizon once during this film and my neck is cramped still. This flaw although perhaps not consciously noted by all viewers was distracting enough that it completely drowned out the plot and acting (not that the latter was a bad thing) with unnecessarily annoying and excessive camera tilting and badly placed movements. I've never actually seen a movie that could be ruined by bad cinematography but apparently this goes down as the first. Save yourself time and aggravation and don't watch this movie, or for that matter the book. Avoid L.

Then I saw Pitch Black, the second worst movie I ever saw in a theater (1st place will always be \"Daylight,\" starring Sylvester Stallone).  And now I have seen Battlefield Earth.  It might be a long time before I watch a sci-fi movie again. I just have a hard time believing, as many others have, that a superior race could find strains of gold in the Rocky Mountains but not find Fort Knox. I find it hard to believe that cave and forest dwellers who thought that statues were frozen people could learn how to pilot a Harrier in a week. Now it occurred to me that perhaps they learned it that quickly because, after all, it is a thousand years from now and surely the brain has evolved, but I mean, they think STATUES are frickin' PEOPLE.  There is a lot to swallow in this movie, as in all sci-fi movies, but this was a just too much. Now, the overall plot isn't that bad I suppose.  From what people tell me, some of it doesn't make sense because parts from the book were deleted. HOW BIG IS THIS BOOK?  It's slated to be a trilogy and you can't have the movies make sense?  Anyways, I can accept that Johnny Goodboy whatever could learn stuff that fast (after all, I accepted that Neo could learn that fast in Matrix, didn't I?), but how does he teach hundreds, if not thousands of people just as fast?  And why, in the year 2000, do we have a bomb that one person could carry (Is this the \"suitcase bomb\" from \"Wag the Dog\"?) that blows up (and I mean BLOWS UP) a planet which is supposed to be much much bigger than ours?  And how many people and Psychlos are we dealing with here?  That never seems clear to me, and most of the final battle scene just completely escaped me unless there was a main character in it. Speaking of characters, what was Travolta doing here?  I wasn't able to tell if we were supposed to laugh at him or be afraid of him.  That stupid laugh was funnier and less purposeful than Dr. Evil's, I mean throw me a frickin' bone here.  Other than that, I didn't think the acting was too bad.For some reason though, I was able to watch this movie without getting too upset.  Perhaps it's because Pitch Black had already lowered my expectations of Sci-Fi movies, but when I was watching the movie, I turned my brain off, and only since I've had time to digest it have I gotten so mad.  Unlike everyone else, the tilted screen really didn't bother me that much, it wasn't like it was Blair Witch or anything.  So that is why this does not get into the \"Pitch Black\"/\"Daylight\" levels and I give this a 4 out of 10, and I would attribute that to the special effects.",

I won't even try to list all the things that are wrong with this film because there's a 1000 word limit on this. I think that the thing that really sunk it was the lack of humour, if there had been a few good one-liners it would've lifted the whole thing. When you think of a great film, you always think about certain scenes. Sexy scenes, funny scenes or gobsmacking action scenes. But this film has none of the above. Some of the action scenes might have been impressive if they hadn't been ruined by the overuse of slow motion. All in all, the film was ruined by the script's reliance on contrived situations. It was too easy for the heroes to save the day. If only someone with a decent grasp of the English language had given the script a quick once over, then maybe we might have been spared this monstrosity. But on the plus side, John Travolta gave a good performance as Terl, considering the useless, stupid character he was given to play. If only Terl had been as clever as he thought he was then the film might have worked. Might have. And Kelly Preston was a very sexy Psychlo. Still, having said all of this, I'm planning to see it again. It might improve with repeat viewing. It's not the worst film ever made, but it is a letdown. Warner Bros. must be getting sick of always the studio that delivers the turkeys.",

The film is plenty putrid in it's own right.Okay, I kinda liked the cavemen learning to fly the 1000 year-old Harrier jets in 7 days...but other than that, the film doesn't even stand up as silly summer dreck.I hate to quibble, but why is it that in the future everyone feels the need to tie strips of cloth around their triceps? This keeps showing up in these science fiction films, and I haven't seen any rational explanation for it. I knew I was in real trouble when Bon Jovi showed up here with an armstrip. I had a bad flashback to Alien 4, where everyone  was tying strips around their arms, presumably to ward off alien attack...and then I  remembered \"Staying Alive\" the truly dreadful dance film that Travolta made following up Saturday Night Fever, where JT posed his little buns off with the most aggregious armstrips ever put on film. What's with that?By all means, stay home from this film...or find a second-run theatre still showing 'Pitch Black' if you have a real hankering for pumped-up B-grade Science Fiction.  Amazing what Vin Deisel pulls off in that film with 25 words of dialogue and not an armstrip in sight.   --josh",

OK far fetched but giving the whole conquering of us maybe I can buy it. Here's were it gets really bad. There is a line in the movie where Travolta boasts about how it took only but 9 minutes to conquer the Earth\". Keep this line in mind as you read the rest of this. The alien beings are powerful and seem to know a lot about the Earth history and historical figures. Yet they couldn't figure out that the primary mineral they are there to collect (gold) has its largest concentration in Fort Knox. They were so intelligent they could pick up any version of an encyclopedia to look up the word gold and have a greater understanding of where the earth's already mined supply's are. Then Jet fuel has an expiration date of about 50 years. Yet many many years later it still holds the chemical balance to work in these aircraft that the caveman humans learn to fly in 2 weeks. Oh wait I hear it again \"9 Minutes to conquer the Earth\". Then caveman take a crash course on how to fly a jet and use the gold from fort knox to buy the time. From caveman to fighter jet pilot is a huge leap of evolution my friend. My grandfather was a pilot and this movie is a pure comedy to him. Oh OK, say we are complete morons and buy all the crap that has been spooned fed to us at this point. Now an alien nation that was so far advanced that (yes the 9 minute thing)conquered us. And you figure their advancements from that point would have increased even to higher levels. yet they end up getting their butts kicked by caveman pilots in obsolete jets with expired fuel to end the movie. So basically the technology that got its but kicked almost 1000 years ago is now the ultimate weapons again. Its like us getting into a huge war with Iceland and Iceland breaks out the catapult and destroys us. Nice work Travolta and L Ron Hubbard. If you have a religion with science in the name you might want to do some scientific research on your own film before you release it to the public. Can you say F-. Nope, I can't, the humor in its flaws alone bump it up to an F.",

It's an intelligent person's film and so I also completely comprehend why the critics don't like it. They can't begin to understand it!! The direction of the photography was brilliant! There are so many scenes within scenes. And you really have to pay attention and follow the sequences. See it again and again and it only gets better and better! Once you conquer the sequences its a \"piece of cake!\" (A line from the movie). Travolta again has made movie history. His lines in this movie will rock down the ages as unforgettable. I'm already hearing them among those who have seen the movie and some who have only seen the trailers!! And the movie was true enough to L. Ron Hubbard's best-selling novel by the same title. I believe the sequel (or trilogy as it will most likely take 2 more movies to complete the awe inspiring second half of the book) will only be more exciting as the story unfolds into an unbelievable action packed adventure and final confrontation. Really the BATTLE has only just BEGUN!! Kudos to the entire cast, director, producers, and all who had anything to do with getting this movie made!! Thank-you!!

I don't just like all movies, so hear my thoughts on this one.There are a bunch of high reviews here for this movie. A small percentage of people actually like this movie and I happen to be on of them. If you have the correct expectations and you're a hardcore Sci- Fi fan, then you may sincerely be one of the people can enjoy this.WHAT TO EXPECT: This is a low-budget post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi with over the top script and acting. It's done more in an old-school style instead of going for realism like movies nowadays (for instance Nolan's Batman trilogy, which tries to be realistic).As a huge Sci-Fi fan, I liked the movie because it has what I wanted form it: Futuristic visuals and a post-apocalyptic story. Visually I enjoyed the alien spaceship designs and certain environments (such as the alien colonial base and city ruins) even if they were low- budget. The post-apocalyptic story is interesting, it follows one the most known Sci-Fi novels. Personally I haven't read the novel, so can't comment on that much.The first 5 minutes leaves the worst impression (acting and script wise), but it got interesting after the aliens come in.BOTTOM LINE. HERE IS THE KEY POINT: I wasn't bothered by the acting or the script BECAUSE... Being a Sci- Fi fan, the post-apocalyptic story and futuristic visuals made this into an enjoyable experience, even if the script and acting isn't what you would call Oscar worthy. That's why some people really like this movie. Most people are extremely disappointed with the acting, dialogues and cheap visuals. So much that it's considered the worst movie ever.

Afterwards I thought to myself : wow ,that\u00b4s a bad movie! but still, I was entertained. Let me explain this to you:\"Battlefield Earth\" is definitely one of the worst movies of the 90\u00b4s. The dialogue is awful and the acting is laughable. I wonder what John Travolta was thinking about when he decided to make this movie! Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker are usually great actors and they\u00b4re pretty decent in this one too, but eventually you\u00b4ll end up wondering what the hell they\u00b4re doing in this mess. The directing by Roger Christian is very old-fashioned and pretty average. It makes you feel like you\u00b4re watching an old episode of Star Trek or a b-version of Star Wars.Anyway, there\u00b4s one positive thing about this movie: the special effects. The visual effects are not superb, but they\u00b4re good enough to entertain you and make you stay awake for two hours.Otherwise, this is an overblown sci-fi turkey with a predictable story and no suspense. Barely worth a look, unless you\u00b4re in the mood for some dumb, pointless entertainment!",

Travolta intentionally plays Terl over-the-top as a super-evil villain who is constantly scheming to outdo his fellow alien invaders in an effort to get off of Planet Earth and back to his beautiful purple home planet.  You just got to laugh when Terl tries to figure out the favorite food of the humans, and using all his wit and \"brilliance\" figures that it's got to be raw rat. Of course, all of Terl's schemes usually backfire at some point.In the novel, Hubbard puts a definite mocking spin on Terl's character, and Travolta carries that through to the movie very well.  Also, Forrest Whittaker does a very commendable job as the underdog Ker, and plays well off of Travolta's evilness as Terl.In summary, I would say that the film definitely had some enjoyable elements that made up for some of the less inspired parts.  Worth a watch.",

But there is one facet I did want to mention, and that is Travolta's great rendition of Terl.While some people have said that Travolta played Terl over-the-top unintentionally, I remember that the novel has the same sort of tongue in cheek rendition of Terl.  He is always working on some new dastardly plan to outwit his fellow compatriots, and in the book one can't help but laugh at Terl's ridiculously evil lines and plots.I think Travolta nailed the Terl character perfectly, and I found him really entertaining and down-right funny.  Furthermore, I think that is how Travolta meant to play it.  Travolta is definitely having a good time in this film, and I was always entertained while he was on the screen.  So if for no other reason but to see Travolta play a great over-the-top evil maniac, Battlefield Earth could be entertaining.",

Therefore I won't comment any further on that, but I felt I just had to put my two cents in here.

He was well schooled and had an engineering background, so you would expect a little accuracy in his story elements, yet there are many gross oversights. I have a lot of difficulty with the thousand years of degeneration in regards to the earth's equipment and power supplies.  The military couldn't build a plane that could sit for even a hundred years without needing a complete overhaul.  The flight simulator not only was fully operational, but could teach illiterate men to fly (and possibly maintain) F-15s and Herriers better than some enlisted soldiers. Fort Knox has to have better security than an average bank, which should befuddle even a handy-man with an awesome set of tools; yet our Neanderthal heroes seem to have walked right in to the well lit vault like it was McDonalds. During the finale, the humans seemed to instantly figure out the Psyclo weaponry that had previously baffled the best of them.  I didn't get the impression that many of them had even ridden horses, so they adapted well to aerial combat against greatly advanced aircraft, even doing victory rolls at the appropriate time. Aside from the goofy camera tilting in every city scene, the special effects were well done and the makeup artists should get some kudos; but regretfully this is the only bright spot in a lame story line.

            "content": "Trying not to let all the terrible reviews of \"Battlefield Earth\" influence me, I went to see the movie today in Stavanger. It was cinema number 7. 77 seats only, so it's one of the smallest in Stavanger (Norway). BE has only been shown in this cinema since it had premiere June 2. Today it was only half full and I took place on the first row where I could sit alone to enjoy the show.My first impression was the incredible lousy titles at the start. One of the great things with major sci-fi movies has been their extravagant use of great introductions with apocalyptic music to get the audience in just the right mood before impressive battleships or massive explosions are folded out on the big silver screen. In \"Battlefield Earth\" it looked like the title were made using the built in features of a Sony Handycam. I strived hard, but I did not manage to get in any galactic mood.I've seen a lot of bad movies that I've enjoyed. Sure they did not deserve an Oscar, but when it comes to adventure and sci-fi I'm easy to entertain. I guess that would be my reactive mind. ;) I'm still at 35 a big fan of cartoons and as most of us know there isn't a big demand for a story line if just the story telling and craftsmanship is good enough. The same goes for a movie. I treasure movies like the Star Wars and ID4 because of the entertainment value, they gave me something exciting and I willingly let down my critical guard just to be entertained. This never happened during the two hours watching BE, even though I really looked for an opening. In ID4 for example the human air fights with the aliens was rather silly, but still enjoyable to some extent. We all knew the president of America would save the world and the drunken father would give his life to save the day, but at least it had some charm. When cavemen grunted while flying jet planes in BE I was just stunned by how silly a 80 million dollar movie could be.I mean, they start off walking into this city that is supposed to have been left to erode for 1000 years, still the car wrecks looked like they were left there not more that 20 years ago. That's not cute errors, that's an insult to my intelligence when in a movie presented to be a major event. Having been spoiled with the special effects used in the previous century I can't help that I expected something better than what BE offered. Even \"Brasil\" had a better scenery than this so this is not a budget thing.After a while the ill-placed grunting by the humans and the put on laughter by the psychlos just became silly and you smile with them in pity. I've never liked Travolta very much as an actor but he's had a couple good roles where the directing and character has fitted his talent. Since this movie was Travolta's pet project the only excuse I can make for him is that it was probably difficult to direct him to make a good appearance in this movie.The story line was basic enough, nothing to write home about. Aliens take over the world and the small group of helpless humans that are left wins it back when they get the right leader. If this is the best Hubbard fiction book then he wasn't a very inventive writer. You know all along how it will end so what could have made it a good movie would be how surprising and inventive the makers bring you to the known ending. There are few, if any, news or surprises in BE. After \"Planet of the Apes\" and \"ID4\" I can't understand why they bothered to make BE based on this script. If you can't do it better or very differently then it's good advice to drop the whole idea. In retrospect one can only laugh when reading how people defend their decision to join the making of this tragedy after reading the script.There are many things to get annoyed over. Make-up and costumes that are just plain bad and effects that wouldn't convince anybody unless it was made before 1980. Like the double chin on the guy that ruled the psychlo colony on Earth. When you turn your head it doesn't move with the head like it was a baby's bib. They had done a lot of effort making the details look realistic because of all the close-ups, but it only worked to a certain point as long as the actors did not move a muscle.The use of echoing voices and slow motion in the action scenes was so put on it looked silly. Tons of debris falling and people running in slow motion is boring after awhile. They have not succeeded hiding the very poor cutting of the movie by adding splitting scene effects all over like it was an episode of a TV detective episode from the seventies.Can anybody explain to me why Terl let Jonnie spend time at the human library catching up on human history when he was in a hurry to mine the gold? Or how come the psychlos claims they know everything about humans but still they had no idea about what they liked to eat? Where's the logic in Jonnie learning human mathematics when pumped full of information in the psychlo learning machine, but still psychlos knew so little about humans? The rat thing and the human mathematics were just stupid and didn't have any meaning for the story. Psychlos lived in an old city with skyscrapers built by humans, but still they laughed when talked about humans operating machinery. And what about they finding the door to the vault at Fort Knox open so they could just walk straight in?A 1000 year old storehouses with military equipment is of course all intact, even the walkies and the flight simulators are full of power ready to use. Learning lots of cave men to fly jet planes in 7 days is of course no problem and in the end a whole planet is blown up with a bomb so small it can be carried by one man. Get out of here! That might almost have worked in a Marvel comic, but this movie is aiming much higher than that and that is why the result is a joke. Had Christoffer Reeve showed up in a blue suit I might have at least found the story funny.Another scene that is strange and evidence of the lack of logic in the movie happens in the cages where psychlos keep the humans. Someone shouts that one of the humans know the psychlo language and plan to fight them. Then all the humans suddenly goes ecstatic, shouting and climbing up the grates like crazy monkeys. The characters in this movie aren't even suited for a cartoon, that's how shallow and unreal they appear.Someone should count how many times the word \"leverage\" is used, I felt like shouting \"Use the damn leverage, Jonnie!\" several times. Poor Barry Pepper had the leading part but Travolta stole the show as the villain. His character was not suited to take over that role and Travolta lacked the talent to get even close to fill the misadjusted role.There might be a good twist in the rest of the story, since this is only half. I can't say. But when it comes to this movie things just didn't add up. It surely didn't do much good for the reputation of L. Ron Hubbard when his name was shown with green letters early in the end credits. If that is how he is to be remembered by the masses (assuming this might haunt us on national TV for years to come) then he does not need any critics.People started walking out after one hours but I stayed to the end. I don't agree that it was a big pain to sit through it all, but it wasn't any pleasure either. Also sat through all the end credits to see if I could spot any interesting names. Found nothing I could recognize, except that the guy responsible for the 2D effects was called Steve Fishman. ;)Do I recommend it? Yes, for people on ARS who have been following BEs release it should make a great excuse to invite some fellow critics over for some snacks and beers when it is released on video. Knowing what you will get I guarantee a fun evening, though probably not in the way intended by top Scientologist chill John Travolta.This truly is a miscarriage of a movie.Well, this is my layman opinion, as a sci-fi and movie fan.",

            "content": "One of the truly epic science fiction films of recent memory is `Battlefield Earth.' Based on the best-selling novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the film is not only a rousing, action-packed, sci-fi adventure that evokes the best of `Star Wars,' `Independence Day,' and `Braveheart,' but also showcases the work of the much underrated director Roger Christian. This exciting tale of heroes and larger than life villains, against the backdrop of extremely cool special effects and edge of your seat action, is available as a special edition DVD, and is a must-own for anyone building their own video library.`Battlefield Earth' looks like a big-budget summer epic with money to burn and a scale worthy of `Star Wars' and its other Hollywood predecessors, but in fact the film was made with the very modest budget of $22 million (production and effects).  Director Roger Christian, who won an Academy Award for his Art Direction on the original `Star Wars,' came to the project shortly after directing the second unit on `The Phantom Menace,' and actually surprised his former boss George Lucas with his economical use of talent, production design, and special effects.  Christian's rousing and action-packed saga, which is filled with humor, adventure, and fun, takes movie-goers to a world they have never seen before-a world in which man has become an endangered species-via some innovative special effects.  While not as fluid as the computer-generated images of  `Titanic,' it is an impressive achievement that recalls the best work of `Planet of the Apes,'`Blade Runner,' and `2001: A Space Odyssey.'  Tatopolous's production design is incredibly detailed, and makes you believe that this is the war-torn world of 3000 A.D.  When you're not marveling at the eye-popping special effects or set design, you'll probably be marveling at the performance of John Travolta.  Starring as the Psychlo Security Chief Terl, Travolta firmly cements his star status both in terms of screen presence and acting chops. Forget Tony Manero from `Saturday Night Fever.'  Here, Travolta plays one of the screen's great villains, with equal parts of Shakespeare's Iago and George Lucas's Darth Vader.  Terl's underhanded interaction with Ker (Forest Whitaker) serves as a microcosm for the Psychlo's own faux-Machiavellian machinations of death, betrayal, power plays, and secret identities (with lots of faux-Machiavellian dialogue ladled on to keep the proceedings appropriately \"classical\"), but it's all briskly shot, edited, and paced with a contemporary sensibility. The artistry behind `Battlefield Earth' is most apparent as well, from the very first scenes through the last reel of the motion picture.  I have already mentioned the film's wonderful production design, but beyond the matte paintings and large-scale sets, there's a true artistry to how the motion picture was composed. Roger Christian creates a wonderful metaphor using the simple contrast of light and darkness in the composition of scenes.  This is especially apparent in the special edition DVD, where the light is perfectly balanced and the image superbly clear. For example, when we first meet Jonnie, the primitive protagonist, his scenes are filmed with the warmth of sunlight glinting off rugged mountains and green pastures. Later, when he allies himself with other primitives, the scenes are again in bright light, showing in a metaphorical sense how important and essential it is to band together against the hostile aliens. Even the gold in Fort Knox glows with a very warm light. Those scenes are contrasted against darker ones that show the Psychlo homeworld and the dome-city that they have made out of old Denver. The scenes are very dark, filmed with cold blue and dark green textures...you can almost feel the claustrophobia, death, and destruction in those sequences. The Psychlos are dark, dastardly aliens who have enslaved humanity and are strip-mining the planet, and what better way to portray this agenda than with the play of shadow and light. Similarly, the wipes, dissolves and transitions between scenes are handled with an artistry that I haven't seen in motion pictures in years; in fact, I can't recall the use of such dissolves unless I go all the way back to the original 1977 `Star Wars,' and the editors on that film won an Academy Award for their work. In `Battlefield Earth,' the transitions between the different scenes move the story forward like pages turning in a novel...and this artistic texture reinforces the story's literary heritage.Every once in a while a motion picture does something so extraordinary, it makes you desperate for more. You sit on the edge of your seat the entire film biting your nails while you are lost in the plot, the special effects, and the action-adventure. `Battlefield Earth' is one of those movies.  When the motion picture first debuted in theatres in May 2000, I laughed and cheered and cried and clapped, and enjoyed every moment and every aspect of the production from beginning to end.  But I was among a select few science fiction fans who got to enjoy the film in theatres.  For reasons totally unrelated to the production, critics trashed this saga of alien conquest and human rebellion during its theatrical run, and chased many fans away with their hateful and denigrating remarks.  They completely ignored or missed the film's true artistry and fun.  Now that the film is available as a special edition DVD fans can finally enjoy that artistry and fun!  They can also see for themselves what a largely misunderstood work of true genius `Battlefield Earth' really is.  I know that when I watched the special edition DVD on my home video system I experienced all of the emotions of laughing, cheering, crying, and clapping again, and enjoyed the film from beginning to end.  Experience the movie for yourself, and you'll see what I mean.",

            "content": "There is a relatively simple way to measure how bad a movie is.  If you draw a graph where the x axis represents how poor in quality and entertainment value a movie is and the y axis represents how much money was spent on making such a poor movie, Battlefield Earth would have to place as the worst movie ever made.It's a hard and depressing thing to accept - that merely a century or so after the invention of film, we'd already have reached the absolute nadir of quality.  But here it is.  A movie so mindblowingly bad, so incredibly inept, so in-your-face repulsive and unpleasant that one looks back in nostalgia at the career of Ed Wood, Jr.The movie is adapted from a book by cult guru and con artist (read \"Bald-faced Messiah\" or check out Xenu.net for more info) L. Ron Hubbard. The book itself was pretty lousy - in terms of literary quality, it could make a serious case for being one of the worst books of the past 30 years. But it was bad more in a boring and occasionally offensive way.  Sure, it was Scientology propaganda, but its major crime was its dullness.  Over 1,000 pages of the adventures of Johnny Good Guy.  We all knew that Scientologists were buying dozens of copies from mall bookstores and then returning them to create the illusion of a sales blockbuster, but it was more amusing than disturbing.Until the movie came out.  John Travolta plunges ahead with another attempt at career suicide in yet another love letter to L. Ron.  The movie strips away the fluff from the novel, and we are left with a film reminiscent in its worst moments of a mix of \"Triumph of the Will\" and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".  I'm not sure this movie even had a continuity editor, nor cared to try to impose a logic on the various parts of the film.  A galaxy-spanning alien civilization relying on \"man-animals\" to mine gold with picks and shovels?  Aliens having to use what looked action figure cookie molds as paper?The Psychlos (stupidest name for an alien race in history) seemed to be brain damaged.  How in the world did they ever conquer their own planet, let alone the universe?  Most of the unintentional humor comes from the aliens, and especially John Travolta's performance.  It reminded me of nothing less than a megalomaniac Steve Urkel.  The laughable clawed hands and gigantic jock straps worn by the aliens are only the most noticable aspects of what can only be a huge joke played by the makeup/effects people upon the moviemakers.  I highly recommend the \"Leverage\" drinking game - a drink for every mention in the film of the word \"leverage\".The message of the film, though, was disturbing - if anything, it reminds one of Norman Spinrad's book \"The Iron Dream\", written as if Adolf Hitler had wrote it.  The story of a young Aryan warrior rising through society, eventually becoming a leader and inspiring those around him to superhuman feats by the mere fact of his existence is eerily similar to the film \"Battlefield Earth\".  Thankfully, the film was done so ineptly that it will someday become as much a cult classic as \"Showgirls\" or the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", but the underlying message is disturbing...",

My judgment at that time would probably be in line with all those how have voted this one so poorly.After the second viewing, in the comfort and privacy of my own home, I think my mind was far more open, feeling safe, at home. I truly was in a complete daze, dreamlike state after it was over. While I generally avoid the comic book style productions, and low budget sci-fi (trust me, this one cost Travolta's group next to nothing to produce, truly a testament to the enthusiasm of all those who must have 'volunteered' they're time), this one grabbed my attention fully, metaphors/symbols of our society interwoven carefully, and I had the sense I was style missing bits. Third viewing revealed more to me.I suspect that the vigorous slamming of this film has derived from pure base fear. A PG-13 movie, looking like big $$ but not, very accessible, presenting some brutal age old truths.I was very 'uncomfortable' with Travolta's performance on first viewing. I thought the shift from his deep Psychlo voice to the translated english voice was distracting. It wasn't until second viewing that the purpose of this became clear, the separation of these 2 races, 2 different perspectives interwoven to the point where I could easily identify with both perspectives, something that I can't remember ever experiencing before. Travolta and his team clearly knew what they wanted to produce, I would judge they're efforts as completely successful, beyond all expectations.It's a comic book movie, its metaphor, its subtle and deep and layered.Love it or hate it, you will always remember the 'warning' scene, if it makes it over 'the wall'.",

Fast forward 1000 years later and Mankind is an endangered species who only survive by hiding in radiated areas where the Psyclos don't go due to a violent reaction between their breath-gas and radiation. One Human (Pepper) doesn't believe in the stories about monsters and leave home in search of a better life. He is captured by a Psyclo and then placed in the hands of Travolta. Travolta detests Earth and sees gold as his ticket back to Psyclo. He puts Pepper onto a machine which teaches him the Psyclo language, mining techniques and strangely enough how to use Psyclo weapons and teaches them about the Psyclo weaknesses. However Pepper uses his new found knowledge to start a revolt. He arms his fellow humans with ancient human weapons and all is set for the final showdown between Humanity and Psyclo.To be blunt the film was utter rubbish. There were numerous plot holes (Humanity's technology failed badly in 2000 but is more than a match for Psyclo in 3000 and the cavemen manage to learn to fly and use guns in a week and despite conquering billions of galaxies the Psyclos are really stupid and cannot shoot for fudge). The dialogue is atrocious (the script writer must have been paid for the amountof times the words ''leverage'' and ''man animal'' and ''rat brain'' were used. The Special Effects were good and the acting was okay and really are the only things that save this film from 0/10.

Ron Hubbard's classic science fiction novel-it's a rousing good time. The year is 3000, and the Psychlo's have conquered Earth to mine its natural resources.Even though John Travolta felt he was too old to play the young hero, Jonnie Tyler, he out-does the evil Darth Vader as Terl, the sadistic Psychlo security chief.  Hunting and caging the few man animals left, is Travolta's daily pleasure.  His make-up and his humorous sarcastic manner will make your skin crawl.  Berry Pepper is Jonnie Tyler, the scrawny human, who refuses to be Terl's obedient slave, and rallies the remaining humans in a desperate attempt to regain their freedom.  Forest Whitaker is Travolta's devious assistant Ker.  The Psychlo's seem to enjoy cheating and abusing each other almost as much as they enjoy killing the humans.\nThe action is non-stop.  Of course, Tyler and a small group must find the Psychlo's weaknesses, and a way to exploit them in order to win the day. No doubt `Battlefield Earth' will not please the professional critics, but what science fiction film has?  If you look up the original reviews of major sci-fi movies, such as Clark's `2001: A Space Odyssey,' you'll find the same thoughtless comments. And, many denounced `The Matrix' and `The Mummy,' as well.Have no fear, `Battlefield Earth' is fun.  It portrays the best of the human spirit, and our need to be free.  I guarantee you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face.  Whether you consider yourself a Psychlo or a rat-brain human, go see it.  You'll be glad you did.Steven Whaley, SFWA",

I watched this movie to have something to laugh at and make fun of but besides the plot holes that were mentioned already a hundred times it really is not as bad as everybody says.The acting was the part that surprised me most. Travolta puts in a good performance and makes the best out of what he had. The rest of the cast is at least not responsible for the bad ratings this movie received.I am anything but a fan of Scientology and wanted to dislike this movie more then anything but after having seen it I do not think it deserves the rating of only 2.3.Still, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, if you want to watch a Sci-Fi action film there are plenty of alternatives and you should really only watch this movie as a last resort.",

            "content": "True science fiction fans might be able to blame Battlefield Earth on the source material, as Hubbard's original \"masterpiece\" is often to be considered one of the most overrated pieces of literature introduced to the genre.  From cliche, two-dimensional characters to inane plotlines - it seems like a likely culprit.Unfortunately, Battlefield Earth doesn't have such an easy scapegoat. Despite some impressive production design and some clearly talented CGI artists, this film flops on nearly every measure.  The story is formulaic, predictable and generally laughable.  The dialogue, especially from the stomp happy Psychlos, seems to be written down for the Saturday morning cartoon crowd.  Travolta's attempt at being evil comes off as a bad Ming the Merciless impression, only with a costume stolen from a KISS concert and a serious need for some cough syrup.Saddest aspect of the film's pitiful performance is to watch the normally underrated Whitaker be squandered away in a feeble, simplistic role.  You seriously want to give the poor guy a hug while watching him next to Travolta's bristling overacting.Rumors of this movie being a \"saga\" or an \"epic\" are grossly off-base. The campy space comedy Ice Pirates is more fitting to the description.This movie might be better with the sound turned off, but I didn't dare to watch it a second time to find out.  The only true worth of this film is to rent the DVD and watch the commentary and behind-the-scenes footage.  The pretension at what the makers of the film believed they had before them is near high comedy, if only they weren't serious.",

Ron Hubbard started Scientology as a joke, I wonder if the makers of this movie did it as a joke as well. If so then they failed because it's to bad to laugh at.

We were expecting to grease it up with insults as our friend Martin had done, but after watching the triumphant blow out in the mad city at the end we could not help but shout, \"Look who's talking!\"Basically, the chemistry between Whitaker and Travolta escalates from sizzling to electric by this powerhouse duo. The two actors have no trouble in showing their characters' primary colors. Travolta pulls off Terl's arrogant swagger and slippery persona without a hitch; Whitaker convincingly reveals his thin red line of compassion towards the man-animals. The face/off between the experts is perfect!Barry Pepper is sure to reflect on this movie as the high point of his career. Like an urban cowboy, his character Ker rode unafraid into the ancient wilderness. Kept alive only by a dead mouse here and there, he lives moment by moment always thinking of the limpid eyes of an angel, his lovely wife Carlo (Kim Coates, she's so lovely), he rebels against the white man's burden, the Psychlo! Certainly not a civil action.The psychlo are obsessed with mining chains of gold from the Earth. Gold, the rarest element in the universe, is traded as vociferously among the Psychlo as it is among mankind today, so it would be an understatement to say that the Psychlo could care less about collateral damage in their mining operations.  Talk about a domestic disturbance!The ending is fantastic! I was as happy as the humans were to see the horrible poisonous enclosures destroyed. No longer would the humans be boys in the plastic bubble; they were free, free from the devil rain.WATCH THIS MOVIE! MAKE LIKE A SWORDFISH AND GET TO YOUR VIDEO STORE NOW!",

If your a true lover of Sci Fi including grade B and can appreciate movies that are just fun Sci Fi with little meat to them, you won't be disappointed with this one. Plus if you are a Travolta fan, you will enjoy seeing him play the part of a Alien as a most entertaining new way to see him in a new light and so different from his other movies but a lot of fun! Hubby and I have always hoped that John Travolta would do another Sci Fi movie again after seeing how well he did his cruel alien character in this one. I am more then surprised it was rated so low. Travolta makes a great alien in his Klingon like get up and plays it to the hilt with grade B \"gusto\". In fact we thought his Klingon like costume was very acceptable. Consider how many Sci Fi movies mimic the Alien monster movies with Sigourney Weaver etc. Why should Travolta not take a good idea and make it his own. He is a terrific and scary alien in this movie. We were engaged through out the entire movie with his ruthless and heartless character which he did a fine job portraying. It was interesting to see mankind as a \"lesser species\" forced to be slaves to a alien race. The masterly and entirely arrogant alien Travolta plays is most believable and menacing. He struts around like a bull in a bull fight threatening any second to erupt and destroy anything, any idea and anyone in his way! You keep thinking where is his weakness? You will never see the surprising ending of this movie coming! But you will be so pleased at the sudden twist of fate it affords! Can't say more or would give it away. Watch this movie if you love fun grade B Sci Fi and enjoy John Travolta movies in general. Travolta is a blast in this underrated movie.",

Thankfully I have been spared seeing his other such films by the Cult of Sirius - a scientology based alien species that as removed most of Travolta's work to their home planet where it forms the basis of their intergalactic invasion plans.I spent the second half of the film in increasingly intense pain as my internal organs ruptured under the pressure of sustained laughing fits.Memories occasionally do leak through, sometimes waking me in the middle of the night to a vision of man, practically regressed to the level of an ape after the destruction of his entire civilisation over a millennia ago, conquering a technologically advanced species by figuring out how to operate VSTOL aircraft.  In a week.  My mind turned inside out by the illogic of these nightmares allows it's defenses to drop and more memories slip through.  The acting!  Oh, God, the acting!  Please mother, no more, I'll be a good boy.  I still get flashbacks of grinning, razor-toothed aliens bragging about 'leverage' with reference to influence about as compelling as a kidnapped lunchbox.The only possible use for this film would be to overlay it with Beethoven and use it to cure Malcolm McDowell of his violent tendencies.If you devise a rating system which awards Police Academy 8: Mission to Moscow a number of stars equal to the number that the Hubble space telescope is capable of observing I would still find it blasphemous to award a single asterisk to this piece of crap.",

The rivalry between him and Forest Whitaker's character was one of the more amusing aspects of the movie.  Barry Pepper's performance was outstanding.  I'm sure he is destined to become a major star.  The scene where he decides to unite the man-animals and free mankind from the evil Psychlos was really moving.  The Psychlo Planetary Head was totally disgusting, in a fun, grossed-out alien way.And to top it all, Roger Christian delivered some amazing special effects.

I've read that it's a great movie, that it should be rated at 0, that it is a good circumlocution from the equally good book, that it is a brain-numbing agenda movie, etc.etc....I like Travolta's acting which can make someone compassionate, no matter what role he plays, but I dislike Hubbard's Mensa-like arrogance.  I prefer to watch sci-fi movies, especially those which have good environment development, like Dune or Star Wars.  From secondhand information, it seems that this movie will have well portrayed environment.  Furthermore, I like movies with a hint of conquest/reconquest of land and property, which, to the best of my understanding, there is here.  I have no reason to disbelieve user-comments, and since I am a user of the same database, I would tend to relate to them more than to, say, newspaper articles.

Ron Hubbard may be a highly regarded writer in the science-fiction community, but he has yet to receive honor for his work in a movie.  All the movies adapted from his novels are bad.  This is because the only movie adapted from a Hubbard novel is Battlefield Earth. Let's get all the good parts of it out now.  I liked the special effects. They were pretty cool, but they're not ILM material.  Thats about it for the good parts.  (Except for the fact the sound went out at the end and I got to make up my own dialogue). For the real skinny on it- its awful.  Yes Battlefield Earth is a true flop- an utter embarrassment to filmmaking.  It wasn't even entertaining. Its shame lied in the following parts: 1)-  Dialogue- whoever wrote this dialogue sucks. I have never heard more corny lines since Starship Troopers.  The writer did not even attempt to give the dialogue variety.  I will never use the word \"leverage\" again and not grimace at the sound.  What the hell was that all about anyway?  Also- Travolta said about Earth \"I hate this stinkin' planet\" and \"I can't wait to get off this wretched planet\" and every other variation you could think of- REPEATEDLY.  The script is awful. 2)-  Hire a new editor. Every single transition between scenes was the same. Variation must be a problem with this crew.  Even worse than no variety was the embarrassing one they picked to use.  A wipe from the middle? It was embarrassing for me to watch.  The editor might have well had used a star wipe.  It would have been just as stupider and silly.  Silliness is not a word that should be associated with sci-fi movies. So don't pick a silly wipe.  Editor- hope someone throws an AVID at you and you die.3)-  The people.  Travolta must have done this as a favor to some Hollywood honcho, or it must have been a labor of love.  Maybe he thought that the Scientology community would look up to him if he produced and starred in its founder's novel.  Whatever he did it for, it disgraced sci-fi movies for a long time.  He set back the public's appreciation of Science Fiction movies maybe all the way to Star Wars.  Thats more than 25 years Travolta kicked the genre back.   Also- Barry Pepper, how could you follow Saving Private Ryan with this?? Anyway, I hated all the slo-mo shots of Pepper running and yelling.  They looked cheesy anyway without the cliched score pacing it through. Moreover, the cast was tired. They bored me and looked as if they showed up with a hangover every morning on set.  Maybe it was all that time in make-up for stupid looking costumes.  But Forest Whittaker- you need someone to give you better roles.  You deserve it.  You are very good when you choose the right roles.  (Ghost Dog, God Morning Vietnam)  But frankly you pick bad roles frequently (Species, this movie)  You just grunted your way to a paycheck here with Travolta.  You derserve just as much blame for flopiness.Battlefield Earth is an embarrassment to Science Fiction.  Those people who don't take it seriously have one more reason to solidify that opinion. Don't waste your money- Battlefield Earth has no redeeming qualities, (you can always see Special FX in Stuart Little and at least get a laugh).  Oh wait, Traovlta got a laugh, 18 laughs actually.  I counted 18 laughs in this movie.  He must have been going to the bank.",

            "content": "Another point of view...\"Battlefield Earth,\" based on the best-selling novel by L. Ron Hubbard, is a rousing, action-packed, sci-fi adventure which evokes the best of \"Star Wars,\" \"Braveheart,\" and \"Independence Day.\"  Roger Christian's direction is first-rate; the production design is incredibly detailed, and makes you believe that this is the war-torn world of 3000 A.D.  The eye-popping special effects are an integral part of the film, and not just some showcase. The storyline is thoughtful, inspired, and ironically amusing, and the acting is top-notch.  This film is the reason why science fiction movies are always best-received out of the summer's blockbusters, and just a heck-of-a-lot of fun. Fun is the key word here--for this film is a great deal of fun. I laughed and cheered and cried and clapped, and enjoyed every moment and every aspect of the production from beginning to end.  It is one of the best science fiction films to come along in the last few years. Part of the reason for that is the fact that it is a literate film, based upon a literate novel. Most good SF films can trace their origins to good books--like \"Contact,\" \"Logan's Run,\" \"Planet of the Apes,\" and \"2001.\" \"Battlefield Earth\" is not merely a retread of pop-culture icons.  (I'm so tired of seeing \"Alien\" retreads or \"Blade Runner\" retreads or \"Star Wars\" retreads!!). The production also shows a love for the genre of science fiction, and not the cynicism that was shown with \"Armageddon.\"  It is clear from the movie that the people who made \"Battlefield Earth\" wanted to make a fun movie that was thoughtful and inspired for fans of the science fiction genre.The artistry behind \"Battlefield Earth\" is most apparent as well, from the very first scenes through the last reel of the film. I have already mentioned the film's wonderful production design, but beyond the matte paintings and large-scale sets, there's a true artistry to how the motion picture was composed. The director of photography and lighting technicians create a wonderful metaphor using simple light and darkness in the composition of scenes.For example, when we first meet Jonnie, the primitive protagonist, his scenes are filmed with the warmth of sunlight glinting off rugged mountains and green pastures.  Later, when he allies himself with other primitives, the scenes are again in bright light, showing in a metaphorical sense how important and essential it is to band together against the hostile aliens. Even the gold in Fort Knox glows with a very warm light.  Those scenes are contrasted against darker ones which show the Psychlo homeworld and the dome-city that they have made out of old Denver.  The scenes are very dark, filmed with cold blue and dark green textures...you can almost feel the claustrophobia, death, and destruction in those sequences.The Psychlos are dark, dastardly aliens who have enslaved humanity and are strip-mining the planet, and what better way to portray this agenda than with the play of shadow and light.  Similarly, the dissolves between scenes are handled with an artistry that I haven't seen in motion pictures in years; in fact, I can't recall the use of such dissolves unless I go  all the way back to the original 1977 \"Star Wars,\" and the editors on that film won an Academy Award for their work.  In \"Battlefield Earth,\" the dissolves move each scene forward like pages turning in a novel...and this artistic texture reinforces its literary heritage.Finally, but not lastly, the music is rousing and triumphant, and stitches each sequence of the film together with an artistry of its own. Today, most films opt for a collage of popular hits; few present music of such a high caliber which recalls the best of John Williams or Hans Zimmer or John Barry. After the first viewing, most movie-goers tend to remember great special efforts or large action-adventure sequences in a film, and miss the subtle artistry behind a motion picture; however, repeated viewings often show a great deal more.\"Battlefield Earth\" is the kind of motion picture achievement that holds up to multiple viewings.John Travolta gives one of his best performances in recent years as the wicked alien Terl with the all-to-human vices.  Several years ago, the great action-adventure hero Arnold Schwarzenegger took a chance by playing a villainous robot in James Cameron's \"The Terminator,\" and became an even bigger star by playing against his heroic archetype. Travolta wisely chose the same path, and plays against his golden-boy image (forget Tony Manero here) to play one of the screen's great villains, with equal parts of Shakespeare's Iago and George Lucas's Darth Vader.  I had always respected Travolta's body of work as an actor, but could not count myself as a true fan until now; his turn as the chief baddie in \"Battlefield Earth\" is wonderfully wicked and delicious.  Forrest Whitaker also turns in a fine performance as his lieutenant, and I just loved Kelly Preston's cameo as the long-tongued alien. Barry Pepper is just superb as the primitive human Jonnie who leads the other primitives in a battle against the Psychlos.  He is not just another action-adventure hero in the Bruce Willis and Sly Stallone mold, but an actor who shows that he is thinking and feeling his way through impossible and improbable situations.  You actually think that he is thinking behind his cool exterior, and that's what makes him most believable for movie-goers.  He was sensational as the sharpshooter in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and shows that he's going to be a big star with his lead role here.I have a minor quibble with the movie and from what I have read of other critics this criticism is a familiar one.  In the film, the primitive humans learn to fly F-14s in less than a week's time.  I called a friend of mine in the Air Force, and he told me that was likely impossible; the primitive humans might be able to get the planes airborne, and might even be able to fire the plane's sophisticated weapons, but its highly unlikely they would be able to maneuver and land \"worth a damn.\"Okay, so this is something that we are supposed to take on faith--a cinematic verisimilitude.  After all, the humans in \"Independence Day\" learn how to fly sophisticated aircraft is less than a day, and that misstep didn't keep the movie from becoming a huge blockbuster.  So, why not simply accept one more suspension of disbelief?For months, I have been listening to critics deride this film simply because of Hubbard and Travolta and their connection to Scientology, and after seeing the film, I must conclude that they are all wrong.  Deriding this film because of its connections to Scientology is like deriding a Barry Levinson film because of his ethnic background and his ethnic storylines and characters.  The film  \"Battlefield Earth\" should be taken on its merits or criticized for its shortcomings alone, quite separate and apart from this issue.On the whole, I would rate this film very highly--a must see!Dr. John L.

The director, Roger Christian, had his own vision for the movie and he created a dark world dominated by the alien Psychlos. Some of the special effects created for the movie were incredible. I saw the interview with Christian on the DVD and given the actual budget that he said he had to work with to make the movie, you have to be impressed at what he created. I also feel he got an excellent performance out of John Travolta. There was a lot of very dry humor which came out of the alien character played by him. This was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the film.\nThe book by L. Ron Hubbard that the movie is based on is a great read and fully lives up to its reputation as one of the great science fiction novels. One can read it and visualize many incredible actions sequences which never made it into the movie. At over 1000 pages there was so much going on that the best thing one can do is to read the book. You will not only have had the pleasure of reading a great story, you will probably understand the movie a lot better as well.",

When a book is adapted to the movie screen, I let the movie speak for itself instead of making expectations of my reading. In this way the movie is more enjoyable. However, the screenwriters should have gone back and read and re-read the book. Maybe they would have gotten a clue about constructing a plot.Robert the Fox is a main character in the book, but you wouldn't know it by the movie. The two met in Scotland after Jonny escaped from Terl. You'd never know it by the movie.

            "content": "\"Battlefield Earth\" is not so much a movie as it is a random assemblage of images, pasted together without even basic skill or talent. I have not seen such a poorly written/acted/filmed movie in a long time. Where should we begin to dismantle this film? Let's start with the alien villains, the \"Psychlos\". The Psychlos are, without a doubt, the most inept and blundering aliens ever. They make the aliens in \"Spaced Invaders\" look calm, cool and collected by comparison. They invade the Earth, conquer humanity in nine minutes, but then it takes them a thousand years to get around to looking for gold. They have built a big 'ol dome over the poorly drawn ruins of \"Denver\", so they must realize that things like cities and cars exist, but apparently don't realize that the enslaved \"man-animals\" originally made them. They have been watching humans for a millennium, but think that their favorite food is rat. They have a perfectly good prison, complete with cells and everything, where they wash off the humans, but then they actually store them in an abandoned and easily escapable Zoo. And, wait a minute, why did they bother to wash the humans in the first place? They just get dirty again instantly.The lead  Psychlo is Terl, a mid-level bureaucrat played, tragically, by John Travolta. Terl is the head of Earth Security, and has been hoping for a transfer to someplace with better set design. Unfortunately, as he is dumber than a sack of man-animal feed, he is doomed by an executive from the \"Home Office\" (in Sioux City, Iowa, presumably) to stay on Earth indefinitely. This makes Terl mad, and his two volt brain comes up with a cunning scheme. He will mine a bunch of gold and bribe his way back home! Terl decides to use man-animals to mine his gold, and he chooses feisty and grungy Johnny Goodboy to lead the work detail. Terl zaps Johnny with a few volts from his learning machine, and teaches him Psychlo language and other things that are equally stupid teach to slaves, especially slaves that have already outsmarted you six or seven times, as Johnny has. But, as I have noted, Terl is not the swiftest Psychlo around. Actually, as it is mentioned several times that Terl graduated at the top of his class at the Academy, maybe he *is* the swiftest Psychlo around, and that makes me wonder further how the Psychlos even managed to invent the rubber band, not to mention conquering planets and teleportation. Maybe they bought their technology second hand from the Klingons, along with their makeup.OK, so where were we? Oh, yes. Gold. Terl sends Johnny and his comrades into the Rockies to mine for gold. But Johnny has a better plan. You see, in a brilliant scheme to convince Johnny that resistance is futile, Terl has taken him to the ruins of the \"Denver\" public library, and lets him look at the dusty books, thus instilling in him the realization that the Psychlos are the superior species. But Johnny instead reads the Declaration of Independence and other patriotic documents, and his rebellious resolve is solidified. Of course, as the humans of the future don't seem to have a written language, and the Psychlos don't know English either, so they couldn't have taught it to him, you have to wonder how, exactly, Johnny understood the books he read. Oh, well. Maybe he was inspired by the nice penmanship. At the Library Johnny finds out about Fort Knox, so he and the other miners fly there and take that gold and give it to Terl instead and.and.Ahhhhhh!I'm sorry. At this point the movie completely collapses into a babbling nonsensical cesspool. Ok, it collapses further. I can't even bring myself to describe the details of the finale. With good reason: It is so poorly edited and shot that it makes no sense whatsoever. I think the humans won, but I may be wrong. The Psychlos home planet gets blowed up real good, but Terl survives. The end.That's the plot. But the plot is only one of the movies problems. Second is the acting, which is uniformly dreadful. Trying to compare the John Travolta in \"Pulp Fiction\" to Terl is impossible. Travolta plays the extraterrestrial imbecile like a whiny, petulant eight year old. He is, I guess, supposed to menacing, but he ends up just being annoying. The humans are all dull, and Forrest Whittaker, as Terl's clerk/dogs body Ker is completely wasted. The acting is not helped by the direction. Roger Christian, the auteur who gave us \"Masterminds\", has no idea about how to frame shots, or transition between scenes. There about 1500 wipes in \"Battlefield Earth\", which makes it look like an old \"Commando Cody\" short, only less skillfully executed. Christian has also observed that sometimes, in good movies, the camera is tilted. So he tries to imitate this by randomly tilting the camera, regardless of the action of the scene. The whole film looks as though it was filmed in the Jokers Lair. To top off the hideous direction and lifeless acting, the movie also appears to have been edited by untrained tube worms.In conclusion, avoid \"Battlefield Earth\" at all costs. Do not think that it is a so-bad-its-good kind of movie. It's not. Its so bad its unwatchable. If you want one of the former genre, rent any Ed Wood film, all of which are more enjoyable. On a scale of 1 to 10, this piece of cinematic sputum gets a.5.PS. \"Battlefield Earth\" contains what is meant by the filmmakers to be an homage to \"2001\", by having two of the characters be named \"Floyd\" and \"Heywood\". Under these circumstances, it is  much more of an insult than compliment. If they liked \"2001\" so much, maybe they should have paid more attention to how it was made. It might have helped.But I doubt it.",

So it's not too surprising that the reviews for this movie are so uniformly awful, right?In any case, this movie was awesome!  I've been a fan of Travolta ever since my friends told me about all his movies and how I should see all of them, even the older ones he did between Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction! Has anyone here ever seen Look Who's Talking?  That's a great comedy with both Travolta and my favorite actress, KIRSTIE ALLEY!  Mmmmm.... Kirstie.... And wow, did Travolta crack me up as the evil alien Terl!  He was just so amazingly evil with his forbidding costume and breathing apparatus, he just seemed incredibly alien.But anyways, like I was saying, the movie was AWESOME!  None of that blood-and-guts and sex stuff we see today in Sci-Fi movies like Independence Day and The Matrix, this movie has instead a stirring theme of duty, honor, and sacrifice, not to mention the best special effects since the original Star Wars!So go out and see it today!  It's the feel-good Sci-Fi flick of the summer, and it deserves to be seen multiple times, with as many of your friends as possible, in order to experience the wise themes of Battlefield Earth again and again.  The book was also excellent, easily the second greatest book I've ever read.  I have several copies that I own myself and pass out to friends every chance I get.  They don't always return them, but I figure hey, that means they've passed them on to other friends, right?But anyway, go out and see Battlefield Earth, and hope along with me that it'll go international, and spread its wisdom across the globe!Especially to Germany, which really needs it.",

It had the basic action movie script, good guy versus evil guy, helpless situation, good guy somehow manages to defeat all-powerful bad guy. Granted the plot was kind of hard to follow and some of the dialogue was choppy and didn't make a lot of sense and the aliens were kind of goofy looking and didn't have very good hygiene but I can't say that I was bored and just counting the minutes until the end. I was rooting for Barry Pepper and the humans to beat up those aliens.

            "content": "First, let me say: You NEED to see this movie. It establishes a new benchmark for the millennium. Will we ever see another sci-fi movie this putrid? I can't imagine it. Battlefield Earth certainly sets a milestone that will be hard to beat as the cheesiest big-budget sci-fi film ever made. Based on one of L. Ron Hubbard's countless pulp-sci-fi novels, this is in essence Independence Day all over again, but after the aliens have destroyed Earth and established a colony to mine it. Characters, dialogue, action and acting all reminded me of nothing so much as a Saturday-morning, Transformers-type cartoon specifically targeting 5-year-old boys. Directed by Roger Christian (who's made a career of shlocky losers) Battlefield Urrrp manages to give banality a bad name. The protagonist is named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. No: I'm not making that name up. He lives with his honey as part of a very small tribe of renegades in the year 3,000. Being very brave, he wanders fearlessly close to `the gods' and is of course captured by the aliens. Ah, the aliens. That would be Terl (John Travolta) and Ker (Forest Whittaker). To make them appear very tall, they're obviously walking on huge platform boots. This is obvious because their walk is, literally, stilted and laughably awkward. In fact, I found myself constantly expecting them to start saying `Ni!' since they seemed very much like Monty Python's Knights Who Say Ni! In one of many paradoxes in the film, here are aliens from a race so advanced they were able to wipe out the entire planet in exactly 9 (not 8 or 10, mind you but 9) minutes, way back in the 21st Century, yet they obviously know nothing of personal hygiene and all of them are in desperate need of basic dental work. Even the names would do Saturday-morning cartoons justice. The aliens are Psychlos from the planet Psychlo! I am not making this up, either. And these highly intelligent beings call humans `man-animals.' Of course, when they catch man-animal Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, they come to find they've met their match. Had Ed Wood received the astounding $80 million budget of Battlefield Earth to spend on Plan Nine from Outer Space, this is probably what he'd have done with it. If nothing else, with that budget, the effects should have been awesome. Or even good. But they were just plain cheesy - laughable and low-budget in appearance. One of the funniest moments occurs when the very bad Travolta drops a man-animal down an abyssal chasm to see if it can fly. The way the hapless fellow falls, lying on his back, looking up and waving his arms - allllll the way down - made me feel I was watching a 1950s-vintage flick. Rip-offs of other films abound, but it's as if someone decided to rip off all the worst aspects of sci-fi films from recent years. Jonnie figures out how to beat the seemingly invincible aliens and part of his scheme requires his band of wild, uneducated man-animal workers to learn how to fly the United States' most sophisticated jets from 2000 (they know just where to find lots of them, of course). Sure enough, Jonnie leads them to an old training module; each one sets a spell in it and comes out an incredible ace fighter pilot, despite having never even seen a jet before. Never mind that after 1,000 years these birds might not start right up (even if the jet fuel were any good). Never mind that these same planes and even much more powerful weapons, during the invasion 1,000 years ago, had absolutely no effect on the invaders' technology. Now, suddenly, these jets are deadly - knocking the transplanetary craft unerringly out of the sky. Hell, the wild, loin-clothed man-animals must have learned jargon in the training module, too, so they suddenly spout marvelously incongruous lines like, `Hang on! I'm right on his tail!' The acting was as laughable as the plot. Travolta's forced `evil laugh' matched the special effects for cheesiness. And, certainly, Forest Whittaker has never been so ridiculous. Both actors spend the film varying between malevolent smiles and evil sneers; that's the range of their performances. Of course, if their heart wasn't in it, who could blame them with dialogue that would have made the Power Rangers sound childish. `Man-animals operating machinery?' asks alien Whittaker to Travolta, aliens technologically light-years ahead of Earth, from a race which freely traverses galaxies, `Have you blown a head gasket?' But if the aliens are petty villains, the wild humans surviving in `the hills,' are profound. Such as man-animal Jonnie Goodboy's woman-animal who says to him, `Jonnie, I've always known you don't believe in fate, but I've always known this will be our destiny.' (And she does it with a straight face!) As if all this weren't bad enough, the cinematographer apparently wanted to do his part in making the film worse - by inexplicably shooting scenes throughout the film with the camera tilted - at up to 45 degrees.  I kept waiting for the actors to start sliding right out of the frame! And apparently the editor's idea of action means `fast cuts.' The cuts were so fast, in fact, that during what could have been at least marginally interesting fight scenes, all we got were muddled flashes back and forth so quickly that we knew fighting was going on but couldn't follow any of it - until it was over, at which point we had no idea how the winner prevailed. Before the film came out, some controversy erupted over the fact that this movie was nothing more than an insidious ploy to spread Hubbard's (and Travolta's) religion of Scientology. You could find a deeper, more evident message in any episode of Pee Wee's Playhouse than you'd find in Battlefield Earth. If there was any message intended (which I can't imagine), it was completely lost in this puerile, brainless turd of a movie. 0* (and that's being too generous)  (May, 2000)",

My advice is to watch the movie before the book, because the movie is based on a 500 page section of the book (the first half), which is fairly hard to squeeze into the short amount of time the movie lasts.  The book is also excellent, written by an author who knows how to write what people will enjoy forever.  It is a timeless classic already, enjoyed by adults and children alike, as the movie is.

            "content": "\"Battlefield Earth\" has all the elements to a good sci-fi epic. Several, in fact. I think they should sue.Let's set \"Braveheart\" in a sci-fi setting, I can see them saying. Yes, but that was called \"Independence Day.\" Ok, so include some of the more savage elements of \"Braveheart\" and use the sets for \"Blade Runner.\" This also cuts from the lighting budget, which we can use to pay for John Travolta's makeup. Oh, and to save money on the costuming budget, let's use stuff we can five-finger discount from Goodwill and the Salvation Army.Of course none of that happened because the book is older than that, which is what makes it really uncanny. The plot could not have been canibalized from those sources. The fact that they feel so stolen from is a tribute to Roger Christian's inability to show any talent that cannot be found in a Blockbuster.Action sequences from \"The Matrix.\" A camera wipe from \"Episode I\" (they could only afford one). Special Effects robbed from \"Bablyon V,\" and then darkened with the Curves tool in Photoshop. A soundtrack that was pieced together from \"Earth 2\" and \"SeaQuest DSV\" at the local used CD shop.Oh, and then the leg on the camera tripod broke, and they couldn't afford a new one. And the editing was done by the director's 12-year-old son in Adobe Premier.Ok, the film had one thing that in my desperation I clung to as a saving grace: John Travolta. I mean, he just LOOKS funny. When he starts talking, it's just hilarious. Somebody call Tarentino and tell him that Johnny needs a third career after he flushed his second down the drain.Now, for the final question... is the film a Scientology tract? Hmm. Scientology means \"knowing about knowing,\" but all I learned about was the pain inflicted by an overcaffeinated editing job. I didn't see any deleting of engrams, and definately nobody that was \"Clear.\" Not a smidgen of an idea of thetans. There were some references to Freedom, but those were more like Mel Gibson imitations than liberating oneself from \"Matter, Energy, Space, and Time.\" So all I got out of that was a bunch of people on IMDb wondering why I know this much about Scientology and thinking I should be committed.

So much is missed and you get what we have with \"Battlefield Earth: The Movie That Sorta Promises a Sequel\". At least thats the impression I got from the ending. They tried to cram so much into 2 hrs that enjoyment of the story was lost in a race to get to the climax. The Psychlo's were portrayed well. Travolta makes a good Psyclo. Whats his face that played Johnny Goodboy Tyler looked like if he concentrated hard enough everything would be all right. But he tried too hard to be Mel Gibson in Braveheart, right down to the braid in his hair. Probably wasn't his fault, but its hard not to draw comparisons. Overall this would have been better if they broke it up over 4 nights on network tv and made even a half-a**'d attempt to stick to the story line.Bottom line... don't expect a whole lot.

The movie is doing a very good job telling about 1/2 of the book's story with great special effects and some real bad ass aliens. Travolta plays the Psychlo security chief Terl and I just hated his guts. The concept of NEVER giving up, no matter what the odds, was very uplifting.

Travoltas byplay with Forrest Whittaker is marvelous.If there is a shortcoming to the movie it lies in the difficult task of distilling a 1000 page novel into two hours running time. Dune met a similar fate but it remains one of my favorite sci-fi movies and favorite books of the genre.I recommend the movie--especially for Travolta's performance and those of Whittaker and Barry Pepper as the hero of the story.

Because of the compressed, rushed pace of the film, it would have been easy to let some of the scenes be done in a superficial manner; however, they turned these into scenes that made the characters more understandable. Some character development was done with glances from the actors and that is not an easy task.The theme of the movie is truly noble and might escape some people because it also is not superficial.  It is about a quality that does not exist around us in high quantity and is almost not taught any more.I recommend it and think that parents should encourage their kids to go as well.",

A very insidious type of evil.  He's the villain you love to hate.My favorite character was Forest Whitaker who plays Travolta's sidekick.

For years now all people have done is attach the word \"Scientology\" to L. Ron Hubbard - quite unfairly forgetting that he was one of the greatest and most prolific sci-fi writers of all time. Right up there with Asimov. Yes, he was most certainly a founder of a religion, but with the release of this movie, I think it is plain for all to see that Mr. Hubbard was a gem of a sci-fi/action writer.\nAnd as for the critics out there: What exactly IS a critic? It is a person who cannot produce and so they find ways (little or small) to tear apart the work of others who are working to create something. Keep your harsh opinions to yourself! It took alot of time and effort to make this incredible film and some of the special effects rival ANYTHING out there including Star Wars, Independence Day, or some of the most well-known action flicks like Die Hard.This movie was wonderful.

            "content": "I went into this movie expecting it to be a number one, blockbuster \"hit\" and was very disappointed. I did not read the book and I don't believe a viewer must in order to get the plot if the creators do their job. That a plot isn't the same as a book does not bother me either. But I found the plot incoherent and hard to follow. I found the characters very undeveloped and these two things are needed to create an emotional impact in any film. Special effects cannot carry  a movie alone in lieu of a good dramatic and clear message. And to be a \"hit\" as it was promoted these things must be done from an audience viewpoint not what Travolta, Christian or the Scientology public thinks is a good movie. And herein rests the problem with this flick.As a special effects art director and set decorator Roger Christian is not a film director with any experience. He was a second unit director. Nor is he known for developing  characters although I also found his film to be too darkly filmed. Even the screenwriter was a beginner. You don't hire people at this level for a brilliant epic that is difficult to recreate on film. It was also Travolta's  first attempt at producing. I have to give them credit for the attempt but I think the three of them bit off more than they could chew and it shows.As far as those writing in saying that all the good reviews are by Scientologists I feel that there is prejudice and bias at both ends of the spectrum which is  obvious. On one end there are those who hated it before it began because it was written by Hubbard and produced by Travolta. Even if it were good these people would be writing the same thing. They  are just more delighted that it also wasn't a \"hit\". These people have an agenda and are just as organized in their attack as they allege the Scio's are in their support. I am one myself. The fact of the matter is that the reviews amongst my group are actually mixed. We are individuals with our own opinions about a movie. As far as all of us buying the book six or seven times-I never even bought it at all and my husband bought only one. He loved it! But he did not like the movie. This goes the same with some of my friends including non-Scio's who are not prejudiced. I do believe that some guys truly had a high opinion of the movie eventhough I don't agree with them. It may be true that some are automatically partial to it at the get-go but no single person is totally free of any bias. We all bring our personal tastes to any work of art. Some of these guys like this kind of story and message regardless. So what.I also did not see any sublimal messages for the religion either except that we don't like psyches and/or psychotics. It was overt, not hidden. What is wrong with that?  What about the Christian messages in \"Ben Hur\" or Jewish ones in \"Shindler's List\" ? Jewish people don't like Nazis. That doesn't make them bad.  These are very valid points of view shared by others.In place of invalidating criticism some constructive criticism is due-a better way to do. The story is better suited to a TV miniseries or at least an epic length of three hours to  flesh it out more and develop the characters. Roger Christian could still direct the special effects, but hire a top-notch experienced screenwriter and director,  cast a more charismatic Johnnie Goodboy-Tyler; someone more blond and blue-eyed. Prior to release market test it for response.  Spielberg would have been a great candidate but may not have had the courage to take it on. Gene Hackman would be great as Terl, not that John was bad and Kelly Preston was great.It's true the creators did not put the film \"over the plate\" but the extreme Scio critics couldn't have created anything better if they could create anything at all. And that's my humble but Constitutionally protected opinion.",

I don't know or care about the author or his religion and followers - it's irrelevant to the movie. Christian, Muslim, Mormon - they've all got ridiculous myths, beliefs, and followers - followers who have to suspend logic in real life everyday - so why not for a movie? 4.

Recently, John has created a new persona for the big screen with funny, villainous characters in Pulp Fiction, Face Off and Broken Arrow. I was impressed with the way he has added more elements of comic dark humor in B.E. I'll definitely be seeing this one again, like all his movies, to catch all the subtle lines and facial expressions I missed the first time.",

Sure there are holes in the plot, physics not behaving as they should etc, but this is science FICTION, not reality based drama. The book is fantastic and answers a lot of the questions asked by the people prepared to blast this movie. The humans use the aliens technology to learn how to fly, etc. Who knows what technology will be like in 1000 years from another planet?!? The Psyclos arrogance to everything non Psyclo is a parallel to America's arrogance to the rest of the world as it is today. After millenniums of being the master race of the universe, they have stagnated and look down upon all other species/races with contempt. Their society is based on corruption and I can't help but think LRH intended this to parallel the consumer capitalism that rules the western world today. Read the book, I am not a scientologist, nor a Christian, and I think most of the disliking of this movie is due to prejudice (towards Scientology)and people not following the story and filling in the blanks themselves. This is no worse an attempt at the scifi genre as any other movie, including the completely unoriginal Star Wars trilogy, Star Trek etc. I can't wait until someone gets the balls to do a movie of LRH's Mission Earth decology, what a great yarn that one is, full of corruption, temptation, greed, lust and science FICTION at its best. I gave this 8 out of 10, it could have been longer and more in depth by explaining all the little bits people with no imagination couldn't figure out for themselves, but overall it is a good attempt at a very complex and long piece of science FICTION.",

The book was recently named the best sci-fi of the century by Publisher's Weekly.  The movie closely follows the book, although there are some changes, which I can only assume were made to successfully adapt such an epic to the screen.  It's easy to sit back with a critical eye, not having been the producer/director who had to make the critical decisions in the movie's production.  From start to finish, the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, but refreshingly, without the unnecessary gore or foul language.  There are many humorous moments to ease the tension as well. The special effects were exciting and seamless (the transition between the actual footage and computer graphics).  Overall, the film invoked the kind of excitement I felt while watching the very first of the Star Wars trilogy years ago -- a great movie for the entire family.",

            "content": "It would be impossible for any movie to truly do justice to the book, \"Battlefield Earth\" (which I recommend to all and sundry; I've read it four times so far), because of its enormous scope and long time-line.  The movie makes a valiant attempt to include as much as possible of the events in the book, mostly by truncating the timeline and the number of characters.  The severe truncation makes the movie storyline more like a myth, with larger-than-life characters doing impossible deeds against incredible odds in an implausibly short period of time.  Nonetheless, the moviemakers did a good job, and the effects are spectacular, if somewhat derivative.  You may have seen similar effects in other movies, but they're used here to tell a new story (just as you have seen words like these before, but I'm using them to tell you something new).  And the story is a good one, well worth watching.  The part I liked best, however, was the music!  It enhanced the movie without overwhelming it (I didn't really think about how good the music was until we got to the credits ~ which we always watch, all the way to the very end, as a matter of principle ~ when the movie wasn't distracting me).  I plan to buy the soundtrack, which I almost never do, and play it often, especially when I feel I'm in an uphill battle and need to boost my spirits.  It is stirring, inspiring, almost martial music. Perhaps I'll play it the next time I read the book!  If you like the movie, you'll love the book (it will explain many things that they couldn't fit into the movie), which will also tell you the rest of the story ~ this movie covers only the first half of the book!",

My wife had never heard anything about the story at all and she didn't like it at all.  The movie moved so fast that the characters were there and gone before you even knew who it was.  No plot development.  To me the worst part was the fact that the picture was ALWAYS at a 20 degree angle. Nice touch once in a while, but not every shot!!! 0 believeability factor, (harriers still in mint condition after 1000 years, Barbarians learning to fly a harrier like a pro in 7 days?

I was not only skeptical when I heard the movie was being made, but doubtful that it would carry any semblance of emotion/impact that the book had. You know, everyone always says, \"the book was better\"... Well, I was very surprised that so many elements that made the book so incredible were kept in the movie. Most of the book seemed to me to be all but impossible to duplicate on film -- I mean, how can you make a 9' or 10' tall alien using the real actor's head and not end up with a tiny head on a big body? The characters looked very good to me. Also, I was impressed with the photography (there is no blood in the movie, but you sure feel like there is). I thought John Travolta did an excellent \"evil\" and Barry Pepper did a fine job as Johnny -- excellent acting on both of their parts. All in all I think it was a very tough challenge for Hollywood to undertake. I think my book \"movie\" was better, but there really is no way to make what I have in my head become a reality even with the most modern technology. Hats off to those who pulled it off!",

            "content": "When, several months ago, John Travolta referred to the writing of his guru, L. Ron Hubbard, as \"the fine wine of science fiction,\" I KNEW something fishy was up.  To the best of my knowledge--and I consider myself fairly well read in the genre--the late L. Ron Hubbard is widely regarded as an amateurish hack of a science fiction author, given to poor spelling and worse grammar, and further hindered by his apparent inability to spin a trite piece of fantasy in less than 1000 pages.  Actor John Travolta, who admits that he has read \"The Time Machine\" and \"Leagues Under The Sea\" [sic], seemingly elevates Hubbard's scrawling above the works of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.  And THAT, my friends, is a stretch.It is no less a stretch for the film, \"Battlefield Earth.\" A monstrously dull and slow-witted yarn, here we have a typical high-school script: Aliens rule the earth, Mankind fights back.  How many times have we seen this theme rehashed through the years?  Most schlock producers can work with such a premise in an entertaining fashion, but not so with \"Battlefield Earth.\" Produced as a \"labor of love\" and as a \"tribute\" to L. Ron Hubbard, the film is nothing more than a thinly-veiled and campy Scientology lecture on breaking the bonds of bureaucracy and defeating the System (yawn). Features the CGI effects that may be expected in ANY mediocre film today, but the movie is poorly framed, poorly acted, poorly scored and very poorly edited. More than embarrassing, the film is mortifyingly bad--it makes one ashamed to be a theatregoer.Without bailing off into the childish storyline, Salvation Army costuming and dastardly dialogue, it may be enough to note that this movie is based on merely the first HALF of Hubbard's 1982 novel, \"Battlefield Earth.\"  A hugely boring tome of over 1000 pages, it reads like the scribbling of a neurotic recluse who starts out sober and finishes in a drunken stupor. Which does not bode well for the promised sequel film, presumably based on the remaining half of the same book.CineDigest",

I liked many things about the film but it didn't capture Mr. Hubbard's masterful tension, expression and warmth for the characters. Johnnie Goodboy Tyler was alone as a human when Terl brought him to the base, not one of hundreds. He was alone in knowing that he had to save the world of humans. He was alone. Chrissy was blonde and sort of whimpy til the end.  Johnnie was an exceptional human being with a depth that included razor-sharp wit and an insoucient sense of humor that allowed him to triumph over the plodding, evil minded psychlos.

The main character has some very good moments, and has a never-die attitude, but not just with false bravado, but with clever actions as well.The main character's goal is not just to \"kill the bad guys\", but to free all people from their oppression.For example, there is a moment where he could kill the bad guy (John Travolta) easily, but turns it around to make the bad guy think him less a threat, and so the main character gets more leeway to achieve his larger goals.Lots of moments where the audience laughs, cheers or applauds.",

            "content": "FREE THE EARTH!A Review of the Screenplay for Battlefield Earth by Brad LinaweaverBrad Linaweaver, co-author of the best selling Doom novels. acquired a copy of the Corey Mandell shooting script that was used during the Summer 1999 filming of Battlefield Earth in Montreal, Canada. A Nebula finalist and Prometheus award winner for his first major science fiction work, Moon of Ice, Linaweaver has also written the Sliders books based on the popular TV series. In addition to selling over seventy short stories and 200 articles to anthologies and magazines, he is co-editor of Free Space. Following are his comments and thoughts.Adapting one of the modern classics of science fiction for the screen might seem a daunting task but Corey Mandell has proven he was equal to the task. Everything L. Ron Hubbard learned as one of the top writers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction is on display in his magnum opus, Battlefield Earth. If ever there was a novel demanding the big screen treatment, this is it!The screenwriter understands that the strength of a book-to-movie project lies in faithfulness to the original vision. All too often, Hollywood spends a fortune bastardizing the work of gifted authors. That hasn't happened this time. Reading the actual screenplay used for the filming of Battlefield Earth has been a revelation. Imagine Hollywood spending tens of millions of dollars to get it right.Mandell trusted the novel. This gave him the advantage of using the well-structured plot and the interesting shadings of the characters. The hero, Jonnie (played by Barry Pepper), is adaptable in a manner we rarely see on the screen. We've seen action heroes who do incredibly brave things. We've seen more cerebral heroes who outsmart their opponents and even flatter their vanity. But Jonnie can do both as the situation requires. He can switch back and forth in a second. He knows his opponents have all the advantages but they also have one potentially fatal flaw, their pride. Jonnie never forgets that at crucial moments his enemies will underestimate him.In fact, the bad guys the alien Psychlos are the literal embodiment of foolish pride. Because it only took them minutes to conquer the Earth with superior technology, they assume that the remnants of human beings who remain will never cause them any trouble. After a thousand years of dominating the Earth, there is little reason for them to think otherwise.The primary villain of the story is Terl, head of Earth security, portrayed by John Travolta. He is smarter than the other Psychlos. He is the first to realize that Jonnie is smarter than the other man-animals. Even so, Terl can't overcome his prejudices sufficiently to imagine that human beings might be able to take back their planet.Already we are dealing with a level of sophistication in the writing beyond most film and televised science fiction. The script also retains many nice touches that only show up in real science fiction. A good example is that the aliens find a beautiful blue sky with white clouds to be one of the ugliest things they've ever seen.The plot is never boring. Terl is so busy plotting against other Psychlos that it distracts him from the human threat to his power. The fundamental weakness of all tyrannies is that they must ultimately devour themselves. When the ruling power becomes decadent, the victims of Empire have their chance if they possess sufficient courage. The script couldn't include all the material about economics and politics found in the novel but it kept what was essential. The result is a surprisingly adult film that will appeal to teenagers with its action and adventure. Maybe some of the kids will even be inspired to read the book.Already the film version of Battlefield Earth is being compared to other block-buster science fiction films before it even comes out. The obvious and best comparison is to the Star Wars films. There are very few films like these. The comparison is also inspired by Roger Christian in the director's chair when he'd earlier been art director for the original Star Wars and unit director on The Phantom Menace. He was even recommended for Battlefield Earth by no less that George Lucas! And, of course, the design and special effects experts are the same people who worked on the Star Wars films as well as the Alien films, Independence Day, X-Files and Titanic.But after a close reading of this script, I think Battlefield Earth can be favorably compared to a film that has nothing to do with science fiction - Spartacus. Only a handful of films have dealt with the full implications of slavery and what it takes to resist the most evil of institutions. Cynics won't understand what I'm talking about because they share the psychology of the Psychlos.A good plot puts characters in conflict and then has clever resolution. Battlefield Earth the novel has this. And so does the script. How ironic that there are snobs who dismiss this kind of story as pulp fiction.\nPulp fiction! The title of a movie that was one of the great moments in John Travolta's career. Pulp fiction! The kind of high adventure and romances that L. Ron Hubbard wrote back when people read to get their entertainment thrills.Today's kids are hungry for stories of heroes and villains on an epic scale. The situation with which Battlefield Earth begins seems far more hopeless than any problems the audience might have. There seems no conceivable way for the good guys to defeat the bad guys. To quote the opening line of the novel: \"Man,\" said Terl, \"is an endangered species.\"For two hours in a darkened movie theatre, a new generation will be shown that sometimes cliches are the truest things in the world: \"While there's life, there's hope.\"Mandell has done his job well.) 2000 Brad Linaweaver",

What's up with THAT?!?  It didn't even seem to me, in some of the reviews, that the critics even WATCHED the movie before lambasting the whole thing! Half of them didn't even have the basic premise of the movie or even the NAMES OF THE ALIENS correct in their reviews!!!!

The aliens are big, bad, dress in long black trenchcoats, and display a wicked combination of stupidity, greed, and self-interest.  Humans are small, emaciated, desparate, but partiotic, self-sacrificing, and very interested in learning all they can, especially about how to take back the Earth. The Dome City is the one respite from the cliche views of a Post-Apocolyptic Earth. The acting jobs of the humans are convincing and evocative of the most noble character in men.  Travolta and the other aliens are frightening and comic in their arrogance and displays of raw power.  Time and again, you have to wonder how they managed to make Travolta and the aliens look like specimens of Giganthropicus while standing next to humans.  A fun sci-fi show that displays a range of character and spirit with the requisite explosions and gunfire, while avoiding profanity and explicit sex.  A beheading is done off-screen, while you see the actors react to it.  The two amputations (performed on bad guys) are handled almost as comic relief. While you don't leave the theatre pumping your arm up and down like you did after Independence Day, you do walk out smugly thinking \"Homo Sapiens Kick Butt\".",

The acting and filming were middling daytime TV quality, at best - stereotypic characters, over dramatic dialog and camera movement. Ughh. I hoped that with the debut of the Travolta character things would get on track. Unfortunately, it got worse throughout the film.Other reviews have already pointed out many of the obvious logical errors in the film. I am pretty good at ignoring that kind of stuff as long as there is some element in film that is interesting, endearing, enticing, funny, etc. For me this film had nothing.My friend and I were close to leaving several times, but for some reason chose to stay.

I thought Forrest W. did great as the side-kick and loved his scene at the end of the film when he got to turn the tables on his jerk of a boss. Pepper did a great job with Johnny's character - playing it with the right amount of seriousness for the situation Johnny was in - basically a \"common man\" rather reluctantly thrust into the role of hero by virtue of his own desire for freedom and strength of integrity, rather than any thirst for power.  Good versus evil in a wild-ride, fun, campy sci-fi setting...that's a good time and a good movie experience in my book any day.

            "content": "Putting all the fiery rhetoric, nasty rumors, falsehoods, prejudices and other hot comments aside, I'd like to review this film for what it is: an adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's epic sci-fi novel. Here's my view. For me, the book was terrific, which millions of others who bought it internationally can vouch for I'm sure. But the film is mediocre at best. There is one basic, major flaw with the movie, which I believe, doomed it from the beginning, and that was trying to tell this story in 2 hours. It never should have been attempted. Maybe three hours would have worked, but Travolta and director, Christiansen, didn't have that luxury.The book is rich in characters, sub-plots, humor, and most importantly a true sense of the world. Battlefield Earth is basically a story about the subjugation of mankind by an evil force and how one man helps the rest of the ragtag survivors of the planet fight back. What I loved the most about the book (besides the obsessed character of Terl) was the Scots and surviving tribes of other nations teaming together to fight back against impossible odds. I remember when I saw the film, I kept saying: where is Robert the Fox? Where are the Scots? Where is the sound of bagpipes coming over the hill? Where is that sense of \"Braveheart\" that I felt when I read the novel. None of that wonderful sense of the world made it into the film.And that's why it failed.It's my opinion that Travolta had a worthwhile dream to realize the book in film, and unfortunately, out of practical necessity, cut far too much of the richness of the story, and thus, unintentionally, ruined it. The flaws should have been seen at the shooting script stage, but they weren't -- and then everyone was on board the Titantic (though I don't think the film is that much of a disaster really. I would give it a 5-10 -- worth watching if you're expectations are not super-high.)Too bad it can't all be done again as an animated series which could do justice to the depth of the book. But that's showbiz.",

            "content": "I never saw this movie in the theaters, just on DVD.  Firstly, the 5.1 channel surround on the DVD was VERY crisp, with good dimensionality and excellent effects.  The whole room was shaking during some of the blast scenes.  Overall, the movie was very enjoyable.  I  liked the whole concept, especially the fact that this all takes place 1000 years after an alien invasion.  Quite frankly, this is a lot more realistic scenario than Independence Day.  The difference here is that human technology was no match for the aliens.  This is much more realistic since any race which manages to reach Earth with interstellar travel is likely much more technologically advanced than ours.  The key to the human's success is that Johnnie was trained in the alien technology, and then figures out how to use the alien technology against the aliens.  This is much more realistic.  And realize that it was only with the help of the aliens in the first place that the humans learned alien technology.  The chances of the humans being able to figure out the advanced technology without the aliens teaching it to them is almost nil.  There were many other facts which correspond much more closely to real physics than other movies.  So I thought the concept very good, and I would recommend any SF buff to check out this movie, especially if you have a good home theater set up with 5.1 channel Dolby Digital surround. This movie is now one of my top 2 choices for showing off my stereo system (the other one is Fifth Element).",

You will hate this film if you go into it looking for intelligent science-fiction that teaches us anything new or worthwhile about the human condition. That's a shame because this film represents a missed opportunity. The idea of the human race reduced and in thrall to their alien masters on Earth could have been a wonderfully insightful poke at our notions of mastery and arrogance over this planet. But the unbelievable background story and the dramatic ending, combined with dodgy dialogue serve to ruin the whole piece. If you go into this film with lower standards, just looking for a no-brainer to waste some time with, you'll find this movie OK. Don't believe the bandwagon press.

I agree that for such a big budget movie and all the hype and star power that went along with it, there should have been a better pay-off. However, if you look past all that, there is actually some pretty cool stuff in the film.  The way Barry Pepper's character evolves throughout the story is brilliant.  I also thought that the make-up and costumes were really good. I think that if people look at the movie for what it is, which is good old fashioned sci fi, they will enjoy themselves.

            "content": "There was so much good material to work from, yet they still managed to create a movie that won an astonishing seven razzies. It's quite a remarkable achievement if you think about it, but certainly not in a good way. As an avid science fiction reader, I prefer to read a book before I see the movie, but in this case I don't think that was such a good idea. Yes, this was a bad movie, but amazingly enough it's even worse if you know what the story was meant to be like. L. Ron Hubbard wrote a true masterpiece and it is really disappointing to think of how it was misrepresented in the movie that bears the same name of Battlefield Earth.The original book is really just too big to try and cram into a two-hour movie; I think that the 1050 pages and 400,000 words would be a good indication of that. Just look at what happened to Dune: they took one of the most monumental works in science fiction and turned it into a movie that was nearly impossible to follow. I'll have to see it again to see if it makes more sense after reading the book, but still, it's just the thought of taking a masterpiece and mutilating it beyond recognition.In Battlefield Earth, the story was chopped up so badly that the majority of the characters in the book weren't even mentioned in the movie. Example: (Caution: Contains spoilers [not that it matters])* Robert the Fox- The Scottish war chief who is more or less Jonnie's main helper.* Dunneldee, Stormalong and Glencannon- Other Scotsmen who help with taking back the planet.* The seventy-seven remaining Scots- Where were they? Did you see any Scottish people? I didn't see any Scottish people.* The Chinese- I didn't see any of them either.* The thirty-odd alien races- Nope. Definitely no aliens besides the Psychols.Where did they all go? You might be asking if you actually care, and I would be concerned if you did. Well, I have one word for you: Carlo. Yes, Carlo. The guy with the dark, curly hair who tried the suicide dive into the dome that failed at first. I'm not sure exactly how they managed to get eighty-one people into one character, but somehow they did, if rather unsuccessfully. Actually, there was a Robert the Fox in the movie, but I didn't realize this until reading the cast list. Not to mention that only about a third of the book was covered in the movie, but I can't imagine what it would have been like had they tried to put all 1050 pages into two hours. Well . . . no, it's definitely too frightening to think about it. They would have been better off just not attempting to make the movie in the first place. The writer didn't even follow the plot. For those of you who haven't read the book, it might be interesting for you to know that when Jonnie was captured along by Terl (the movie really screwed this up) he was kept for nearly a year until they both went to Scotland and picked up the eight-one people from there. I guess they just wanted to condense the story so they captured Jonnie with a few other people and took him to a compound where there were already a few hundred humans. The real stinger to this all is this quote from the official Battlefield Earth website, and this is a real quote:\". . .the grand adventure of Battlefield Earth awaited only the right script adaptation before everything came together to make it a movie reality. With a Corey Mandell screenplay, which captures the immense scope and irrepressible spirit of Hubbard's novel, that time has at last arrived.\"Poor Corey Mandell; you almost feel sorry for him.

It should have been a pleasure to see Travolta and Whittaker in such fanciful roles and costumes, and it's a shame they won't make a sequel. We wanna see what happens next! Not. Basically Travolta wanted to turn everyone into a scientologist, but this whacked out shitty story didn't make anyone want to pay like $3500 for some stupid books, let alone $5 back in 2000 to see this movie. It sucked, but Forrest is still the man and it's cool he fucked over Travolta! He gets his is in the end! So anyway, it was one of the worst movies of 531 since Squid and Whale, or until a couple days later when HBO Max suggested I watch the Crazy Rich Asians, fuck them 2.

I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. If you can make it through the book, you'll enjoy the movie.

Based on a work by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, this movie focuses on the ultraviolent alien species Psychlos that enslave and study the last living humans in the 31st Century. The humans rebel and join forces to destroy these damn dirty aliens once and for all. As a person who's not quite into science fiction movies, I found out early on why this movie is often considered the worst. The laughable Psychlo designs look like troll dolls covered in moss with dirty mops on their heads. Despite being the leader of the superior conquering alien race, Terl (John Travolta) has no idea how to communicate with the humans or what food they eat. The humans also have inconsistent tendencies, the shopping mall mannequin worshippers that give away their weapons to villains, but yet know to use a nuclear bomb to take out the Psychlos' planet. Seriously, you'd think Terl and his gang would have wiped out the human race on Earth with the use of radioactive fusion, rather than the other way around. So, with that said, Battlefield Earth is one miracle of a sci-fi flop. With the horrendous art direction, baffling idiotic inconsistencies and complete stupidity in the writing and characters, this movie is one giant intergalactic dog that has to be seen to be believed.

Watching Battlefield Earth is like taking a shit that just doesn't want to come out. It's frustrating, it's messy, and it only serves to screw up your day. In fact, this movie is so painful that I am forcing myself to watch it until I finish this review. Man, you should see how fast I'm typing right now.\n\nActing: 3\nLess than two minutes in, the movie has one of those bloodcurdling \"NO!\" screams after main character Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) finds out someone close to him has died. That's when I remember saying to myself: \"What the hell did I just get myself into? I gotta sit through the rest of this?\" You would think, \"Well, it's only uphill from here.\" You, madam or sir, would be wrong. From John Travolta and Forest Whitaker's painful performances as aliens to the rest of this horrid cast, I can't really decide who did the worst job. I gave them a 3 because, well, I'm assuming they showed up on set everyday.\n\nBeginning: 0\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 3\nFast forward to four minutes after the \"scream\". You see a bunch of cavemen (ish) beating up a prop from a broken down minigolf fun center. You see this happening with weird cut shots and slow motion, all while focusing on the anger and intent of the cavemen who see it as a threat. It is quite possibly one of the dumbest scenes I have seen in film. It angers me even now just thinking about it.\n\nConflict: 6\n\nEntertainment Value: 0\n\nMemorability: 0\nThe only thing I need to remember is this movie is garbage and to run if someone ever mentions watching it. There is nothing about this movie I will ever treasure.\n\nPace: 2\nLet me watch paint dry and see if I'm not more entertained. My wife captured a caterpillar in a jar recently because she thinks it may become a butterfly. I'm pretty sure it's dying because it only moves an inch every few hours. That inch outpaces the speed at which this movie drags along. Give me the DMV. Give me the longest wait at any Disneyworld ride. Give me the lines for the 2008 voting stations. I will take any of these things over Battlefield Earth.\n\nPlot: 0\n\nResolution: 1\nEnded just like it began: As a failed movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. \n\nOverall: 17\nI usually don't judge people on tastes. We're all different and we all like different things. But if you enjoyed this movie in any shape or fashion and you profess to be my friend, please lose my number. The passion with which I hate this movie has no end.",

For it's time when the movie was created it also had a lot of great CGI, as well as wardrobe.

Plus, he doesn't have the kind of deep, resounding bass voice necessary to command immediate respect.

This is probably the closest to what \"gangrene vision\" would look like if it existed, yet even then the film is able to outdo itself in its ugliness by including overabundant dutch angles and tedious slow motion. John Travolta once claimed, 'the film would be like Star Wars only better' but there really is not a hope of successfully comparing Battlefield Earth with any sci-fi film, classic or mediocre. This is about as bad as a sci-fi film gets. Meticulous calculation would be needed if one deliberately tried to make a film of the same abysmal caliber.

Ironically, I don't regret renting this film. I rented it out of curiosity to see how \"terra-ble\" it was and people were right. Here are the complaints I have about this film, poor storyline, bad acting (especially from John Travolta), weak dialogue, everything from a thousand years prior still works, overuse of Dutch angles (45 degree angles on film cameras), and it's just a bad film. If you'd like to see a good science fiction film, check out \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\", \"ET\", \"The Thing\", or the \"Back To The Future\" franchise, the \"Terminator\" films (earlier, although I didn't see them, I hear they're good), \"Scooby Doo And The Alien Invaders\", \"Marvin The Martian cartoons\", or the episode of \"Scooby Doo\" (original series) where Scooby and the gang encounter an alien, all of which are better than this hunk of garbage.

I was thinking nah this can't be as bad as everyone said it was. When I saw Battlefield Earth, I could be more wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the plot is not worth for me to explain because it is too stupid and incoherent for me to explain. Not only that, Battlefield Earth is fill with plotholes that most people who are fans of the book (and yes this is based on a book) will be confused because I was. It is a movie so bad that I wonder why it got made in the first place. \n\nBattlefield Earth is fill with overacting (mainly John Travolta), like I just mention plotholes, saturated colors, and the more irritating of them all Dutch angles. And no the soundtrack is not good either. Well, you can't call it a soundtrack because atleast a soundtrack have a smooth sound to it like a Hans Zimmer soundtrack. However, in Battlefield Earth the sound is bascially just noise throughout the whole film. It is just embarrassing and stunningly awful in every way.\n\nIf you are a smart person, you will not watch Battlefield Earth. It is the worst sci-fi flick I have ever witnessed. It is bad in every aspect. There is not one good or decent thing in this movie. Not even Forest Whitaker can't save this movie. Avoid this film and watch a better sci-fi flick like The Matrix (which it copies because of the slow motion) or Star Wars.",

It i used at the most insignificant moments. Slow motion is best used sparingly anyway but I couldn't get past the idea that this film may have been 10 minutes shorter had the scenes in question been run at the correct frame rate. The dialogue is woeful but in a way the delivery, particularly from Travolta, is one of the few redeeming features. Whether it is supposed to be funny is up for debate but I did chuckle a few times. Although this is thoroughly inept it is only redeemed, perhaps in hindsight, by its few moments of hammy charm.",

I read about this film in a TV Guide listing films that would be playing on TV when I was a kid. I gotta tell you, this film is horrible, it's a waste of time (laughs). Ironically, I don't regret renting this film. I rented it out of curiosity to see how bad it was and people were right. Here are the complaints I have about this film, poor storyline, bad acting (especially from John Travolta), weak dialogue, everything from a thousand years prior still works, overuse of Dutch angles (45 degree angles on film cameras), and it's just a bad film. If you'd like to see a good science fiction film, check out \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\", \"ET\", \"The Thing\", or the \"Back To The Future\" franchise, the \"Terminator\" films (earlier, although I didn't see them, I hear they're good), \"Scooby Doo And The Alien Invaders\", \"Marvin The Martian cartoons\", or the episode of \"Scooby Doo\" (original series) where Scooby and the gang encounter an alien, all of which are better than this hunk of garbage. Also, this film is supposed to revolved around Scientology (which I do not believe in, but Travolta believes in), but I didn't see ANY connection between Scientology. All I saw was just messed up looking outfits and dumb aliens! But, I have to admit there were some scenes that were entertaining, but for the most part it was DUMB!",

So why have the gate? It clearly won't stop human invaders, and it's completely useless against the aliens (Psyclos), who have aircraft.\n\nI get that Psyclos are taller that humans, but why do they look like regular sized people walking on stilts?\n\nHelp me understand how the Psyclos can rate human intelligence on par with man's best friend, yet can clearly see signs to the contrary all about them? Hello! Who built all those cities you destroyed? Considering all the evidence to the contrary, why do the supposedly intelligent Psyclos think human beings can't be taught how to mine gold? The very thought of humans operating mining equipment is prosperous to them, so why round them up? Certainly looks like they're put to work, and using basic tools too - and the work they're doing involves moving large quantities of rock, which is mining, right?\n\nHow is it possible that human beings with the mental capacity of prehistoric cave dwellers, can learn how to fly Harrier Jump Jets in less than a week? Then tell me how an alien species that can conquer the planet Earth in nine minutes, can't handle that same bunch of flying troglodytes in combat?\n\nWhy was most of the movie shot at a weird angle?\n\nA visiting Psychlo complains about Earth's gravity as being 'different'. Since we're to understand this race makes frequent visits to other planets, why haven't they gotten used to the concept that planets with a different mass will have a different gravitational force?\n\nDespite living on Earth for a thousand years, and actually capturing and feeding humans daily. Psyclos have no clue what humans like to eat.\n\nWhat bet did Forest Whitaker lose that resulted in his appearance in this film?\n\nDid anyone involved in the production of this horrible film actually read the source material? Because the book is actually very good.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is considered one of the worst movies ever made, and for good reason. Only cat killing levels of curiosity (or being a movie blogger :-) ) would compel someone to watch it. It's an illogical mess, and nothing at all like the book it's based on.\n\nBest Format:\n\nIf you are going to watch this, then a regular DVD or streaming show on any device you like will do.\n\nBest Element:\n\nJohn Travolta. Despite how bad this movie was, I have to respect John Travolta's obvious enthusiasm for this project. Even spending millions of his own money to help get it made. Maybe one day this story will get another chance on the big screen - because I'm telling you, if they had been more faithful to the book, Battlefied Earth could have been really special.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/battlefield-earth-2000/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Everything about it just feels wrong and disjointed, in every possible way. From the overuse AND unnecessary use of dutch angles to John Travolta's laughingly-bad performance to Barry Pepper's grunting and groaning - it's all terrible, but it's all entertaining in a so bad that it's good kind of way. It's no wonder that the crew from Rifftrax riffed on this one. It certainly deserves their kind of treatment. I'd say that I'd watch this again, if only for the entertainment value I get out of it, but I have to rate it accordingly. A lot of work went into making it, especially the sets and the costumes, but you can't deny how terrible the finished product is. This is a legendary stinker, of the highest caliber.",

A real embarrassment for all involved, it's  a travesty and a curiosity.  A Scientology love letter to L.

Oh boy how I have dreaded this day...FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's my review of Battlefield Earth... just kidding, but seriously though it is god awful. \r\nThis big-budget (Piece of shit/ clusterfuck) science fiction adventure centers on a final battle between good and evil for control of the world. In the year 3000, Earth is ruled by the Psyclos, a vicious alien race of which Terl (John Travolta) is a member, that has laid waste to the planet, killed the majority of the population, and stripped Earth of its valuable resources (And camera stands apparently. Seriously, every shot is at a goddamn angle). Pockets of resistance remain among the surviving humans; Jonnie \"Goodboy\" Tyler (Barry Pepper) is one such rebel, living in hiding in the mountains near Boulder, CO. Eventually, Johnny begins organizing like-minded humans for a final stand against the Psyclos (When he discovers their weakness which is the stupidest fucking twist ever in the history of sci-fi!). The film is based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction author also known as the founder of the Church of Scientology; it covers only the first half of the book, saving the remainder for a possible sequel (That better not happen or else I will riot.). Battlefield Earth also stars Forest (What the fuck am I doing here) Whitaker, Kim Coates, and Kelly Preston. ~( Mark Deming, Rovi)\r\nAs you can tell I am not exactly a fan of this bullshit, it makes me angry. Why, you ask. I'll tell you. The script is the biggest fucking mess I have ever witnessed. It contains horrible main characters, dialogue that is so bad it will make your ears bleed, and some of the worst villains in cinematic history. \r\nThe acting is worse than that featured in Troll 2. I am dead serious. No one here emerges unscathed, especially John Travolta who turns in the worst performance of his career. This is the type of acting that will be shown at film school with a big sign above it saying \"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T DO THIS\". The main character and his girlfriend... I don't want to see them in a film ever again. Exile them from Hollywood if you must. \r\nThis movie had a budget of 30 million dollars. Looking at the film, I'm going to call bullshit on that. I think it cost 1 million MAX! These are the worst special effects in cinematic history, they don't even fucking try with this. The explosions, the enviroments, the ship designs, all of it is god awful. It fascinates me that this got through post-production. \r\nNow you know I hate this movie. But the funny thing is the people involved in it actually defended it after it released. So here is what I'm gonna do. I will list what these people said in their defense, and I'm going to make them look like goddamn idiots. Okay? Here we go. \r\n \"When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, and a lot of people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it and thought it was a great piece of science fiction.\"- John Travolta That is highly unlikely. They probably did it for one of two reasons: 1.They didn't want to hurt your feelings or 2. They were drunk or high as hell. \r\n\"[The] critics were waiting for us to ... chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology for some reason. I didn't know people were so prejudiced.\" He argued that despite the film's poor performance it would cover its costs in due course: \"Maybe [in] the second cycle with Internet, and HBO, and DVD, you always make your money ... so I'm not going to lose sleep over one movie that did not perform for us.\"- Elie Samaha\r\nThis has been a hot topic lately, with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer saying the critics \"Conspired\" against the movie. That is not true. The critics didn't hate your movies cause they don't like its production history or because you guys are scientologist, that is simply untrue. She is just trying to expain away her pathetic failures, and doing a bad job at that. \r\nAnd the best part: They were originally going to make a trilogy out of this. I shit you not.Two sequels to the worst movie ever made ? Yeah... no. Don't believe me saying how bad this is, lets see what the critics had to say. \r\n\"With this kind of epic ineptitude -- hell, the flick is set in the year 3000 -- you go for \"worst of the millennium.\"\"-Peter Travers (Rolling Stone)\r\n\"One of the darkest, ugliest, most uninvolving and incomprehensible major-studio fantasies I've ever seen.\"-Jack Mathews (New York Daily News)\r\n\"Here is a picture that will be hailed without controversy as the worst of its kind ever made. It could be renamed Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes if that title didn't promise more cheesy fun than the movie actually delivers.\" -David Edelstein (Slate)\r\nSo yeah... stay far away from this movie. Please.",

            "content": "Okay. Here we go. Sometimes, there are movies that make you lose all faith in humanity. They are cinematic abortions, enormous bird shits on the windshield of film, the anus of everything good. They make you realize that human beings are capable of unspeakable acts of cruelty and stupidity. And this is very much the case with Battlefield Earth. Starring John Travolta as Terl of Psyclo (or WHATEVER THE FUCK, I'm not wasting more of my time to look it up), an alien being who has helped enslave all of mankind. They refer to humans as 'man-animals', which (for you fellow Trollfighters out there) is the name given to us by one of our greatest adversaries. \r\n\r\nWords cannot describe the experience one feels while viewing this 'movie'. It's an abomination. The film that should not have been. It may have usurped Tim and Eric's Billion-Dollar Movie and taken its rightful place as the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm going to try as hard as I can to give this enormous piece of elephant shit an honest and professional review without going fucking nuts over how bad it is. So, let's begin.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with this travesty is that it's just very, very boring. Even in the scenes that are supposed to be 'action-packed', 'intense', or even 'watchable', there is absolutely no sense of suspense or excitement while watching any scene of this enormous tumor upon cinema. For those of you who want to get an idea of it, I refer you to the Hose Scene video on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZujb23cwX0\r\n\r\nYou would think that someone who has, in the past, starred as Vince Vega in Pulp Fiction and Chili Palmer in Get Shorty would have a bit more acting clout than to participate in this cinematic pustule. But unfortunately, John Travolta's faith in Scientology clouded his judgement, and he took it upon himself to act in this movie based on Scientology's beliefs. This might be the biggest career blunder of all time-- Travolta hasn't gotten much work since when this tremendous pile of crap was made back in 2000. Nearly all his movies since then have gotten 'splats', except for animated features and documentaries in which he plays himself.\r\n\r\nBut now, I have to say this: To those of you who want to see Battlefield Earth just to say you've seen it, DON'T. Yesterday, I was just like you. I thought that watching this movie would be a fun exercise in laughing at bad movies. I was so, so wrong. It's not even entertaining for that. It has no value in this world whatsoever. Just go out and do something with your life. Final Score for Battlefield Earth: 0/10 stars. I only gave it 1 here because RT won't let you give a movie a zero rating. Just a horrible, horrible movie. Stay the fuck away.",

            "content": "Now this film wanted to be epic, it really tried, Travolta put millions of his own fortune into it and pushed people into helping him create it. These type of catastrophic alien invasion films were all the rage around this time after the success of 'Independence Day'. The films title alone sounds epic, a thundering statement...BATTLEFIELD EARTH!, it sounds like the ultimate sci-fi action film, so what's wrong with it?.\n\nFirst and foremost it looks like, and for all intense and purposes, is an extended 'Star Trek' episode. The plot is very dull and plays out like a dull episode of Star Trek, one involving lots of dialog about mining for minerals (gold, for what reason? I dunno), slave trading and general alien politics. The mistake made with the alien race (with the rather stupid name of 'Psychlos', is that the best Hubbard could come up with??) in this film is that they are dissected too much. We hear about all sorts of trivial background stuff that isn't required, in the end they just seem like large humans, there is no mystery.\n\nOn top of the really overly laboured plot is the simple fact that these aliens look crap. Putting aside the obvious 'Klingon' like appearance, they look like huge platform wearing transvestites with dreadlock-like hair in campy goth space suits. As if they belong in some fetish club or one of those freaky bizarre goth circus's.\n\nThen there's the simple question of why Travolta's face isn't the same as the rest of the alien race? why do all of them have devil/vampire-like faces but Travolta's is normal?. Is this because Travolta didn't wanna be hidden behind makeup?. Who's decision was it to let Travolta have/keep his little goatee? that kinda detracts from the whole alien design don't you think, a humanoid goatee. And who are these really old looking alien politicians with the flabby necks? is that what 'Psychlos' look like with age? why don't they look like the other 'Psychlos' facially?.\n\nOther minor issues spring to mind also such as the fact these guys don't feel pain, Travolta's arm gets blown off yet it doesn't really faze him. Whitaker seems to be the only black alien in the entire race. Then there's the amusing observation that most of the cast clearly can't walk too well in the stilts they are on, no running by these aliens hehe.\n\nThen we have the human element, or what's left of them. OK so humans are almost extinct and the 'Psychlos' have been ruling them for 1000 years apparently. So why has humankind completely forgotten everything about their past? the ability to use their brains, know what basic objects like glass or weapons are, names of places etc...they have forgotten everything which makes no sense. Mankind has been enslaved by aliens but why have they gone backwards to primitive cavemen? they don't know what a city is or what stars in the sky are, they worships Gods like ancient humans once did and they all scream and yelp like monkeys. But they still wear trousers.\n\nThe plot totally loses it once the rebellion begins, the last humans led by Pepper conveniently find apparent secret military bases still stocked to the gills with weapons, Harrier jets and power it seems. Little bit of training and many of them are now proficient in guns and even better...can fly Harrier Jump jets no probs!! just like that. So much so that they are able to engage alien ships in a fancy ass dogfight.\n\nThere really are so many plot holes and question marks I can't possibly mention them all or remember them all!. I do recall the effects being somewhat bigged up at the time, they were suppose to be pretty neat for the day. I guess they aren't too bad to be honest, some shots look nice, mainly ruined cityscape's, the alien ships are a reasonable design as is some of the ship flight sequences. Sets are pretty bland and uninspired, just faceless metallic facilities whilst the whole film has this quite ugly blue/grey/green tint/hue to it which is unusual.\n\nSo for a film called 'battlefield earth' there actually isn't that much in the realms of mega earthbound conflicts going on, its all based in one location. On a certain silly level the film can be enjoyable with its action sequences, it totally jumps on the 'Independence Day' bandwagon that's for sure, but it can still be minor fun.\n\nHad this been a few half hour episodes of a TV sci-fi series then it could be looked on more favourably. I mean the film really isn't much better than a TV show, but I must admit to liking Travolta's wickedly evil campy performance. That and the 'Psychlos' females that we get a glimpse of, a kind of fetish wearing gothic 'Cenobite' with very very long tongues, film highlight for me.",

Well, it's not that bad.\n\nIt's a basic sci-fi flick about a species known as the Psychlons who are in constant battle of oneupmanship as part of their culture. Of course, a society run on knives in the back is going to have issues.\n\nYet, somehow, the Psychlons invaded Earth and defeated all of Earth's army in 9 minutes, scattering human kind and using the remnants as slaves. Well, enter our hero, who learns, well, everything there is to know from a \"learning machine\" and then teaches the rest of humanity to fight back. \n\nOh by the way, this works, despite being able to beat all the armies in the world in 9 minutes, and by blowing up the Psychlon base in Denver, they apparently beat all the Psychlons in the world. Really?! Even Empire 101 would teach you to have more than one central location.....\n\nSo, yeah, that's pretty much what your looking at. Goofy plot, okay acting. Not a good movie, but I've seen way worse.",

            "content": "Considered one of the worst movies ever made and based on the laughably mediocre novel of the same name, Battlefield Earth sounded like a masterpiece of terrible filmmaking.\n\nAs with any adaptation, Battlefield Earth takes man liberties with its source material. Battlefield Earth only adapts the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's 1050 page novel. On the surface that sounds like a perfectly reasonable idea as that is the better part of the story. I enjoyed the first third of the novel because of how it characterized the relationship between Jonnie Goodboy Tyler and Terl, even if the writing style was very juvenile. Unfortunately, the few plot points and general concepts that I enjoyed from the original are abandoned in the process of adaptation.\nThe first scene to really focus on is the first violent encounter between Jonne Goodboy Tyler and Terl. As much as I found that L. Ron Hubbard could not write good action scenes at all, I felt that the scene where Jonnie Goodbye Tyler faces off with Terl for the first time was one of the better plot points. It was described as a largely western showdown, a battle between advanced weaponry and a kill club. After facing the adaptation process of Corey Mandell and J.D. Shapiro, the entire scene is changed. It ends up sacrificing any sense of competence for an abundance of slow motion sequences plagued by an excess of green filtering in which Jonnie runs through a derelict shopping center with no sounds to be heard and poorly rendered stun lasers being shot at him. He collapses, and then audiences have to bear witness to Roger Christian's idea of the species known as Psychlos.\nThough a species of aliens named clearly for L. Ron Hubbard to have an excuse to reference psychology as evil in his eyes do not have a high standard of intrinsic character value, the film adaptation manages to mess up everything in attempting to characterize them. For one thing, The Psychlos speak English way too much in the film when their own language was what separated them from the \"man animals\" who they viewed as their inferior. Unfortunately, it just adds to the artificiality of Battlefield Earth as the Psychlos are already too obviously human beings in costumes which dream of reaching the standard of half-assed. The exact quote that characterizes the design of the Psychlos is as follows: \"Either or nine feet tall, maybe more. About three and a half feet wide. Two arms. Two legs.\" These basic elements are captured by the actors, but the elements requiring prosthetic effects is the \"Shiny substance fort a face and a long tube from the chin down to the chest. Glowing amber eyes behind the shiny front plate.\" are completely ignored. The \"Furry paws and long talons\" are some of the most iconic beast aspects of the species, but they are overly simplistic in design. Lastly, it is said that their \"Huge booted feet dented the earth\" and are guessed to weigh \"a thousand pounds\" in an attempt to make them seem threatening. Yet the creatures do not look intimidating at all and fail to fit the description of L. Ron Hubbard's source novel at all. As it is, antagonist Terl looks like the result of John Romero having an allergic reaction to a bee sting and walking around in a state of life support. Their appearance is dreadful, and the female Psychlos look even worse, although they only appear briefly in the film. Still, it remains notable enough for its incompetence.\nOddly enough, the ridiculous design for the Psychlos is not the worst visual aspect of Battlefield Earth. In actual fact, that is the cinematography. If you don't know what a dutch angle is, a few minutes of any scene in Battlefield Earth will have you knowing.\nThe dutch tilt is a technique used to create a sense of uneasiness in the more dramatic moments of any film. Apparently, that is every second in Battlefield Earth as there is more dutch angles than terrible acting which is a pretty large call. There is no sense in taking the story the slightest bit seriously because everything is too dutch for its own good. And at the end of the long scenes are the same basic transition every time. Every. Time. It's the same basic horizontal wipe which goes from the center of the screen in both directions at once, the kind of cheap editing technique used by fifth grade students discovering Windows Movie Maker for the first time. For a commercial film to use it so much without even a second guess is just purely ridiculous, but after sitting through so much slow motion, dutch angles and poor lighting.\nThough the incompetent story and terrible technical elements are separate issues, they merge into the narrative that is Battlefield Earth and end up creating countless scenes which are far beyond ridiculous. The best scene in the film comes from when Terl is told by Zete that his period of time on earth will be extended by another \"fifty cycles\". The line \"With endless options for renewal\" echoes multiple times while the strange creatures laugh in a haze of slow motion and excess of blue filtering. This scene is hilariously terrible, reminding me heavily of the famous scene from the episode of The Simpsons \"Last Exit to Springfield\" in which the words \"Dental Plan\" and \"Lisa Needs Braces\" echo in Homer Simpson's head repeatedly as he tries to grasp his train of thought before it derails. Because of that, the scene is the epitome of all the unintentional humour in the film where the scale is limited solely to the discussion between characters where the incompetent attempt at \"spectacle\" cannot serve as any kind of distraction.\nThe pacing of the story is poor. It's clear that there is a lot of narrative ground to cover in the film and that a commercial film adaptation of such ridiculous source material would ignore many extensive periods of dialogue, melodramatic subplots and plot points that expands upon the technological nature of the universe in favour of a progressing narrative. Unfortunately, the film just speeds right past the idea of characterization with a painful bluntness. The characters weren't that deep, but the relationship between Jonnie Goodboy Tyler and Terl is what interested me about the novel. Unfortunately, that is completely forgotten about as are many other story elements. The novel explains that humans are needed to mine Earth's gold as machinery is too difficult to maintain and the compound that Psychlos breath known as \"breathe-gas\" is explosive if it comes into contact with uranium which is said to plagued the mountains. In the film, there is no mention of this. Considering that the presence of uranium as a key asset to the leverage humans hold over psychlos with leverage being a word used repeatedly in the film to follow on with the novel. That just goes to show that the film knows the word is relevant to the story, but it just doesn't know why. And at the same time, it doesn't know why the original novel was titled \"Battlefield Earth\".\nEven though the film takes the title of Battlefield Earth, the global intergalactic war with Psychlo is never touched upon. The large scale action scenes described poorly in the novel which could have been much better as part of a bigger cinematic spectacle are completely omitted from the film adaptation, not only is that unfaithful, but it renders the title of the text misleading. Essentially, Battlefield Earth is not only an incompetent and misguided film, but it is a large betrayal to its sub-par source material and therefore lowers the already esoteric audience likely to enjoy the film to be only the least demanding fans of L. Ron Hubbard's works.\nStill, the film is a brilliant comedy.\nThere is hilarious irony in the production as the message in the film is that education is the greatest foe of any oppressor, yet it is only the truly educated people who can clearly see L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology legacy is little more than a threatening farce. The film almost goes against what Scientology is built on, only retaining the concepts of a ridiculous story and absolute idiocy to appeal to the cult. Yet the funniest irony in the film is that Battlefield Earth has a plot point regarding Terl discovering Zete has been defrauding his company so he can embezzle funds, while Franchise Pictures was sued for defrauding its investors through overstating the production budget of Battlefield Earth. Considering that the film looks so freaking cheap, it is difficult to believe that it actually cost the proclaimed $73 million. That one criminal act proves that the film is pure evil in every way, a more convincing evil than John Travolta's attempt to characterize antagonist Terl through one of his most enjoyable performances to date.\nJohn Travolta's performance is quite remarkable. I mean, it is so pathetically unconvincing that it is genuinely hilarious. Decked out in a ridiculous costume, John Travolta looks and acts like he is on a poorly lit episode of H.R. Pufnstuf. His campy acting and inability to stop smiling reinforces the idea that he thinks he is in a comedy, and his emotionless attempts to be intimidating are some of the most pathetically hilarious scenes of his career. And yet, when he pretends to be angry it is even funnier. Watching him aggressively trying to stuff a rat in the mouth of Barry Pepper and shouting \"Do you want lunch?!?\" is now an image of him which I will never forget and one of my favourite moments in the film. Clearly surrounded by endless weak material, John Travolta embraces his fate and actively transcends the film by going beyond the standard of bad depicted by the other cast members. While the other actors deliver uninvolved performances, John Travolta is deluded into thinking that he can honestly make something good out of the role by putting a tenacious effort into it. His dedication is too much for a character that is so misguided and ridiculous, and so his repetitive line delivery and blank facial expressions prove hilarious. John Travolta's terrible performance is the greatest and most entertaining asset to Battlefield Earth because it is so ridiculous and far from the character described in the source material that it proves the film was worthy of an adaptation just to bring out the worst in him. Of all the actors to ever win the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor, John Travolta is one of the most deserving as his effort truly deserves plenty of recognition. He doesn't save the film, he makes it worse in the best possible way.\nBerry Pepper is an actor I have long admired for his strong supporting performances in films such as Saving Private Ryan or The Green Mile. I can still admire those efforts after seeing Battlefield Earth, but I must confront the notion that he is no leading man. When Barry Pepper runs, he could not thrust his arms any more than he physically does. He looks like an extra from Highlander but moves like Charlie Chaplin having an epileptic fit. So on a physical level, he is a hilarious presence. But when it comes down to actually being involved in the character, Barry Pepper cannot do any transcending. In the source novel, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler was a thinly scripted and generic protagonist with a mild sense of patriotism for fighting for humanity, so in that sense Barry Pepper delivers what is written. Unfortunately, he is given the appearance of more of a mystical fantasy film hero than the bearded muscular man characterized in the original text. The man doesn't look right for the part so he is miscast, and his uninvolved performance doesn't damage his credibility so much as it just serves as a reminder for how poor the characterization in the film is. Barry Pepper does not shine this time around.\nEven Forest Whitaker managed to weasel his way into the cast somehow. Forest Whitaker went on to win an Academy Award for Best Actor six years after Battlefield Earth, so it is good that he got a sense of mediocre acting out of him early on. Although he did just appear in the dreadful Taken 3, the man has talent. Battlefield Earth fails to anything with it though. Seemingly just following the crowd, Forest Whitaker delivers a monotonous performance as he forces all the terrible dialogue through the veil of his ridiculous costume. However, he is one of the legitimately better members of the cast. He has noting to boast about, but the standard of acting around him is below what he delivers. Though his character Ker is meant to be a \"midget Psychlo\", this factor does not carry over into the film. But Forest Whitaker manages to move the character in line with the monotonous and uninvolved characters of the same species all around him by remaining singular with his tone of voice. But unlike John Travolta or Michael MacRae, Forest Whitaker's tone of voice is naturally a very deep one which makes his line delivery come off as slightly more organic. As a result, the dark Psychlo nature of the character us slightly more believable. I can't see Forest Whitaker's wanting to put this film on his resume any time soon, but it is clear that he has more credibility as Ker than any cast member in the film.\nAnd I don't know what direction Kelly Preston was going in with her brief and somewhat disturbing cameo, but the ideal direction for her would be anywhere else. Preferably away from the screen.\nIt's also a shame that Richard Tyson was a wasted presence because I just saw him in Three O'Clock High recently and enjoyed his effort.\n\nSo Battlefield Earth is a double entendre of terrible filmmaking as it disregards anything slightly positive from its sub-par source material while maintaining the incompetence of L. Ron Hubbard's writing style, matching it with the same standard of craft in Roger Christian's directorial work with a shoddily constructed narrative plagued by poor acting, weak scripting and an excess of poorly lit filtering, rough slow motion and inexplicable Dutch angles. But the fact that such a level of incongruence exists in a Hollywood film alongside a hilariously awful performance from John Travolta ensures that there is plenty of room for the film to exist as a guilty pleasure on midnight film circuits.",

Yes, the acting is atrocious (one wishes that John Travolta and Forest Whitaker would stop laughing so much), the camera angles are extremely annoying, music is ridiculously overused, and the dialogue is tedious at times. But, really, this isn't the sort of film you'd walk out of, with enough special effects (quite impressive) to tolerate surrounding flaws. With some it's-so-bad-it's-good qualities, 'Battlefield Earth' isn't really the complete and utter turkey you've been lead to believe, but it's not the sort of standard of cinema you'd want to come across all too often.",

I knew nothing about the movie so I rented it and here's what I have to say: ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! How was this movie allowed to be made? Who thought this would work? What parts of the movie make sense? The plot is simple and stupid; it's in the year 3000 and a weird race or something called the \"Psyclos\" are ruling the Earth and this group of humans has to stop them. The leader of the psyclos is named Terl and he's played by John Travolta. Why would you cast him? His only good role was in Pulp Fiction. His performance in this shows why he'll never be taken seriously as an actor ever again. His line reading is hammy and he's the definition of over-the-top. Another actor is Barry Pepper and he's mostly known for his role as the sniper in Saving Private Ryan. If only he could've brought that role on the set of Battlefield Earth and sniped the director. A really odd thing about the movie are the weird camera angles. All the angles are tilted so that whatever is on screen is close to being exactly diagonal. It's mind-numbing and it gets old really quick. The special effects are awful. They made me feel like I was watching a campy, public domain action movie.The editing also doesn't help for the \"action\" scenes. It's just all over the place. One example is when (Spoiler alert, though I'm pretty sure you've lost you're ability to give a shit with this movie.) Terl gets his arm blown off. The guy blasts it, his arm is on screen for barely a second and that's it. I didn't even know what had happened until I saw Terl with a missing arm in the end scene. Oh and the \"clever\" irony of the last scene involving a bunch of gold is enough to make anyone groan or make a sarcastic remark. (You don't say?!) Avoid this movie by all means. It's an hour and forty-five minutes that will just drag on and on. The worst part is you probably won't be able to get it back.",

Is this movie bad beyond recognition? A resounding \"yes\" would answer that. Is it the worst movie ever made? Not quite, but close. That title would go to Jaws 4.\r\n\r\nThe movie takes place in the year 3000. For a thousand years, Earth has been ruled by an alien race known as Psychlos. The humans are enslaved and forced to work for them. Any that weren't lived in isolated areas beyond their control. One such human, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), leaves his village. However, he gets captured. Terl (John Travolta), the alien leader of those on the Earth, is forced to stay forever on Earth because of a certain crime he committed in the past. But he soon comes up with a plan to have the people mine gold in order to buy his way off the planet. Jonnie discovers more about the Psychlos and must lead humanity in a battle to take back their freedom.\r\n\r\nThis isn't one of these \"it's so bad, it's good\" movies. This is one of these movies that is bad beyond bad. There are no interesting characters. The special effects are bad and the action lacks excitement. The plot is also so bland that it makes The Phantom Menace look like The Empire Strikes Back.\r\n\r\nThe acting is just as bad. John Travolta is the worst of the lot. His character was whiny and doesn't even act like a bad guy. The rest of the cast is just as lifeless.\r\n\r\nThere are only two possible reasons to even consider watching this movie at all. 1.)To see if it's as bad as people says it is (which is the category I fall into) or 2.)if you're one of the few who actually like this movie.\r\n\r\nAlthough not the worst movie I've seen, it's certainly the worst sci-fi movie.",

            "content": "When I was twelve, I remember walking into my local video store where I went to rent movies all of the time.  I saw a poster for Battlefield Earth displayed and I thought that it looked good.  I don't remember if this was before, or after I went to the theaters to see Star Wars Episode II, but I digress.  Nonetheless, this film caught my interest.  I remember my dad came home one day with the movie and I watched it and it was a slap in the face.\n\nThe plot takes place in the year 3000.  The primitive mankind has been enslaved by an alien race from the planet Psychlo.  The Earth has been drained of almost all of its natural resources and mankind is forced into hiding.  Amongst the humans is a man named Johnny Goodboy Tyler (played by Berry Pepper) who gets captured while touring the ruins with two men from a different colony who show him various statues that they confuse for gods.  While he is captured, he discovers who these ''demons'' (the humans in the colonies call them such due to their ignorance) are.  One of which, named Terl (played by John Travolta) is the chief head of security who is accompanied by Ker (played by Forest Whitaker).  In response to his authorities putting him back on Earth, the planet he despises, he and Kerr begin to privately train the humans to harvest gold so they can keep it for themselves.  As they learn more about one another, Johnny starts to organize the surviving colonies into a resistance faction to overthrow the Psychlos and liberate Earth.\n\nThis movie is based on a book written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1982.  L. Ron Hubbard is infamous for founding the Church of Scientology, but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Scientology.  There is so much wrong with this disaster of a sci-fi movie, I don't know where to begin.  We'll begin with the structuring.\n\nThis movie's plot covers the first 436 pages of the book's 1050 page length, but the adaptation is very dreadful.  The first couple of seconds into the film begins with a overhead view of the humans going inside their place of sanctuary.  We finally see Johnny return from lord knows where with a cure for his father only to find out he's dead.  Johnny then begins to mourn.  Why am I bringing this up?  Because unlike the book, we don't get any exposure, nor backstory to that character whatsoever.  Granted, there have been films that have started out that way.  Two of which being Fantastic Planet (Terr's mother getting killed by the playing Tragg) and Dragonball Z: The History of Trunks (Gohan returning with a cure, only to find out that his dad, Goku has passed away), but in this film it's executed miserably.  It's paced at the last minute, it's rushed, and comes totally unexpected.\n\nOh, wait.  There's more.  Another thing one will notice with only a few minutes exposure is that almost every shot is slanted.  I don't know whose bright idea that was, but I can safely say that it's stupid.  There's no plot device to hold this dynamic in place and it never contributes to anything in the long run.  When I first saw this movie, I remember that it was very hard to tell what was going on in the images because of this fact.  There were also times where I had to tilt my head at the corresponding angle just to watch the film.  I can safely say that there's no excuse whatsoever for this.  This is only one of the things this film is notorious for. \n\nAnother thing that brings this film down are the special effects.  The special effects look very drab, dark, and generic.  Most of them look like images one would expect off of an Atari game.  The sound effects to these same images sound like someone took each and every sound effect from tons of video games and compressed them wrong.  The music doesn't fare much better.  Roger Ebert perfectly summed up in his review that the music sounds like someone threw an activated microphone into a trash can and rambunctiously tossed it to and fro.\n\nThe designs of the aliens are another noteworthy thing.  In the book, the Psychlos were described as humaniod felines that stood at ten feet.  In this movie they all wear KISS boots and Bob Marley wigs.  Their air masks are reduced to oxygen tubes that hang from their noses like snot from someone who has a really bad cold.  Their fangs are replaced with rotten, yellow teeth that could use some serious dental care.  Their talons are also nothing but three-fingered hands that have infected nails that could use some serous trimming.  I know that aliens (mostly evil ones) are supposed to be ugly, but with this movie's theme being about understanding one another and being liberated it all feels so needless.  The story just isn't dramatic and the tension is totally absent.  This fact alone makes it jarring.\n\nAnother thing noteworthy is the idiocy of this film's plot.  Examples being: Terl is a leader of a conquering race.  This race has enslaved humanity for many years and they don't know anything about humans.  What we eat, how we live, nor our language.  When Johnny holds Terl at gunpoint and stops the accompanying humans from killing him, he gives Terl back his gun after giving a motivational speech to the humans and doesn't kill him.  As Terl teaches the humans how to use their war technology and leaves for the day, I'm not lying this is true, he watches the humans by having a small camera fly over every couple of hours and take a still picture.  The humans destroy the planet Psychlo with a single nuclear bomb and this happens because the atmosphere is radioactive. \n\nTerl is just a complete buffoon in this movie who does nothing but call Johnny rat-brain (like he does in the book, but in the book he's smarter), gets drunk off of kerbango, gawks with Chirk-his secretary played by Kelly Preston, and scowls at everybody he talks to.  As with all of the other Psychlos.  Some of y'all might be wondering whether I've read the book.  And the answer is: yes I have.  Terl did all of these things that I've just mentioned, but the way the movie ''simplifies\" them is remarkably dumb.  Johnny was the only human present with the Psychlos.  Terl captures him by himself and begins to study him first thing.  Terl didn't get knocked down by a human while showing off his marksmanship skills, he got attacked by a bear and Johnny saved him with Terl's own gun.  The cameras that monitored the miners were always on, but moved in specific patterns that became known and evaded by the human miners.  During his imprisonment, Johnny develops a friendship with Ker- the midget Psychlo who accompanied Terl, but never was involved in Terl's plot to plunder the gold for himself.  Terl never lost his arm.  Lastly, the planet was not destroyed in the middle of the book, it was near the end.  The planet was not destroyed by one nuclear bomb, it was destroyed by a multitude of them that reached its core and turned it into a radioactive sun.\n\nOverall, Battlefield Earth is a disaster of a film from start to finish.  While it does retain some of the character traits that were presented in the book, the way it executes them is just miserable.  I give this movie 1 star because the dialogue is halfway decent and does contain some memorable lines here and there.  The cast of actors in this film are great, but not here in this movie.  If you want great alien films, check out Predator, Alien, Aliens, Predators, Starship Troopers, and Avatar.  Otherwise, either read the book this film is based on, which is a good read.

I truly believe that there are only about 50 or 60 people who even found this one tolerable. It may very well be one of the 10 worst movies of all time.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is pretty much the worst script I've ever heard. Seriously, ever. Even the memorable quotes were lame. It was like a 3rd grader was writing the script for a fantasy sci-fi movie he was writing for his buddies.\r\n\r\nAlso, the movie is infamous for it's bad acting. And the pinnacle of all that bad acting has got to be Barry Pepper as Jonnie Tyler, leader of the human resistance. When he is not viciously overacting he is underacting, and his character comes across as INCREDIBLY annoying. John Travolta wasn't very good either, but he did a better job than most of the other cast.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lighting is horrible. It's dark when it's supposed to be light and light when it's supposed to be dark. It's all one giant mess. I felt like I was watching a home movie made by two Star Trek nerds.\r\n\r\nThe sound was really messed up too. You remember how revolutionary the sound affects in Star Wars were? That would be the opposite of \"Battlefield Earth\". There are plenty of awkward silent sequences and even more awkward laser sounds.\r\n\r\nYou know, there are some movies that make me want to yell at every one who can possibly enjoy them. This is one of them. Awful. Truly, truly awful. One of the worst films of all time awful.",

I've watched this film multiple times over the years, even inflicting it on friends and family who are willing enough to sit through it. The plot holes are big enough to create another ring around Saturn (How are jet fighters still flyable after 1,000 years? How can cavemen learn to fly said jet fighters in like, two weeks?), the acting is legendarily bad (John Travolta as Terl is the equivalent of an overwrought, badly directed Shakespearean role), the special effects are awful/fascinating in a fever dream kind of way, it shamelessly rips off other sci-fi films and franchises (Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner, etc), and every moment of watching it is awe-inspiring in its ineptitude. Then again, should I expect differently from a film John Travolta pitched as, \"It's Star Wars meets Pulp Fiction, but better\" and the fact that the novel it's based on was written by the founder of Scientology? It's a glorious, legendary, hilariously awful mess of a film that will be forever mocked. And because of all these facts, I will treasure this film, enjoy it, and watch it many more times over the years. Unless you have a strong stomach for garbage, I don't recommend it.

The movie was one of those 'so bad it is funny' ones but even the pathetic and unintentional comedy couldn't keep my attention very well. I did laugh hard that every time the aliens got upset they said 'crap' or in John Travolta's case 'crap lousy'. As the plot moved forward it also moved into water too deep to rescue it. Basically the aliens defeated all of modern earth in 9 minutes so the humans that are not captured are pretty much cave men technologically. One guy gets I guess all the information ever just shot into his eyes so he knows basically everything the aliens do and hatches the most outlandish plan ever. Since modern earth didn't have a chance he somehow gets the idea his cavemen buddies can help him not only get the aliens off his planet but also destroy the entire planet the aliens come from. No big deal, just throw some nukes through a teleporter to blow up the alien world (actually the most plausible part of the idea) and also launch an assault on the earth base by getting a simulator to train the cavemen to pilot Harrier jets into combat. Oh and this all must be prepared within one week. Did I mention all the explosives they want to lay around the base that somehow won't be immediately detected by cameras or security guards?\nThis film is grade A garbage. If Sci Fi channel were ever to get a budget big enough to put one of it's originals onto the big screen, this is what would happen. To use Travolta's phrase, this movie was 'crap lousy'.",

Eventually, Johnny begins organizing like-minded humans for a final stand against the Psyclos. The film is based on the novel by L.

            "content": "I have a select few movies that I choose to give zero stars, and Battlefield Earth is not one of them. Barely. The reason I give this movie half a star is because of my curiosity. About 20 minutes in I was amazed at how bad it was, so my curiosity wanted to see just how repulsive this movie could get. That is the only front that Battlefield Earth succeeded on. It's incredible how misguided Battlefield Earth is from pointless camera shots, to terrible cinematography, an awful script, wooden acting and...well you get the point. I have seen how good movies can get, and now I know how bad it can get. Battlefield Earth puts everything horrendous that can happen in cinema and not only uses it, but puts it on a pedestal.\r\n\r\nWhere to begin? How about the wasted talent at hand. John Travolta has some serious talent. The sad thing is he was a big follower of scientology and encouraged this film to be made. Unfortunately, the book this is based off of by L. Ron Hubbard, got universal backlash. The film followed suit, minimizing all of the actors on screen to grunts and pointless dialogue. Forrest Whitaker (an Oscar winner!) is really put to shame here as a mere underling. Sometimes he's smart, sometimes he's stupid, its an inconsistent an poorly conceived sidekick to Terl. Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler (wow what a name) is the only person who even attempts some sort of intelligence in this waste heap. But Pepper, who gave the performance of his career in The 25th Hour, is forced to do nothing but yell, scream and say cliched lines. Hilariously, the actors are probably the most insignificant problem in this film, but they are still a big problem.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here has to be director Roger Christian who ironically, to quote Roger Ebert, has made \"an unholy mess\". This has to be the most pretentious and grim direction I've seen in a film. Instead of focusing on the plot, which is completely incoherent, I was focusing on how many dutch angles we're in this film. I looked it up and apparently virtually all but a few frames of the film are in dutch angles. Why is the camera slanted? It has no purpose at all! And why when there is sun out does it look like someone urinated on the film strip? Can't we get a lighting technician somewhere? I'm ranting but this is a film that deserves to be ranted about because it is so easy to do so. Any aspect you can think of, this film does not do it well, or at all. \r\n\r\nAmazingly, Roger Christian came recommended from none other that George Lucas. See, Lucas isn't that amazing a director, he just happened to conceive the most famous science fiction saga in cinema. Roger Christian was the second unit director on The Phantom Menace, so of course Lucas would recommend him. He was a second unit director for a reason. Christian's vision of the year 3000 is so cheap looking, so dull and completely lifeless, and it reflects in the film. There is just no characters to root for, no luscious or interactive sets, or any intelligent ideas. It's a big wad of lifelessness that just sits there.\r\n\r\nI'm amazed that I even stayed awake for this. I was just staring at my laptop as meaningless images seemed to roll over it. I barely understood the plot, and nothing made any sense. I was convinced that this story was butchered. Somewhere on the cutting room floor, and inside the CGI editors room, there is a movie. Even though the acting is horrendous, this world could have looked beautiful. But it doesn't. It's a world I never want to visit again.\r\n\r\nEverything here just hits a dead end. No one can go anywhere without contrivances popping in left and right, the plot is silly, slow and stupid. The special effects are incredibly lame, remember this came out a year after The Matrix broke new ground with their conception of \"bullet time\". I had no time for this film, but it just kept topping itself with atrocity after contrivance after dullness after terrible witty remark. \r\n\r\nCan I emphasize anymore that nothing works? I guess giving this film a bad review is going with the crowd, but this crowd is the size of the critical and financial failure this film was: massive. Hey, maybe people will seek out this film because of all the negativity surrounding it. To those who do, I will forever be in envy of your perseverance and endurance. Battlefield Earth is awful, plain and simple.",

For some reason the main alien guy played by an awful Travolta, wants Johnny, even though their are thousands of humans around.

I mean... really! \r\n3 mins into the movie it had one somewhat normal scene of snowy mts. And then the 45 degree angle shots came into beign, and then the headaches began to occur.

Sure it plays like a cheap live action cartoon, but that turned out to be one of the reasons to why I liked it so much. From the cheap costumes, to the very laughable dialogue, I could see why not too many people liked this. It was apparently Travolta's idea to have this story of scientology adapted to the big screen, and having himself portray the lead bad guy. He wanted this to be the \"Star Wars\" of this generation, and while watching the film, you could tell that. You can take a film like \"Grease\" more serious than this. I guess there was going to be a sequal, but it was never made do to bad reviews, and very poor box office performance.

The plot's confusing, the camera angles are weird, the wipe transitions are bound to drive you crazy, and there's enough ham in the acting for a family dinner on Easter. But it's still fun to watch at times. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have some humorous scenes together. You can also tell the filmmakers were really trying with this movie.

At the time I thought, ?Travolta is in it, so it shouldn?t be bad?I?ll watch.? If only I had known better. But I feel I was taken advantage of, as were so many. Travolta?s bad acting in this movie nowhere near made up for this crap sandwich. I also didn?t know about the connection to Scientology when I watched it. Now that I do, I feel so sad for those poor misguided people, following a ?religion? that could contribute to the making of a movie this spectacularly horrendous. A movie with bad acting on a new low level, huge plot holes, and completely unbelievable scenarios throughout. But it?s good to know that if I?m ever in a post-apocalyptic world all I have to do is go to Fort Hood and I?ll find 1,000-year-old jet planes will be intact, with perfectly usable fuel, and that even though I?ve never even flown a plane before in my life I?ll be able to pick that up with ease. Maybe Travolta will teach me, he?s a pilot. Seriously though, I was stationed at Fort Hood, they don?t have those kinds of planes there. And the fuel would not have lasted 1,000 years. And do I have to say it?there?s no way people with absolutely no flight training could have flown those planes as shown in the movie.

            "content": "Painful, derivative, and lame.  This movie aggressively resists any attempt made by viewers to enjoy it.  Travolta may have made this movie in order to share the \"storytelling genius\" of his guru Hubbard, but all he succeeded in doing was to give people another reason to avoid anything bearing Hubbard's name.  \n\nBattlefield Earth is a tortured piece of cinematic garbage that attempts to sell the viewer on a number of points - thematic and intellectual.  First, Alien Races are Bad.  This more or less jives with the mythology of Hubbard's \"Religion\" of Scientology, in which an all-powerful alien overlord committed an act of genocide (in space) that resulted in millions of alien 'souls' to become trapped in the bodies of primitive humans after being exiled to Earth.  Just watch the South Park Scientology episode.  The aliens of Travolta's film are evil, greedy, conniving, backstabbing monsters who spend a great deal of time waxing eloquent about their supposedly superior culture, which appears to be nothing more than a strange, propagandist mutation of capitalism.  The dread-locked and nose-ringed aliens are blessed with few - if any - redeeming features, which makes their ultimate doom devoid of any meaning.\n\nA second point:  Humans are basically savages without anyone to lead them.  Our 'hero' in this film is a human slave who, thanks to the machinations of one of the aliens (played tragically, by Forest Whitaker), gains the ability to use language.  That's right; humans in this movie, although attractive and clearly able to use machinery, speak in grunts and snarls.  At any rate, the human, thanks to the unthinking hubris of his captors, gains almost unfettered access to a 'learning machine', which is capable of teaching anyone who sits in it how to do everything from shoot an alien weapon, to pilot both alien vehicles and, confusingly, human fighter jets (which have sat, fueled, armed, and shielded from the elements and alien invasions for hundreds - or thousands - of years).  Thanks to this miracle machine, our hero and his band of scantily clad compatriots devise a plan to rid their world of the monsters (who are here for our gold.  Seriously.), and allow humans to once again rule Earth.\n\nThe acting is awful; the script, even worse.  If one had never seen either Travolta or Whitaker act before, one could be forgiven for thinking that they simply couldn't, or shouldn't ever again.  The effects are good for their time, and the costuming showed an attention to detail that was sorely lacking in the rest of the film.  If someone were to ask me if this movie was a good candidate for an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, I'd say no; it's too bad - even by their standards.",

Im sorry just because you wanted to get layed by a scientology chick IT still dosen't not mean you should script something this bad ,ok its not that bad tust me ive seen films that are miles worse like MANOS:THE HANDS OF FATE and the true worst movie ever made MONSTER A GO-GO but still this film is just a few points above these two films. \r\n\r\nSo were to begin , i just keep it short bad , bad , bad writing with a dozen things that contradict every single estabished plot point film like mankind in the year 2000 only put up a nine minute fight aginst the psyclos but 1000 years later primitve humans can fly Harrier jump jets, use guns, arm nuclear bombs and sucessfuly deafet the alien invaders ...... WHAT THE FUCK WERE THE SCREEN WRITERS THINKING !!!! oh wait one wanted to get a blow job from some scientology woman so wirte some shit and get some lovin in return. God, anyway bad split bar wipes , piss poor direction ,each frame of the film on a tilt  that begs the question was the camrea man on something while filming and travolta's werid acting as Terl who says \"every WORD in EACH senatce WITH a RASE in TONE with EVERY second WORD\" is both funny and anoying.\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Now I have heard some refering to this as the 'WORST SCI-FI FILM EVER\" in my view there are films in the genre that are worst than this ;LASERBLAST anyone? Im just applaled that something this pathetic was made for the sake of sexual intercourse with some fucken sicentology woman. At least the brilliant minds of THE GOLDEN RASBERRY AWRADS gave this so many RAZZIES  it actually won the same amount of RAZZIES as SHOWGRILS did. Infact at the Razzie award cermony in 2001 they constaly reffered to this film as 'PLAN 9 FROM L.RON HUBBARD' or in my view Plan 9 from the church of scientology.  overall rating 20%",

I'm not going to be the laughing stock any more.\" -- Elie Samaha\n\nI was reading up about this movie and I found this FANTABULOUS quote that, in hindsight, I'm sure Elie Samaha wished he would never have made.  Now I'm not about to say that Elie is a laughing stock for making that statement.  I'm just saying, he's an idiot that he thought the movie he was producing was going to be successful.  If you take into consideration that almost everyone who has seen this movie has said that it's one of the worst movies ever made, then in a way that is succeeding.  You've succeeded in making one shitty, horrid, abysmal, atrocious, ugly movie.  Of course, I'm sure that wasn't exactly Elie's goal (or the two other producers of the movie) wanted to achieve, but hey...what the fuck can you do???  Holy christ fuck, this is really one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've ever seen.  Now you may ask yourself why I watched this movie if I knew of its reputation.  The answer is simple.  We acquired Starz (and Encore) On Demand for one month last week.  Basically, the deal is, you can watch any movie that they provide without actually having to pay for it like a normal On Demand service.  You pay a monthly fee to watch as many movies as you want, for as many times as you want during the month.  After watching Hot Shots,  I decided to use the computer while I browsed through the Encore On Demand channel.  I came across Battlefield Earth and I clicked on it, thinking that I was only gonna watch a minute or two of it and then not bother.  The only reason I stuck with it was because I wanted to find out if it was really as bad as everyone says it is.  So that's the only reason I watched it.  And in reality I didn't even pay for it, because with all of the movies I wanna watch, Battlefield Earth won't even be a fraction of the monthly bill.  So I watched this movie for free.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes, this movie was so bad that it was awesome.  It's like watching a car crash in slo-mo for 2 hours.  You can't help but look at the disaster that's unfolding before your eyes.   Once the 1 hour mark hit, I was like...christ this isn't \"so bad it's good\" anymore, this is just BAD.  You know before we keep going, let me just say that the special effects in this movie are ABYSMAL.  Of the two movies I watched today, Hot Shots had the better visual effects...and that movie was released in 1991 for fucks sake.  This movie definitely lived up to its billing as one of the worst movies ever made.  Hell I can't think of a worse movie I've seen in YEARS.  Couples Retreat is up there, but at least it has 3 redeeming qualities about it, that being Jason Bateman, Malin Akerman and Kristen Bell.  Two of those were the girls who I thought were really lovely young lasses and their performances really did nothing for me.  I can't really find anything that I actually liked about this movie.  There were some decent explosions near the end there but that's about IT!  Everything else about this movie is just so abysmal.  The dialogue is horrible, the acting is even worse, the movie is shot like it's a low-budget SyFy channel original movie, and the cinematography is even worse, the dutch angles are WAY too much, the story is an absolute fucking mess.  I really didn't know what in the FUCK was going on in this movie and I didn't even care to try to figure it out because it's not like it would have changed the sheer abysmality (yes I made that word up...I think) that the movie is.  I remember mentioning in my Couples Retreat review that if I could have given that movie a zero I would have.  Well I was wrong....that movie DESERVES every bit of that .5 star that it got.  On the other hand, this movie....*shrugs* if I could give this movie a negative score I would.  I would give it a negative all the stars that are in the universe.  And stars in the universe are infinite so that's how bad this movie is.\n\nHell what does that even say about the book.  The book is a 750 pages long (hardcover) and over 1000 (paperback).  Thanks but no thanks, this movie = no buys.  Worst movie ever made??  I can't disagree with anyone who says such a statement.   It's certainly the worst movie I've seen in AGES.",

Battlefield Earth is the most horrible looking, ill-written, poorly acted (and I mean POORLY acted) piece of s*** movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some doozies.\r\n\r\nWhere to start? Ok, the special effects. The settings were horrible looking and unrealistic. It's like a 1st grade class put them up or something. The CG looked like the SyFy channel original movies they spit up every week. I know this was made in the year 2000, but come on! The Matrix had much better Special Effects, and that movie was made a year before this one! The plot is just, well, basic for a Sci-Fi movie. It's in the future and hostile aliens have taken over, and now humanity is an endangered species. So now a bunch of humans want to take back the world from the aliens blah blah blah. The movie could have been tolerable if there was at least some decent writing behind it, but alas, there was none. Now the acting. Ok, I've seen some wooden acting, especially from Sci-Fi movie, but this, this was just so awful! It's like the cast just said, \"F*** It!\" and gave up trying. It was that bad.\r\n\r\nEven with a decent budget and lead actors like John Travolta (who was probably the worst actor in this entire movie) and Barry Pepper (almost as bad) couldn't stop this movie from being a box-office bomb. The writing, plot, effects, and most of all acting, was bad in every department. But hey, at least this movie was famous for something: Being one of the worst films ever made. I only gave it a 10% because of how famous it is for being bad.\r\n\r\nBottom line: DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!! There should be a label on all copies of this movie saying: DO NOT WATCH. It's just not worth putting yourself through",

Maybe if it didn't take itself serious I could find some respect in there, but this is dead serious. The acting is horrendous and almost scary, especially when Forest Whitaker and John Travolta aren't usually ever bad (I blame the script,  those nose pieces and crazy costumes). Barry Pepper leads the human race in its fight for survival, yet he has absolutely no charisma or anything really intriguing about him. The visuals are not even the worst part, even though they are some of the worst uses of CGI. I think it's worth seeing to show what not to do when making a movie.",

If come in with just an open mind, you can see stuff. Zaranyzerak said it well in a video he did saying that \"Trailer Park Boys\" seemed stupid at first glance, but these characters have layers on them. And so they do. I'd say John Travolta is probably the best guy in the line-up. Man, I love his lines. In fact, most of the aliens seem to have better lines then the earthlings. Maybe to show how earth and mankind are loosing the fight unless something great can pull off, and they don't have that much hope. While, the aliens, they have it all and can feel the great lines as much as they please.\r\n\r\nBut, you really feel emotion in these characters. And emotion that only comes from a classic...usually. If there's one thing that matches the Syfy channel, it's the CGI. But, I understand. Imagine a Tie-Fighter 15 feet above the surface of Endor in Star Wars. That would be hard wouldn't it? The emotion, you haft to see it too understand it...and I'm two days late on the review and I was sick while I was watching it. Excuse me for that. Remember The Thing (1982) which is being remade into The Thing (2011) which is a remake of exhibit one and exhibit one is a remake of The Thing From Another World (1953) which is a remake of a short story The Thing (18--). Now that I've co-oped out my short paragraph lemme bring your attention to it.\r\n\r\nIt had no female actresses. Why? Not because they were sexist, but because they didn't need em. The story flowed fine without a lady in it. I do hate when they put in a girl or an African-American JUST to fill in a demographic. If you're gonna put those groups in their, you wanna put them in the plot and not just to be there. Another example is Glory (1989), it doesn't focus on the female actors too much, simply because females didn't have much of a say back in the Civil War era. Fact, probably until the '60's did they not have much say. So, what do we say for Battlefield Earth? Well, it does pretty much try to fill in the demographic of the lady, but they also got TWO other demographics without actually wasting them. They result as John Travolta's partner.\r\n\r\nSo, there are my thoughts without ruining the movie. The Rating? 3.7/5+-",

Well it's 2 hours long and when the ending is as obvious as it is in Battlefield Earth that's a lot of movie to sit through.\r\nThe hero has very little personality, as do the other humans in this story.  It's one of the few times I wished the protagonist would just die so the villain could keep the screen.  Obnoxious and uninteresting is the only way I can really describe Jonnie Goodboy Tyler.\r\nI felt only interested in the aliens.  If I squinted while watching the Phyclos have their evil meetings it felt like I was watching an episode of Star Trek, but with less convincing makeup and dialog. \r\nDespite everything else I felt that Travolta did a pretty good job considering it was his camp that ruined the script.  It may not be what we're used to seeing him in, but he defiantly stands out... perhaps it was just enthusiasm he has for being in a movie inspired by the guy who founded Scientology...\r\n\r\nThe bottom line:  You might get a few laughs out of this movie and may enjoy parts of it, but it's mostly boring and I'd keep the fast forward button handy to skip any scenes without Travolta.  I can't tell if he's the cause for it being bad enough for it to be nominated as \"worst film of the decade\" but somehow his unusual camp performance makes it watchable in the way a car accident is watchable... It's a bad film but not the worst ever or even in it's genera, but it comes pretty darn close.",

Barry Pepper is Johnny Goodboy Tyler, one such human survivor, who, through his own crappy choices, finds himself enmeshed in the plot of Psychlo Terl (John Travolta, who also produced), to mine gold so that Terl can buy his way off planet.  To do so, Terl educates Johnny, teaching him everything he needs to know to lead a rebellion against the Psychlos which results in their overthrow and the destruction of their planet.  Way to go, Terl!  The dialogue is crap.  The plot strains credulity.  John Travolta's acting is unabashedly ATROCIOUS, chewing scenery like it was taffy.  The production values look like a SyFy original film.  There's really so much cheap and bad about this film, how could it do anything but fail?  The cinematography is gratuitous, the editing slipshod.  Director Roger Christian proves that just because you win an Academy Award for set decoration doesn't mean you have any business helming a major motion picture.  Did everything have to be shot at an angle? Seriously?  When you use the same special angle in almost every  shot, it means it's not special anymore!  Especially when you film it all in slow motion!   Long, boring, under produced...this film is a huge hulking mess of a movie and deserves the scorn heaped upon it.

What kind of mindless human-being came up with this dim piece of crap? That piece of crap got flushed down the toilet, sent to it's natural habitat, grew arms and legs, went to Hollywood, and made this crappy film. The script is highly senseless and dumb as hell; the storyline is something that came out of a dumpster filled with flies, garbage, and dumpster juice. For Christ's Sake, it takes place in the year 3000. Each and one of the actors and actresses don't even have any acting abilites what so ever, it is just actless acting. The worst part of all is that the movie is two hours long. Besides the length, the script is the worst part about the film. Really dreadful and dull. This is even worse then just-a-plain- bad-movie. The aliens call the humans Man-Animals. All of the CGI Graphics and special effects are very cartoony. All the humans and aliens have multiple amounts of ponytails and even ponytails growing out of their noses that look to be about four to five feet long. Blame the make-up designers. The characters of the movie are flat-out retarded. It is so hard to follow what's going on because nothing seems to make any sense. It's like one scene to another and to another and to another. The humans eat rats and only rats as their favorite food. Haven't they heard of apples, or bananas? They seem to act like monkeys so why not have eaten bananas? Oh that right. They're cavemen, they don?t know any better. None of the characters names aren't even said or mentioned in the film. I had to go online to \"www.imdb.com\" to find who was which character. It's all senseless. This is by-fact John Travolta worst he has ever done in his entire carrer. It's truly the worst of all the bad acting any film ever. This film is based off of the famous best-selling novel book \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" I bet the book was better then this trash. If there is anybody out there that likes this movie, they must be smoking crack...and I mean a lot. If there is anybody out there that says that this is the best movie in the world, then they need to be put in an insane asylum...for good. If you like this movie, then you need help. 'Battlefield Earth' is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the worst movie ever made of all-time out of all movies ever made. Worst Movie Ever!",

But alas, that is how horrendous of a film Battlefield Earth is.  I was reading several articles regarding a group of films that were chosen for Razzies of the decade (for those of you who are unfamilair the Razzies are awards given each year to the worst films that were released, and celebrates film awfulness in general.  Having only seen Battlefield in theatres and only once (and having bad, but marginally bad views of it), I decided to take the plunge and watch it now, knowing significantly more about movies and what makes one good or really really bad.  And while its not the worst film ever made, it goes into an upper echelon of unspeakably bad films that also blew a LOT of money.  Which is kind of ironic because one of the problems with the film is that it looks like a sci-fi made for tv movie.  The acting is horrible, especially Travolta who is seemingly trying to harken a Shakespearean delivery for his character Terl and sounds more like a homoerotic Englishman, and Forest Whitaker, who is usually a brilliant actor, is painful to watch here.  Adding to the discomfort is a JARRING color palette and the fact the entire movie is filmed with dutch angles.  Those are good for brief effect but for two hours it is nonsensical, unless your Terry Gilliam and know how to use it effectively.  This film is a failure in every way.",

The story is shit, the CGI sucks, and worst of all though the cinematography is just the same angle over and over again. Basically i truly believe that the cinematographer was Dutch because he had a huge hard-on for Dutch angles the whole movie.

Most movies that are bad, usually have a terrible story or a lack of one but Battlefield Earth was more than just that, it was pretty much everything about it. One example, you can find it on Youtube, there's some sort of council scene, one guy's costume was so badly made that you can tell that he was wearing a mask or some sort of make up and it that same scene something else was done so poorly, you just have to check it out yourself, it's hilarious. This movie is usually chosen as the worst or one of the worst movies ever but it's really hard to determine what movie is the worst of all time. Is it the story? The acting? The mistakes within the film? Yes but it's also how much the budget was because if you are spending like $100,000,000 you make damn sure it's a good movie. It's also hard to compare a bad comedy with a bad action movie like this one because a bad comedy is just a whole lot of bad jokes but when a movie like Battlefield Earth is trying to be serious but turns out laughable then you know it's a BAD film.",

So right off the bat, all the good stuff happened before the movie starts. You want to know how Earth gets enslaved? The aliens drop some kinda gas in the atmosphere that makes us stupid. Aliens want free labour, but they don't want us to be competent enough to do our jobs. Also: the movie is making a clear statement that the only reason a human beings will ever find themselves as slave is because they're stupid. So all those black people stolen from Africa way back when? Apparently they were idiots. Those Jews who built the pyramids? Retards. That's some subtle racism there, L. Ron.\r\nOkay, so the aliens have some magic stupidifier gas, or something, but then they also have a chair that makes people smart again, and they leave this lying around. So, obviously, one dude finally gets smart, and since he's now intelligent, he gets others to try the chair out and makes an army that way.\r\nMeanwhile: John Travolta is an alien with booger chains hanging from his nose. Basically everyone involved with this movie and everyone who ever watched it is a Scientologist, because that's the only way you would likely have heard of L. Ron Hubbard and his \"literary\" works.\r\nAlso starring in the movie is Raven from the WCW, dressed almost identically to his in-ring persona. If you don't know Raven, he looks like a buffed out Eddie Vedder who went EMO when EMOs were still called Goths. \r\nOkay, so the aliens created a magic stupid gas, because they're supposedly masters of human biology.Yet: they don't even know what humans eat. There's a whole long scene where John Travolta watches the starving hero-dude just to see what he'll eat. The dude catches and eats a rat, so Travolta jumps to the conclusion that all humans love rats, hence the line, \"Eat up, rat brain!\" \r\nTravolta's alien character gives new definition to incompetence in a Saturday morning cartoon fashion. He's just plain bad at his job. Basically: all he has to do is keep the retard humans from taking over, and he fails at that and he has an enitre alien armada fleet at his command. Think about Darth Vader, and how he fucked up protecting a metre wide exhaust port. Seriously: that was all he had to do. He didn't have to hire any bounty hunter, he didn't have to blow up Alderan. He could have put up a grate, or something but instead the Death Star blew up. You can almost forgive him, because the Force was involved, but Travolta's character has two major flaws by comparison: he looks ridiculous, and he's not scary.  \r\nSomewhere in there, there's some flying spaceships and shit that put the movie over budget. That's not worth the price of admission, really, which is why the movie bombed. \r\nSo what does this sci-fi flop have to do with Scientology? EVERYTHING.\r\nScientologists believe that aliens are responsible for all negative human behaviour, and are controlling us. They use their own weird-ass helmets to purge their minds, much like the ones in the movie. So this movie is all about subtle religious cult propaganda. \r\nAs a result: WATCHING THIS MOVIE COULD KILL YOU!!!",

He could have put up a grate, or something but instead the Death Star blew up. You can almost forgive him, because the Force was involved, but Travolta's character has two major flaws by comparison: he looks ridiculous, and he's not scary.  \r\nSomewhere in there, there's some flying spaceships and shit that put the movie over budget. That's not worth the price of admission, really, which is why the movie bombed. \r\nSo what does this sci-fi flop have to do with Scientology? EVERYTHING.\r\nScientologists believe that aliens are responsible for all negative human behaviour, and are controlling us. They use their own weird-ass helmets to purge their minds, much like the ones in the movie. So this movie is all about subtle religious cult propaganda. \r\nAs a result: WATCHING THIS MOVIE COULD KILL YOU!!!",

If there is then I'd be surprised.  There couldn't be a film with a more appalling script, horrendous acting, a horrible storyline, and unbearable visuals than this. What kind of mindless human-being came up with this dim piece of crap? That piece of crap got flushed down the toilet, sent to it's natural habitat, grew arms and legs, went to Hollywood, and made this crappy film. The script is highly senseless and dumb as hell; the storyline is something that came out of a dumpster filled with flies, garbage, and dumpster juice. For Christ's Sake, it takes place in the year 3000. Each and one of the actors and actresses don't even have any acting abilites what so ever, it is just actless acting. The worst part of all is that the movie is two hours long. Besides the length, the script is the worst part about the film. Really dreadful and dull. This is even worse then just-a-plain- bad-movie. The aliens call the humans Man-Animals. All of the CGI Graphics and special effects are very cartoony. All the humans and aliens have multiple amounts of ponytails and even ponytails growing out of their noses that look to be about four to five feet long. Blame the make-up designers. The characters of the movie are flat-out retarded. It is so hard to follow what's going on because nothing seems to make any sense. It's like one scene to another and to another and to another. The humans eat rats and only rats as their favorite food. Haven't they heard of apples, or bananas? They seem to act like monkeys so why not have eaten bananas? Oh that right. They're cavemen, they don?t know any better. None of the characters names aren't even said or mentioned in the film. I had to go online to \"www.imdb.com\" to find who was which character. It's all senseless. This is by-fact John Travolta worst he has ever done in his entire carrer. It's truly the worst of all the bad acting any film ever. This film is based off of the famous best-selling novel book \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" I bet the book was better then this trash. If there is anybody out there that likes this movie, they must be smoking crack...and I mean a lot. If there is anybody out there that says that this is the best movie in the world, then they need to be put in an insane asylum...for good. If you like this movie, then you need help. 'Battlefield Earth' is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the worst movie ever made of all-time out of all movies ever made. Worst Movie Ever!",

As in the Alien series, ET and even the Predator movies, often the \u00e2\u0080\u0098alien\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face is never seen but here Travolta plays the lead alien so of course he has to be seen.\n\nThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boots... yes the boots! The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Phsyclo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 race of aliens are 9 feet tall, this is achieved by putting the actors in Spice Girl boots with 7 inch thick soles and tapering their heads to a point like Dan Ackroyd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coneheads characters! This makes it clearly difficult to walk and impossible to run... keep in mind these aliens keep the fast and agile human race as slaves. How on earth do they even catch one?\n\nThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hands, swathed in thick latex gloves to make them look bigger... it makes it difficult to pick anything up and the can barely hold onto the \u00e2\u0080\u0098advanced\u00e2\u0080\u0099 firearms they use, let alone aim and fire them!\n\nThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plot holes, humans waltzing through highly radioactive areas with no ill effect, a group of men who have no written language no grasp of numbers or simple mathematics are able to teach themselves how to fly AND take into combat a squadron of Hawker Harrier Jump Jets in a Star Wars like arial dog fight... in 7 days! A group of men enter the abandoned Fort Knox to get the gold for their fiendish scheme, but guess what... the vault door is wide open and the gold is STILL there! (Even though we know the reason it is so heavily guarded and that there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been an audit of the gold since 2000 is because the US doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any gold reserves.) The big plan to kill all the aliens by collapsing their atmosphere dome so they suffocate has one flaw... we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen that they ALL carry breathing apparatus!\n\nIts a cross between a bad episode of Star Trek and Frankenstein... even one of the scenes where the lead character smashes through a series of plate glass windows is ripped off of Bladerunner. With lines like \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou still get to be head of security which from what I can tell is a pretty \u00e2\u0080\u0098kusshy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 job\u00e2\u0080\u009d...\u00e2\u0080\u009ckushy job\u00e2\u0080\u009d?! Thats something that Dellboy Trotter would say!\n\nI guess those involved probably thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe MUST know what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing... he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s John Travolta!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna dress up like a clown, people ARE gonna laugh.",

I certainly wouldn't go that far - it's a run-of-the mill science fantasia of noble humans striving to throw off the yoke of alien invasion and conquest. At times it's entertaining, at others it reduces itself to risible pap. Throughout, it testifies to that essential lesson which Hollywood again and again fails to learn - a good film is based on a good, well-worked script, something which gives the actor's parts they can make come alive, something which gives the audience the opportunity and excuse to suspend disbelief and become lost in the story.\n\nEarth has been seized by an alien corporation whose executives and storm troopers strut around in big boots - they look like heavy metal clowns, maybe even punk Ronald McDonalds! The corporation owns the franchise to the Earth and is stripping it of its resources. Head honcho John Travolta is passed over for promotion, so conceives a plan to use some of the human captives to perpetrate a major heist and set him up for life. Little does he realise that he will set in motion a chain of actions which will threaten to expel the aliens from Earth and restore it to human control.\n\nDid I say 'little does he realise'? Well, Travolta must have realised, but then he'd read the script! He was the leading light behind the making of this movie - which is based on a story by Scientology head honcho, L.Ron Hubbard. Making the film was something of an article of faith for Travolta. Watching it may well be a triumph of the will.\n\nIt's a multi-million dollar extravaganza which is entertaining in the places where it is not entirely trite. Travolta camps up his role, no one else has much of a role to speak of. The humans are stereotypes, the film is utterly derivative, but fails to match the science fiction films which clearly influenced it. Action drags on and on, predictably. Need I say more?",

Based on the \"best-selling\" (the quotes are because the Church of Scientology was caught buying up thousands of copies; not members, THE ORGANIZATION) book of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, is about as compelling as a bag of dog shit lit on fire and caught on film.  This amateurish mess of a movie looks like something done by a kid with one of those old Fisher Price movie cameras.  This movie truly must be seen to understand the depth and validity of loathing people have for this monumental waste of time.  The script will make you stare into space in disbelief.  The acting will make you vomit.  The production values will make you think you can do better with change you find in your couch and you can.  Travolta will not be able to atone for this mess if he moves to India and picks up where Mother Teresa left off and lives 1,000 years.",

John Travolta is notorious for overacting in this movie, and I think if you watch it for a good sci-fi flick, its not bad. But expecting something more? You'll be sadly disappointed.",

But with all the stars in this movie is certainly doesn't look or seem starry, in fact is seems shitty.  How films like this make it past the script and into pre-production, let alone out of it, is beyond me.  I thought that people in Hollywood had at least a little taste but this film disproves that notion with a vengeance.\n\nThe plot is a paper-thin as you can get, the year is 3000 and the human race is nearly extinct (the opening scene makes this overtly clear, numerous times, like we didn't catch the drift the first time), and a man is sent from one of the colonies in exile for breaking too many rules.  Along the way he meets some other people and they lead him in a thousand year old mall that looks just as fantastic as ever.  While they are eating, they are attacked, taken by an alien race called Psychlo's (the ones who annihilated the human race).  What happens next is a long, stringy, series of events leading to the humans fighting back in a rebellion and blah-de-fricking-blah.  Quite frankly we could care less.\n\nThe acting is bad... I mean bad; whether is was on purpose or not, I don't know.  John Travolta's talents are totally, 100% wasted in this movie and Forest Whitaker delivers his worst performance of his career.  Barry Pepper may be out hero (His name is Johnnie Goodboy Taylor, which makes at least a little sense since he and everyone else in this film and apparently behind it has the intelligence of a inbred mutt) but he is not memorable in this film for anything but giving a bad performance that still doesn't reek as much as the script.\n\nAnd as for the screenplay, it is horrid.  Two dimensional is too broad a term to describe these characters, there actions are as incomprehensible as the dialogue and the plot and they have absolutely no personality.  Some of them we apparently are even supposed to care for but since they say no more then twenty words throughout the whole movie, we don't.  The film is laughably silly and pretentious.  It is also incompetent, half-assed and full of inconsistency.  Doe's it make sense that 1000-year-old paper is still white?  That 1000-year-old planes still fly and 1000-year-old nuclear bombs still blow up planets (another inconsistency in and of itself quickly tied-up with a bit of mindless dialogue).  Also, the year 3000 and the Earth is a rapid wasteland, yet all the electricity works?  Right.\n\nThis film does have some entertainment on the pure basis that it really is this bad.  Is it as bad as such trash like 10,000 BC?  Not quite, but damn it it tries!\n\n\n1/2 out of ****",

But I do love the lline \"I'm as happy as a baby Psyclo on a straight diet of Ferbangos,\" and the whole \"How to Fly A Harrier Jump Jet in One Easy Lesson When You Can't Even Read\" aspect of the story is endlessly amusing. The acting all around is terrible, with the worst performances coming from Travolta and Forrest Whitaker (who clrealy can do better.), and the plot is incomprehensible. In all honesty, it is very rare that a movie can be built up to be this bad and actually turn out to even worse than you had been led to believe - this may be second only to \"The Happening\" on my list of worst movies of the past 20 years.",

He knows if the slave humans are made smart, it will be trouble, so he does it anyway. He educates a bunch of primitve humans in geometry and physics, (using a Scientology-like mind device) and they start using sophisticated fighter jets that shouldn't have any gas left in them. And then something unintensionally funny happens to their methan rich planet. Ha! Okay, just assume it is 3000, unlike the book, nothing with gas would work. No planes. Assume also nukes would have corrided long ago. No story. It would have not made snense to set in in 2000, (when that stuff works), but then again, it doesn't make any sense. This movie is revoltingly bad. It's not even so bad it's good. The Psychlos are about as scary and cool as going to watch plants grow on a hydroponics shelf, or trying to decipher what anyone was thinking green-lighting this horrid movie.

I  became agitated within a few minutes (mostly because of the horrible camera angles- I think the cameraman was suffering from an egregious case of vertigo during the making of this \"film\") and wanted to commit acts of violence toward director Roger Christian. That this man was partially responsable (and won an oscar for) the visually striking images featured in the movie Alien makes this movie all the more agonizing to watch.",

Wasn't this like a million page epic novel?
