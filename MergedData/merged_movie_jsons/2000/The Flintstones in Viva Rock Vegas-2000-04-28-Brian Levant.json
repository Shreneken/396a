            "content": "When both Flintstone movies came out, my daughter wanted to see them, so we did. I was not especially impressed by the films...but I thought they weren't bad. Well, apparently I am not the typical viewer, as both films (especially \"Viva Rock Vegas\") have very low scores on IMDB...and \"Viva Rock Vegas\" now made the Bottom 100 list following the recent changes to this list (increasing the minimum number of votes greatly impacted the list....and about 2/3 of the films are new to the list). Because of this change, I decided to try seeing the film again....and perhaps I was mistaken the first time.The first thing you'll notice is that although the look of the film is great (much like the first film), all the principal actors are different. Apparently, the studio had a hard time getting the old actors to commit to the film...so to try to get around this, the movie is supposed to be a prequel which occurred long before the Spielberg film.When the story begins, Gazoo is being punished for some unknown mistakes. His punishment is to be banished to Earth to observe human mating rituals. Not surprisingly, he picks Fred and Barney to follow...as the boys have not yet met Betty and Wilma. Once they do, they all fall in love but it doesn't go THAT smoothly. First, Wilma comes from a rich and snooty family...and they have no interest in low-brow Fred. Second, Wilma's old boyfriend invites the four of them to Rock Vegas....and he obviously has some underhanded scheme in mind for them. Third, once in Rock Vegas, Betty mistakenly thinks Barney is chasing another woman and she ends up being one of Mick Jagged's entourage.So was I wrong the first time? I don't think so. While the film isn't exactly brilliant, it is what it is supposed to be...a live action version of a cartoon...no more, no less. And, despite me not seeing it with my daughter this time, I had a fine time watching the film. Pleasant and adequate...and not at all deserving all the hate it's received. Believe me...there are many, many, many worse kids films, such as \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\", \"Baby Geniuses\" (1 and 2), \"Son of the Mask\" and most of the \"Land Before Time\" films (they made 14 of them!!!). Don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as I think this film is enjoyable and a decent story to watch with your kids.",

            "content": "I came on here to review this movie, and I was really surprised at the rating. I didn't think the movie was that bad. It is flawed in a lot of ways, but there is some fun embedded in the film. I am stuck on whether it is better than the 1994 movie or inferior. If I were to be picky, I would say better in some areas, inferior in others. My main flaws were with the script and some of the plot. The script is weak in places, but has some funny moments, mainly with the little green alien. The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun. All in all, has its flaws but it's a fun prequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

The special effects are good and the cinematography is actually interesting.Some of the double entrendres are cute, but they harmlessly go right over the kid's head. (Remember, the theme song says \"...They'll have a gay old time.\")There's a couple of clever buried jokes. (Did anyone else catch Gazoo's \"Klaatu berada niktor\" comment?)Also, Kristin Johnson is quite easy on the eyes.Remember, it's a MOVIE based on a CARTOON. Set your expectations accordingly. Enjoy.",

Even Joan Collins was outrageous as mother Slaghoople, but who else could bring glam to a time without modern techniques?? And, as reminder, she was a prequel version of Liz Taylor from the original. Special mention to Thomas Gibson as the handsome villain. I'm no movie producer or whatever but the sets looked mostly real, unlike most movies now filmed almost exclusively in warehouses, and the effects they do use are better than some I see now, 17 years later. Sure, if you look closely, the lighting is off or poor depth perspective on some of the fast-moving effects, but this was the show based on a cartoon style that repeated it's backgrounds while eyes and mouths basically had two positions, open and closed. The music is rompy and fun, classic style meet-cute and Vegas tunes. And who doesn't love an origin story? And I can't resist a Vegas movie. Hello? Ann Margrock seeing a stone-age Elvis cover? EPIC! Flintstones (this one and it's predecessor) are among the first of the live-action cartoon revivals, I cash cow that Disney is now suckling to. I haven't noticed any of the older reviews on here point out specific issues, so I would argue they weren't open to liking the movie in the first place.",

By the time it came out years later, I was at that age where I was too old to want to see it.Fast forward to 2016, currently I've been really into DC's great new Flintstones comics series (It's hilarious. I highly recommend it.), so since I was in the mood for all things Flintstones, I just rented this movie to watch it finally.This movie was silly enough to keep me amused throughout. Yes, the story is dumb and all the characters are idiots, but they're lovable idiots - all the actors clearly had a good time - and it's all so bright and colorful and cheery that you can't hate it.I laughed aloud at enough of the ridiculous scenes throughout the movie, such as Dino's big moment, or the prehistoric TV remote control, that I can't rate this movie any lower than a 10 out of 10. I enjoyed this silly movie.Surprise cameo: Not exactly a \"cameo,\" since he wasn't famous back then, but it was funny to see John Cho in an early tiny role as the valet who gets beat up by Fred and Barney.",

            "review_title": "A prequel to the first movie with a different cast and almost as good",
            "content": "While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of \"The Flintstones\" and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because it's a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, he's a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so it's fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilma's 'look' to a \"T\" and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that can't be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's stepmother than Joan Collins? Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60's cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding \"yes\"! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they aren't. For instance, \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original \"Apocalypse Now\" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? It's the same thing with both Flintstones movies \u2013 how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing? I always loved Gazoo and he's effectively brought to life in \"Viva Rock Vegas.\" The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, it's natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The first two acts of \"Viva Rock Vegas\" are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Don't get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.GRADE: A-",

            "content": "This movie makes an awkward attempt to stay faithful to the spirit of the cartoon. It has moments, but far too few of them.The few things done right first: Jane Krakowski makes a wonderful Betty; why couldn't she have been in the first movie? She makes the silly dialog somehow sweet and fun. The dating sequence is cute and the Vegas arrival scene has some clever sight gags, but these were fleeting montages. Harvey Korman is wasted in a throw-away role with few lines; instead of voicing Gazoo (as he did in the original cartoon), and the guy they use for Gazoo sounds like slate grinding on bedrock.Joan Collins is obnoxious enough on her own; this movie has her play a wrenching stereotypical loudmouth mother-in-law who you want to feed to the nearest T-Rex you can find. And the guy that plays Barney? What the heck is he doing? His entire performance looked like a rejected audition for a junior high school production of \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in Jurassic Park.\" Fred? The guy had a voice almost as nasally as Joan Collins. Wilma is cast as a 7-foot-tall giraffe. Fred goes gambling: Gee, what's gonna happen there? Fred and Barney dress up as dancers: they even manage to ruin this classic comedy routine. A poorly done triangle story falls flat.This petrified fossil of a film does little justice to the Modern Stone-Aged Family. Rent some of the original cartoons, instead.",

            "content": "\"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" is one of the poorest excuses for a family film I've seen in a long time.The original remake with John Goodman was at least decent, but this flop has not only an awful cast, but awful dialogue, filming techniques, jokes...it's straight out of a made-for-TV sequel. Only one thing: It's even worse.In this live-action prequel to the 1994 comedy hit, Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and wife Wilma (Kristen Johnston) go to Rock Vegas along with the Rubbles, Barney (Stephen Baldwin) and Betty (Jane Krakowski), where Wilma is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). This is the setup for a bunch of tiring gags that also have to do with a little green space alien coming to earth to see how humans mate, or something as such.This has to be one of the worst comedies I've seen it a while. It was actually painful for me to watch. There really are no redeeming values whatsoever, and I don't think I'd like it even if I was a five-year-old. It treats the audience like dirt, and it obviously seeing if there's any juice left in the audience to pay for another \"Flintstone\" flick.Instead of trying to improve upon the first film--which was a bit underrated--this film seems to go for the bare minimum in an effort only to draw money from the audience. I have to ask myself, if they knew the first was so critically-declaimed, why release another awful flick? Try to improve and get good reviews.But nope, no luck here. Instead we are treated to a truly awful and hard-to-watch comedy with no redeeming values whatsoever.Avoid at all costs.0.5/5 stars--John Ulmer",

(Yes, that can happen because that is the reason why the 1998 film \"Madeline\" got a PG rating) Genre(s): Family, Comedy, Romance, Based on a TV show (The Flintstones animated series of the 60's) Summary: It is basically a prequel of the 1994 underrated hit. (The Flintstones starring John Goodman). Fred (Addy) and Barney (Baldwin) just got their jobs in the rock quarry. Barney is feeling highly in content of his life although Fred is unsure of his future. Yet they'll meet \"The Great Gazoo\" (Cumming) for the 1st time soon enough. Meanwhile Wilma (Johnston) despite her financially wealthy life is feeling rather bored with her glamorous but rather humdrum life. After all she has her overbearing mother (Collins) her ex-boyfriend soon to be suitor for financial reasons of course Chip Rockefeller (Gibson) and who is trying to win Wilma's heart for financial reasons only, but at least she had her senile but good-hearted father (Korman). Wilma tries to escape her wealthy but unhappy life. So she runs away and gets a job at a local fifty-ish fast food place. Soon she meets with Betty (Krakowski) after trying to give a reason why she came there in the first place (but failing because Betty wouldn't let her completely explain) Betty gets Wilma a job at the fast food place. (Known as \"Bronto King\" gee try to guess what product plug in joke that was suppose to be.) Soon Fred and Barney meet the girls and you pretty much have an idea what's going on here. \nThe good: If it weren't for the fact that this was a prequel the casting would look downright absurd. (I mean c'mon a Baldwin Brother as Barney Rubble? I don't hate the Baldwins but still). The special effects are first rate. Yet despite the special effects and the gags this isn't just \"eye candy with simple gags\" the movie was well made as itself. The cast did well & the performances were well done too. Despite the fact that this is a PG film this is perfectly fine for the whole family. And I can easily recommend this to any Flintstone fan. (Although I am not a Flintstone fan, I did enjoy the show and the movies though). The animals were a really nice touch such as dino (Blanc) a massaging squid (O'Donell) and more. From start to finish this film plays out really well. Overall this is one of the best \"gag\" comedies I have seen for a while but so far the animation world is on a winning streak this year I hope the simple gag comedy world can do the same. (Although it's rather unlikely)\nThe bad: The humble morality element in this is a bit schmaltzy, but that is no big deal. But if you don't like comedies that its humor is mainly simple-gags then you may want be careful.

I think he played him awkwardly as though, he didn't really want to be in the movie.But Mark Addy was a lot lot better. OK, he didn't have the voice down to a tee, but he resembles Fred, when made up, a whole lot more than Mr. Goodman.I just wish they would have asked Elizabeth Perkins to re-create her role as Wilma. She did a great job in the original, and resembled and sounded like the cartoon character, where Kristen Johnston, didn't quite do it for me in the role. She looked far too mature to be playing Wilma, and didn't have the voice either. But full marks to Stephen Baldwin and Jane Krakowski as Barney and Betty. They were also a lot better than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell from the original film. Mostly because, again, they sounded like the cartoon characters and Krakowski resembled Betty. (Baldwin in no way looked like Barney though - oh, well, can't be perfect, but he makes up for it with the voice and laugh).Joan Collins is also hilarious in the film, as the Filthy Rich Mother of Wilma, and again, does a better job that Elizabeth Taylor from the original.Also watch out for Alan Cumming. He almost steals the film with his \"Mike Jagged\" from the Stones, while also playing an alien in a dual role.With great creatures (Jim Henson workshop), good gadgets and an all-round enjoyable film, I give this an 8 out of 10.",

Don't let that happen with \"Viva Rock Vegas\": it is a fine little movie: fun, funny and visually rich in cartoony colors, costumes and sets. The acting (and voices) are top notch: Stephen Baldwin's \"Barney\" and Mark Addy's \"Fred\" are just fantastic; voices, mannerisms, etc. Jane Krackowski is spot on as Betty, (ditzy-ness and giggle-wise). Alan Cumming as \"The Great Gazoo\" is perfectly sarcastic and wise-ass. The CGI is very good, considering, as are the sets and costumes. The storyline makes sense, is plausible, and even engrossing (again, considering). For what it is, this is a great little movie, and compared to the first one (sheesh) it TOTALLY rocks (\"rocks\". get it?). I defy anyone who can actually tell a good movie from a bad one to watch this movie IN FULL, ALL THE WAY and TO THE END, and tell me that they weren't entertained by it.",

            "content": "Since I grew up as a child in the 2000s I saw almost all the good movies based on classic cartoons (such as the GARFIELD ones, the SCOOBY DOO ones and of course THE FLINTSTONES ones). I must have seen the FLINTSTONES movies at least 3 times during my childhood and when I looked about them on IMDB I was shocked at their appalling scores (and this one has also made the new Bottom 100 at #87 at the moment as in 2018 the Bottom 100 changed the criteria for including movies in its list, so increasing the number of votes up to 10,000 for being eligible greatly impacted the list, and almost all of the movies in it are from the last 21 years.This film isn't really a sequel of the movie with John Goodman and Rick Moranis as apparently the studio had an hard time in calling back the actors for the previous movie so, for getting around this, this is a prequel about what happened before the events of the 1994 movie hit.In the beginning the alien Gazoo (Alan Cumming) is banished from his planet for some unknown mistakes and he has to go to Earth to follow the humans' mating rituals. Quite coincidentally, he picks as his subjects Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (played this time by Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin) as they are freshly graduated and began to work in the quarry. After a while they meet Wilma Slaghoople and Betty Rubble (played this time by Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski) and they fall in love and they go on Rock Vegas, but soon trouble follows; Wilma comes from a rich and spoiled family and they are not really interested in low brow Fred; her former boyfriend Chip Rockfeller has a scheme for them when they go to the casino; after some misunderstanding Betty ends up in Mick Jagged's tour.So it really deserves its bad score and reviews? I don't think so. While the movie isn't a masterpiece it's good in what it is... a live action version of a cartoon. And despite having a different cast and a different story, I enjoyed it on the same level of the predecessor. It has the same colorful sets and funny looking dinosaurs and prehistoric animals from the first movie. The cast has improved a little bit; while Stephen Baldwin was a bit better than Rick Moranis in the first one as Moranis was less clueless, I prefer John Goodman over Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone. While Kristen Johnston is gorgeous just like Elizabeth Perkins (and even a bit taller), I think that Jane Krakowski was a cuter choice for Betty Rubble as she is less fat than Rosie O'Donnell. Thomas Gibson as the villain looked a LOT like Kyle MacLachlan for me.In substance, I'll simply suggest to don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as this is a very cute and harmless family movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.",

Basically The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming) has come to Earth to see how humans (or should that be Neanderthals) mate, in his case, Fred Flintstone (A Knight's Tale's Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin). Soon enough Fred and Barney meet and fall in love with Wilma Slaghoople (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me's Kristen Johnston) and Betty O'Shale (30 Rock's Jane Krakowski). Betty and Barney suit each other perfectly, but Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) is not impressed with Fred, she wants Wilma to marry rich bastard Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip obviously plans to make Fred and Barney look like criminals by giving them some credit to gamble in Viva Rock Vegas, they obviously see the opportunity to make money to impress their girlfriends. In the end, Chip is obviously defeated, and Fred and Wilma marry, with Betty catching the flowers, oh, and Gazoo (who only Fred and Barney could see) succeeded in his \"mission\". Also starring Cumming as Mick Jagged, Harvey Korman as Colonel Slaghoople, American Pie's John Cho as Parking Valet, The Mask's Jim Doughan as Dinosaur Confessor and Rosie O'Donnell as the voice of the Octopus Masseuse. Addy does quite well replacing John Goodman, Baldwin is certainly stupider than Rick Moranis was, Johnston is more voluptuous and husky voiced than Elizabeth Perkins and Krakowski is definitely better than O'Donnell, all in all, a near better film than the first.

            "content": "I saw the 1994 live action \"Flintstones\" movie on video for the second time in 2000, about 4 \u00bd years after I first saw it, and thought it was great during my second viewing. That was shortly after this prequel, featuring a different cast, came to the silver screen, and I remember hearing about this film around that time. Since I was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings of 1994's \"The Flintstones\" (both many years after my second), I was in no hurry to see \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\", especially since I knew it had an even worse reputation than its predecessor. It's been over 2 \u00bd years since I last saw the first live action \"Flintstones\" effort, and I've finally seen this second one, which is unsurprisingly not good.The Great Gazoo is an alien who is sent to Earth by his species to learn about human mating rituals. Back on Earth, in the prehistoric town of Bedrock, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are two best friends who are both in search of girlfriends. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them. Meanwhile, a rich young woman named Wilma Slaghoople is fed up with the snobbish people around her, especially her mother, and runs away. She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the \"I'm ignoring you\" part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of \"The Flintstones\" was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's \"The Flintstones\", you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like \"Viva Rock Vegas\".",

The movie also has a few nice little touches like pictures of the cartoon Fred and Barney handed out to people, and the specially modified Universal logo with the Earth only showing one continent behind the word \"Univershell\" (\"Did anyone else see those giant letters out there?\").Alan Cumming as the Great Gazoo (and a Mick Jagger-type rock star) is also one of the movie's pros... and indicative of its cons. Writers Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont (\"Can't Hardly Wait,\" \"Josie and the Pussycats\") and the late Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr (\"Top Gun,\" \"Anaconda\") go for too many cheap gags, have a wilful disregard for the show's mythology - Gazoo didn't arrive until Fred and Barney were both married with children, for starters (and as another poster rightly says, he crashlanded as opposed to being sent) - and don't really have much of a plot going for them. The movie's all as silly as that episode where the boys befriended \"Ann-Margrock\" without knowing who she was. Speaking of which, Ann-Margret (who guested on the TV show) returns to Bedrock to sing \"Viva Rock Vegas\" in a montage and over the credits, but her take isn't a patch on the BC-52's version of the theme song in the first one, and indeed the overall feeling of going down a level is everywhere - not just in the plot of Wilma's mum wanting her daughter (a miscast Kristen Johnston) to marry an uppercrust type (Thomas Gibson from \"Dharma & Greg\"), but from the cast to the visual effects (Rhythm & Hues aren't quite up to Industrial Light & Magic's level) to the music (song-wise, that is; David Newman at least tries), the movie fits in all too well alongside the other losers directed by Brian Levant, he of \"Problem Child\" and \"Jingle All The Way\" infamy.

Running as a prequel to the first film and the cartoon itself, it shows how the four main characters (Flintstones and Rubbles) met and married, after a trip to the city of Rock Vegas (the equivalent, in the movie and Flintstones world, to the city of Las Vegas, of course). But the thing that really make me mad in this movie, personally, was that silly, green character, that seems to have come out of the \"Jetsons\" (another Hanna-Barbera cartoon). He was permanently out of context, his existence has been poorly explained by the plot and he only served to try to make totally empty jokes. I wanted to drown that alien several times while watching the movie.If the 1994 movie had already revealed several fragilities, beginning with an all-too-adult plot for a children-oriented film, this movie completely misses any attempt to improve these faults. The plot is miserably poor, which is probably the result of poor scriptwriting choices and the subliminal, lousy, intention of extorting some more box office money (we cannot forget the huge box-office success that the first film was). A bad choice: the public wisely didn't pay to watch this piece of trash. Dried jokes, a bad plot, poor acting, bad construction of characters, far-fetched props and sets, a tiring cinematography and a cast that did an absolutely painstaking job.

            "content": "THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS (2000) ** Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin, Kristen Johnston, Jane Krakowski, Thomas Gibson, Joan Collins, Alan Cumming, Harvey Korman, Alex Meneses, (voices of Mel Blanc and Rosie O' Donnell). (Dir: Brian Levant)`The Flintstones' were one of my all time favorite cartoons growing up and I certainly appreciated it years later as an uncanny Stone Age homage to `The Honeymooners' - arguably the greatest sitcom ever created - and was surprised that  a prequel was in production to the less than stellar live action adaptation a few years ago with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis and Rosie O' Donnell.  Go figure.Here the plot - such as it is - centers on how good buddies Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (Addy, the portliest member of the English lads in `The Full Monty' and Baldwin playing dim) met their future spouses Wilma and Betty - nee Slaghoople and O'Shale - (Johnston, the Amazonian alien from tv's `Third Rock From The Sun' and Krakowski of `Ally McBeal').  Seems Wilma is trying to get by when she abdicates her rich bitch mother Pearl (Collins, remarkably well-preserved precursor to the first film's Elizabeth Taylor) and her dotty, yet loving father the Colonel (perennial gold standard second banana comic vet Korman who gives plenty of smiles whenever he's onscreen), shirking her inherited lifestyle for a down on her luck lifestyle supported by the giddy barhop Betty who works at Bronto King where the two get along famously. It is there that the two cavemen meet the wives-to-be and set up a blind date after encountering mini alien The Great Gazoo (creepily envisioned with the full-size head of Cumming) who is there to observe mating habits of the `dumb dumbs'.  From there the rest is - as the theme song goes - `a gay all time!' After the two couples find their true loves (Barney was originally Wilma's date and Fred, Betty's) they quickly realize they are meant to be together but Pearl's interference with her estranged daughter only makes matters worse when she throws a party inviting the foursome to discover her plans of getting Wilma back with her ex, playboy and snake in the grass Chip Rockefeller (Gibson of `Dharma and Greg') who ploys to usurp Fred from Wilma at a set up vacation in his casino in - you guessed it! - Rock Vegas. Sure the storyline is pretty lame and some of the puns ridiculous - which was the appeal of the tv series frankly - but the cast seems to be enjoying themselves.  Addy gives an uncanny impersonation of both Jackie Gleason and Alan Reed, the original voice of Fred; Baldwin is believeably dippy; Johnston ably sexy and goofy and Krakowski's giggle is dead-on. And while the production design is accurate to the original with some inventive visuals (the dinosaur rollercoaster for example) and the debut of baby Dino the film just seems unnecessary and by the time Mick Jagged and the Stones (with Cumming - again - doing a gross caricature of Mick Jagger) arrive the energy seems depleted and going through the motions.  Yet little ones who are just getting a taste for the classic cartoon will not be disappointed and of course I'm sure that Universal will still pump them out as long as there's an audience.PS: My only quibble is why they didn't allow Korman to voice the superscilious Gazoo (which he was on the old show) and make him more of animatronic than the bizarre and disturbing looking one in the film.  Maybe they can check into that for the inevitable sequel.",

            "content": "Let's be honest: For better and for worse, this is a lot to take in.I genuinely admire the production design and art direction. There was a tremendous amount of hard work that went into creating the costume design, set pieces, props, puppets, and the fundamental look and feel of Bedrock. It all pays off, because on even a basic level the movie looks great. The CGI is more of a mixed bag, ranging from the notably distinct but good (extra large dinosaurs that are effectively stand-ins for tangible fabrications), to good but overt (overlaid cartoon effects like hearts or thought bubbles), to garish (Gazoo and his brethren). Still, even the post-production visuals are reasonably decent in general. On top of all this, I honestly like the cast. Though the A-list stars from the 1994 movie have been replaced, their substitutes are a lot more solid than I ever would have anticipated. Mark Addy, Kristen Johnston, Jane Krakowski - and, yes, even Stephen Baldwin - are fantastic as they lean into the simplistic silliness we recognize from the classic Hanna-Barbera animations to realize the chief characters.To be sure, there's an unmistakable ham-handedness that characterizes the feature from top to bottom - the ending is frankly cringe-worthy, no matter how well it's executed. Some inclusions are too straightforward, over the top, or outright juvenile to be palatable - trying too hard to cater to the intended youthful audience. At the same time, there's a certain level of sophistication to some jokes and dialogue, aiming to please those adults watching with their kids, that while pleasing nonetheless feels out of place. In no small part 'The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas' is uneven in the weirdest of ways. We get a tired fart joke a few minutes in, for example, while the overall plot is just about as by-the-numbers as a romantically-inclined comedy could be, yet some lines and scenes are so sharply written that they earned some real laughs.For all this, though - even minding all the worst faults (including a scene that's bizarrely indelicate in broaching gender, and is not just sexist but borders on transphobic) - overall the movie is a whole lot stronger than I ever would have guessed. I admit I'm unsure why the reception has been so poor as it is. This is a kids' movies, after all, and even so: It's wonderfully well made from a technical standpoint, with fine work from those behind the scenes. The cast embody their characters with marvelous personality and physicality, and there are some surprising names appearing here, including Joan Collins and Harvey Korman (and, for a scant few seconds, 9-year old Kristen Stewart in her feature film debut). Though the very appearance of Gazoo is a bit much, Alan Cumming is a true delight in bringing the diminutive extraterrestrial to life. And if imperfect, there's some welcome intelligence in the dialogue and scene writing that goes a long way in making up for the inadequacies.Anyone who can't abide family-friendly pictures won't find anything here to change their minds, and even for those who can, this is far from perfect. However, I started watching with decidedly low expectations, and ultimately those were handily surpassed. 'The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas' had a lot working against it, but the heart poured into it from all involved does a lot to outweigh the deficiencies. One doesn't need to go out of their way to watch it, but truthfully, if you happen to come across it, this isn't half bad!",

To be fair, many big-name sequels are dreary affairs with no heart, especially when they're prequels. But that is definitely not the case with Viva Rock Vegas.Viva Rock Vegas is the story of when Fred and Barney met Wilma and Betty. Frustrated with her oppressive mother (Joan Collins playing a b**** like only she can), upper-class Wilma Slaghoople runs away from home and meets Betty O'Shale at a diner, who takes Wilma under her wing under the impression that she's poor. Fred and Barney walk into their lives and soon sparks are flying. That is, until Fred discovers what a rich background Wilma really has, one that he intends to impress when the four of them are invited to the Rock Vegas casino of Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's shady suitor. Overseeing all of these antics is the futuristic alien Gazoo, sent to Earth to oversee humans' mating rituals and having the bad luck of taking Fred and Barney as his objects of study.I was not at all expecting to like Viva Rock Vegas, but I did, and it's a joy to watch every time it comes on TV. The cartoon atmosphere works pretty well in live action, and the actors are even improvements on the original live action cast. Mark Addy makes a much better Fred, and Jane Krakowski is a particularly excellent Betty. Stephen Baldwin captures the innocent slow-wittedness of Barney well. Alan Cumming (\"I am INVINCIBLE!\") seals the deal in two very different but equally hilarious roles as Gazoo and the rock star Mick Jagged.The movie is very entertaining and very funny. It doesn't try to be anything more than that and it succeeds admirably. It seems there is no place for innocent comedies on the internet these days, but you could do worse than give this one a chance. Much, much worse.",

So when I heard the prequel was coming out I did not want to see it.  However, my wife brought it home as a rental for the kids and they wanted me to watch it with them.  So I did.  I have to admit, this film surprised me.  It had a very original plot and a different view of how they all got together.  I found that very refreshing.  Granted, this one did not follow the original cartoon series story line too well but that is forgivable when you begin to realize what this film is about, finding the right person you should marry.The plot line is solid and is generally presented well.  There are a few painful spots in the film and there are some good comedy scenes as well. The oversized props are generally good and Dino as a puppy just remined me of my Labrador when she was a puppy.  Full of life and hyper!!  Just the way a young puppy is.  The other special affects were also rather good.However, the choices of Mark Addy as Fred and Kristen Johnston as Wilma I have to question. They did not seem to have the personality to match their characters.  John Goodman did a better job as Fred Flintstone and I feel would have been a better choice.   On the other hand, the choices of Stephen Baldwin as Barney and Jane Krakowski as Betty were excellent!!  They seemed to fit their characters well.I was also surprised as how low this film was rated by other users.  I thought this to be disappointing, considering how bad the first one was. This prequel was far and above superior to the first.Overall, worth your while (7 out of 10).",

            "content": "THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS / (2000) 1/2*\"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" reminds me of edible substances that have no taste, no texture, no nutrition, but are very colorful and you can chew on them. This movie has no depth, no purpose, no meaning, but it has prehistoric set creations, big sound effects, imaginative costume designs, and colorful makeup contributions-all of which may capture the attention of the film's target age group. This contraption absent of intelligence, flavor, and just about everything else.This immature prequel to the 1994 comedy hit based on the popular TV cartoon series, \"The Flintstones,\" is so bad none of the previous performers have faithfully returned for seconds.  The replacement for John Goodman is Mark Addy, the obese male stripper in \"The Full Monty.\" Rick Moranis' replacement is with Stephen Baldwin, whose most profound acting experiences uphold on the M&M's commercial. Kristen Johnson and Jane Krakowski substitute for the much funnier Roise O'Donnell and Elizabeth Perkins. Not coincidentally, these new actors, especially Addy and Baldwin, fit their dumfounded characters perfectly.The film details the fossilized lives of best friends Fred and Barney before they marry and conceive children. The two meet their future wives, Wilma and Betty, at a fast food restaurant. Conflicts evolve when Fred falls in love with Wilma and her filthy rich mother (Joan Collins) requires her daughter to romance playboy ex-boyfriend (Thomas Gibson) and skip poor Fred. Another subplot involves an alien (Alan Cumming) being sent from another planet to observe human mating rituals. Of course, Fred and Barney are right in the middle of the creatures' mishaps.I never cared about any of the characters in this movie; none of them have any motive or brains outside of the script. There is no effective tension contained in the love story either. The production dim-wittily attempts to portray suspense and involvement with romantic competition Wilma experiences. The \"Rock Vegas\" blackmail scheme contributes brief uptightness in the audience, but its conclusion will leave you laughing with pity.\nAs far as humor goes, \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" is lacking of any funny material due to incredibly poor writing. There are dozens of slapstick jokes about dinosaurs, rocks, style, aliens, obesity, and clumsiness, but none have any life. At least similar comedies \"My Favorite Martian\" and \"What Planet Are You From\" were appropriately wacky. \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" is too corny for its own good. There were a few scenes that were so pathetic I could not hold my laughter back, but I was laughing at the movie, not with it. Several of these horrible sequences transpire through ridiculous dialogue. Here are a few examples:Fred complimenting Wilma in a love scene \"Your eyes are like two big eyes\"Wilma to her family who is disbelieving of her passion for Fred \"They love me for who I am\u0085not who I am.\"As bad as the original \"The Flintstones\" was, \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" is a whole lot worse. Perhaps there is no coincidence the two movies acquire the same director, Brain Levant. This man has created bad films before (\"Problem Child 2,\" \"Jingle All The Way\"), but never anything as putrid as this pile of bones. After reading this critique, I fear you may misinterpret my implication; this movie is not so bad that it's funny, it is so bad it's bad.",

The story is utterly predictable, and the characters are flat and uninteresting. As for the subplot about the alien Gazoo character, if you examine his character carefully, one will notice that his presence essentially does NOTHING to advance or contribute to the story. He could easily be written out.

Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble become employed at the rock quarry then they meet the embarrassing Great Gazoo. Wilma is trying to shed her rich image so she flees and is befriended by Betty who works at a restaurant. Absolutely no plot with elements such as courting, gambling and jail that is above the intended audience. Horrible directing by Brian Levant who also made the first film. What does work is the casting is more accurate. Mark Addy is effective as Fred and Stephen Baldwin brings out the mannerisms of Barney. We are given their introductory to their jobs and their first encounters with their future wives, which leads to a predictable outcome. Kristen Johnson brings fine comic touches to Wilma who rebels against her rich upbringing and is accepted by working class Betty who is played by Jane Krakowski. Joan Collins plays Wilma's mother and Fred's antagonizing mother-in-law. While the film delivers on a narrative given background setup to characters, the special effects are actually worse with Gazoo in desperate need to disappear. Score: 2 / 10",

Mark Addy and Kristen Johnson were only okay as Fred and Wilma, but Stephen Baldwin made Barney look like an idiot, and I found Jane Krakowski's Betty to be a bit annoying. Then, there's the Great Gazoo, who originally came into the picture in the cartoon in the last season. Here, Fred and Barney meet him before they even meet the girls. It would have been much better if they did a CGI Gazoo that looked more like the original character, and got his original voice, Harvey Korman (who did appear in this movie as Wilma's father, actually) to do the voice. Alan Cumming's head on a CGI body was kind of off-putting, and maybe it would have been better if the body was a bit more proportionate to the head.I think the only thing I liked about this movie was Harvey Korman as Wilma's slightly senile father, and Dino as a baby dinosaur (so cute!), as well as using archived vocal effects from the late, great Mel Blanc (Dino's original voice actor).",

All in all I call this a middle of the road type of movie.",

Although Kristin Johnson and jane krakowski bring Faaaaaar more sex appeal to their roles of Wilma and Betty than their 1994 counterparts, their acting doesnt seem to rise above Sitcom level which is a Bit of a Shame, but no letdown. Mark Addy as Fred flintstone struggles with the fact that he has an english accent and minimal comic talent. He certainly looks like a Young Fred and brings more depth to the Character than expected. And like the rest of the Cast, he is willing to do whatever it take to make it work which is most admirable.The Real Standouts here are Stephen baldwin as Barney..and Alan cummings as the Martian Gazoo. Whilst Rick moranis in the Original film took a more vulnerable approach to the Role,Baldwin goes after the role in the same way as the cartoon character,getting the voice pitch perfect and depicting him as the cheerful fella that the series did.Alan cummings is also very enjoyable as the Great gazoo.These two actors should take a bow for excellent performances.Thomas Gibson is a bit over the top of the scheming villain..But the sets are Great..the film is imaginative...and quite funny in many scenes...even if the ending is a Bit predictable(ONE QUESTION...HOW DID BARNEY SHRINK SO MUCH BETWEEN THIS FILM AND THE ORIGINAL....JUST A THOUGHT)All in All...a great effort guys...Im so Happy this film was made..cause when the first one came out....it was more than just a film...it was a special event....and this film was the icing on the Cake....I GIVE IT 9 OUT OF 10......GREAT EFFORT",

A few of the jokes were cute too ... the Juraissac Park and Barney not realizing what Betty meant by taking him home and making him breakfast is two that come to mind (though a bit racy for the kiddies).

The set designs are colorful and clever; they keep every scene lively.I have only two criticisms. The resolutions to the main conflicts are a little too easy.Also, they should have let Jane Krakowski sing (perhaps instead of Mick Jagged). Jane is an excellent singer; she is probably the biggest talent in the cast.

Some of the jokes suck, in fact, I never laughed the entire film, I just thought it was OK.   For sexual content, well, it's hard to tell if Fred slept with Wilma (the same with Barney and Wilma), and there is a gay (literally) joke where Gazoo (voiced by Alan Cumming, that annoying bird from the first one), who must observe our mating rituals and dosen't understand that it is boys and girls, asks Barney and Fred to mate. I didn't think they had enough \"character development\" on Rock Vegas, and I wish they had told more about the flight there.  But all in all, it's an OK film (though not much of a comedy), Beetles fans look out for a spoof of them, too.",

I must admit, THIS Fred actually did a better job than John Goodman, however I miss Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma.  I thought Steven Baldwin (A Baldwin playing a Barney...lol) did a pretty good job as Barney, and I can't decide which Barney rules, Rick Moranis or Steven.  OK, Rosie O'Donnell ROCKS as Betty, this one was a good attempt, but it just wasn't Rosie. My only complaint with the film was the sexual comments made.  Betty invited Barney over to her appartment to have sex, and the Great Gazoo was sent to earth to study man's MATEING ritual, And He tells Barney and Fred to \"Go to it\" as Barney is laying on top of Freds backside.  Barny starts cleaning a girl's chest area after he makes a mess, and to Betty who see's, it appears that Barny is PLAYING with the womans breasts. This is suppose to be a FAMILY film, and I found this material VERY unacceptable for my two daughters. I thought Alan Cumming was WONDERFUL as the Great Gazoo, this was a breakout performance. The plot was very good, (However, they never did explain Fred being cleared of his framed crime, or escaping from jail, and the issue of the stolen pearls was never resolved),the acting was great, (considering it WAS A CARTOON), and the special effects were not bad either. There were no laugh out loud jokes, but I did smirk a couple of times, it was enjoyable, but be warned before taking your small children, unless you're ready to answer some sexual questions.",

I didn't think Harvey Korman should have had a part in the first movie and defiantly not this one! He was like a joke and I hated that! Rosie O'Donnell should not have been in this one either! I thought the other actors were great, but the script was a little messed up. Why was Alan Cummings playing plural roles?! Come on, guys! Fred and Barney switching dates was in poor taste, too! Who thought that mess up?! My last gripe is Ann-Margaret singing Viva Rock Vegas! I love her, she has a great voice, but this was not her song! She was great with Elvis in the 1960s Viva Las Vegas and that was good enough! Imo, Alan Cummings did a great job with the song. They should have let his version be played in the plane ride scene to Rock Vegas! I'm done. Ouch! I have a headache! LOL!",

The movie is about Fred Flinstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) who are visited by The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming). This is about as random as a plot as we can get. Gazoo has been sent to Earth to learn about the earthlings mating rituals. Only Fred and Barney can see him and truthfully he doesn't even need to be in this movie. Also the effects to show him look very very bad. Anyways Fred and Barney one day get some food and run into Berry O'Shale (Jane Krakowski) and Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnston). Wilma has run away from her lavish live in Slaghoople manor and is currently living with Betty. The four of them decide to go on a double date and both basically come out of it with their respective partners. Wilma brings her new found friends to her family for her father Colonel Slaghoople's (Harvey Korman) birthday where Fred meet's Wilmas ex-boyfriend Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip invited them all to his new casino opening in Rock Vegas. Fred agrees they should go with hopes of winning enough money to buy Wilma a proper ring and propose to her. The four of them go, but meanwhile Chip is actually the puppet master here planning to get Wilma back and get rid of Fred. There's a bit more to it all, but that's the jist of it. So yeah the plot is basically an origin story of how Fred and Barney met Wilma and Betty. Why they added the Gazoo plotline I have no idea. Looks like they just wanted to make more references to the cartoon. The film does actually have some funny moments and some adult jokes in it like the previous one which I actually laughed out loud at. I will say Mark Addy is definitely no John Goodman. He's sufficient, but he just is kinda missing something here as Fred. I thought Stephen Baldwin was a good Barney and I even liked Jane Krakowski as Betty. I think Kristen Johnson as Wilma was miscast. She's very much out of place in this movie and while she's trying her best I think they could have gone with someone else of this role. Definitely, a forgettable film. If you have to watch one terrible Flintstones movie might as well just stick to the original (as I said previously I think it's a decent flick).

Sure the first live-action Flintstones film was better but this one is still highly entertaining and certainly stays true to the cartoon in a lot of ways.

However, this movie was a disgrace in every details. Running as a prequel to the first film and the cartoon itself, it shows how the four main characters (Flintstones and Rubbles) met and married, after a trip to the city of Rock Vegas (the equivalent, in the movie and Flintstones world, to the city of Las Vegas, of course). But the thing that really make me mad in this movie, personally, was that silly, green character, that seems to have come out of the \"Jetsons\" (another Hanna-Barbera cartoon). He was permanently out of context, his existence has been poorly explained by the plot and he only served to try to make totally empty jokes. I wanted to drown that alien several times while watching the movie.If the 1994 movie had already revealed several fragilities, beginning with an all-too-adult plot for a children-oriented film, this movie completely misses any attempt to improve these faults. The plot is miserably poor, which is probably the result of poor scriptwriting choices and the subliminal, lousy, intention of extorting some more box office money (we cannot forget the huge box-office success that the first film was). A bad choice: the public wisely didn't pay to watch this piece of trash. Dried jokes, a bad plot, poor acting, bad construction of characters, far-fetched props and sets, a tiring cinematography and a cast that did an absolutely painstaking job. For all this, this is one of the worst family movies I've ever seen.",
