            "content": "How great was this movie? I fell in love with it from being made to watch it in Health class in 11th grade. I love films about adversity within races, and this movie was a classic. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth, and these guys were greater than any stereotype.",

            "content": "\"Remember The Titans\" is one of the two best films to have a chance to win an oscar for best picture.Denzel Washington leads a cast that is young, fresh, talented and determined to make this movie a success. \"Remember The Titans\" is laced with strong performances from Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams.Based on a true story \"Remember The Titans\" follows the 1971 T.C. Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone, who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes \"Remember The Titans\" a real gem. However, the strength and real beauty of \"Remember The Titans\" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In \"Remember The Titans\" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.I hesitated to see \"Remember The Titans\" because I didn't want to see another football film, but it is more than just another football film.\n\"Remember The Titans\" is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film.",

            "content": "By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying \"oh geeze, another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.\"  Well, after seeing this film, you'll be taken by surprise, just like I was.In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T.C. Williams Titans, are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year, a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season, Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone (Denzel Washington). What's bad is that Boone is black, and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry, and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp, Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally, he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football, he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with, they have homework to get to know one another.  With this, it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane, unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, HOOSIERS, and RUDY, all are films that show that what appears to be a sport, is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film, since they are factual, they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" another gets excited while listening to \"Act Naturally.\"  And although you can guess what happens in the end, you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor, it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white, these men are a team, and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance, that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays \"racist\" roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot, he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted, and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead, he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great, the ones I thought stood out were:  Preston Brant (Jerry Buck, the team's captain), Donald Adensun (Petey, the team's running-back), Kip Perdue (Sunshine, the team's quarterback), Craig Kirkwood (Rev, the team's defense player), and Ethan Suplee (Lastik, the team's leading defense, and by his size, he should be!)  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him, he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS, he's the exact opposite, he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film, which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful, and if it doesn't convince you to change, then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film, that along with Cameron Crowe, Wolfgang Petersen, and Ridley Scott, he should be nominated best director.This is quite a film, in fact, I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film, and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only \"PG\" and put out by Walt Disney Pictures, I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did, then chances are, the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer, Boaz Yakin, and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film! ***** (out of five)",

            "content": "Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like \"Hoosiers\" this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.Like \"Hoosiers\" this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film.",

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" is a movie that by the end of seeing it makes you feel good. And why shouldn't it? You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company, and I think it's perfect for the whole family. \"Remember the Titans\" is a comedy-drama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students, white and black teachers, and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton, there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps \"Remember the Titans\" from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with \"the big game\". Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in \"Remember the Titans\", but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win, win, win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line: \"Remember the Titans\" is an excellent film, very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.***1/2 (out of four)",

            "content": "Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. With two important family roles nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" particularly potent and uplifting.Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?). So hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired, and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10",

Except for one thing. It is a peculiarity of the film business that some actors peak early, for no obvious reason, and others just keep on going, like the Energizer rabbit. Michael Caine -- excuse me SIR Caine -- has been making movies for decades. Sometimes he is brilliant and sometimes he is not. Samuel L. Jackson has been in so many movies that (to this reviewer) it seems like the writers have reached the point where they no longer bother naming a character, they just pencil in the margins that they have written a part for Jackson. Denzel, who was beyond brilliant here, it is so hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the conviction and the diction that is his trademark, seems to have stopped doing these sorts of parts (written in 2013) and frankly, more's the pity. Hollywood is like that. So on top of all the other excellent reasons to see and enjoy this film, here is one more. Denzel at his peak. What more can I say?",

This is based on a true story, and the 13 and 0 record really happened, so this true story was what created the predictable film stereotype. I love the choice of actors in the film. Each person seems to be able to tap in to the feelings of their character, which creates a much more realistic film. It depicts the nature of racism within peoples lives very well and shows how common loves for different things can pull people together so that simple and wrong beliefs are forgotten.

It tells the story of a dedicated coach seen tackling the explosive combination of football and racial desegregation in 1970s America. The film is quite ambitious, but it not only really does pack an emotional punch but it does linger long into the memory and is several notches above sports movies I have seen. For one thing, it is slickly directed by Boaz Yakin, and benefits also from wonderful cinematography and a music score of sweeping grandeur, almost epic. Even better than any of these put together, is the marvellous lead performance of Denzel Washington that was worth an Oscar, it seems as though in every film I've seen of his he manages to give a compelling performance and this includes the underrated Cry Freedom. Will Patton matches him perfectly in a smooth, quiet and perhaps low key performance as his counterpart that isn't at all clich\u00e9d. Hayden Pannetiere also gives a fine performance, even though I didn't see how her character would ever overcome her differences with her sister. The script is extremely sharp and decisive, the editing is crisp and fast and the football parts are enough to pump up your adrenaline. The epilogue could bring tears to your eyes, as it is so beautifully put. All in all, wonderful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

This is a movie about discrimination and racism in the early 1970s and the courage it took to deal with it.And the movie was fairly enjoyable and it was clear who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. Denzel gave a stellar performance. And the actor portraying the football captain did a great job as well in capturing the nuances and subtleties of his character. But it seemed overly melodramatic. I find it inconceivable that the Board of Education would have appointed coach Boone with the intention of firing him after his first loss. It just seemed a bit much and overblown. And then one of the referees started intentionally calling bad plays against Boone's team -- I thought it was highly improbable that this happened the way it was depicted in the movie. And then I started wondering what really happened. Frankly, I would have preferred something closer to reality than what was depicted. It was all a bit too melodramatic and fanciful and not grounded in reality, so much so that I felt fairly cynical toward the movie and wondered if anything outside of the basic facts was even true -- the basic facts being that Boone was hired to coach and his team won the state championship the first year.As a comparison, imagine a movie where Abraham Lincoln uses his magical powers to sway the course of the Civil War in the right direction. Would it have added drama to what actually happened ? Yes, but then it becomes a piece of fiction and starts to bear little/no relevance to our society.Similarly, I think there was so much dramatic license taken that, instead being an important biographical work, the movie ended up being a sappy melodrama that bore little no relationship to what actually must have happened. As a piece of fiction, it's fairly enjoyable and dramatic. As a biographical/historical piece, it's a fairly empty and unsatisfying piece of work.In sum, it's like junk food -- it tastes good, but it's not really good or healthy for you in the long run...",

It's in the North, the South, and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film, the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted, it's just a movie, but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said, I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable (although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wall--this is happening in most football movies). The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practice--Sunshine and Louis--who just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive, but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. I could go on, but others have said so much already. It's a good action movie with nice human characters. It just gets a little simplistic at times and it needs to answer for that.",

            "content": "Although a mite too predictable, \"Remember the Titans\" is an inspiring and entertaining movie.  The true story of the integration of a Virginia high school football team and the warm multicultural relationships which developed among the team members, staff and families, the film reminds us once again when working together in a common effort, one can find love and friendship in the most unlikely places.  As the head coach, Denzel Washington uses military-style techniques which have been shown time and again to succeed in creating unity and team spirit among people from different backgrounds.  Big surprise here.  The film's most important lesson is for people to give each other enough respect and trust before making judgements about other people.  The film glosses over the genuine cultural differences between black and white communities.  They do exist, though are generally minimal among people of the same socioeconomic class. This isn't really important except to those who feel this kind of thing has been done to death over the last three decades.  Even they will find plenty to enjoy in \"Remember the Titan's\".  There's plenty of humor and action (some really tough looking football plays).  There is also one truly amazing performance, that of Hayden Panettiere as Cheryl Yost.  Hayden is TOTALLY convincing as Will Patton's football-obsessed daughter.  She's also spunky, charming and strong-willed. There's nothing bitchy about this little girl.  You believe she could tear your head off if she put her mind to it.  Yet, She still manages to be very feminine and cute.  As I said, a truly amazing performance.This movies a keeper.  I'll probably pull this one out about once a year just to lift my spirits.",

When it came on TV, I wouldn't want to miss it, even when it came with the commercial interruptions. It was just as good the second time around, and there are new discoveries. For example, the first time I saw it, Ron Gosling (The Believer, Murder by Numbers, The Notebook) had not yet proved to be such a good actor.What attracted me to the movie was the football, set around the time Joe Nameth took the Jet's through its most glorious season in snatching the Superbowl from the heavily favoured Baltimore Colts. But this is college football. In the movie, in a vital game when the opponents tried a shotgun, someone in the Titans quipped, \"Who do they think they are? The New York Jets?\" While the movie seems to concentrate on the Titan's defence, it was just a little before the time when the Minnesota Viking's defence, the \"purple gang\", became legendary. But then the Titans set an example for the NFL to follow, they had a \"perfect\" season, a feat the Miami Dolphins repeated in the NFL a few years later.But this is more than football. It is a wonderful movie about racial harmony, uplifting, feel-good and touching. As one commenter so beautifully puts it, let the cynics sit out on the sidelines on this one, and groan about clich\u00e9s and all that. This is a movie that will warm your heart, and don't let futile vanity cheat you out of enjoying it.Nor is the movie a fairy tale. It is based on a true story. It is also realistic. The camp is an isolated environment where wonderful things can be made to happen. The kids themselves understand this when the come back to the \"real world\", as one puts it. But then, through determination and good will, they bring these wonderful things into the real world. Finally, anything with Denzel Washing in it is worth watching.",

            "content": "Although Remember The Titans is based on a true story from Northern Virginia in 1971, I couldn't help feeling that I had seen this story before. Then I remembered that a short time before the incidents on which this film is based occurred, there was a film made called Tic Tic Tic. This also involved a southern town growing out of the old days and into the new ones with the post Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. In that film a new black sheriff played by Jim Brown is elected in a southern town and he asks the former sheriff George Kennedy to stay on as his deputy to help ease the tensions.When the folks who were making Tic Tic Tic happen on the big screen, how could they have known that life was imitating their art. This northern Virginia town was being integrated, black people were now voting, the schools and businesses were being integrated, the city fathers had to take into account a whole new population with the franchise. Successful football coach Will Patton is asked to step aside for Denzel Washington, newly arrived from North Carolina. Patton agrees to stay on as his defensive assistant coach to help the team and not incidentally the town. Because of the good will and good intentions of two strong personalities they make the newly integrated team the Titans work.Even with two Academy Awards and several nominations besides, I doubt Denzel Washington will ever get a more beloved role than Herman Boone. In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to.",

            "content": "When segregation comes to an end TC Williams High School is created by the combination of an all-black school with an all-white school and, for political reasons, the white head coach Bill Yoast is replaced by black coach Herman Boone. This obviously causes a lot of conflict within he team and it is only to protect his white players that Yoast decides to stay on as the defensive coach. When the players go to training camp the conflicts are everywhere and Boone's first job is to bring the team together.Usually when movie premieres come onto terrestrial television they are trailed big time and are put in plum spots; so when this film was simply dumped into the daytime schedules at Christmas time I feared the worst and, for that reason, didn't get round to watching it until February. As with many films, there is plenty of good in it but it is dented a bit by its weaknesses. As you would expect it to be, this is a simple story of race conflict being resolved within a group of youths who then become a winning team and, in the telling, it doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. Now that is not to look down on the real story behind the film but the film itself cannot help but spoil it by always going for the easy clich\u00e9s, the simple and corny bonding moments that summarise a difficult journey and, whenever possible, sticking in some mighty, swelling music to make sure we all understand how emotional that particular moment is.What this does is reduces the true story of a turbulent time to the level of melodrama and, while I admit it would have been hard to do it any other way, it cannot help but damage the film a little. However despite this it is still quite enjoyable and those that can forgive its self-indulgence will find much to like about it. However for me it was hard to get past the corn and I was only able to see an average sports movie with a core of a \"lets understand each other\" storyline. The sports stuff is OK but never gripping and the characters are a touch too generic to be really involving. It is fortunate then that the performances are mainly reasonably good, certain good enough to keep the film lively and watchable. Washington delivers a good performance even if it lacks any subtlety or edge to it; likewise Patton is right out of the playbook and does what is expected of him. The support cast have some good performances and some corny performances but generally they all do well enough to match the tone of the film.Overall this is an OK film that is quite enjoyable but doesn't do anything special. While having enough to involve and just about entertain, the film still suffers from being overly melodramatic, corny and loaded with moments that come across as rather clich\u00e9d. If you can accept this then it is a good film, otherwise it is just an OK one that will grate on you occasionally.",

            "content": "In the last decade, I've realized that perhaps the most difficult \"genre\" of movie to make work is the sports movie. Not only are there only probably a handful of great sports films in the history of cinema, there are really very few good sports movies. Really, the 1980s is the end of the era of consistently good sports movies (and most of them about baseball).All the major sports flicks in the last 10 years are pretty formulaic and follow the same recipe: tale of a bunch of downtrodden, undertalented, scrappy, \"brothers\" who band together to pull off the impossible...win the big game! And I actually think that this film that I'm reviewing REMEMBER THE TITANS (2000) started this new trend of rather formulaic, soft-headed, cheesy sports movies of the last decade, which include We Are Marshall and Glory Road, all of which were supposed to be \"fact-based\" movies. The problem with all these movies is that, while they may have gotten the very general details correct (character names, opponent mantres, era costumes, etc.), all these films fail where it really counts: character, dialogue, and story.Set in a 1971 D.C. suburb and starring Denzel Washington (who really had gotten long in the tooth at this point in his career) plays yet another typical in-your-face, take-no-junk, proud black man, a hodgepodge of pretty much all the characters he had played up to that point in his career, and it's annoying. Virtually all the characters in REMEMBER THE TITANS (including Washington) are all one-dimensional and clich\u00e9. The ever reliable Will Patton does his best to overcome a thankless role as the white assistant coach that Washington's character deposes (and pretty much runs over for the entire movie). Of course Patton's character turns out to be a closet liberal and completely understanding of the man who took HIS job from him! Hayden Panettiere, as Patton's annoyingly spunky and super-smart daughter certainly shows talent for a child actor (at the time), but what kid in the history of the world has ever acted like this? Then you have a bunch of nameless, one-note footballers and assistant coaches of both races who somehow learn to love each other. The absolutely most annoying character was that faux-gay transfer surfer dude from California, who is one of the weirdest characters ever to grace the movie screen!The only tolerable characters in the film are played by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as the prospective leaders of the white and black players and help bring them all together. Their personal relationship is actually authentic (thus the extra star!), but everything surrounding them is not. In real life (which this movie is supposed to be based on), even post 60s (1971 to be exact), I find it hard to believe that opposite races would have hated each other so vehemently at the start of the film, only to end up getting along so famously by the end of it, especially on a team that was literally forced to be together.",

(Sports can be readily justified by other means.)Films thrive because they simplify reality -- unlike books which can amplify reality. It is in the very nature of film (quite apart from the Hollywood machine) to abstract, simplify and theatrically enhance for effect.This is all well and good -- films and sports -- when we want to exercise our minds and bodies. But when we cast the huge truth of the world in these simple terms and call it truth, well there's a big problem. Just think, there are millions and millions of people for whom this film (and many like it) will convey the reality of what racial struggle was all about in the sixties and seventies.Here, all the whites (except the dumb fat kid who clearly doesn't know better) are ignorant racists. All the blacks are noble victims. All it takes to solve the problem is some Marine Corps discipline to get these kids to know each other.

I don't know anything about American Football and it's probably one of the least known sports over here, because we only get to see something of it once a year: when the Superbowl is on. So that didn't do it for me, but what made me decide to watch it was the fact that Denzel Washington played an important role in it.He's coach Herman Boone, a newly appointed African-American football coach who will have to lead a high school football team in Virginia, during the early 70's. Racism is still the norm and even though the school has been recently mixed under federal mandate, integration is far from reality. Many white players even threaten to sit out until he is replaced by a white coach. But he doesn't give up that easily and during a training camp, he learns the white and black players how to get along. In the end they all become friends and it's that bond that will get them through the season undefeated. But when the captain of the team gets injured in a car accident, just before the state championship, they will have to prove that they can adapt and that they still can win the match...True stories have always been a great source of inspiration for Hollywood, but personally I can't name too many of these movies that I really liked. The main reason for that is that they are almost always preachy and as sweet as syrup. \"Remember the Titans\" doesn't completely get caught in that trap, but isn't really able to avoid it either. Or wouldn't you call a movie that shows a coach, who goes with his team to one of the greatest battlefields on the American continent, while giving away a speech about team spirit, fighting for each other and things like that, not preachy??? I certainly do, but I'm glad that not everything about the movie was like that.The acting for instance was OK. You can't expect anything less than OK from a man like Denzel Washington of course, but most of the other actors did a nice job too, even though most of them were complete strangers to me. The direction too isn't bad. Again, Boaz Yakin is a complete stranger to me, but what he has done with this movie could have been a lot worse. OK, there is nothing exceptional, original or daring about it, but he knows the conventions of the genre and has followed them rule by rule.All in all I must say that this wasn't the worst movie about sports. OK, it will never be in my list of favorite movies, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I'm sure that it will be loved by the American audience, especially the young males, because this is one of those typical American spectacles. But even the others might give it a try. I did and wasn't completely convinced, but also not entirely disappointed by it. That's why I give it a score in between a 6.5/10 and a 7/10.",

            "content": "Tossing it out there like a football, this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football, but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye\" Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans.",

            "content": "I can't say it enough, I love football and I love football movies. I've rarely seen a bad football movie. If I were to make a list of my favorite football movies \"Remember the Titans\" would be at the top, closely followed by \"Friday Night Lights.\"RTT differs from most sports movies in that we weren't dealing with a plucky group of guys who had no business being on the field, but miraculously come together and win. These guys were good, but could they get along long enough to play together as a team?The year was 1971 and Alexandria, Virginia's TC Williams High School was formed as a combination of the city's segregated White and Black high schools. Like many southern cities, Alexandria was very resistant to the 1954 Brown v. Topeka Board of Education decision that made segregated schools illegal. They waited seventeen years to integrate and I'm sure it was not by choice. Part of their new restructuring was to give a head coaching position to a Black head coach. They chose Coach Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) to bump Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). There was already going to be tension for the forced integration, so what more when an accomplished head coach is being bumped out of his position?Two better coaches couldn't have been chosen. I don't mean that they were the best X's and O's men in the game, I mean that their personalities were uniquely suited for the situation they were put in. Coach Boone was strong willed, bullheaded, and good at coaching. He'd have to be all of that to command the respect of his coaches and his players. Coach Yoast was selfless, agreeable, and integritous enough to not sabotage Coach Boone as he could have.RTT started with the team's training camp preseason where Coach Boone wanted to not only make them good players, but he wanted to make them a team. I couldn't appreciate this starting point more. Many sports movies start somewhere midseason and have a team make this phenomenal turn around. RTT showed all the hard work that goes into making a good team well before they play a single game. Coach Boone pushed those guys to the brink and he was indiscriminate in his demands. He was trying to make a winning team. As he said, even if they didn't love each other, they were going to respect each other.The two alpha males on the team and the bitterest about the whole situation were Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) and Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst). If they could get along, then just maybe the rest of the team would follow suit.It was no walk in the park and things didn't just fall into place. There was years of history acting as a dutiful guard of the old order. There was unbridled hostility and an entire community wanting to keep things status quo. RTT doesn't shy away from the hurt, the pain, the anger, and the ignorance--and I think it's a better movie for it. They could've glossed right over the painful parts of the past and celebrated a victorious team, but the movie showed that past and how a community, a school, and a team got past it.RTT is more than a football movie. Sure, the football team was the focus, but it was the vehicle for showing a greater lesson. It was about sacrifice, about learning from mistakes, learning from each other, and loving one another. Ultimately, it was about transcending differences and coming together, and all the good that can result from togetherness.",

It's fun, it has heart, the characters are memorable and the action on the football field is frantic.The cast is phenomenal. Everyone does a great job, but I would higlight Hayden Panettiere, Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, Ryan Hurst and of course Will Patton and Denzel himself. Especially Hayden steals every scene she's in.Wonder why the director Boaz Yakin hasn't done any more hit movies, but here he pulls it off. Also writer Gregory Allen Howard only has couple of movie credits. Anyway, good work.",

            "content": "I knew the lead actor that it was based on a true story about American football, and I have to say, for a Walt Disney Pictures it doesn't have that schmaltzy feeling. Basically two schools in Alexandria Virginia integrate forming T.C. Williams High School, and the Caucasian Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) of the Titans, is being replaced by African American Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) from North Carolina. Tensions are formed as he forms a team with both black and white players, creating tensions, but after much training, these are eased at camp in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. When they get back, they get to prove themselves on the pitch, and they prove both successful and accepted by the community. There is the point when they get to the biggest match of all, and a star player is paralysed, but this doesn't damage their spirits and their determination to win, which they do. Also starring Donald Faison as Petey Jones, Wood Harris as Julius Campbell, Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Louie Lastik, Nicole Ari Parker as Carol Boone, young Heroes actress Hayden Panettiere as Sheryl Yoast, Craig Kirkwood as Jerry 'Rev' Harris, Kip Pardue as Ronnie 'Sunshine' Bass, Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth as Emma Hoyt and The Notebook's Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley. Washington always gives a good performance, and this in no exception, and Panettiere is cute, in a film with a good story about overcoming hostility and prejudice, and going to sporting glory.

Some may call it sacrilegious to compare the resurrection of Jesus to the resurrection of a Virginia town through football, but I see the Easter story in this movie. The self-importance exhibited by the Pharisees and the resulting hatred of those different, was no different from the hate exhibited by the town fathers in Virginia. The insistence of brotherhood by the coach, as played magnificently by Denzel Washington, resulted in a rebirth of the town - a resurrection from the hatred that blinded, and sometimes still blinds, the sons of the Old South. None of us is perfect, but we can all come together and form a perfect society. That was the vision of Jesus and the vision of our forefathers. Remember the Titans reminds us of what we can accomplish if we try - and if we try with love.",

            "content": "I'm actually quite fond of sports movies, no matter how predictable they always are. I'm also a bit fond of American Football and occasionally watch a match on TV. I even watch the Super Bowl, even though it gets aired literally in the middle of the night for me, till early in the morning.So this movie sounds like a perfect one for me to watch, since it features ingredients that I like. I really wasn't impressed with the movie though. It lacked a bit of everything, making it just a bit too much to regard this movie as an above average one. It lacked in good sports moment, it lacked in character development and it lacked in overall credibility, even though the movie in essence got based on a true story and real-life persons.For an movie focusing on American Football it surely is missing some good match sequences. During the matches you hardly ever see any wide-shots, making it hard to figure out how the game is progressing and what exactly is going on and who is doing what. It's not remotely as adrenaline pumping all as portrayed in some other and much better movies, involving American Football.But of course American Football is not the main essence of the movie. It's all about the racial issues. The movie is set in the early '70's and focuses on the State's first racial mixed Football high school team. Of course in the beginning they have difficulties working as a team together at first and the different groups don't accept and respect each other. I don't think I need to say how this is changing in the movie though later on and how the story is progressing. That's one of the difficulties of the movie. It's formulaic and predictable. Not just the story but also the different characters and their reactions toward each other. Basically every character within this movie is one big stereotype.This brings me to another problem of the movie; It's characters. Because it's all so predictable and because the characters are such stereotypes you'll also feel hardly involved with any of them. The movie besides really doesn't feature the best character development I have ever seen in a movie.Nevertheless they are still being somewhat made interesting by the actors that are portraying them. The movie has some big names in it, such as Denzel Washington and Will Patton. It besides feature some new faces, that are now some well known established actors, such as Kip Pardue, Hayden Panettiere (as an 10-year old in her toughest role out of her career yet), Kate Bosworth and Ryan Gosling. Denzel Washington is especially great, like always.The movie is a bit too short though. Sequences often feel rushed and lots of things are taking for granted, just to keep the movie going at all times. This is of course also something typical for a Jerry Bruckenheimer production but in this particular case it doesn't help the movie much. They could had easily resolved this by just letting the movie be like 15 minutes longer.It's also a pretty 'clean' movie. It's a Disney produced movie, so there are no swearing characters, no sleeping around with the cheerleaders and the movie is heavy on its themes and morals, such as acceptance and team work. A supposedly homosexual character and a real fat and slight backward guy are almost immediately being accepted into the group of tough pride, athletic, all-American youngsters. A makes the movie just a bit too 'clean' and therefore at the same time also really not the most credible movie around.It's overall a maintaining movie that is certainly watchable, with a fine style and acting performance. But it's also a real lacking and far from perfect one, in more than a couple of ways.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Not all black people break into song every few minutes of their lives.2.) Not all white people listen to country music.3.) All state championships are not won on the final play.4.) A team would not be running the ball with 20 seconds left in a game, risking a fumble. They would have just taken a knee and the game would be over.5.) There were more than 8 songs released in the 1970's. Apparently, Hollywood never got that memo.6.) The little girl. Enough said.7.) The \"transformation\" of the Gerry character happened way too fast to make it realistic. Over the course of a 2 week football camp, he went from telling the coach he didn't need any of \"them\" on the defense, to being the main guy who brought the races together.8.) Even without knowing the real story, you could see the car accident coming light years away.9.) No football team would ever just throw guys into a game on defense in the 2nd half of the state championship game who had never played on defense previously.10.) Awesome waste of Kate Bosworth. \"Now that you've won some football games with both black and white players, I'm willing to shake your hand Julius.\" If only she had gone to the training camp. Then she'd understand it all so much better.11.) Let's throw in a California hippie to show that white people can be discriminated against too. The audience will never see that coming.12.) We're supposed to believe that the \"Sunshine\" character would actually doubt whether he should go into the game because he can't throw an option pitch?? 13.) Way too many impassioned speeches about being \"perfect\" and this being \"our time\". I was afraid they might run out of music to score these scenes.14.) Love the slow clap and standing ovation for Gerry's mother. Of course, the TV commentators would announce when she enters the stadium as well. By the way, did they really televise high school state championship games in 1971? 15.) Ryan Gosling's character giving up his spot to Petey because \"Petey's just better coach\".16.) This whole racism thing is important and all, but I really wanted to make the Virginia high school sports hall of fame. Now that's some big time stuff right there.17.) Let's use the white coach's trick play on the last play to show just how far these two men have come so they're winners in life as well as on the field.18.) Apparently, every time a new player comes into a game, he makes a game changing great play within the first two plays that he's in there, propelling the team to an easy victory.19.) Darn those crazy backup quarterbacks. They'll getcha every time. Can we see a movie where the starting QB gets hurt, and the season goes to hell because the backup QB sucks? There's your reality.20.) And finally, what a great message the movie gives by showing how winning football games is the solution to all the world's problems. Want to end racism? Just win some football games.",

The team gets to the final and they of course win! This was a really corny and gross movie and I can't say that I enjoyed it.

Everyone knew that a school three times their size was going to destroy us -- the only question was how badly. They were never, ever, an underdog in any sport \u2014 to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.To add insult to injury, they changed the name of our team from the Tigers to the \"Lions\" (because they felt that Tigers was too close to Titans), and they depicted us as backwater hicks... which was laughable, since Groveton served Hollin Hills, the most intellectual and progressive community in the entire DC area, as well as other upper-middle class neighborhoods filled with career government professionals.The problem, of course, is that Hollywood dreck like this becomes gospel to those who have no knowledge of the actual events. Rather than accept moral responsibility to make a film based on real life events reflect the truth, they purposefully pervert it to satisfy their biased fantasy and obliterate the historical record.I wish I could give this grossly insulting film a negative rating, to help make up for those who have embraced it as heart-rending \"truth\", given that they know nothing about the events it claims to document.",

The movie did well in sending out its core values regarding prejudice and that it is important to get to know someone before making judgement. But this is where the movie also does wrong in how they gloss over cultural differences in between races. The movie however does well in showing how racism can be overcome but its portrayal makes it too easy and simple for such a major problem. Even so, the movie still feels good to watch for casual audiences. In the end, it becomes a nice feel good movie about teamwork and overcoming differences, but it's simple and predictable nature may make some people turn their heads away from the movie. The movie is a good watch, although I wouldn't recommend it you can try giving it a watch and see how emotional and passionate the movie can be.",

            "content": "It is common knowledge in the film critic community that sentimentality, if used improperly, is among the most hated of all celluloid evils. \"Remember The Titans\" provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.From the first to the last frame of \"Titans\", the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clich\u00e9s and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Diana Ross. This is meant to be heart-warming, playful, and inspiring, but it just comes off as irritating. As far as clich\u00e9s...lord, where do I start? We have copious amounts of \"soulful\" black characters who want to do nothing but love their \"brothers\", the \"tough\" controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the \"big game\", the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, \"enlightened\" hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates \"c--ns\" no matter what, the lovable \"Bubba\", the \"cute\" \"I'm nine and a half!\" tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token \"fat guys\" whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\".On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about \"Titans\" was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable clich\u00e9 trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous \"Uptown Girls\"! He also wrote such fantastic films as \"From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money\", \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\", and, surprise, surprise, \"The Rookie\", another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clich\u00e9s (someone's been watching too much \"Forrest Gump\").\"Remember The Titans\" also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles. Denzel, please try to stay away from horrid wastes of celluloid such as this and try to star in more films like \"Training Day\". You can do better.4/10",

            "content": "In 1969, there was a survey taken that rated the majority of Americans' opinion of the Ku Klux Klan as being more despicable than the Viet Cong. Yet judging by the inability of many communities of the 1970's to accept integrated schools, such a sentiment would seem hard to believe. I passed up numerous chances to watch this movie, and when I finally saw it on The Disney Channel(of all places), I realized I missed a good one. Boston and Detroit weren't the first battlegrounds for school integration in the 1970's, but even if Alexandria, Virginia wasn't one of them, southern cities were just as hostile towards it as they were in the 1950's and '60's. I had a glowing review planned for this movie until I saw some of the user comments here, and I almost changed my mind.Denzel Washington plays as Herman Boone, an African-American coach, hired on the basis of affirmative action who faces a great deal of resentment for it, especially from former coach Bill Yoast(Will Patton), who is demoted to defensive coach. From the beginning, Boone makes it clear that he's a coach first, and not that much of an activist. Yoast's football-crazed daughter(Hayden Paneittiere), is such an outstanding character, that if this wasn't at least loosely based on a true story, you'd have to make someone like her up.Needless to say, most of the kids don't get along with each other, but Boone is determined to make sure that ends at training camp, and it does, which nearly creates a rift between first string Q.B. Gerry Bertier(Ryan Hurst), and his girlfriend(Kate Bosworth). What we eventually learn is that there's a sinister plot to make sure the integration fails both on the team and at school in general. Boone finds that he can't lose a single game or else he's fired. So, being the determined coach that he is, he wins every single game. However Yoast finds his white friends are plotting to revoke his membership in the local hall of fame if he doesn't agree to let them dump Boone, so they rig the next game.Big Julius(Wood Harris) sounds a great deal like Mr. T when he tells an opposing player, that he'd better get used to being on the ground.As Louie Lastik, Ethan Suplee does a complete 180-degree reversal from his role in \"American History X(1998)\" as a kid from New Jersey who LOVES black culture! This is a kid who knows segregation is stupid and pointless. If he were a kid of anytime since the late-1980's he'd be the kind of kid who drives a pimped-out full-size sedan with huge speakers and chrome dubs.I don't think the movie suggested that Sunshine(Kip Pardue) really was a homosexual, but that his fellow students just taunted him simply because he was such a hippie. Aside from this, I can't really say anything about this movie that hasn't been said before. Even if the events of this movie didn't exactly take place the way the movie depicted, it was still memorable and glorious, clich\u00e9s or no clich\u00e9s.",

Having been out of high school almost seven years, the scenes on the football field stirred that old burning desire to be back on the gridiron cleaning people's clocks and having that sweet taste of victory in my mouth (although that actually happened a lot less than I'd like to admit).  And to see the way the two races forged friendships and integrated did cause a rush of emotion as well.  However, by the end of this movie, I knew all too well that my emotions had been deliberately played with and that this was the entire point of the movie.This film evokes the typical stereotypes of both a sports movie and a free-you-mind flick.  The whites and blacks who play for the newly integrated Titans are hostile to each other at first, and then miraculously at football camp they all become friends.  They are then met with the same prejudices they once shared when they return home, and the movie chronicles their struggles to remain friends as well as the rest of the communities fight to become more tolerant.  It's a great message, but one that has been done before.  Furthermore, it is such a formulaic account here that it's hardly worth the initial emotion it evokes.  On the field, the same formula (and this paragraph might be a spoiler, but then again, I'm sure you can already determine the outcome).  The Titans face tough opponents but come together to defeat them all, and, on the last play of the game with only a prayer, they somehow manage to score the winning touchdown and take the state championship (gee, haven't we seen that 300,000 times before?).If you like the emotional roller coaster ride, then this is your movie.  If, like me, you tire of seeing the same formula plugged into movies with only the names of the characters different, then avoid this like the plague.  All in all, when the emotions subside, I realized that this movie left a bitter aftertaste.I give it a 3 out of 10.",

As a history buff, I decided to look up the real story of the Titans to see what they changed.First Denzel Washington's character had already been hired at the black school in the film. He was not a new coach. Three schools were closed and consolidated not two.Second the Titans did not have any close games except for the Marshall game which they won 21-16 and not 10-7. However that game was the fifth game of the season and not the state championship as in the movie. The Titans crushed their opponents by double digits in every game on the way to the state championship.The film was strong on getting many of the key racial relationships correct. What would been wrong showing the Titans as a dominant football team. Sports clich\u00e9s such as winning on the last play of the game need to be eliminated in movies unless it actually happens.What made Miracle a strong film is that they did not rewrite what happened in the US Soviet hockey game. Of course more people know the events of the US and Soviet Hockey semifinal game than the Titans high school football team in the 1970s. But in a film whose movie title is \"Remember the Titans\", I want to remember them as the dominant team they were.",

The movie will hit some pretty tense, serious dilemmas, which are then resolved too simplistically and quickly.  Racist, narrow-minded people suddenly see the errors of their ways and reform their attitudes overnight; then they all hold hands and think happy thoughts.  I don't care to even guess how historically accurate this movie is of the real Titans.In the end, I cannot consider this movie as a serious commentary on society and American history, it though does put forth an honest effort.  Instead, it belongs next to The Mighty Ducks and all those other feel-good, go-team, rah-rah movies.Still, this movie is entertaining and pretty engrossing.

            "content": "Finally saw Remember the Titams on pay-per-view. Rated it a 5. RTT is a curious mixture of two basic stories: the integration of a high school in Northern Virginia in 1971, and the integration of that school's football team.The \"big picture\" story, of racial integration as a social issue, is painted shallowly. We see glimpses of protest and white people who resist the integration (the African Americans seem bemused by it). But we never really get a feel for how hot an issue this is elsewhere. In truth, the movie makes Alexandria appear bigoted and racist. That's curious to me, because I grew up about 10 miles south of Alexandria and don't recall any of this. Alexandria is a D.C. suburb (more of a feeder community). D.C. is extremely integrated. I would think Alexandria would be more likely to be accepting when the change came. Now if the school had been in SOUTHERN Virginia, that's a different story ....The \"small picture\" story, of the players on the team (and the two coaches) integrating, is filled with cliches. There is forced bonding and unnaturally quick progress. None of it feels very real. Neither does the football, which is almost incoherent in its speed and flash through games. Never do you feel like the Titans are facing any particular dramatic moment. You just assume they will win, and don't worry about it.For a movie with such ambition, Remember The Titans is more pretentious than anything. It reached high and never actuall got off the ground.",

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" is about the 1971 Alexandria, Va football team that dealt productively with mandatory racial integration. On the surface it is a football story, but it really is how the students, parents, and business people of Alexandria were brought together by these football players and coaches.Denzel Washington as the new coach, coming in to take over, and Will Patton, the outgoing head coach who becomes defensive coordinator, are both fine actors and are never better than they are here. The story is fairly predictable, and the Titans win the big championship on the final play of the final game. The script is a bit patronizing to our emotions at times. But we know this story is a real one, and the characters were real people. Many of them, including the two coaches, were there in the making of the film. The DVD sound is just great, and you can choose between DTS and Digital Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The extras give a real insight to the making of this film, including interviews of the two original coaches and many of the players. As the writer, who is a black American, commented, during adversity among the races we may not end up loving each other, but at least we can understand each other and appreciate the differences. Well put. This is the kind of movie everyone should see, because it accurately portrays the struggle of school integration, which is still fresh in many of our minds.

            "content": "Two coaches, one black, one white, compete to direct the fortunes of the T. C. Edwards High School football team facing integration in 1971 Virginia. An enormous 300 pound plus blonde good old boy modelled on the late Chris Farley, is the first player character.  He seems to have arrived on the Titans with none of the polarized racial animousities of the other players.  His ready wit softens some of the early conflicts. SPOILER ALERT Two leaders emerge immediately.  One is a beefy white guy with a lot of fairly racist attitudes.  Interestingly, he and another black guy become good friends before school starts as the team works out at a nearby college. Some of the tensions subside as the players get to know one another.  Back on opening day at T.C. Edwards High, however, the brotherhood evaporates quickly.  The Team reenters the real world.  Girlfriends are lost, friendships become tentative, the race problem persists.A Sports alumni group wants to help white defensive coach Will Patton recover his head coaching job by seeing to it that black head Coach Denzel Washington loses the first game and his job.  Will Patton's acting is neutral and opaque for the first third of the movie.  He gives Coach Washington all the rope he can manage, to hang himself as head coach.  But since Patton also represents our moral perspective, his character is not allowed to actively do battle with Denzel Washington.  No problem. The white Coach has a five year old daughter with loads of attitude, a temper, and football know-how to boot.  Her character is absolutely unbelievable but her credible temper manages to represent Patton's feelings perfectly.  The Defensive Coach's daughter keeps the battle over team strategy hot in the absence of her symbol-ridden father.Somehow, despite the racial divisions on the team and in the community, the Titans win the first game.  Now it will be a battle to win all the games and the State Championship, a ridiculous expectation, given the divided community.  But, see, this is an opportunity for the various players to bury their animosities and pull for the common good.Meanwhile, a blonde army brat with a perfect quarterback throwing arm arrives to join the team.  He's from California, has long hair, no race attitudes, and he looks like Kris Kristofferson before he was 35, but after Kristofferson's right and left jawbones were surgically broken to give him that high cheekbone look. Oh yaeh, while the girls look on from a window at the school, the California \"hippy\" practices Zen on the lawn.  Coach Washington has reservations. The Quarterback Adonis is given a minor haircut that only makes him look even more appealing. Then there is also a LeVar-Burton-like black guy who starts to show Coach Patton what a winner he is on defense.The two coaches have an uneasy truce.  Eventually, an effort is made to have the daughters of the two men play together.  Another uneasy stand-off. Washington's daughter plays with dolls.  Patton's daughter wants to shoot some hoops.The Titans roll through a series of games, each of which presents a new set of obstacles for the Titans, and especially Coach Patton.  Each opposing team has a White Cracker Coach, and typically there is another conspiracy to put Coach Patton back in charge of the Titans if he will only accept complicity in the plot against Coach Denzel Washington.  But Patton resists these overtures and the Titans winning streak continues.By now, the film is playing race cards as a substitute for drama.  The little playlets always end with a moral that is at least some way toward a position for racial harmony. And sometimes you get the feeling this movie is made with a moral cookie-cutter.But by two thirds of the way through the movie, each Coach begins to develop some respect for the others coaching abilities.  There is a racial incident when Patton's daughter is endangered after someone throws a brick through \"Coach Coon's\" window while the two daughters are playing.  One coach contributes a set of plays that vastly improves the chances of the team.  The two rival Coaches bond, smile, occasionally slap one another on the back.Now the movie is starting to roll.  It is no longer necessary to balance every race incident that makes the whites look good, with another incident that makes the blacks look good.  The players are starting to pull together.  The soundtrack is staging a battle of musical tastes since the first practices at the religious college.  The black players try to bug the whites by singing Motown harmonies.  But eventually we are hearing the best of Cat Stevens and other white Seventies Music to help balance the musical equation.  The Team astounds by doing a Don Cornelius Soul Train Pimp Roll onto the field at the beginning of each game. Its as if this movie has collided with the cheer-leading Bring It On.You can guess where this is all headed.  To the Big Game.  This time there is no problem with crooked officiating.  The other team and its coach are not riddled with the varieties of cracker corruption we have seen from coaches and teams up to now.  The Titans are going to have to pull together despite their problems, because this time they are facing a real team with no particularly grating stereotypes.I was fairly disappointed  with the films efforts to strike its own racial balance. The way to get the movie mechanism working is to get Coach Patton to relax and smile.  When the film does that, the audience relaxes too. As it does, Remember the Titans gets good.  And when it does it becomes, uh.., memorable.Finally, there is the inevitable postscript.  Ten years later the Titans gather at the funeral of one among them who has fallen. The roughly 28 year old actors playing these roles need only don suits, mustaches and slightly different hairstyles to play their real ages for the funeral scene.  Meanwhile, the two little girls have been replaced by older actresses and Washington and Patton look exactly as they did earlier.Of course, this story was based on a real high school team.  The mandatory short profiles of Team members reveal that most of the white guys go on to professional careers.  Despite euphemisms, the heroic black players spend their working years in menial jobs, mostly around the old home town.  Its amazing the filmmakers risked letting old eternal truths like that one break through.",

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" reminds us that fear is the only thing standing in the way of a society not divided across racial lines. We fear those who are different than us. We tend to reject what we don't understand.The film is about the redistricting and forced integration of two high schools in Virginia in 1971. An all-white football team that has had great success its past few seasons must now give up parts of its roster to players from the school it's merging with-who just happen to be all black. The white players have played under coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is a nominee for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame. The school's athletic board, believing they can prove that integration is a bad idea, brings in Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man, to replace him as head coach. They'll then sit and wait through training camp until Boone's team loses a game, then fire him. Yoast unexpectedly stays on as Boone's defensive coordinator, however, and they head for camp. Understandably, the white players have difficulty with the situation. They feel, justifiably, that their team was just fine the way it was. They know each other. They were winning.Another great point that Titans makes is that sometimes winning is not important. Coach Boone wants to win but, like all great coaches, he won't deny any kid who wants it the chance to compete and contribute. He designs the two-week training camp to force the boys to get to know each other. Like it or not, this is our team, is what he's saying to them. `I don't care if you like each other,' he tells them, `but you will respect each other.' At first, it looks like they'll do neither. Boone forces them to room with someone they don't know, which usually ends up being someone of a different race.  But this is a Disney movie and heck, a true story, so they do learn to respect each other. Then they learn to like each other. The result is a powerful, almost unstoppable high school football team.The players return to the real world to find that many of the citizens of Alexandria, the school's town, could have stood to go to Boone's camp themselves. The players overcome their first obstacle, their own fear. Now their new friendships will be put to the test by a backward society that hasn't had the benefit of the intensive bonding experience they just had. Some simply fear the team won't be as good as it was. This fear is quickly diminished. For some, though, it's just plain bigotry. Win or lose, they won't accept a group of black and white boys playing together as a team.Not only did this film come from the Mouse House, but it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production. This strange combination has created a gritty film that's still family-friendly. Basically, they were trying to please everyone, young and old, male and female. For the most part, they succeed. Still, the Disney/Bruckheimer factor does hurt it in many ways. The singing and dancing for instance, even if it did really happen, should have been left out. It makes nice footage to put in a trailer, but when inserted into the actual film, it ruins the overall tone. What hurts most though, is that there was no hope of giving it the ending it really needed, namely the Titans losing.Okay, I know it's a true story. But T.C. Williams was not the only high school that was created by forced integration. A bolder move would have been choosing a different such school, one whos football team wasn't all that successful. Really, the Titans go undefeated. For one thing, from a sports perspective, what fun is that? But most importantly, the dream season they had begs the question: what if they'd lost a game or two? Or three? How would the town have felt about integration then? If the once-intolerant community still comes together across racial lines, it would mean more. All the film really shows is that that Alexandria is willing to accept integration--as long as the team remains as successful as it has been. What's worse is the film's tagline: `History is written by the winners.' What, exactly, is this supposed to mean?Still, I recommend \"Remember the Titans\" ends up because it ends up being a pretty darn good sports movie. And even though its message could have been communicated even more powerfully, the film is more honest about the relationships between blacks and whites than maybe any other mass-market movie has been. Washington is great as usual, but the real stars are the young actors who play the Titans.Grade: B",

I also attend TC Williams (which looks nothing like the school featured in the film, and is in actuality one of the most culturally diverse schools in the US) and I met many of the players from the successful 1971 team at a school assembly around six months before the films release - it was not racial black-white tension as exaggerated in the film, but more of a long standing rivalry between the two city high schools, Francis Hammond and George Washington High Schools (which are both now Middle Schools) that caused issues in the team at the start of the season.",

Williams (Titans) and we played them regularly in every sport (including track, which was my sport). I have personal knowledge of the events in that film. First of all, the idea that T. C. Williams had just been integrated is incorrect. Schools in the area had been integrated for 15 years. By 1971, it was routine to have blacks and whites in the same school. Come look at my yearbooks and I'll show you. What happened at T. C. Williams was this: the Alexandria school system decided to change the status of three schools..........Hammond HS, George Washington HS, and T. C. Williams HS. Hammond was reduced to a junior high, and its students were sent to Williams. GW was closed and its students were sent to Williams. Everyone in the ENTIRE AREA knew that Alexandria had just created a super sports school and it was true. With the best athletes from three schools combined into one, there was no beating T. C. Williams. We played them in football that year and they beat us about 49-0, but it sure as hell had nothing to do with integrating a school and everything about creating a super school. Next, the idea that Alexandria was a small, backward town with rampant racial prejudice is laughable. Alexandria is a MAJOR suburb of Washington, DC. You can stand in Alexandria, look across the Potomac River, and see the Washington Monument, Capitol Hill, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, etc. It was and is a rich suburb of DC, and racial prejudice was about as far from being mainstream as I am from marrying Miss America. In my school, the white kids were afraid of the black kids. We didn't initiate fights, we tried hard to avoid them, but sometimes they were forced upon us by angry groups of students who roamed the halls and you sure as hell better look out if you didn't cringe to the side and let them pass. There is one scene in the movie where a white football coach calls the T. C. Williams coach a \"monkey\" on local TV. Good Lord.........that sort of thing would NEVER have been put on a Washington, DC sports channel and that is where ALL the channels received in northern Virginia originated (with the exception of channel 20 which had no news at that time). The people who made this movie had an agenda. I know the facts. I was there. I ran track in that T. C. Williams stadium and they beat the hell out of us because they were a super school. It is both sad and annoying that people will watch this movie and believe that how things are portrayed is actually how they were. They absolutely were not!",

In order to keep the peace, Yoast stays to coach defense.It's a fairly standard superficial look at a segregated system being forced together. The best thing in this movie is the duo of Will Patton and Denzel Washington. They do the heaviest lifting acting-wise. They have to act through a minefield especially Denzel. He can't look arrogant but also can't be a saint. He is aggressive and not the most likable character at the start. Will Patton's character is much more the saint in this movie. The players each have limited roles. Ryan Hurst has the leading role among the players and he provides a suitable performance. It is fascinating to see a baby faced Ryan Gosling, and I didn't even realized that Hayden Panettiere played the young loud coach's daughter.I guess based-on-true-story limits the writing in the movie. However, this is like somebody copied all the stereotypical story lines from other sports-race movies. It isn't very deep, and all the big ideas are touched upon. Every scene is about how race is affecting this school. While the coaches get proper time, the kids are too numerous to get enough space. They need to remember the teens.",

            "content": "This is a corny but still moving story of a football team becoming integrated in 1971, with the whites led by Will Patton and the blacks led by Denzel Washington. I know \"blacks\" and \"whites\" are obsolete terms but that's the way the movie pitches them.The performances are pretty good. Denzel Washington is always reliable and Will Patton has done some superb turns on film. He was my supporting player in one of his lesser efforts, \"Everybody Wins.\" The team members vary in chops, with some better than others, but nobody torpedoes the film, not even the lovable and pathetic football player with the build of a sumo wrestler, the kid so fat he can be seen from outer space.The movie more or less divides itself into two halves. I found the first half more interesting than the second. The first half deals with bringing two mutually antagonistic groups together. The second half, a moral vacuum, deals with winning the Pan-Tidewater and Okefenokee High School Championship or something, and not an opportunity to stir the rabid enthusiasm of the crowd or to milk a tear out of the audience is missed.It's hard to believe that the philosopher William James once described sports as \"the moral equivalent of war.\" You know -- get that pent up anger out of your system in a peaceful and rule-bound manner? I don't think he'd make that argument today, not with riots so common after soccer games that England banned them, and not with a dispute over soccer -- what IS it about soccer? -- having provided a trigger for the so-called Football War between El Salvador and Guatamala. Three thousand people died.I don't want to get too far off the gridiron here but let me add that Denzel Washington is the first black coach of the Titans, the high school football team, most of whose members look old enough to have been held back for four or five years. How does Washington run the team? Like Marine Corps boot camp, right out of \"Full Metal Jacket.\" He's a real hard-ass. Color means nothing to him. He's pitiless. And his ruthlessness lends the story some meaning. Let me introduce some experimental evidence for that claim.(1) The famous \"Robber's Cave Experiment\" by Muzafer Sheriff. Sheriff brought together two antagonistic groups of matched twelve-year-old boys, gangs that had been labeled the Eagles and the Rattlers. They hated each other. Then they were both faced with a difficult task that could only be achieved by cooperation. Sheriff called it a \"superordinate goal.\" It resolved the antagonism. I'm simplifying this but it's easily Googled. And I refer you to Ronald Reagan's musing that if the earth were invaded by UFOs it would draw the disputatious nations of the world together. (2) A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills that demonstrated that the tougher the initiation rite, the more group loyalty you get. By browbeating them so mercilessly Washington enhanced the solidarity of the Low-Country and Panhandle Titans, blacks and whites together. Basic training aims at the same end, and the harder the training, the greater the loyalty. Just being in the Armed Forces is not enough. You have to have your butt kicked. It's why you sometimes hear, \"Once a Marine, always a Marine,\" but never, \"Once a Coast Guardsman, always a Coast Guardsman.\" There's an element missing from the story, though. We see a lot of white antagonism towards blacks but very little in the way of black solidarity. Many African-Americans have built a wall around themselves and punish each other for associating too closely with white people. A hint of that reality would have turned this into an edgy adult movie instead of something that resembles a Hallmark special.The direction is okay. The football scenes are exciting and every impact of shield-clad body with shield-clad body is accompanied by an explosive WHOMP on the sound track. The same effect is applied recklessly to a football pass landing in a runner's arms. The musical score is loud and signals with reasonable precision exactly what emotion is expected of you during a given scene.",

Indeed, I found many things to like about this film, from the performances (especially the criminally overlooked Will Patton, one of the great character actors of our time), the great use of period music, the pro-integration sentiment, the comraderie between the players, even the inevitable cliffhanger game climax.  Of course, the entire film is held together by the incredible presence of Denzel Washington, who along with Morgan Freeman, has to rank as the finest film actor working today.  In all, \"Remember the Titans\" is a winner and I would recommend it to anyone.  Oh, and I cannot remember the last time I saw a movie with an African-American star that deals primarily with race relations in which there was not a single non-white person in the audience.

Seemed to me that he (Denzel) was younger than the character and that they tried to make him (not the family though) seem older. I played southern high school football and on many afternoons (offseason) found myself the only white guy in the school weight room and not having to sing blues or behave such. But Hollywood, this movie as an example, keep making it like the Black way of doing things is the THE way of doing things and it's not. But the wave of that thinking (brainwashing?) has swept over the US for the last twenty years and this movie is just reflection that nothing before Brown vs. Board of Education mattered except the oppression of the Africans. I wish we could just get the over this idea of racism as an emotion or state of mind by and of itself. Racism is a reaction, a defensive, protective attitude just as prejudgice is one's survival mode kicking in and trying to preserve ones state of being. Of course we know where the southern anglo state of being is going these days. This movie did a so so job of showing that Blacks are just as racists as Whites, it mostly showed them as being the better people and teaching and guiding the White folks toward correctness, except for a few token places like the white coach suggesting the winning play.The way the Titans went onto the field for their games was a joke too. They would have been the laughing stock of the state. It looked silly and only a bunch of queers would do that. If they entered the game this way they surely must have cracked up their opponents and/or made them not take them seriously.",

            "content": "Set during the turbulent years of the civil rights era, this film centers around a new black football coach by the name of \"Herman Boone\" (Denzel Washington) being hired to take over a high school team that was predominantly white until a court order implemented the merger with a nearby black high school. This hiring, coupled with the fact that their existing white coach named \"Bill Yoast\" (Will Patton) was highly regarded, fueled racial fears unparalleled in that particular area of Virginia which not even a winning record could totally alleviate. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this film was entertaining to a certain degree, there were susbstantial historical inaccuracies which were rather difficult to ignore. For starters, Coach Herman Boone didn't take a team that was in extreme disarray and build it into a powerhouse by his sheer ingenuity or charisma. Far from it, as many of his own players and staff were highly critical of his coaching style which they believed was unnecessarily cruel and abusive. Likewise, there are several other blatant distortions which can easily be ascertained if the viewer chooses to do so. But all of that aside, the fact remains that Herman Boone was a very successful coach and his overall record proves that point. Additionally, most of us will never know the pressure he had to go through-especially during this particular time in history. I just wish Hollywood hadn't taken so many liberties with the truth. That being said, while it may not justify the \"based on a true story\" advertisement, it was still an enjoyable film for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

Title refers to reflection upon something great, which isn't this film. The theme is racism where two schools will blend the whites and the blacks and the community is hostile towards it. Denzel Washington moves into the community from North Carolina to coach football. Numerous players threaten to quit because their current coach may be leaving. Predictable elements occur such as fights over race as well as Washington winning everybody over and gaining respect. Directed by Boaz Yakin who, despite having the true story element, does not have a screenplay that inspires anything but sympathy. Washington is a tremendous actor but he is basically wading through clich\u00e9s and story structure done a hundred times over. That means that he is merely reciting what others having done either better or worse than him. Flat supporting roles by Will Patton, Ryan Hurst and Kip Pardue, and a host of other actors who are led to believe that this sh*t is special because it is a sports film starring Denzel. Patton in particular plays that uptight coach uneasily impressed. Strong themes of sportsmanship, friendship, endurance, honor, exposing racism, and Xeroxed storytelling. Score: 3 / 10",

Now, lets start from the beginning, another film about interracial, or prejudicial/bigotry issues between players on a team (played out to death in modern American movies). I can think of countless examples; Coach Carter, School Ties, Radio, Rudy, Varsity Blues, The Program, and...yes, the list of mediocrity continues, but I'll cut it short! You see, I'm not really into sports, but that isn't why I dislike this film so strongly. My reason is that the whole racial issues aspect is a little out-played/out-dated, the acting-lazy, and the film as a whole, rather corny and pretentious, with a lingering air of belligerence and predictability. The little girl (Sheryl) played by Hayden Panettiere as Coach Bill's outspoken daughter was absolutely unrealistic and obnoxious. She was loud, boyish, and downright rude at times. Her father deserved a slap in the face for raising such brash, insensitive little child. She reminded me of a lesbian version of Rhoda from the Bad Seed (1956). The lead character Coach Herman (Denzel Washigton) had no character-development and was at times overly dramatic, rash, and had an exaggerated confidence that destroyed the intended character. I also found the film to be very mediocre, and if that wasn't bad enough, sexist as well. Yes, I know, the film is about men on a football team, but the women characters that were present (rare), like the wives and girl friends, were plain, waif-like and generic. They mostly had one-liner dialog and scenes that lasted literally seconds. So if you appreciate not-so-predictable, fresh and more captivating entertainment and history told as it is without the commercial addition of crude jokes and bad characters, skip this film.

            "content": "Finally - a reason to boycott Disney that actually makes sense.  As I hunkered down to watch the DVD version of `Remember the Titans' - a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a diet soda in the other - what did I discover, to my amazement and horror, but that there was NO widescreen edition of the film anywhere to be found on the disc!  As a lover of movers, I long ago made a pact with myself that I would try to watch every movie in its purest possible form and that includes seeing it with its original theatrical ratio in tact.  What good is watching a movie when up to half its original picture is missing?  That is why I love DVD so much.  It almost always provides us with that option.  Watching a film that has been panned-and-scanned to fit the requirements of a square TV screen is as anathema to me as watching a film spliced-and-diced to meet `broadcast standards' or to make room for oodles of mind-numbing commercials selling products you wouldn't want even if they were given to you free of charge.   All this is prelude to saying that the review you will be reading from here on out is based on at best 90% of the movie that was shown in theatres around the country (and that's a conservative estimate).  Yes, I know there is a widescreen DVD version of the film on the market.  My point is trying to fathom why Disney feels the need to separate its full and wide screen editions when many of us may not have access to both, since we often find ourselves at the mercy of numbskull video storeowners who wouldn't know a jump cut from a freeze frame if their lives depended on it.  Furthermore, once a person gets home with a video, how many of us are going to want to go through the hassle of returning to the store to pick up the widescreen version?  Get a clue, Disney! `Remember the Titans' is a near-perfect film for young people to see.  Not only does it open their eyes to just how recently - a mere 30 years ago - blatant institutionalized racism was woven into the fabric of many segments of American society, but the film shows them just how far we've come in rectifying that situation in a very short while.  Stylistically, `Remember the Titans' emerges as an effective distillation of two sure-fire popular genres:  the inspirational true-life sports story and the inspirational consciousness-raising racial drama.  Although the more cynical among us may feel a bit `inspirationed' out by the time the film's closing credits go rolling by, the rest of us will probably find ourselves dewy-eyed and emotionally uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, `Remember the Titans' takes us back to the year 1971 when a high school in Alexandria, Virginia - like schools all over the South - was just beginning to cope with the hot button, highly emotional issue of court ordered desegregation.  Into this hornet's nest of bigotry and rancor steps Herman Boone, a black football coach, hired to replace Bill Yoast, a top-notch coach who has led his team to no fewer than 15 championship seasons.  Credit `Remember the Titans' for tackling this issue in a unique way.  By acknowledging the unfairness done to Yoast (ironically, in the name of `fairness'), the film makes the reaction of some of the whites at least  comprehensible.  Few films of this type seem willing to delve into the moral complexity surrounding the sensitive issue of racism and choose instead to paint their characters literally as well as figuratively in black-and-white terms.  `Remember the Titans' doesn't do that.  We are allowed to see the issue from the white people's view as well - and to understand a bit where  they too are coming from.  Indeed, the basic theme of `Remember the Titans' is that anyone can change, given the proper chance and the set of circumstances necessary to bring it about. It is with this set of circumstances that `Remember the Titans' most concerns itself, as it chronicles the gradual but inexorable change that takes place not only in the individuals involved but in the community as a whole.  The amazing thing, too, is that `Remember the Titans' manages to do all this without resorting to the use of a single four-letter expletive - an accomplishment that is not only rare in this day and age:  it is positively unique!  This, along with the salutary theme, makes `Remember the Titans' ideal viewing for schools and youth groups as well.  Director Boaz Yakin and writer Gregory Allen Howard are to be commended for crafting a film that is believable, fast moving and emotionally powerful all at the same time.  The actors are all superb in their various roles, with Denzel Washington, as always, serving as the solid center holding the whole project in place. `Remember the Titans' could be dismissed as just another clich\u00e9-ridden, feel-good film designed to appease a smug, self-congratulatory liberal audience, making them feel superior by confirming their own goodness.  If it is such a film, so be it.  When a reminder of our common humanity comes along that is as good as `Remember the Titans,' the cynics will just have to be content to sit this one out and bitch from the sidelines.",

It taught me, and I'm sure it can teach a great deal of other people, to look at black people in a different way and realize that they are really not different from us at all.",

            "content": "We seem to have set a similar standard for sports movies these days.  A team in doubt gets a new coach, and suddenly their self confidence is boosted. The players go on to win a few games and advance to the finals.  You see the tension when they off on the wrong foot, but in the end, they always win. Thankfully, this is not the case Remember the Titans.  Well, maybe a little.Titans, a Jerry Bruckheimer production, is the true story of African-American high school football coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), who had to build a football team from the roots of racism. Boone's first inference is that half his players are white, and the other half black.  The players, ignorant to the other kind, refuse to even cooperate with each other.  This sends Herman Boone, along with Assistant coach Yoast (Will Patton), on a mission to force his players to get along. Through extensive exercising, and a lot of prep-talk, Boone manages to create one talented -- and most importantly \u0096- colorless team.What separates this film, from most sports movies, is has less to do with football, and much ado with the ignorant community.  The locals cannot even begin to understand how two opposing races can work together.  Ignorance from the white residents tries to dissolve that black coach they've heard about, and prevent their kids from playing with those `monkeys.'All this works well with the actors, though young and inexperienced, give fantastic performances.  However, the movie falls short of great with it's questionable dialogue (`Who's your daddy?' asks Coach Boone) and the failed attempt to make a story out of the coach, and assistant coaches daughters. Yoast's daughter Sheryl, a tom boy, disrupts the screen with her annoying yelling and dull character.  Another flaw would be the unsatisfying film work on the field.  Director Boaz Yakin game action is too simplistic, offering nothing new, and nothing surprising.Washington, as always, is great.  His charisma plays well with the audience. Overall, this film works great with Disney, and is well worth a trip to the theatre.* * * 1/2 out of 5",

            "content": "The person who assigns parts to actors always has a very important job, but his choices can become crucial in the case of a movie involving a sport. Miscasting in this kind of movie can subject some performers to ridicule and doom even the most thoughtful and well written story to mediocrity. In a story about a singer/musician, for example, the woman selected to play the part of the entertainer can learn the lyrics to various songs, sway and smile, engage an audience, move her mouth and her hands. She does not have to truly sing or play an instrument. Similarly, a man chosen to play the part of a United States president or well-known foreign leader can prepare by learning the significant events that took place during the ruler's reign, study his idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, and memorize important speeches - almost a natural task for an actor. He does not have to have ever held a government post as a prerequisite.I don't mean to imply that an actor with only community theater experience could easily play one of the above parts in a major motion picture, or that a person awarded for his performance in one of these roles would not deserve the recognition. The person who portrays an athlete might in some ways, in fact, have a less challenging job. But unlike the actor who plays the part of an entertainer or a politician (or who portrays a doctor, a priest, a teacher, a criminal, a soldier, a pilot, an explorer, or a lawyer, for that matter), the one who plays the part of an athlete has definite limits with respect to what he can pretend. He can't fake agility, coordination, a comfortable running style, a natural throwing motion or catching form; he must demonstrate skills beyond his acting.Remember The Titans moved and inspired me (despite a few scenes and some dialog that sort of manipulate a viewer's feelings) partly because the young men playing members of that football team not only swaggered, jostled, bantered, and jived like high school athletes, they also played like them. This movie benefits from equally impressive performances from the adults. Denzel Washington did a commendable job as Herman Boone, the demanding, domineering, yet fair head football coach, and Will Patton did tremendous work as the demoted head coach Bill Yoast, the mentor with the softer approach and rather folksy style, who must deal with the immaturity of his bigoted friends as well as his tendency to patronize the African American members of the team.",

            "content": "I may not be what one would call a dyed-in-the-wool sports buff, but football, combined with mandatory school integration in the South of thirty years ago, sounds like it would make for a pretty confrontational picture. Instead, Remember the Titans gives us a paint-by-numbers cast of goody goods, villainous townspeople and teary-eyed, reformed-overnight racists who suddenly \"see the light\" in time with appropriately swelling musical accompaniment. And of course there's one guy in the hospital watching the final Big Game on television as the others play their hearts out for him: I'm not kidding, it's that cliche. It was unintentionally funny when, near the end, one of the characters said \"Is this really about football anyway?\"\nI believe I was looking to Denzel, as the football coach with everything to prove in this one season, to anchor the film a little more forcefully -- the kind of charismatic individual who could bring the warring factors of a newly integrated high school football team together with dramatic, yet plausible energy. Alas, he's a cypher, lost somewhere in the middle of a plot that's on Automatic Pilot anyway -- suddenly Christopher Plummer's character in The Sound of Music looks decisive.  Funny coincidence is, while I was waiting for Titans to start, I went over to the next auditorium where Men of Honor was playing and watched that for a few minutes. Men of Honor is a film about mandatory integration of the military; I won't know til I see the whole thing whether it's a good movie or not, but I can say safely that there's a lot more material to be explored within that topic than in the relatively \"safe controversy\" and easy targets at which Remember the Titans is aiming.",

All I knew was it had Denzil Washington in it, so it might be OK. The first few seconds the music started, put a chill down my spine. Movies with an excellent score (lord of the rings trilogy, brave-heart, titanic, last of the Mohican's, etc) they help the movie be even better. I knew I had heard the music before, but had no idea, maybe when I was channel hopping or something. Anyway, back to the movie. We were taken away from our work for a couple of hours because our team had really come together for a few hard months, and won a quarter at work so we were rewarded with a couple of hours off... so Kudos to \"CitiBank\" for that:) But its a team building movie. Denzil Washington was amazing as usual, Will Patton, excellent, and all the young talent. Everyone was so incredible. There were times the movie was so... moving.. tears welled up in my eyes, and it wasn't even the sad part in the movie. Overall... best movie I have seen in a long long time.

            "content": "A lot of times, when it comes to films about racial topics or filled with such themes, there is tendency--especially of late--to \"tell it like it is\", or favor the depressing (if more truthful) angles over the more aspirational ones. Yet, I believe there is still a place for a film that leans in the opposite direction (aspiration over reality), and \"Remember the Titans\" is easily one of the best of that bunch.For a basic plot summary, \"Remember The Titans\" is loosely based on the story of Virginia public school TC-Williams going through the integration process in the early 1970s. When legendary white coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is replaced by black newcomer Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), the entire football program (and school in general) is thrown into the type of turmoil that integration would usually produce. At first, All-American defenseman Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) refuses to play with his new black teammates. Helped along by the tenacity and shrewdness of Coach Boone, as well as a friendship with new player Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), Bertier and all his teammates face the choice of either coming together or having the whole program fall apart.Clearly, the racial themes in this film are what drive the primary emotions derived from it. What never ceases to amaze me about \"Titans\", however, is that it comes out of the gate so strong but then just never quits building. Somewhat remarkably, many (most?) of the film's iconic scenes are within the first 20-30 minutes. It would have been so easy for this film to peak too early, but the filmmakers (including director Boaz Yakin) craft an airtight script/story that never drags or stagnates. Something is always happening (whether on the field or off it) that gives the viewer something to marvel at or mentally ponder.Only helping matters is \"Titans\" being one of the most well-cast films ever created. Washington is masterful as Coach Boone (the pivotal role in the film), but he is matched by the performances of the surrounding cast. Patton, Hurst, and Harris especially stand out, but are also joined by Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Kip Pardue, Kate Bosworth, and Ryan Gosling. A very young Hayden Panettiere even gets in on the acting greatness in a magnificent role. By the end of the picture, you will feel as if you are right in the stands cheering on the Titans, as the characters come so alive.Mention must also be given to the musical score, a combination of period pieces--a locker room rendition of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" is a treat--and incredible orchestration from Trevor Rabin. An emotional film like this needs a great soundtrack, and boy does it ever deliver.Overall, \"Remember The Titans\" is one of my favorite movies of all-time for its mix of drama, comedy, thematic weight, music, and well-developed characters. While certainly in the Disney vein of being saccharine and overly dramatic, it just does everything so well that it is the perfect aspirational triumph. I honestly don't see how anyone can watch this masterpiece and not take something positive out of the experience!",

The entire cast play their roles to perfection; not one performance was unconvincing. Denzel as always is top-notch. Will Patton and the young guys on the football team deserve praise as well.  Titans isn't without its flaws, though. You'll never guess this, but the climactic scene involves the state championship game where the fate of the universe seems to hang in the balance. I found myself honestly hoping they would pull it off, which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for The Replacements. A theme prevalent throughout the film is racism. You'd never know it from the trailer, but the main obstacle in front of the Titans football team is the fact that they're the only school in the state to have been desegregated. This is dealt with incredibly well throughout the movie, conveying the feeling of pointless hate and prejudice without ever using the vaunted \"N word\". This is a movie you can bring Grandma Nugget to without fear of her collapsing at your feet due to strong content. Yeah, it looks like Jerry Bruckheimer isn't just an action film man anymore.

If you don't know the game they are too short to really give a feel of the game. If you do know the game, they are too short to be exciting, as you never actually can follow a game in the movie.Based on a true story, but nevertheless totally predictable, right up to the ending. Dull, dull, dull.Oh wait, there's a message; Don't judge anyone because of their colour. Well, the bible could probably tell you that.

It shows the struggles of a town to come to terms with its inter-racial beginnings.  Denzel gives his customary humorless performance.  He is never intense when he is supposed to be, and even when its time to celebrate or actually breathe, he can't seem to do that.  The only scene he seems to be giving anything to is one where the Titans beat a hated opposing coach who referred to him as a non-human - in this scene Denzel gets to give the guy a banana. Perhaps Denzel was uncomfortable with the subject matter, but its not like the script was going to be changed so everyone was holding hands from the start, right?Will Patton is worse.  He's THIS CLOSE to playing more psycho parts like he did in that Kevin Costner/Sean Young thriller that I can't remember the name of.  He whistles when he speaks and its annoying.The worse is his daughter, a nine-year old who thinks she should be coaching the team.  I loathe children in movies who act like they're 39 and she epitomizes that.  Too much is sugar-coated and too much is never even shown.  Also you never see any prejudice on the black side. I am sure there are blacks who are prejudiced against whites as well and were extremely vocal in their feelings about that.  No one's black mother is shown reluctant to meet her sons' new white friend. Why?  This is what I meant by 'Disney treatment' in the title..some things will never change as long as movies like this are never fair. The best actor is Wood Harris as Julius, followed by Ryan Hurst as Bertier and Kip Pardue as Sunshine.  This seems fitting, as the movie was about them anyway.  Harris has a great moment, when a cop car pulls up next to him. Guaranteed that's unfortunately happened to him much more than it should have, and for all the wrong reasons, but this time the police officer is congratulating him on a great game.  His look of shock combined with relief and genuine thanks is worth ninety other movies and says everything you need to know about this movie.  8/10.",

The supporting cast back him up well, allowing us to get a sense of the atmosphere that these young men faced and the struggle that they endured both on an off the field.It is these performances that facilitate the delivery of several strong emotional punches which will bring you to tears.Remember the Titans manages to find a decent balance between sports and the human side, bringing both together nicely. As a result the pacing felt quite natural, even if it does feel a tad longer than its one hour fifty runtime.Overall this film delivers a powerful message in a thoughtful way, with a solid performance from Washington and the supporting cast, leaving you to ponder the nature of humanity and power of sports.",

            "review_title": "Centuries of racial divide overcome in 90 minutes - Disney style...",
            "content": "First things first, this is a Disney movie, so you know a few things before the movie even start:There will be no profanity or particularly offensive remarks, (even though this is an historically accurate race relations movie). - Even if they don't win, gosh darn it will they try. - Everyone will learn a lesson and be a better person for the experience.So, it's 1971, and in attempts to ease touchy race relations two Virginian schools are integrated, by force. And as a concession to the black population Coach Boon, a black coach with less experience than the white coach Yoast is given the head jo\u0085 role.This leads to much unrest, some garden variety rioting and a rift between the black and white students. Coach Boone, (Denzel Washington) immediately sets parameters, he will not play favourites, and insists it don't matter if you're black or white, he'll play you if you're any good.Initially Coach Yoast resents the implication that he is a lesser coach, but when the white players all decide to compromise their future by sitting out the season in protest, he decides to hang around for the year in an assistant's role. Coach Boone welcomes him and allows him to coach the defensive team, while he takes the offense.Training camp is pre-school year, whites are roomed with blacks, and the players are only segregated by position. This being the early 70s in the South of America, white folks bait the black guys constantly, and the black guys often take the bait.(Now, this being a Disney movie, matters of race must be handled very carefully, and the latter parts of training camp are sickly sweet, with blacks and whites almost unanimously setting aside years of negative conditioning to go arm in arm. I realize that the acceptance came, just not in a two day period. This being a movie, one must accept this and move on.Oh, and the white guys are almost always the instigators, they are shifty, resentful and spiteful, while the blacks are cool, suave and laid back. Just pointing out that in attempts to appear not racist sometimes the filmmakers hedge in the PC side.)Anyway the team bonds and everyone is buddies, a quarterback transfer shows up with hippie hair looking a lot like a trailer trash Juliette Lewis - which in my mind is the everyday Juliette Lewis.They get back home to find that America still don't understand racial unity, but they stick together anyway, and the season starts off well, until factions and selfishness begins to emerge.Again being a PG learning movie this is sorted out pretty quickly, then the Rich White Guys step in, they aren't happy with the arrangement and try to rig the system so that Coach Boone can get ousted.Anyway of course things go as they do in sports movies, the team gets all the way to the finals and\u0085 you can work it out for yourself.I learned a few more things myself by the end of the movie:Ethan Suplee, Randy from My Name is Earl was once wayyyy fatter than he has been in recent years, and he is still very fat now.Only a Disney movie can have a \"spunky\" 9 year old girl, who calls her own Dad \"Coach\", give him the vital tip at the pointy end of the big game.Every sports movie has many montages of two types, the \"Oh no we're losing\" montage where everything goes wrong: and the \"Oh man we can't lose\" montage were everything works.Apparently the 9 year old girl is now a fairly famous actress from Heroes, though she overacts like a mofo in this, she is rude, annoying and more opinionated than any 9 year old should be, or at least her Dad should have sorted her out. She deserves around a dozen backhanders in this one.Everyone learns a lesson, black or white, people grow and mature, and bonds are made that will never be broken. I keep telling ya it's a Disney movie, what did you expect? Cue much inter-racial hugging and tears.Final Rating \u2013 6.5 / 10. I once saw that NBA player Jason Terry watches this movie 50 times a year. While I must admire the message, I think he is easily pleased.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

            "review_title": "if one examines it at a subliminal angle, \"Remember the Titans\" is not as conventional as it may seem",
            "content": "I freely admit that the primary reason why I dislike so many motion pictures of the 21st century is because they are repetitive. They are predictable from start to finish. They are hackneyed and tiresome. They just do the same thing over and over again. But amongst all of those examples of reused themes and stories, there are a few individuals that stand out as not only passable, but even glorious and inspiring such as Boaz Yakin's conventional, but surprisingly moving \"Remember the Titans\": a film about the true story of the T.C. Williams football team that not only became one of the first integrated football teams in the nation, but the one that went on to become one of the best despite the ups and downs they had from the start.The movie stars Denzel Washington as Coach Herman Boone, who not only was hired to supervise the integrated team, but was promoted to head coach over Caucasian coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who had been the head coach for years prior. Boone and Yoast take the reluctantly integrated Titans under their wings and very slowly begin to transform them from racially divided groups into a unification that begins to inspire change in their southern town.Now, the plot and story of \"Remember the Titans\" is one that has been used over and over again and will be used again and again in the future. The story is entirely predictable. You know how it's going to start. You know how it's going to end. You can even make some pretty accurate guesses about what's going to happen in the middle. But what really surprised me was what an involved film came out of all of this convention. Director Boaz Yakin is due enormous credit for this as are the writers, but the primary thrust behind the hand of \"Remember the Titans\" are the characters of the two coaches and the actors who portray them. Denzel Washington, one of the finest actors we have today, is hands-down brilliant as the school's first African American coach and Will Patton is also very good in the movie as well and their performances strengthen what the screenwriters did.The irony is that although the plot is conventional, if one examines certain aspects of the movie at a subliminal level, it's not as recycled as it may seem. A typical conventional football movie about integrated teams would have the white coach be a racist, perhaps due to change, perhaps not and the black coach a thoroughly perfect individual. But here, that's not the case. In fact, Washington's character is not all that noble and Patton's character not all that prejudicial. These men are portrayed as professionals, but also as human beings with strengths and flaws.Now in regards to the players themselves, there are some high points and some low points. The focus set on the team is a friendship between a white player (Ryan Hurst) and a black player (Wood Harris) and their struggle to convince the rest of the team and their families and school that people are people regardless of the color of their skin. Their story I found interesting if conventional. Another great touch was Coach Yoast's ten-year-old daughter who loves football as opposed to dolls. There was also a good subplot about an obese player and his strive to make it to college. But there are also some weak points and characters such as one in particular who backs out on his team at one point and the movie doesn't really center in on that moment the way it should have. And there were a lot of supporting characters that didn't strike with the impact that I think they were meant to be. Perhaps the filmmakers tried to include too much given that it's a true story.Despite the fact that it is conventional, perhaps too conventional for the tastes of some people, I was very enthralled and absorbed by \"Remember the Titans\" and the two stellar performances by Washington and Patton. The message of racism and the strive to dissolve it has been carried out better (and worse) in other films and here it plays its part just fine. It is a Disney movie, so it doesn't get carried away with itself, but rather just tries to communicate a good, inspiring message for the whole family, which is what a movie of this sort should do. It takes a certain genius to mold something inspirational out of a convention-packed formula, but Boaz Yakin has scored with \"Remember the Titans.\"",

            "content": "Predictable and sappy, Remember the Titans is memorable not for the story, which has been done, overdone and done again, but for the performances of some of the actors. Hayden Panettiere (the young daughter of the white coach) was incredible -- I find it difficult to believe that she's really that good at her age, so I have to attribute a lot of her performance to the director, Boaz Yakin. I'm ashamed that I don't know the name of the other performer who was absolutely outstanding -- the fat kid who finally got to go to college -- he did a super job. Denzel Washington also did a very good job with a part that was pretty much a cliche. In fact, my wife (who's in the business) mentioned that 'there is really something wrong' because Washington didn't win an Oscar for his performance. I think it's not because Mr. Washington is black, but because it's difficult to give an actor a major award for acting in such a sappy little movie. I was most disappointed in Will Patton, who I think is a very good actor (if you like his work, you must see The Paint Job!) At times it seemed to me that Mr. Patton was almost embarrassed by the dialog he had to utter, and his performance wasn't up to his previous appearances.The movie is just one cliche after another: a combination of racial (racist whites/noble blacks), regional (dumb, unethical Southerners) and sports (the team with the most heart always wins) stereotypes, and it gets very tiresome. The movie is said to be \"BASED on a true story,\" but it's obvious that the writer took some pretty large liberties with the truth. Sort of like Titanic being \"based on true events\"; yes the boat did sink, but...But all in all, it was an enjoyable movie -- not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination -- but a nice, enjoyable little movie nonetheless, with some uncommonly good acting from a couple of people.",

I went to little hamlets all over the state and was part of the ritual that was (probably still is) high school football in the South.  REMEMBER THE TITANS did a credible job of bringing back much of that.(Old Official's quibble - Don't know if it is allowed now, but at that time in high school football a player could not advance a fumble.  That was one of the differences between the high school and the professional rules.)Football was an equalizer that literally allowed black students to compete on an equal playing field with white players.  That was good for both, something that comes through pretty well in the movie.Overall, the movie is schmaltzy with more feel good thrown in than one encounters in real life.  (Especially noteworthy is the  score that crescendoes at moving moments for those too dense in the audience to get it on their own.)

Although there is some amount of liberties taken with characters and events, the essence is true. It was a historic event that took place w/o the notice of most of the rest of the country. So much courage displayed by all those young men on the team as well as their coaches.The film is so well done, thank God. It would have been a shame for one more amazing true event to be despoiled by a poor script and film translation (aka - Cameron's silly, sentimental \"Titanic\". Real life and destiny provided more amazing and profound stories that would have riveted us all to the screen and perhaps taught us something. Cameron goes for lowest common denominator, overworking special effects and writing the most superficial story that had been done a million times before and far better. Plus poor direction of some very talented actors made it all the more boring.) None of that can be said about Titans. Story, direction, editing, acting, cinematography, music are all so well done. But indeed the film rests on the telling of the tale and the performers.Denzel is at his best in one more over-looked Oscar-winning caliber portrayal. Also excellent in far more than support is Will Patton as Bill Yoast. Patton is a terrific actor who always turns in an excellent performance regardless of the role (from great films like \"No Way Out\" to duds like \"The Postman\".) The cast of the youthful actors on the team round out the depth of the tale and bring us a variety of characters that are both entertaining and deeply moving. The friendship that develops between Gary Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) becomes the heart and soul of the film. These young actors in particular carry much of the film through their honest and intimate portrayal. This is another cast where all turn in terrific performances from the leads to the minor roles.

However it is Washington that pulls the film across in his powerhouse performance as the head coach. I liked the dialogue, especially when Washington is saying the lines.

Coach Boone (Washington) is politically appointed to coach the team in place of coach Yoast (Patton). They have the work cut out for them, as they have to bring the two societies of black and white communities to work together as a team. To complicate matters, the coaches don't really trust each other either. To bring the team together, all the players go to training camp were they're forced to live and work together. But problems arise again when the team come back to town, and the ordinary life begins again and the divided community try to tear the team apart. However, they are successful on the field and for every game they win, they come closer to the championship.This is an entertaining movie about an important topic. It is really great to see that a movie can show an important, and still current, issue and still be entertaining. This is mostly due to a nice plot and story, well thought through, that don't shy away from hard interesting situations and the very good performances from the entire cast. Both Washington and Patton is great as the coaches and the team is good as well, especially Hurst and Harris. Another part that makes the story very good is that there is time for individual development in the characters, and there are a lot of interesting characters in and around the team. The use of music is also very good, both the music in the movie and that from \"outside\". All in all, interesting cast, good acting, story and directing and an interesting topic. Very good.8/10",

(I didn't see any, but the action was all in extreme close up; I didn't see anything much.)  Does one score by simply placing the ball on the other side of one of those lines?  Must one PLACE it over the line?  Is throwing allowed?  Is kicking?  What's the difference between those who play \"offence\" and those how play \"defence\"?  And as for tackling - when is it allowed, when is it forbidden?  What does it achieve, anyway?  Are there penalties for fouls?  What form do they take?  Who's winning?  How can you tell?  What the HELL is going on?And you know, it's truly amazing how little my ignorance mattered.  They may as well have been playing some now lost Babylonian game - although such a game would probably be more comprehensible to the average modern viewer - for all the sense it made, but for once I didn't care.  This is the kind of film that gives slickly made, manipulative, fascist sentimentality a good name.  I loved it - even though I meant it when I said \"fascist\".  If the football camp failed to look like something Mussolini might have designed, that's just because the Italians were much more laid back.  (I suspect even the Hitler Youth were more laid back.)  But, well, you know ... there was all that stuff about crossing racial barriers, so somehow the nastier elements of the story didn't seem to matter such a great deal.  I suppose it's because the film, more than most of its kind, was willing to acknowledge the underside.  Boone got his job by unfair means.  He was brutal and arrogant.  He won the adolescents to his side by methods that could easily, in another context, have made our blood run cold.  Yet because the film made no great effort to deny any of this, or to hide it, it didn't leave the sour taste it might have.  We were free to concentrate on Boone's one redeeming virtue: he was the only character who was unracist from the very beginning.  (Actually, he's much less of an actual character than half a dozen other people in the movie - he's more a symbol, a mechanism of change.  This is just as well.  I suspect it's another reason why his virtue weighs so heavily with us.)\"Cool Runnings\" is a far superior Disney sports film (more humane, less mechanical), but this one somehow leaves just as warm a glow.",

Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone, who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes \"Remember The Titans\" a real gem. However, the strength and real beauty of \"Remember The Titans\" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In \"Remember The Titans\" this young actress single handedly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.I hesitated to see \"Remember The Titans\" because I didn't want to see another football film, but it is more than just another football film.\"Remember The Titans\" is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film.",

Another two actors who impress in this film are Child star Hayen Panettire and Ryan Hurst. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary in this film , it is a film about winning while battling against nasty racist bigotry and is a little predictable in that respect but maybe that shows my prejudace by saying that.

We do not need a loud, swelling orchestra to tell us something should be sad. Also, a few too many songs are used, and the football action is not particularly well done.

            "content": "African-American football coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is appointed head coach of a Virginian high school team. His appointment initially causes friction as he is set to replace their current coach the highly respected and decorated coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). However, his appointment has farther reaching implications when Boone insists on integrating black and white members in to his team in a school and area that are deeply hostile towards black people...Remember The Titans is about as predictable as they come and it's fair to say that there are no real risks taken in the narrative (everything plays out more-or-less as you'd expect). However, it's a Disney film and its main purpose is to uplift and in this respect it achieves its goal.Denzel Washington is a key ingredient to the film's success; his performance here as firm, but fair coach Herman Boone was superb and some of his pep talks and speeches were very amusing. Whilst this is perhaps not Washington's best performance I would certainly put it up there as one of his best.Although the narrative is predictable, Remember The Titans is a very well-directed film. It's a well-paced film whereby the first half of the film sees the majority of the team harbouring animosity towards those of the opposite skin colour whilst a slow-burning bond also starts to develop amongst them as a unit. This in itself provides for some amusing exchanges (particularly in the way some of them overcome their natural prejudices). The second half of the film focuses more on the team's gradual ascent to the top in which they ultimately play that 'final game.' By this stage they have mostly overcome their differences and begin to focus on winning the Championship. In some ways the second half isn't quite as strong as it mostly focuses on the ball games for about an hour and sadly a rinse and repeat approach is mostly used (the only thing to separate them is that there seems to be incidents created involving different players). It's all still quite good, just a little less impacting than the first half.For what it is and what it does, Remember The Titans does work; it's uplifting, inspiring whilst also raising awareness on the pointlessness of bigotry and racial hatred (yes we've seen it all before, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded now and again). Remember The Titans is a message film so it's only natural that it gets a bit preachy (it does but thankfully not often and not in a way that it hurts the overall quality of the film). It's definitely worth a look particularly, if like me, you're a sucker for these type of films.",

It moves along very nicely and it has lots of great scenery; not to mention it's great cinematography.The cast did great with their roles. Denzel Washington is very appealing as the lead role while Will Patton and Hayden Pantierre did excellent as the coach and his daughter. The direction is pretty good too and the script/dialog is witty and compelling, but the strongest aspects would have to go the football sequences and the sweeping music score from Trevor Rabin with it's epic moments that could easily make you teary-eyed.Overall, Remember the Titans is an epic masterpiece in sports film history and is always recommended to those who love American football.

I grew up countryfied and have tasted the salt of playing against a school that was three or four times our size, schools that could afford to cherry-pick who played. Schools where the defense could rest when the offense was on the field...apparently T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.I can sympathize with some of the negative reviews here...because, honestly, if they made a movie like this about Woodstock, I'd give it 1 star out of principal. Seriously, no, we might be hicks, but we rotate from linebacker to offensive tackle. When you faced off against schools that had an actual student body, you knew you were going to lose, the only question was how hard were you going to make their victory. Sounds like T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.OK, rant done.I caught this on TNT and the music drew me in right away. Hear a good song it catches your ear and drags you in.And this has the acting to back it up. It's very... nice seeing Washington NOT playing the smart-cop role or a variation there of. He can act, he can act well, and this is one of the movies where he's not playing the same role over and over again. So, when he comes out of that shell and gets a gig playing a role he doesn't always play... it's kind of a treat isn't it?Of course the highlight was really Hayden Panettiere, not because she was absolutely adorable in the film (which she was), but more because she did a great job of turning a little girl into that parent, on the sidelines, that thinks he's Ditka, so she was not only adorable but hysterical.The Hippie, Ryan Gosling?, was another little gem, not because he did a particularly good job acting, though it was fair enough. No, he stood out because anyone that's payed football knew someone like him. It gave it a bit of an authentic feel.The only real downside was that, by 1971, schools were integrated and been for a while. It kind of lost that authenticity when they went that route. But, you know what, who cares, it was entertaining enough despite that.It was a solid football movie.And for all the 1 star reviews, particularly those written by people from the smaller schools that had to go up against the Titans... I feel for you. I remember being in that situation and I'd be bitter too if the giant school had a movie made about them that suggested they were in anyway the under-dog.",

            "content": "While a film like this may not be what everyone is looking for, since some who want a sports movie ONLY want a sports movie, 'Remember the Titans' is a fantastic film that works on multiple levels to deliver not only a great film on football, but one that speaks well on the racial tensions of the time period. It may not take the racial problems as seriously as it should, but as it's a Disney film, it's hard to be entirely put off by that.The story goes as follows: When two schools (one primarily white, the other primarily black) are integrated, the football team is put under the control of black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). This causes strife between the players and community. As the racial tension rises, Boone must work harder to unite his divided team.The script has a nice blend of drama and humour. From the gut-wrenching moments of racial battling to the hilarious \"Who's Your Daddy?\" scene, 'Remember the Titans' works well as more than just a simple sports flick. Adapting the script to the screen. director Boaz Yakin (this film being, essentially, his masterpiece (without much competition)) captures the 1970s Virginia setting quite well and does a good job of portraying the action of the game of the football. The acting, as expected, is mostly fantastic. Denzel puts forth his usual awesome performance and, excluding one or two of the players, the rest of the cast does well along with him.All together, 'Remember the Titans' manages to be one of the most well rounded & well made sports movies I've ever seen.Final Verdict: 8.5/10.-AP3-",

Integration now!\" in \"Hairspray\" (1988) in a Baltimore teen TV show to the integrating of a Virginia school and how that affects the championship winning football team, times took forever to change, with one film set in 1962 and the other in 1971. There's a saying that changes start with the young, their ideals not set in stone even when brought up to feel a certain way. It takes time for both the white players established at this Alexandria school to accept the black players bussed in (and vice versa), and they are just a small part of the student body population. Change has to start somewhere, even though it is often very slow.Two of the white students stand out, with the obese transfer student without racism, and the long haired beach boy lookalike who takes on the bullying white player who proves he's an athlete even though he's possibly gay. His taking the risk to actually kiss this other player didn't seem very realistic, but he gets instant respect from the other players for his audacity. The team itself is at least 75 players, and there's no indication if it's a combination of JV and Varsity.At the center of the story are the new head coach (the always reliable Denzel Washington) and demoted former head coach Will Patton, having conflicts but slowly working them out. Hayden Pantierre plays Patton's tomboyish daughter who initially seems racist but comes around after seeing the ridiculousness of the racism between the players. Her conflict with Washington's daughter is based more on the fact that they are complete opposites than the difference in skin color.I'm not sure how much of this story is based on truth, but in documenting the real life history, it makes a point and shows the value of understanding, teamwork and acceptance, and not reluctantly. It's an energetic production that is funny, touching, sometimes violent yet never without heart as the outlying goal besides just winning the game. Maybe not a big award winning blockbuster, but definitely worth seeing and recommending.",

Even so, the way the film is put together makes for an inspirational tale of athletes setting aside their differences for the sake of teamwork and winning in a competitive environment. Virtually all the characters here are likeable enough, and I particularly enjoyed Louie Lastik (Ethan Suplee), one of the first to bridge the racial divide because his appearance made him an outsider even to the white players. Very surprising to see in the lineup was a young Ryan Gosling, who didn't really look like he should have been on the team based on his size, weight and talent, and who recognized as much in the critical final championship game by taking himself out in favor of a better player. Another poignant scene occurred when defensive leader and team captain Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) had his friend Ray (Burgess Jenkins) cut because of an intentionally missed block to make a black player look bad. Together with head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) and defensive coach Bill Yoast's (Will Patton) willingness to step down for the cause of integration and remain an anchor for the players in a divided community, the T.C. Williams High School Titans become the model of teamwork, dedication and strict discipline necessary to attain their desired championship. Look past the cliches, and you'll find an inspirational and entertaining sports story here that should meet with your approval.",

            "content": "I was slightly amused by Remember the Titans. The film is unrealistic in its portrayal of racism and prejudice in the 1970's. The sing-songy happiness of Disney ruined the film in its attempts to portray the prejudice and bigotry that existed then and still is ubiquitous today. As an example, Herman Boone didn't have a brick thrown through his window, it was a toilet. Disney added some useless things to the story in which I am referring to how they said Ronnie Bass was homosexual which in real life he wasn't and never has been. In fact he has a wife and kids. Even though the film was created by Disney, which was founded upon dreams, I say Disney overdid the fictionalization of the movie. The movie may be based upon a true story giving Disney the right to change it, but that doesn't give them the right to change it to the point that it is almost completely fiction. Disney said that the Titans played Marshall in the movie when in fact the Titans never played Marshall and really went against Andrew Lewis and won 27 to 0! The Titans only had one team put up a fight against them, in real life, and that was Woodrow Wilson during the playoffs where the score was 36 to 14 with the Titans being the winners. Gerry Bertier was crippled after the big game, not before. All schools were integrated, not just T.C. which Disney didn't say. This movie is contrived and tripe. I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a true story, but to people who want to see a movie with useless suspense. Like all movies made by Disney it has a happy, predictable ending that you won't remember. The only good thing I have to say about this is it has a wholesome, positive message, but I still say it is a waste of your time.",

I remember hearing about it in England, just before I moved to Berlin, and I thought to myself that I wanted to see it, but never had the chance to before I was actually out here. The film did not gain as much press and public awareness than it deserved in Germany, but (from what I heard) it did gross well, but then again, we wouldn't expect a film from Disney not to gross well! When I entered the cinema, the film was starting, and (I was unaware of Disney being behind the production) I saw the Disney symbol, which stopped me in my tracks. I was expecting your usual Village Roadshow, certainly not Disney, but I stuck through, and thought that if this wasn't the film I paid for, well .... I could always leave and say, \"You sent me to the wrong theatre!!\" The music to the opening sequence was good, and it certainly created the vibe that the film was going to be an entertaining film to watch, and a fast one at that! And how true it was - the time flew by as fast as one of the moves that the team managed to pull in the final match shown! Now to what the film is about: Two schools, one black and one white, are brought together by the state, causing already disturbance in the streets. A black Football coach is instated, and this causes even more uproar within the small town. However, Coach Boon (Denzel Washington) decides to keep the current coaches and work with them. The plot, which I am going to simplify to the bare bones, is how the football team, which Boon creates changes the views on living in a mixed community in the respective town they live in. I cannot give anymore of the story away, otherwise it will kill the film for you. The acting is good, for a football film, and even those who had to say one line don't give out the impression that they are wooden.

It was based on a true story in 1971 which involved integration of both black and white students into one school. I found it quite interesting.Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone. He is brought into the school to replace Bill Yoast (Will Patton) as head coach of the high school football team the Titans. Yoast is upset at first, but then he decides to stay on as defensive coordinator of the Titans, and together these two men find away to get through their differences and bring a football team of both black and white students together as winners. Both give very good performances The young cast is also splendid, especially Wood Harris as Julius and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier. These two are the team captains of the Titans, and they are the first to break through their discrimination against one another and become fast friends. Honorable mention should also be given to Hayden Panettiere as Bill Yoast's young daughter Sheryl.What makes this film work though is how race is not one sided. You see the good and bad from all sides. A recent movie that did just this same thing was Crash from 2005.Now for the bad. There were some things in Remember the Titans that just never quite fit. The character of Ronnie \"Sunshine\" Bass (even though it was a decent performance by Kip Pardue) was one, and all the singing was another. Was Sunshine gay or not? There's one moment where you think it's true, but then afterward it's never really explained. The singing that was used in the movie also went a little too far and distracted somewhat from the movie.

The Disney name and previews did not prepare me for the predominant theme of racism throughout the story.  Because of this, I cannot proclaim this movie to be the first really great 'football movie'.  However, it is a well-made movie loosely based on 1971 racial tension at a high school campus.  Denzel, as usual, dominates his scenes with an in-your-face, holier-than-thou acting style.  The role seems to have been written for him. Only in a Disney movie could you deal with school integration and not once hear the N-word. There are scenes that bring a touch of reality to this film, but most attempts are pretty lame.  The movie is very well paced and beautifully filmed.  Director Boaz Yakin shows flashes of being the real thing.  I am looking forward to his next outing.  Will Patton again shows that he is truly one of the best character actors working in Hollywood today.  Three other actors jumped off the screen.  Ryan Hurst, as Bertier, has the look and presence of a young Russell Crowe.  Child Soap Opera star, Hayden Panettiere, steals her scenes as the young football expert.  A little polishing and she could develop into a true film star.  Kip Pardue, as Sunshine, may be the prettiest actor since Robert Redford in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\".  Hopefully he will accept roles that don't alienate us male viewers.  Translated: be a good actor that happens to look great. Overall, I think this movie could be a nice, low-key introduction for kids into what the struggles of racism entailed, as the message is delivered within the confines of feel-good football story.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is a racial parable with a sports premise in the foreground. This is one of the selected films that does a great job at two different things. It doesn't get too preoccupied with either, and winds up making the two flow nicely without being heavy-handed or incoherent. It has great lead actors for the coaches, great character actors for the players, and a nicely concocted, if simple, moral that ties the ribbon on the package.Despite a few noticeable flaws, the high rating is because the film excels at things other sports films don't even bother touching. We'll get into that later. The film is based on the true story of Herman Boone (Washington), an African American man who becomes the head coach of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virgina, docking long time white coach Bill Yoast (Patton) to defensive coordinator.It's 1971. The Civil Rights movement has recently taken place, and the blacks now have equal rights, but unequal opportunities. It's that awkward period where they have rights, but still seem like they are fighting to prove they do. The blacks, who try out for the football team, are proud to see one of their own coaching a high school. The whites are furious, yet accept that they will be playing in an integrated team, with a black head coach.The town has mixed reception towards the idea. The whites are very sour and skeptical, and the blacks are overjoyed, respectively. The team soon proves themselves worthy of recognition by winning game after game, when they are put through Coach Boone's long, painful, unforgivable drills at a two week camp.There are a wide variety of students on the team, as one would expect. They are religious Jerry nicknamed \"The Rev\" because he is always praying (Kirkwood), tough guy Gerry (Hurst), bad boy Julius (Harris), stocky and simple Louie (Suplee), and many others. Even a young Ryan Gosling shows up in many scenes.My favorite character, by far, was Louie. Ethan Suplee has a natural screen talent for the sweet and simple type, but plays the role not as a caricature, but in a very humanistic way. That's the key word here; humanistic. One of the many things Remember the Titans gets right is that it develops its characters, and doesn't believe it will happen automatically without any amount of effort. Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard gives almost all the football players their own story to tell. Regardless of what they are, he tries, and succeeds impressively.The role of Herman Boone could only be played by Denzel Washington. When you hire Washington to star in your film, you take one look at his serious face and know what you're getting. A fearless leader, that can carry a movie on his shoulders regardless of length or content, and never stumbles or trips up on anything. It is clear he learned something from working on Spike Lee's Malcolm X. In that film, he was a determined Civil Rights leader, looking to do anything for equal rights. Here, he plays a determined football coach, looking to do anything for equal opportunities on and off the field.Like I said, there are some minor things that stuck out to me, more for the worse than the better. For one, the film feels a bit neutered. Sure, this is a bit pushy for a Disney film, nonetheless a PG rated Disney film, but everything feels a bit too simple. A bit too genial. Surely more abuse was caused by the townspeople rather than most happening on the field. There is never really a major conflict that isn't resolved within minutes. Also, the ending is a bit hazy. It doesn't really cement change in a very strong way. It almost makes it seem like the problem of racism and inequality depended on the outcome of a football game.It is common for films involving a teacher, a coach, or a counselor, to take one or more characters \"under their wing\" to teach them greater things or to think outside the box. Yes, Boone inspires virtually the whole team, but we never see him interact with any of the team members, sincerely, one on one. He tells Louis in one scene that they'll go over his test scores, and I desperately wanted to see what those scenes could possibly unfold into, but they never came through. The man on man sentimentality lacks, but there is still plenty of motivational speeches to sweeten the pot.Remember the Titans accomplishes a great deal, even if it isn't perfect. The levels it succeeds in, storytelling, characterization, and motivation, are some of the hardest to achieve greatness in, and the film appears to do if effortlessly. Washington steals every scene he is in, the football scenes are crisp and effective, and the feeling we're left with is a keen sense of optimism. For a Disney film to do all that is quite an accomplishment.Starring: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, Ryan Gosling, Ethan Suplee, Kate Bosworth, and Hayden Panettiere.

As it's 1971, and racial prejudices run rampant, Boone encounters various set-backs.No points for guessing how \"Titans\" unfolds. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures, this is a hokey, sentimental, formulaic film, in which every emotion is accompanied by violins and in which every point is communicated via sledgehammer.Still, \"Titans\" means well, and Denzel Washington is always watchable. Combining the nobility/sanctimony of Sidney Poitier, and the ghetto-street-cred of a young Eddie Murphy, Washington's always been a kind of post-racial distillation of everything African American. More than this, though, he's always oozed movie-star charisma. Give Denzel a monologue, rant or meaty bit of dialogue, and he'll dazzle you some thespian pyrotechnics, before hitting you with that patented laugh and bouncing off with his iconic walk, one arm dead at his side.

            "content": "Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), one of the black players of the T. C. Williams High School's football team, wanders in the WASP suburban neighborhood of Alexandria (Virginia). A police car pulls over, the window rolls down revealing an officer with the kind of stern look that makes us expect a line such as \"are you lost, boy?\". Instead, the cop congratulates Julius for the last game\" calling it he best he'd ever seen. Not only is Julius relieved but he's so enthused by that warm display of support than when he meets the mother of the team's captain, his buddy Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst), he embraces her and lifts her as if if she was part of his own family. No matter how prefabricated they feel, never underestimate the satisfactory effect of small little moments like this one. In fact, that scene was so satisfying that I was willing to be manipulated.That moment encapsulates the spirit of \"Remember the Titans\", not a film about a series of victories but one big victory over prejudice and racism, with the first American \"mixed\" football team trained and managed by Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) in 1971, when civil rights matters were still debated on the streets with signs or batons. And now that we live in a time where Hollywood and Netflix feeds us with polarizing antiracist films, I was pleasantly surprised by how moderate \"Titans\" was. Sure the boys are antagonized and you have several episodes that showcase how tough these times were: ,they're refused the access to a bar, Gerry's girlfriend played by Kate Bosworth refuses to shakes hands with Julius and a brick is thrown at Boone's house but it's obvious that the overall attention was on the positive stuff.If the film was made today, it would have been shamelessly overdramatized: an athlete being beaten up by racist thugs, a monologue about a grandfather being lynched by the Organization. Hell it's even possible that the kiss from Ronnie \"Sunshine\" Bass (Kip Pardue) would have gotten more significance and he wouldn't be thrown out of the bar just because he's a 'hippie'. But \"Remember the Titans\" isn't a history session about racism nor a film that desperately tries to be relevant, in fact, it's less about the teammates overcoming racism than the two coaches trying to overcome their professional differences. And that's the best thing about it: it's got two compelling and realistic characters in Boone and Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Here are two men who are equally competent, share the same passion for football and have legit reasons not to get along first and even more legit reasons to stick together.Boone is frustrated not to have had his efforts rewarded by the position he sought for years and the new assignment as a head coach actually puts Yoast in a similar situation. However Boone realizes the new responsibility he's given and what it represents for his community, so he asks Yoast to be his assistant. If Yoast listened to his pride, he would boycott the new team but then 'his' boys would lose their chances to get scholarships. He accepts the new offer when he sees that Boone has a fair approach to the game and will not just favor 'his own'. Boone also has priority, he knows a defeat won't be permitted and Yoast discovers the politics beneath Boone's assignment and the two men are given occasions to show support and solidarity for each other.Had the film tried to make one a hero and another an antagonist, it would have failed. And just when you think Yoast has a better diplomatic approach than his partner, you have Boone telling him that he's unconsciously patronizing and at least he's a mean SOB to everybody. It's for these subtle touches that the film is more than your inspirational feel-good crowd-pleaser. Maybe it all comes down to having Denzel Washington and Will Patton first and sticking to formula with some standout moments like the speech at the Gettysburg Civil War cemetery and some fun scenes that involve the supporting cast, another good thing about the film. The training session is one awesome moment after another.Ethan Suplee as Louie Lastik, is the first to eat with the black players because he has no 'people', he's immediately accepted. Seriously, who'd believe this is the same who played the hateful Seth in \"American History X\"? Craig Kirkwood makes for a nice \"Rev\" and Donald Faison is responsible for the funniest moment of the film: when he keeps raising his fist until Boone confronts him, telling him this is no \"Black power\" thing and the interaction with the 'fun' word has the comical timing of \"Who's On First?\" with Denzel Washington channelling Clint Eastwood in \"Heartbreak Ridge\". Honorable mention to a young babyfaced Ryan Gosling dancing in the locker and a funny session of \"Yo Mama\" jokes that shows male bonding at its finest.Hayden Pannetiere steals the show as a little tomboy who breathes football like a certified bookmaker while Boone's daughter would dodge a basketball because she made her nails and insists she doesn't play dolls but accessorize them. To each her own. And Burgess Jenkins is given the thankless role of the only player who doesn't go along with the rest of the team, forcing his best friend Gerry to 'take a decision'. I liked Gerry a lot, his evolution, his personality, his friendship with Julius that overarches the whole story. Now, I'm no football expert (to give you the idea, I call soccer 'football') and so I didn't see coming that event that changed his life, a very short life actually but what a legacy, if anything he was the Titan!Of course, Boaz Yakin's film is full of triumphant sports moments, races around the clock, and decisive blitz-like offensive actions served by powerful last-minute speeches but like \"Rudy\", the best part don't involve football, but the very spirit that sports can infuse in people's minds.",

This film makes you care for just about every character in the movie, almost the entire football team. This ain't a average high school football team, but a touching story of two race mainly focused on two men overcoming there difference thanks to the coaches in order to reach a greater goal in life, besides hatred for one another.

            "content": "Never having been a football fan, I went into this movie with some trepidation. Within the first fifteen minutes, my worries were laid to rest. Though seemingly unabashedly manipulative, Remember The Titans was, nonetheless enjoyable, as well as inspirational. Yes, race relations and integration in the '60's and '70's does seem to be a pet Hollywood theme, but in this case, it wasn't too heavy handedly done. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a seven out of ten; not great, but entertaining, and thoroughly engrossing.Denzel Washington gives a commendable, totally believable and entertaining performance as coach Boone. Will Patton, in a departure from the type of role I'm used to seeing him in, actually made me like his Coach Yoast character. It was great seeing him play a good guy, for a change. But the one who absolutely stole the movie, in my opinion, was 11 year-old Hayden Panettiere, who played Cheryl Yoast, Coach Yoast's daughter. Her performance helped to breathe humanity, life and humor into the movie. Hayden's acting seemed so natural that I could actually believe her passions about the game, the team and her father were real. Her scene with Denzel Washington, where they watched post-game films in Coach Boone's home, was one of the best of the movie. Watch Hayden Panettiere; this girl is going places.\nEditorial:If I had to give a criticism about the movie at all, it would have to fall squarely on the shoulders of the Coach Boone character. Don't get me wrong, as I said, I liked Denzel Washington in this movie. I've seen him in (I think) every movie he's done, and I'll probably see every movie he'll do in the future. It would probably have been somewhat less effective had another actor taken the role, as it does seem as though the part of Coach Boone was written specifically for him. ...And that's the problem. Denzel Washington is slowly becoming, if not a caricature of himself, then definitely range-limited. More often than not, his characters have a Denzel Washingtonesque moral rectitude, and most exhibit an engaging condescension that gives the character a father like stature. For all I know, these are traits that may very well be desired in the Roles Mr. Washington tends to take. It would just be nice to see him spread his wings a little and play, dare I say it, a bad guy?",

Granted, I did not watch this film looking for a documentary- still this one takes it a little too far.Specifically, Washington's character is too perfect.  He exudes a cardboard presence of an army commander throughout the entire film.  Worse is that he is NEVER wrong - entirely unflawed in every way.  His temper is never out of control, nor his slightest words without complete omniscience.  Consider his magnanimous speech at Gettysburg-wait a minute - Hasn't that been done before??Overall I enjoyed parts of this film very much.  It does not miss the mark of portraying racial inequality in America.  It even manages to involve the viewer in a compelling way at times.  Washington's character however is not compelling - he is annoying and that is this films undoing.Overall rating - 4",

It does it through the characters' journeys, and experiences, and this seems to come out more maturely, and gets the point across much more powerfully.

Perhaps this was not an adage of his own design; but, nonetheless, there is a lesson to be learned here.IT SEEMS THAT every couple of years or so, a story taken right out of the headlines (or at least the Sports Pages) makes it to the screen. In recent years, we've seen the likes of HOOSIERS, RUDY, THE BLIND SIDE and now wee see that one will be coming out about a High School Football winning streak by a team from a De La Salle school by name.IN CASTING THE role of Coach Herman Boone, the selection of Denzel Washington, the success of the film at the Box Office was virtually assured. The only question was, could he handle what is the role of a more mature individual? If so, would the movie going public buy it? WE NOW KNOW that the answers are all in the affirmative, but hindsight is always 20-20.ANOTHER FACTOR TO be taken into consideration is that just about any Actor relishes the chance to be cast against type and be afforded the opportunity to expand his repertoire s swell as to add to his resume. Mr. Denzel Washington did just those very things. The name of the game is acting and that's just what they want in testing their limits in expanding their characterizations.WHERREAS THE STORY takes place in an earlier time, where not many Black men had opportunity to coach white kids or even in an integrated environment; of which very few even existed then. Even in the Northern urban areas, there was de facto segregation; if not by design of Law, de jurie. The story tells of the difficulties encountered by those who went first in previously uncharted waters.IF THERE IS indeed a 'message' here, it's very subtle and elemental. Put simply, it's the Golden Rule of \"love your neighbor\", coupled with the notion of judging each individual on his own merit.ALTHOUGH WE KNOW that this is based on real life incidents, there is of necessity much embellishment of the story, in order to, make it into a coherent screen play. Our favourite bit concerned the coaches' daughters. In the story, the Black Girl is the one who has no interest in going out for sports. She prefers her dolls and is all female all the way. It is the White Girl who is a veritable 'Tom Boy' and shoot hops an knows all about other games, including her Father's football team.SEE WHAT WE meant about going against typecasting, or in this case, it would be \"stereotyping.\"",

Then the movie goes back to 1971, where people in the Washington, D. C., suburb of Alexandria are rioting because a white business owner has killed a black teenager.  If that's not bad enough, two of the schools have been combined to form the city's first integrated high school and the people are very upset about that.  Coach Yoast, who has been very successful in the football program at the white school, does not like having Herman Boone, who is black, hired as an assistant coach. Unfortunately, things get worse. Coach Boone is named the head football coach because the area has no black head coaches.  The white players do not want to play for anyone except Coach Yoast.  Unfortunately, if they don't play where they are assigned, they don't play without paying a lot of money to go somewhere else. Eventually, the nearly all-black football team gets its white players back, and Coach Yoast returns as an assistant.Coach Boone runs training camp like boot camp.  He expects nothing less than perfection, and he expects the players to get along despite their racial differences. Eventually, the team must return to the 'real world', where the people need lessons in tolerance.  It's an exciting football season, and the team has its ups and downs.  When I saw it, this was a 'Wonderful World of Disney' movie (with additional footage not shown in theaters or even on DVD), though not as clean as most, and you pretty much know what to expect. This movie is based on a real story, though, so you don't know exactly how the Disney formula will work in this case.Denzel Washington did a wonderful job.  His character showed no fear and stood up to all obstacles that came his way. Yet he still managed to show a tender side when it was appropriate.  Hayden Panettiere gave the other standout performance, as Coach Yoast's 9-year-old daughter Sheryl, who knew almost as much as her father about football.  I thought pretty much everyone gave a good performance.  The movie was a little on the long side, and it did contain some offensive terms used by those who hate people just because of their race.  There were also a couple of suggestions of homosexuality. However, there was little violence except on the football field.  And even there, it was mostly the usual for football.There was some comedy.  In addition to Sheryl's precocious behavior, there were lots of great moments where players were learning about each other. Such as when one black player was forced to listen to Buck Owens.\nThis movie showed a football team and a town that had more than the usual obstacles to overcome, and in many ways the people in this movie showed us all that some things can be done which seem impossible.",

Some peoples complaints are as unrealistic as the movie they are complaining about. Of course the whites and blacks miraculously go from hating each other to liking each other. THATS THE POINT OF THE MOVIE! Of course the championship is won on the last play. Sorry to say but most footballs games, especially the ones that are over quickly are BORING AS HELL. When a game goes down to the wire its entertainment, the point of a movie is to entertain.I always enjoy Denzel Washingtons performances, and this is no exception. Another great performance from a great actor.Its a fantastic movie to take your kids to as well. Drop your pretensions and enjoy it for what it is.",

I wonder where they keep all those intelligent, well-spoken dream coaches, but let's move on. Apart from Washington's performance, the movie isn't particularly thrilling yet still enjoyable. It works around that old theme of hatred between black and white, unfortunately most of the characters aren't really compelling enough to focus on. Some are however, and it's also just heart-warming to see some of the ignorant rednecks growing more tolerant as time progresses. \"Remember The Titans\" isn't great cinema though, the writing just isn't smart enough for it to truly be a classic. Still pretty good though.",

            "content": "In a year of many bad movies (USA Today reported the year 2000 was one of the worst year for movies in 75 years), this was one of the year's best.This movie received very little hype and fanfare compared to many box office \"turkeys\" of that year did. It seems as though Disney did not have very high expectations for this movie, considering the little promoting they did and release date they gave it. This was grossly underrated.Denzel Washington was excellent as Coach Herman Boone. A highly qualified coach who is tough, but fair to his players. He has faced racism and discrimination throughout his life, is given the head coaching job at T.C. Williams high in Virginia, because of his race.Will Patton as was wonderful as Coach Bill Yoast. Another highly qualified coach who will experience what Coach Boone has, as the head coaching job is taken away from him and takes a demotion as Assistant Coach to Boone, after the white players said they would sit out the season in out of loyalty to Coach Yoast, but mainly, due to their prejudice to Coach Boone.the rest of the cast was good as well. Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley, had to overcome their prejudices and fears towards their African-American teammates and coach, while Wood Harrris as Julius Campbell, and Donald Faison as Petey to name a couple, will have to deal with their teammates' prejudices I mentioned and come together with their white teammates to become a team. The cast was wonderful. I could go on and on about it, but it there's more to this movie than the cast.Director Boaz Yakin seemed to capture the turbulent times of this era; The post Civil Rights Movement, integration of the public schools in the south and racism in particular. I almost felt like I was there, having to deal with this. I liked the football scenes as well. Once again, I almost felt like I was there cheering on the Titans as they were going for the perfect season and their battle for the Virginia AAA state football title.When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was taken in immediately and I said to myself I will add this DVD to my library. Needless to say, I have it.Another interesting thing is, when this movie is shown on television, I'll watch it. Normally, I won't watch it because these movies have scenes edited out, parts of the dialog is bleeped or dubbed, due to the inappropriate scene, time and/or language content. In addition, you have to deal with those annoying commercial breaks.The reason why I'll watch it is, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor for whatever reason on the theater and DVD version. On the latter. you can find it in the deleted scenes section on the bonus features of the DVD, but on the television version, those same deleted scenes, you can find them back in the movie. On a particular note, you can see Lucinda Jenney's only scene in the movie as Coach Yoast's ex-wife, Arleen Yoast, when she gave custody to their daughter Sheryl to him. Another scene is where Julius and Gerry are at a barbecue and they are discussing their futures. Julius says he wants to go to Ohio State and play for then coach Woody Hayes. This is interesting, because I don't recall seeing that scene when I saw it in the theater and you will not find it on the DVD version of the movie or in the deleted scenes section.Besides being one of the year's best films, this is also one of the best sports movies ever made.",

Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.  The selection of Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst for the student leads is a bit of a stretch age wise (Hurst is 25 and looks older, and Harris is 31).  However, both actors deliver brilliant performances, supercharged with intensity on and off the field.  Eleven-year-old Hayden Panettiere is fantastic as coach Yoast's football obsessed daughter, stealing every scene in which she appears.The DVD has a good deal of interesting material including interviews with the real coaches Boone and Yoast as well as player interviews.  The DTS sound on this DVD is nothing short of awesome, making the music powerful and sounds of the action on the field explosive.This film is classic Bruckheimer.  It sweeps us up and gets us totally involved with the characters, while putting impediments in their way so we can root for them.  I rated it an 8/10.  For most viewers, this will be an uplifting experience.",

A white boy who's seen enough \"integration\" films that his heart is really hardened to that sort of thing, and really I care little to see any more of this sort of film.Let's be honest, after finishing Remember the Titans tonight -- I was a fool.It's a movie about football, but, to me at least, it was very little about football, and very much about people. It's about one life touching another, and how hard it is to change people, and their outlooks on life, and especially their outlooks on other people, and MORE especially their outlooks on people different than themselves.It would be simple to make a movie about a hardened group of white people who are \"turned\" into more understanding individuals, as if by magic. It would be simple to make each person tolerant, and to watch everyone around them fall like dominoes into this more tolerant attitude. We've all seen it a million times.. This movie doesn't do that.As each person is transformed somewhat into a more enlightened person, they are pulled back by those around them. We see time and again the small respect that grows between the two \"sides\" is torn down. As one person makes strides, their family or loved ones pull them back into their racist ways. It's a struggle clearly defined, and beautifully played in Remember the Titans.I am giving this movie an 8 out of 10. While I did find it striking, and nothing short of enlightening, there were enough of the Hollywood trappings and stereotypes to bring it down a bit for me. Still, there are few movies I have enjoyed more, and none I have enjoyed more that cover this tricky subject.",

Alexandria, Virginia's segregated high schools are forced to unite and form one uber-school, T.C. Williams High.  Among other major, obvious problems, one problem, the focalpoint of the film, is the newly created football team. Bill Yoast (Will Patton) had been successful as coach of of the white high school in Alexandria for a long time, so when Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) moves in from the black school and is appointed head coach in the name of affirmative action, naturally he's a little angry.  Now, of course there are going to be a few cliches in this movie, it's movie about football, the most cliche ridden thing in our society, but muchos props to Gregory Allen Howard, the screenwriter, for not making the \"token white coach,\" the \"token racist coach.\"  If there's any tension between Boone and Yoast it's purely because of the situation that they are both dealing with. Despite the general consensus of the town's disapproval, Yoast signs on as the defensive coordinator under Boone. The movie continues on through training camp in Pennsylvania, (which includes a stop at Gettysburg Battlefield) where the racial tension among the players slowly eases over two weeks.  Over the course of the season we get served with a large number of predictable events including:  The racist opposing coach who bribes the refs, the one player who refuses to support his black teammates, the token fat kid who helps the players get along better whilst adding some comic relief.  (Ironically enough, played by Ethan Suplee, Seth from American History X) The football scenes are mostly well done, with the exception being the close camera angle that made following the logistics of the play or game difficult at times. One interesting thing to note is the behavior of the citizens in the movie. They were, for the most part, very close-minded and didn't change in these views until the football team started to win.  Whether this says something good about sports for bringing the people together, or something bad about the townfolk for not caring until something good came out of it, is uncertain. Overall, while Remember The Titans seemed very hackneyed at times, it was less so than most sports movies, and superb acting by Washington and Patton made for some excellent scenes and a solid film.-as Published in 'The Bear' (student newspaper of West Branch High School)",

Boone does a lot of yelling in their faces throughout the course of the movie and it is really funny to watch. The head coach hates that Boone is yelling at the boys. He thinks that it'll make the boys afraid of him. Boone tells the head coach that he doesn't care what the boys think of him. They need to learn how to work together. It isn't about black or white while they are on the field. They are just a football team there to win the game.\nCoach Boone is a little mean to the players, but they need to learn that your coach can't always be your friend. It doesn't work like that. Just like your boss or your teachers can't always be your friend. They are your teacher or boss first and foremost. Not every person in your life is going to be your friend. That just isn't how life works. The team has to learn that they are a team, no matter what their skin color is.\nI'm aware that there are many historical inaccuracies, but they can be easily overlooked because the overall quality of the film is superb. The daughter of the head coach is honestly my favorite character. She was doing exactly what coach Boone was doing and her father got mad at her because she wasn't the coach. She was more of a coach than her father was. Her father was only concerned about being the players' friend. He wasn't worried about being their coach. Sheryl didn't care. If she thought that the players weren't working hard enough, she'd let them have it and she gave it to them hard. Definitely not their friend. Coach Boone was very similar and after Sheryl watched him coach a few times she gave him her seal of approval. I wonder if her dad ever got that.\nOverall a really well-done movie. Can't just watch it once. There is a fair amount of racially offensive language mostly directed at Boone and his colored players. One player's girlfriend dumps him because he wants to spend time with one of his colored friends instead of going to the lake and doing whatever.",

I saw that this movie had a profound impact and a lot of it comes from the fact that this was based on a true story. It teaches us to respect people and to judge them from their character and not by the color of their skin. It also shows how difficult obstacles that are on both the playing field and off of the playing field can be over coned through the powerful bond of teamwork. It also shows how a small group of young men playing football influenced an entire community on how to respect and work together with people of another race. This is a must see film for anyone and if you are not moved by this then I don't know what to say to you.",

            "content": "Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! Queue in intro music**Since its finals footy upon us might as well do a sport movie review, todays flick is the true story sports drama Remember the Titans (2000) where my man Denzel Washington stars as Coach Boone, the newly appointed chief coach in an newly integrated Virginia high school in the 70's where there is still racial tension in the nation. He needs to team up with the previous coach Yoast who has been demoted due to the new appointment and doesn't want his original players lose college scholarships. Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Both swallow their pride and agree to work with each other to form a united team in matter of weeks where they come across obstacles on and off the field. The movie was entertaining from the military-style whip-'em-into-shape training antics by all the coaches especially by Denzel's lines, and the demonstration that in an era where unification was still an unknown variable, everyone can still overcome not just on the field but also in life. The issue to tackle racial prejudice and how a team with different walks of life come to together by becoming a unifying symbol for their school and for the community enables the boys and the adults learn to depend on and trust each other.Since it was a Disney movie I felt that the movie was way to predictable and one for high school kids to watch when it's time to watch a movie and for a sports film that uses the issue of race in its story, this film really should have been memorable. It's more of good entertainment and good to know unification can come across but felt that there were heaps of unexplored themes and arears that was not looked upon by the filmmakers. Having said that, an entertaining movie and very inspirational with the character development especially the growth of respect that leads to brotherhood between Gerry and Julius is nicely done. Great performances from the main cast including Denzel who just goes to a different level when delivering big speeches without sounding fake or forcing himself. He gives the film a blend of realism and the inspiration especially in the scene where he takes everyone for an early morning training run that leads the players to the Gettysburg battlefield. He gives the speech of what happened on the battlefield that reflect past and present and future experiences that will shape everyone. Kudos also towards the Motown soundtrack and in particular \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrel. Overall 7.8/10\n...hear us ROARR.",

His character was also a tough minded disciplinarian who did things his way. There were the misfit players and the climax which was the state high school championship game where one of the main characters keeps in touch with the game from a hospital room, recovering from an ailment.  'Remember the Titans' has the exact same leading character in Denzel Washington and the same type of climax and feel good flavour and it works.  There is one emotional scene in Gettysburg where Washington explains to his players the value of working together and it doesn't fix the race problem entirely which is affecting the players but it greatly improves the team's situation and the entire movie is never boring for a second.  'Remember the Titans' is an inspiring 9 out of 10.",

It is not that it is a horrible movie by any means, but come on, it's not exactly Kubrick, now is it?  Very typical and INCREDIBLY predictable.  This is a movie about fanatics for fanatics, and the sadistic coach and disgustingly unintelligent players leave much to be desired in the way of heroes.

Is it about playing  good, honest ball; winning at any cost; or making a racial statement? And how does one's manhood figure into all of this?You lose yourself. The tensions/resolutions, obstacles/breakthroughs are stitched together with a best-hits list of 'seventies songs -- Marvin Gaye, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, many more -- that keeps things flowing for the whole 100 minutes or so.Just one criticism, really. The sound-effects attempt to hyper-accentuate the brutality of full-contact football, a la Oliver Stone's recent film. That isn't what this film is about. It's about a great story, the characters and their relationships, and those brief instances of human interaction upon which so much depends -- greater understanding or chaos.

It's got good performances, likable characters and mixing a sports film with a story about racism in the U.S.A. gives this enough material to keep you entertained and engaged even if you're not a huge fan of football. For families it's a definite winner, bringing to light the important issue of racism (and if you think it's not relevant today, you have not been paying attention to the news). For people that have not been victims themselves or are simply unaware of how bad it can get even today it will make them think about the issue, but it's not a movie that makes you feel guilty or bad about it. Ultimately, it's a movie about a sports team filled with underdogs, now doesn't that sound like something that would be thrilling to watch, particularly when the athletes get their game together and start winning? Adults will have probably seen movies that push the boundaries a lot more, but it's still an enjoyable film that is sure to please. (Dvd, July 18, 2012)",

If realistic football action is somewhat important to you, don't watch this movie. It's so over the top and unrealistic. Plus, the action is too slow and poorly choreographed. They try to stage every hit or tackle as the biggest and baddest hit in the history of the sport.There's one moment in the film that was laughable. Of course, it's in the big game and the Titans are struggling. So, a running back breaks through the Titans line and runs basically untouched upfield while a Titan linebacker gets OFF OF THE GROUND and chases him down even though the running back had at least a 10 yard head start on him. It was painfully....comically...disgustingly unbelievable.Plus, in this movie, you'll see more football players get flipped because of a hit than you'll see in a full season of watching NCAA, High School, and NFL football.Hey, if you're fine with unrealistic sports action, watch this movie and enjoy it. But if realistic sports action is something that you expect to go along with a DRAMATIC sports movie that you're watching, this isn't for you.I must admit that I did 'laugh' and 'cry' during this movie.

The acting was superb especially in the interaction between the two coaches played by Denzel and Bill Patton, two foes who united for the good of the team. The writing was true to life even with it being based on a true story. The writer definitely did his research or he had played much football in his day. I was especially impress by the performance of Ryan Hurst in the role of the Team captain. His range of emotions surpass his years and experience as an actor. The supporting cast was equally impressive.  This is a picture that should be the example for other's to follow with regard to the lack of needless violence if only to befit the story, and the absence of needless sex unless pertinent as well.

Even Denzel Washingtons daughter is portrayed as stuffy and pedantic. That is what makes it refreshing, we're not watching a bunch of Angels here, we're seeing real people. Possible exceptions: Ethan Suplee and Hayden Panatierre: ya gotta love the fat guy who uses his naivet\u00e9 as a weapon and the Wise Kid, whose great value isn't that she knows so much about football, but that Panatierre delivers her lines with so much realness, she's a great actress, a shame she became visually a woman so soon.This movie, I know i am supposed to feel better about this movie, but frankly, I did not feel better. It's like Brubaker in the sense that you see a movie about some bad, bad historical situation, and usually you can stomach these things by thinking 'but NOW, it's all good'. Well, like Brubaker, with the un-benefit of hindsight, we know that 20 years after, prison-life is not really improved, and we know also that race relations in America haven't really improved. Well maybe in 2000, the end of the Clinton era, there was still hope, but this here is 2006, y'all, and judging by the aftermath of Katrina, white people don't care about black people, starting from the toppest of tops down: shining example and Commander-in-Chief Bubyah! And way down to animals who thinks its necessary to drag people behind their trucks. And it looks like dubya's gonna be rewarded for it too, come November and 2008. So, while I recognize and even enjoy the occasional pockets of brotherhood and kinship between black and white displayed sometimes, in the back of my mind, while watching this flic, is always: there is still a HUGE divide! The fact that we had to wait for 2005 for a TV-series created by a black woman (Greys Anatomy), says enough and is a sign of how slow things go. Yes, there's Oprah and Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters, but also and far more importantly, there are decreasing numbers of black college students, the increasing numbers of all-white TV shows, segregation via money and bobjones university!And of course I'm moved when watching this film, but, I'm very sorry, but when I see it, I can only think: Well, 35 years later, things aren't that much better, really.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is an excellent sports-drama, written by the American Gregory Allen Howard. It's directed by the seemingly unknown Boaz Yakin who puts his skills to action very well in this film. It is film that's based upon a true story it premiered in the U.S late 2000.A small suburb in Virginia seems perfect from the outside, but the society is based on racial inequalities of large proportions. But under a federal mandate a school in for Afro-Americans in Virginia gets integrated to T.C. Williams High School. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is a successful football coach who gets assigned to lead the merged high school football team. Tensions arise when this fact is introduced to the Titans, consisting of both black and white students. Due to the segregation within the group, their performance as a team is obviously unsatisfactory.Consequently Herman takes them on a bonding trip, to overcome the racial differences. Herman is not like any other coach, he distinguishes himself as a winner, and he will not tolerate any mistakes. The team's affections for each other become more profound than Herman ever expected. And as the season progresses the team's success ultimately causes the entire community to accept the changes.The overall performance of Denzel is rock solid all the way through, and same goes for the rest of actors. The soundtrack is also a delight since it's filled with great oldies recognized by anyone. Among these songs we find \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Marvin Gaye and \"Spirit in the Sky\" by Norman Greenbaum just to mention a few. The main symphony theme also blends perfectly during those special, touching, moments.Personally I got very interested in trying out American football while watching this film. It's also a very inspiring interpretation of what's possible when you work as a team. They Titans believed in their caused and proved for the rest of the society what's possible together. If black and white can cooperate perfectly in the football stadium, why wouldn't it be the same on the outside? I particularly admire this film for it moral values. It surpasses the ethical differences and shows that everyone is capable of respecting each other. I think this is an important message to remember, considering mankind's violent nature, and history, with wars and discrimination.",

            "content": "Back before Superhero movies dominated the box office, movie studios were investing big into \"Sports Movies\". Disney made quite a few around the turn of the century. Stuff like \"Miracle\", \"Rookie\" and \"Glory Road\" are all good, but \"Remember the Titans\" is their best.\"Remember the Titans\" is based on a true story about Coach Herman Boone, an African American coach who comes to coach at a Virginia High School the first year after the school had been racially integrated. Racial tension runs high throughout the community as Coach Boone and Coach Yoast teach these kids about a lot more than just football.The acting by all those involved is top notch in this film. I will draw special attention to Washington who puts in a powerhouse performance. It should go without saying, I don't think Denzel has ever put in a mediocre performance. The music by Trevor Rabin hits all the right emotional beats, this is a really great and motivational soundtrack.This movie is able to balance two different elements very well, sports and racial tension. Despite being a Disney PG movie, the film treats its audience with respect. It doesn't sugar coat a problem, nor does feel like it is preaching, it is just giving the facts. This film does take a couple creative liberties with the \"true\" story aspect, but never to the film's detriment and never to a manipulative degree.And if you just came to this film to watch a solid sports movie, this film has you covered there as well. Sound bites of different motivational speeches can be used from this movie in locker rooms for decades after the film's release. The sports part does everything a sports movie should do. It pumps up the audience, it gets them to stand up and cheer, it motivates them to do better.And at the heart and soul of this film we have the characters. They are likable, relatable and have conversations that feel real and natural. They go on compelling character arcs which have them grow as people in a realistic way.If you are a fan of Sports movies, this is one of the all-time greats. Everywhere I go, people want to know, what's a great sports movie? So, I tell them, \"Remember the Titans\" the mighty mighty Titans.",

It was an excellent story about racial tensions within the world of high school sports in the early 1970's - a period I can identify with since I graduated HS in 1971.The movie was a tightly crafted retelling of a true story that took place in Virginia. As with all \"true\" stories, you have to wonder how much of it was embellished to make it more marketable.Actually, I do not believe some things happened the way they showed. I wouldn't have bought them even if it was fiction, so I certainly can't buy them as nonfiction. And, they did detract enough to lower my rating from about 8 1/2 to 7 1/2. Interestingly, in either case, I would have given it an 8 - so in that respect, it was irrelevant except to the enjoyment of the movie.I had just seen another football movie - Any Given Sunday, so I was thrilled to see a decent football movie after that fiasco.

The movie flows very well and is extremely entertaining and for only being a two plus hour movie I think the writer did well in crafting the script and bringing out the important themes of the film. I now would like to say a few things about the cast first off none of the guys look like they would be in high school, that being said they can all act. I don't think that one performance is better than another everything just kind of flows together and with out all the members of the cast it would be a completely different film and might not be as good.

Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school.

I think this is a great family oriented movie that will stay on the top of the charts and will soon be a classic. Denzel Washington is self explained. It's like whenever he's in a movie, you know its going to be good. I think Remember the Titans is one of the best movies to come around.

Not to mention a anti-airtight script that wanders around looking for a backbone! Thoroughly satisfying entertainment, is what I say! Sure it's intentions are obvious from the start (as is the playing out of its climactic ending), but for two hours Bruckheimer and director Boaz Yakin keep you busy enjoying all the talent involved in making this movie about how you gotta have heart to win. And all that jazz.\nDenzel Washington gives his first warmhearted performance as a true-life football coach assigned to a newly-integrated school who has enough troubles with trying to get his team to get along with each other, let alone win some games, let alone win a seasonal championship, let alone resist the volatile intolerance and bigotry that surrounds the school's new political plateau. Despite its predictable nature the film truly is a deserving crowd-pleaser and features some young actors at the peak of their ensemble-hearted form, most notably Ryan Hurst as Team Captain Bertier, Kip Pardue as the native Californian who rocks the whole team, black and white, with his hippy-ness and the very funny Donald Faison (Clueless's Murray) as Petey, the guy who thinks (much to the coach's detrement) that football is FUN. Hayden Panettiere is a scream (and the best performer in the whole film!) as Coach Yoast's (Will Patton) pint-sized daughter, who has her own ideas about how to run a real football team.",

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" starts out with a group of people revisiting the gravesite of an old friend and then whisks us back ten years in time.  This is a film with 'formula' written all over it, from the team that wins against all odds, to the bigger than life Coach Boone (skillfullly played by Denzel Washington) who rules with an iron hand, to the tragic accident before the big game, and finally to the hero who comes off the bench.  Yet, \"Remember the Titans\" excels at the very things that 'Coach' would expect - great acting and a memorable story.  At the heart of this film are human beings trying to figure out how to live with each other - be it getting a team together to win, finding the courage to follow one's convictions, or doing what is morally right rather than following the crowd. The only blemish is that the film glorifies the mistaken obsession, as prevalent today as ever, that in high school sports winning is everything and losing is not an option.  There are many poignant scenes, two that are particularly revealing involve the little girl, Sheryl, (well acted by Hayden Panettiere) once when she is sobbing in a lonely grandstand with her father Coach Yoast (in a strong performance by Will Patton) after he has told her he will not be elected to the Hall of Fame because he could not allow the officials to corrupt his game, and the second when she stares down at her father to swallow his pride if he wants to win the game.  \"Remember the Titans\" spends a lot of  focusing on the moment.  Black and white players forced to interview each other about their families, two white 'outsider' players who blend in so naturally with their black teammates even as the white players are floored by what they see, the stern warning Coach Boone gives to his fellow coach not to cuddle the black player lest they become crippled to deal with real life situations.  Because the film deals with the moment, it is disappointing that few of the participants become bigger stars after their unbelievable triumph including the two coaches who never eclipse their particular glory.  Uplifting, inspiring, healing are all appropriate words for \"Remember the Titans\", a film that freezes a golden moment in a Virginia town for all of us to savor.",

OK. The little kids still had some problems, but mostly overcame. Others ride the wave of glory to acceptance. Unlike Song of the South, not everyone can overcome the blinders of racism.

So, if you liked Any Given Sunday, and are looking for the next best thing, look somewhere else, this movie an't for you.Seeing how this is a Jerry Brockheimer movie I can tell you it has 4 things straight off: great cinematography, great editing, high emotions, and it's probably going to have Will Patton in it.  Jerry (as I call him) has made some bad movies (Gone in Sixty Seconds, Armageddon) and he has made some good movies (The Rock, Enemy of the State, Beverly Hills Cop).  This is one of his best movies.The movie centers on the racial problems that develop when a Virginian high school is integrated back in the seventies.  At first, the players hate each other, you basic racial hate movie.  But after a long stay at a football camp, they all become friends.That is one of the best parts to the movie.  The friendship that bonds between the men also bonds between the audience.  The characters are more like real people instead of talking cardboard cut outs.Let me state one more time THIS IS NOT A TRUE DISNEY MOVIE.  Disney owns a little company you may have heard called Touchtone that is considered the \"adult\" version of Disney.  Jerry just so happens to work for Touchtone. Whenever Touchtone makes a family friendly movie (like Mission to Mars) Disney takes it away from them, and markets it as their own.  This isn't considered stealing because Disney owns Touchtone, making it legal.  There is a lot of content in this movie that kids won't get.  This is just a movie that is \"okay\" for them to see not one that they will enjoy seeing.Denzel Washington is great playing the ferocious Couch Boone.  I haven't seen him this cruelly-energized since The Hurricane (another great racial movie).  He won't win any Oscars for this, but if you're a fan, don't miss this movie.  As far as Will Patton goes, normally I don't like him.  But he does a really good job in this movie., better than I had expected.\nOverall, the movie isn't best picture worthy.  Its emotions sometimes get too emotional, and any macho guys will start to get a little uncomfortable. It can get a little too unrealistic in its friendly tone, but it doesn't cross that line of too nice that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington crosses.But, despite that, this is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. Husbands take your wives to this.  Take you kids too, they might just like it.  Note: this is a good date movie on top of that.By the way, as dramatic as it is, the movie is also very funny.  Boone's idea of football camp is really a junior military boot camp, which gets very funny at times.I give it an enthusiastic 8 out of ten.",

Grid-iron fans should find the football scenes, where many such movies fail, reasonably convincing, and the second central relationship between Julius (Wood Harris) and Gerry (Ryan Hurst) is well handled and sensitively portrayed, every bit as convincing as the rivalry between Washington and Will Patton's characters. The second half does become a bit worthy, and sometimes clich\u00e9d, treading the same ground as the majority sports movies that have gone before, but Remember the Titans has an advantage over these in that it confronts much bigger issues.

It received favorable reviews and has received a decent rating on this site.  However, this movie is barely worth renting from the video store.First off, Titans is horribly unrealistic.  This was especially disheartening, given that it is a true story.  The role of the white coach's daughter is so completely detached from reality that it is almost painful to watch her scenes.  Sadly, her scenes were not the only ones that asked far too much of the viewer (for example, the scene of the girlfriend talking to the black player on the sidelines).A second criticism is that the actors did not remotely appear to be 17-18 years of age.  Granted, this is a common problem in many movies.  However, isn't it about time we expected more out of Hollywood.  The fat kid looked 35 and the white linebacker looked at least 25.  It would truly be a concept to actually hire actors who are the age of the characters.This is not the worst movie I've seen, but it truly disappointed.  Sadly, there are not any really great footbal films out there, but Any Given Sunday and, believe it or not, Varsity Blues are superior efforts.  As far as race is concerned, there are innumerable films that are more interesting (To Kill a Mockingbird is my fav).  Go ahead and rent Titans for what it's worth, but for god's sake don't buy it.4 out of 10",

Denzel Washington plays a coach with unfair odds stacked against him but still overcomes to coach the team to an undefeated record including the playoffs and the VA state championship, his performance is powerful and I was really moved by the Gettysburg graveyard scene which officially sparked the unity between the white players and the black players - coach Boone makes an extremely valid point in this scene. But what I really appreciated was the fact that there were two white players that didn't give a damn about the segregation to begin with(Kip Pardue and Ethan Suplee[who gives a complete opposite performance from American History X]).  The character development is present in most of the characters but I particularly noticed Ryan Gosling and Kate Bosworth who play somewhat racist characters but then realize that the black people are people just the same as them.

Coach Yoast realizes if they sit their senior season out, they could lose their college scholarships. That's when Coach Yoast agrees to become the assistant. At the start of training camp, the white and black players have some difficulties getting along.  They soon learn how to play together; they even become friends.  The Titans have a spectacular season and go undefeated, but something terrible happens before the state championship.  Titans captain Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) is in a car accident and won't be able to play. After the accident, we see Bertier in his hospital room, and he only wants his black `brother' to be there.  Bertier had said earlier he would never play with a black athlete. The racial harmony that took over the football team spreads throughout the community.  Bertier's mother finally hugs his `brother,' and his girlfriend shakes his hand.  Will the Titans be able to win the state championship without their captain to guide them along?  Watch and find out.",

The different aspects of sport occur all in it, and the typical problems of people doing sport, but they are not at all everything the movie has to offer. Instead we also get many political aspects and personal conflicts. The people here are not stereotypes, nobody is just purely good or just purely evil, and not all questions about them are answered by the movie, just like in real life.This movie has a message, it has a story, and it has very good acting.

            "content": "Boaz Yakin has directed a rousing true story drama. Not being a football fan, I entered planning to take a nap. However, this uplifting tale of the dawn of integration in Alexandria, Virginia in the early 70's, draws the viewer in and doesn't let up for a moment. Denzel Washington stars as Coach Boone who is brought in replacing Coach Yoast (winningly portrayed by Will Patton), previous coach of the all white T.C. Williams High School football team.  The two local high schools are being integrated and so is the football team. Boone, not only has to contend with the divisiveness of the local community, but with the job of creating a black and white team that will work together to play and win on the football field.  Washington's Knute Rockne-like orations to the teens are surprisingly straightforward and sincerely delivered. During a boot camp training period he gradually gets the boys to jell as a team and, more surprisingly as friends and equals off the field. In particular, a speech to the boys on the grounds of the Gettysburg cemetery is particularly moving. This carries over to the high school population in general when the team comes home, and helps the community at large deal with integration. Performances are top notch all around. Fine use is made of period music and the expanse of the wide screen. Even wise use of surround sound brings the audience right into the thick of the battles on the gridiron. Best of all, the film is rated PG. As beautifully written by Gregory Allen Howard, use of coarse language is at an absolute minimum, and it doesn't adversely affect the film one bit. All in all, this is so far the best of the fall releases; one the whole family can see and enjoy.",

Stories like this are not made up, they're written in history. Its about a black man (Washington) taking over as coach from a white man (Patton) of a High School back in the early 70's in Alexandria, Virginia. As you can imagine the whites do not take too friendly to this, especially when Patton's character is a championship coach. Denzels task of then trying to make a winning team is clearly hardened as both sides (blacks & whites) of the community are split down the center.But Denzel does more than get the team talking to each other in this heart warming film. He brings the whole community together in Alexandria. Of course this film is about football but the strong theme of racism and how to overpower it really does overshadow this, making it not just enjoyable by sports fans. The story is predictable at times but it's the journey that you go on in the film is what matters.This is a real heart warming story that should leave everyone feeling good at the end, recommended for everyone.8* out 10",

Not the least of its charms are the seriousness with which it takes the race issue and its rating- i.e., this is a movie a whole family could watch together before having a conversation about racism and personal responsibility for treating others with respect. Denzel Washington rarely gives a bad performance, and he didn't here. Will Patton is equally likable. Here are two men devoted to teaching their young charges about life, and realize that it is their responsibility to arm them for battle in the real world. The lovely story of friendship between Julius and the doomed Gerry is poignant indeed. Classy people come from all different races and backgrounds. The one thing that really pulls it together is the audience's awareness that this is based on a true story. I'm sure they've 'Disney-fied' it, but what would come off as incredibly cheesy and manipulative as an entirely fictional story comes off as, well, inspirational when it has at least a grain of truth.",

Well, it was based on a true story & sorry that for once, the true story had a happy ending (in some ways). This review does contain some info about the plot, so discontinue reading if you don't want to know about the story.Case in point about the predictability, when Denzel Washington's character, coach Boone takes the boys on a 3am run at their training camp, it seems like just another outlandish way of disciplining them. Even his assistant coach, Yoast, played by Will Patton tells him, hey, these are boys, we're not in the Marines. But he has a purpose. When they finally stop, exhausted, they are standing at Gettysburg where you can see headstones in the background. He tells them then & there that they must come together, despite any differences in color. It is a moving and not overly sentimental speech that has effect for the boys and the viewer. The friendships that the boys develop while perhaps presented in a predictable way, are still genuine and true to the story. The acting from everyone is first rate as well. Denzel, what is there to say about him? He is outstanding in every film. No doubt he will get the academy award for this film, since he should've gotten it for The Hurricane last year. Will Patton is equally terrific and his character just as inspiring and honorable as Washington's. In a scene that is filled with significance, Patton's character tells him that it's his pride that has lead to some racist people throwing a rock through his window, that happened to be on a night when Patton's white daughter was visiting Washington's daughter. It looks like Patton has the best \"argument\" until Washington's character points out, now she knows a little of what it feels like for my daughter ALL the time. This movie has so much heart and is about the best and worst in all of us. It was very well done & inspiring. Best of all, it's a true story.Great for the entire family to watch, together.",

And to be truthful, it's not like *that much* has changed in 30 years.  There's still a lesson to be learned here and movies such as these are as helpful as any hard-edged, \"face the facts, God-damnit\" type of flick.This may all seem too simplistic for those who hate football, but there really is a purity when football is played at this level.  There aren't many other places where this sort of *coming together* could happen.

A very good look into race relations and how one of the best ways to improve relations is through getting to know the other person (people are rarely what they appear to be).  The key to Coach Boone's bringing the team together was his getting them to learn about each other.  It has been said many times that sports is a great metaphor for learning life's lessons. Remember The Titans drives that point home.  Here is a story of a team coming together and a town learning that and starting to come together as well.  The movie builds itself well, has humor in it, and involves you emotionally.

Further there are two commentary tracks - one by the director and one by the real people - the two coaches who lived the real life story. I was amazed how much the real coaches sounded like the people who portrayed them on screen.  I was also very impressed that the coaches said that almost all the story was accurately converted to film.  They point out a few small differences and why - e.g. The white coach had four daughters, not just the one, and the one was not quite as outspoken and involved in real life.

The plot of the movie was that football is a way of life for some people. The local school board was forced to integrate a black school and a white school. Both of the schools were really passionate about football. Having put both of the high schools together forced them to combine the football teams. Footballs great tradition was put to the test. I knew that schools were segregated, but I didn't know that school boards could force integration amongst a black and a white school. I just thought that progressively white people just started accepting and almost welcoming black people into \u00a8their\u00a8 areas. I have seen many movies set in this time period. I think every movie i\u00b4ve seen regarding segregation has been an awesome movie. In the movie, the boys on the football team got along pretty quickly. I thought that was a little bit weird because usually from what i\u00b4ve learned throughout school, it was not rare for whites to be absolute jerks for no apparent reason to POCs. Boaz Yakin was the director of this movie. I wholeheartedly believe that he did a really amazing job in portraying this movie the way that he did. The way he directed the boys in getting along with one another was honestly so beautiful.\nI liked how the boys got along rather quickly. I liked how the movie wasn't ALL about the boys and football.

In the case of this movie, this film tries to show racism within a particular high school football team. Their attempt was promising but the movie's aim was not to show the racial harmony and problems but rather simply about football. This movie is based on a true story that talks about an African American football coach named Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) who is hired by a Virginia High School during 1971 to coach the Titans on his first year in T.C. Williams High School replacing Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) whom is beloved by the school. Both men are not happy with the situation and circumstances they are put into. But they agree that for the sake of the team, they must cooperate and achieve their goal. A great example would be when Yoast tells Boone to treat his players like marines rather than high school students and does so. I thought that both Boone and Yoast were portrayed quite nicely, Boone does not show any sense of noble or arrogance and neither does Yoast show any signs of racism of being a racist for that matter. In fact, both characters show their ambition to win and how skilled they are at football. Another scene, which I personally enjoyed, was the ending where there was the closing touchdown, I felt that it resembled the end and victory over racism. The Film somewhat historically accurate but I felt that there was a lot of drama throughout the film. Of course, Hollywood loves to alter certain parts of the story to make it more \"interesting\" or \"compelling\". It also seems that the film was \"exaggerated\" but overall, the film was quite accurate. But there are some raising questions during the film, such as we could only see that the Whites are afraid of losing their positions in the team thus not wanting to play with the blacks, but what about the blacks themselves? Didn't they transfer from an all black school? This film shows that the white people are very possessive and want to resent the blacks, and that the blacks themselves are feeling grateful and happy due to transferring to a better school. Another questioned raised is that what happened to the coach in the all blacks school? Why was Boone transferred to coach but not the coach from the all blacks school? This shows that the film has left out some possible information that might affect the movie dramatically. \"Remember the Titans\" is a predictable and heart warming film with strong emotional themes and powerful music but there are some areas where the film was lacking such as stated before, over-exaggeration of dramatization and the limited solution of racism depicted during the film. Overall, I would give this film a rating of 7/10.-Nicholas Chong",

When they desegregated the high school there was a struggle in the beginning. But during the football boot camp they were forced to come together. And doing so created not just a team but a family, many of the team members continued to be friends as well. Also when the team was winning game after game, it made the town look at themselves and what they were doing unto others.",

Things were happening and I was like ... um, what? I don't know anything about American football so there was a whole lot of weird stuff I didn't get, and the whole militaristic training thing is weird, plus there was the schmaltzy music that plays in the background of every movie that showcases American exceptionalism. I worry that it glosses over a lot of the more ugly and difficult parts of this 'based on a true' story. There were some things like not being allowed in the bar, but the movie doesn't give any sense of the dread and fear that must have hung over those boys. But. It is a great story and if you're looking for some entertainment that makes you feel like there is some hope for the better aspects of humanity, this is worth watching. It's difficult to make each of those boys stand out as a seperate individuals, but they do that really well. There are some really wonderful characters on that team. And when the schmaltzy music isn't playing, the rest of the sound track is great.",

As the movie ends I wish I could continue to know these people and experience more of life's twists and turns and ups and downs in their company. You want to watch them continue to grow and see what happens in the lives of people you've come to know.

Of course, it's not a true story (it never said it was, it said it was BASED on a true story), but it felt played and tiresome.  I like moral movies that have football in them, but this was a football movie with a touch of morality in it (the same reasons The Rookie didn't really work for me and many I know, but substitute football for baseball).  *Yawn*  The real reasons I didn't enjoy this had to do with the Sunshine character and his gratuitous kiss with the captain of the football team, but I won't go much into that.  I hate when people use these reviews as podiums to voice their outrageous and unfounded opinions.  All in all, Denzel Washington (who I find acts identical in nearly every role, with the exception of facial hair or the occasional fro) couldn't even save this movie for me.

Now, I'm not really up for movies that base it on a true story concerning sports, don't ask me why, but this one is an exception.  The acting was good and it just shows how ignorant and closed minded people are when it comes to the human race.  If we were all white or black, I'm 110% sure this world would suck.  Heck, the funny thing is when the fights happened in this movie, I pretty much rooted for the black people, not saying I'm going against my own race, but... It was such a joy to see everybody finally getting along and it was also heartbreaking towards the end when they lost their star linebacker to a car accident to only have him watch the championship game from his hospital bed to getting killed in another car wreck 10 years later.  I've only seen this movie three times, but I guess the old saying third time's the charm is really true because I liked the movie before, but I wasn't really as touched as I was the third time.  I think what would have made this movie better is if it took place in the south where the real racial hatred still lingers on today, like in Georgia or Alabama.  Also seeing that it takes place in my birthstate of Virginia, and not too far from where my dad lives, in fact, I think my aunt or somebody she knows went to that school around that time, it was totally breathtaking.

Coach Boone tells the boys that the men who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg were fighting the same fight that they are still fighting for among themselves and that if they do not pull together as a team they too will be destroyed just like the men who fought in the battle.

Some small spoilers may occur in these comments.I was the age of the coaches daughters in 1971, and I can remember the tension in the nation during this period of integration.  This movie captures that era - captures the feelings that were being spread at that time.  It's obvious the language was cleaned up for Disney - the brick would have said Coach N, not Coach Coon.By the same token, what it does also show is how a sports team in a community can bring pride to the community, no matter what the divisions are.  It doesn't matter whether you understand football or not - the plays on the field were not the defining moments of the movie.  Simply having one of your supposed teammates let you down - and then having to re-examine your own values because of what happened - THOSE ideas are what this movie is about.Denzel gives in this movie an Academy Award winning performance.  As a sports movie, this ranks up there with the pantheon of basketball movies, Hoosiers.  (If you don't get football, then don't come to Indiana and ask about basketball.

Also, since this movie is based on a true story, it is inevitable that it would be somewhat predictable. Predictable things happen in real life.I enjoyed every aspect of this movie, including the bonding and the singing of Motown songs.  I too, have broken out \"in song\" when goofing around with friends or when making the work day a little more \"interesting\" with coworkers.The friendships, which overcame racial bigotry and intolerance, in this movie is an exact depiction of real life in American society today.  The world is still far from perfect and racial prejudice still thrives.  But we can still see where we were 30 years ago, and where we are today as far a race relations go-and we are still evolving.  I think there are literally thousands of true stories that can be told about unlikely friendships of people of different races...people who eventually saw past the physical, and into one's character and learned a valuable lesson along the way. `Remember the Titans' is just very unique and had the opportunity to be told in a wonderful, tasteful manner.If I have to point out anything \"unrealistic\" about the movie it would have to be the choice of racial slurs used-they are quite tame compared with real life.  But the script was purposely written that way so the movie can be viewed and enjoyed by vast, diverse audiences.I am glad I saw this movie, and would recommend anyone else, who is contemplating seeing it, to just see it.  I initially put off seeing the movie due to reading comments about how \"predictable\" it was and comments like, \"Oh just another movie about how some guys over come their odds to win the BIG GAME\".  But the movie is about so much more-our history as a society and about values and lessons in integrity.

            "content": "In Remember the Titans, Herman Boone is offered a head coaching position to coach the TC Williams High School football team to help unite the African American and white players. However, Boone is threatened with losing his head coaching job to white assistant coach, Bill Yoast, if he loses a single game during the season. Remember the Titans does a great job of displaying the problems of segregation in decades prior by effectively analyzing the different characters, using various camera angles, and utilizing skilled actors.\nThroughout the movie, Remember the Titans deeply explains the relationships between the main characters and their individual personalities. For example, the two coaches, Herman Boone and Bill Yoast, are very selfless characters who prioritize others over themselves. Initially, Herman Boone was going to decline the head coaching job, but after realizing the positive impact that it would have on the black community as a whole, he decides to take the job. On the other hand, during one of the games, Bill Yoast realizes that the game is rigged by the referees. As soon as he makes notice of it, Yoast threatens to report the scandal if the referees don't call the game fairly from that point. Since the team ends up winning, Yoast loses his eligibility to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but he does it to give his players the best opportunity to win the game. At the same time, the movie closely analyzes the relationship between Julius Campbell, the African American team captain, and Gerry Bertier, the white team captain. This relationship is a symbol for the relationship between the white people and African Americans during this time period in general. Initially, the two star players did not get along with each other, but eventually they create an unbreakable bond. After Gerry gets paralyzed from a car accident during a team celebration, Julius and the rest of the team visits him in the hospital. Julius has a talk with Gerry in his room about how far the team has come from the beginning of the season and the \"brotherhood\" that they have created. Through the analysis of the four main characters, Remember the Titans is able to effectively showcase how far America has come in regards to segregation. Compared to years prior in which there were no integrated schools at all, the black and white students were now amicable with one another for the most part.\nBy using various angle shots in different times, Remember the Titans reinforces the concept of a team as well as the ongoing segregation. For example, towards the beginning of the movie when the camera shows Herman Boone along with the rest of the coaches, it uses a close shot featuring Boone in the center. This is important to emphasize the fact that Boone is the leader of the coaching staff and has the upmost authority. Also, in the scene where the team is just outside the bus, a long shot is taken from the area where the large white crowd is facing Herman Boone. This is used to help indicate the large white population that is against the smaller black community. The long shot displays that Herman Boone is essentially fighting the entire white population alone without the help of anyone. Occurring towards the beginning of the movie, this is crucial to show that ending segregation was a bleak option in this point in time. However towards the middle of the movie when the team has a meeting inside the gym, a long shot is used to capture the whole team gathering in the center of the gym. Displaying all the white and African American players, this shot is essential to emphasize that the team has united despite the two distinct ethnicities. In comparison to the previous example of showing that integration was a bleak option, this moment proves that ending segregation is slowly becoming in reach. The close shots and long shots are incorporated throughout the movie in various times to help emphasize certain moments or characters. These camera angles ultimately help to portray the ongoing segregation during this time period.\nIn Remember the Titans, the two main actors are Denzel Washington who plays Herman Boone and Will Patton who plays Bill Yoast. These two actors perfectly suit there role within the movie as they each have their own unique talents in regards to acting. Denzel Washington is a very eloquent speaker who thrives in delivering moving speeches that tend to impact the audience. As the head coach of a football team that is battling the problems that come with integration, Washington is tasked with giving many inspirational speeches to his players in hopes of uniting them. On the other hand, Will Patton comes off as a very soothing person who tends to comfort other people. As Herman Boone's assistant coach, Patton must step aside and follow the lead of the head coach. Known as a strict, demanding coach, Boone expects a lot out of his players. Thus, Will Patton is often the person who consoles all the black players. Patton's ability to effectively do this played a large role in the movie to help show how far equality has come throughout time. Having the privilege to have two very talented, well-suited actors, Remember the Titans was able to successfully convey the concept of equality and teamwork.\nOverall, I thought that Remember the Titans was a great inspirational movie that included an interesting plot. Since I enjoy both watching and playing football, I thought that the concept of a football team facing the hardships of integration was a really interesting idea to emphasize the tough times of the past. Remember the Titans is a great movie for everyone to watch but more specifically for the black community as well as football fans.",

The problem with this film is that IT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!!!  After watching this movie, people will get the idea that Alexandria, VA is the poor, rural redneck bigot capital of the world, which is NOT true.  I live in Alexandria, and it is a bustling, diverse, densely-crowded Washington DC Suburb located in metropolitan Northern Virginia (which is FAR different from rural Republican Southern Virginia); not a rustic Georgia swamp-town as it appears in the film.  I also attend TC Williams (which looks nothing like the school featured in the film, and is in actuality one of the most culturally diverse schools in the US) and I met many of the players from the successful 1971 team at a school assembly around six months before the films release - it was not racial black-white tension as exaggerated in the film, but more of a long standing rivalry between the two city high schools, Francis Hammond and George Washington High Schools (which are both now Middle Schools) that caused issues in the team at the start of the season.Even though the film strays from the true story, it is still worth watching for the superb acting (hats off to Denzel Washington yet again, along with the supporting cast) great cinematography, and good story, even being a bent truth of a story.",

I think some of these other comments that talk about how it was lacking in different areas and the negativity towards the film need to lighten up and stop being so critical and deep.  Take the movie for what it is.  Yes it is a feel good movie.  I do agree with the one comment about the song at the end of the movie, kinda threw me for a loop, but didnt destroy how much I enjoyed the film.  The film was funny, racy (of course), nail biting, it had it all.  I dont cry during films, but I felt that feeling coming, but sucked it up of course.  I dont know much about the factual side of the movie, but beyond all that, it was a great moving film.  Denzel was stellar, but then again when is he not.  For those who are saying that I must not know anything about film, your wrong, I am a film major and have work on REAL films, short and feature (not just PA work either).  The problem with most people who know anything about film is they think that movies have to have deep underlying messages, extremely compelling acting, and bar none directing to be a great movie.  Learn to look at movies as they are, dont go into them expecting a glorious work of art all the time.  Those that are will stand out for that.  Remember the Titans is a wonderful movie for the entire family to see.  Id go as far as to say worth seeing it more than once!!",

Good if that's what you want to watch, but it pitches itself as a treatise on race relations and thus should do better. Every character is simple, one-dimensional; the conflicts all seem contrived. Yes it's \"based on a true story.\" Well if the true story is really this corny it should have been adapted. Disney might as well have made the movie as an animated feature. The stereotyping and exaggeration are as extreme as they often are in Disney toons. I rate it a 4 as it is watchable, but certainly no showpiece. Oh yes ... next time they make a movie about high school students, how about looking for actors younger than 25?",

This causes conflict, but once the boys on the team have bonded up at camp despite racial lines, they are forced to come back to school and face reality. The issues between the two coaches are interesting and audiences will find things to like and hate about both of them.

Coach Boone constantly has to deal with his players fussing with each other over race, but they are able to come together for a perfect season. In the movie, Boone says, \"In Greek Mythology, the Titans were greater than even the gods. Well, that field out there, that's our universe. Let's rule it like Titans.\" is truly an incredible inspirational quote from the movie, and I would choose this quote to describe to someone what this movie was about.

One of my neighbors used to live in Virginia back in the 70s and while the racism wasn't as bad as it was portrayed in the movie, she said that there were many people who went out of their way to show their bigotry. The point of the movie is that it happened...there was a school named TC Williams and there were two coaches named Bill Yoast and Herman Boone that worked with a young team of black and white football players who overcame their own barriers towards each other. These two men are outstanding and Will Patton and Denzel Washington did a marvelous job portraying them and re-creating their best and even bad moments. It is Disney so it is a feel good movie which I think, is what most people enjoy - without being cheesy of course.

The racial tensions of the film are excellently portrayed in a very real way. After their initial mistrust and hostility, the players' realizations that they are a team and not that different after all is really riveting to watch, Each of the prominent players has a distinct personality and is portrayed very well.

I ain't dead\" and \"I don't care if you're black, white, blue or polka-dotted\" (something like that). The plot is so amazing and the actors were great.

I am a fan of sports films in general because of the way they lift your spirits and are great if you're looking for the feel good factor. But this film is extra special. It has a fantastic cast (Denzel Washington is amazing in this film) and the way the film deals with the issue of race and how it was dealt with in the 70's is really strong. It has all of the feel good factors of a sports film but manages to deal with important issues along side this. As the film is based on a true story, it makes the storyline and the characters much more identifiable and you really care about what happens to them. I like the way that the film portrays the prejudices of both races. It doesn't focus on one point of view and try to place more blame on one culture. When the boys come together at bootcamp it is incredibly heart warming, in particular the relationship between Julius and Gary. These characters are the ring leaders of the two groups in the film and their union brings the whole team together. They have one of the best film friendships, it seems incredibly genuine. 'left side...strong side.' Another friendship that develops throughout the film is that between Coach Boone and Coach Yoakes. They are never going to be the best of friends but the film follows their journey as they learn to respect one another and learn 'to trust the soul of a man and not just the look of him.' All in all this film is a fantastic sports movie and incredibly touching, so i would strongly recommend it.",

However, the strength and real beauty of \"Remember The Titans\" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In \"Remember The Titans\" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles.

The movie focuses around the football team of a recently integrated high school in racist Virginia of the 70's. The team battles the heavy racism of the town and overcomes with a spirit that brings the entire town together.The film features more than just the story of a team winning it all with some sort of magical happening as many other sports movies are. This film shows a group of teenagers who can overcome the racism that lives relentlessly in their lives and go on to turn it around and bring the entire town together. The differences between all of the boys on the team are set aside as they instead come together in a way that allows for them to go all the way and win in the face of racism.I highly recommend everyone to see this movie, not because it is just a good movie about football, but because it is a good movie about settling your differences with others.

The music and characters are lovable, the friendships feel genuine, the ending pulls at the heartstrings. Cool movie, would recommend.",

            "content": "I grew up watching this movie and it has been one of my favorites for a long time. When I was really young, I used to say that I liked it just to impress my dad by liking a football movie (he loves football), but once I got older, I actually did love it. I just love the feel of it, the characters, and the growth that the team goes through.\nThe movie is about a high school football team that is put together right after the desegregation of black and white students in schools. Throughout the movie, the team grows closer and become a really good football team.\nThis movie is based on a true story, but it is not very accurate. I think it may be accurate in portraying what it was like after schools were desegregated, but not totally accurate in portraying the specific story of this high school football team. I think a lot of what it shows still applies today even though that event occurred in the 70's. Today, there are still people fighting against change and against people who are different than them. There is still discrimination among many groups all over the world.\nThe director of this movie is Boaz Yakin. He did an amazing job directing this movie. This is the only movie I have seen that he has directed. Some of the main actors in this movie are Denzel Washington, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, and Will Patton. They are all great actors and played their roles well. I have seen Denzel Washington in other movies and I love him as an actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Gerry and Julius become really good friends after hating each other. I just loved the connection that they had.\nEven though this movie is not very accurate to the story it is based on, I still love it. I thought it was really well acted, and the characters worked well together. I liked that it brought out serious themes like hard work, equality, and treating others with kindness, but was also fun and entertaining. This is a movie that I definitely recommend.",

The movie takes place at a time when racism was still very much at large in the United States, especially in the state of Virginia at T.C. Williams High School. Through all of this, Coach Herman Boone, played by the iconic Denzel Washington, is tasked with the large order of getting white and African American football players to co-exist well together. The film deals with racism, stereotypes and obviously athletics. One thing that worked very well were the memorable characters in the film. If you've seen the film, there's no way you could ever forget Gerry Bertier, Julius Campbell, Petey Jones, The Rev, Big Louie and definitely Sunshine. Good directors and producers know that to put a film over the top you need good characters that you can connect with and producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Boaz Yakin do just that.Being a college student, Remember The Titans is definitely a movie I will want my children to see one day. The lessons they will learn from viewing this film are priceless, and they can't miss out on an all- time classic sports movie.",

I can tell that was the turning point for almost all the football players. That scene gave me goosebumps. I also like how once they all got along they started to play a lot better, and it showed against the rest of the other teams. Their are a lot of high schools that still deal with segregation and racism in the deep south.",

The telling issue for me is that my son, who is not a football fan, also thinks that this is a great movie. That proves to me that this movie isn't really about football, but about overcoming racial bigotry and how the human spirit can be united regardless of the odds under the right conditions. This film features outstanding performances, especially from Denzel Washington and Will Patton as the black head coach and his white assistant, and wonderful performances from the boys on the 'team' also. The musical track, including the composed music and the songs selected for background music during games and at other times, adds to the power of the performances and lifts the story beyond just a sports analogy and makes it appealing to those like my own son who really don't care about football. He sat rapt, watching the story within the story of young men uniting against racial prejudice and taking an entire Southern town with them into a new age of tolerance and respect. I highly recommend this film to football fans, families looking for an uplifting and positive experience, and to those looking for a real-life example of how much better we are united as human beings than segregated as 'races'. Here's to the Titans of TC Williams High School, and to the movie that tells their story so beautifully!",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is a movie that focuses on the racial issues that were going on during that time and the struggles a football team had to overcome to make it to their championship game. Coach Herman (played by Denzel Washington), plays the role of the first African American coach to coach a team with mixed players. He is assisted by Coach Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who helps him as his defensive coordinator. I think this is such a strong movie because it gives us a good view on how bad these issues were during these times, and it was based on a true story on the Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia. Ryan Hurst (who played Gerry), was the captain of the white part of the football team. Wood Harris (who played Julius), was the captain of the black part of the football team. I think these two characters made this movie because they broke through the racial barrier and take this team to the championship. But most importantly they became best friends. In fact, towards the end of the movie they refer to each other as brothers because they grew that close to each other. Another aspect that I enjoyed so much was the music choice. The music that they put in this movie really brought out an exciting view to the movie. Overall, I would rate this a 10/10. I think everyone should watch this movie even if they do not like sports because this movie is so much greater than just sports. It is a very touching story of a group of black and white kids creating an unbreakable bond in the form of a football team. Or to better describe it, a family.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is one of the best movies of this year. As moving as it is inspiring, I'm not ashamed to admit to tearing up at one of the more dramatic points of the story. This movie is remarkable in the way it captured the atmosphere of 1971, when public schools were forced to integrate and the public protested in the streets. Tension between adults was taught to their children, who fought in the hallways at school, and as sad as is the idea of learned racism, it is a fact that our society has fought hard and well against. In this day and age we take integration for granted, and it is easy to forget the way things were just thirty years ago. Remember the Titans is about football, but not to the extent to which it is about people. It is about people learning to live together, overcoming their fears and mistrust to come together as a team and work together toward something great. During football camp, the head coach, played by Denzel Washington, the players are forced not only to play together, but also to room together and eat together. Through the course of the movie, the young men go from mistrusting and disliking each other to tolerating each other, and from that to even liking each other and loving each other. So many lines capture the spirit of this movie, lines that speak of looking at a man for his soul, not his color. I won't get into the nitty-gritty of moviemaking here; the directing, acting, writing, and general storyline are all pretty close to flawless. Remember the Titans is a thoroughly enjoyable tale, and one that speaks of a harmony that America still strives for today. I personally think that every person in America, especially those who are too young to remember those difficult days, ought to see this movie. It does a good job of teaching us a lesson without it coming across like propaganda. Remember the Titans will touch your soul.",

And I am sure that if I was ten or eleven it would have been good to watch.  But the truth is this movie has problems, lots of them.It is \"based on a true story.\"  After seeing the movie, I can believe the following is true: (1) Alexandria, VA exists; (2) the high school there has a football team; (3) in 1971 it won a bunch of games; (4) the coach was newly hired, and black; (5) some people didn't like it, and it took some getting used to; (6) 1971 was a time, in general, in America, where racial integration was a source of bitter contention in many places; (7) Alexandria probably had some unease with the transition.  Everything else about this movie has to be manufactured by Disney.  I think the low point for me was when Gary's girlfriend runs on the field to shake Junior's hand before the game.  See, previously she was one of the people unwilling to accept blacks into the school.  But now she's learned (somewhere off-screen) that she was wrong.  (1) She recognizes it; (2) she has enough poise as a high schooler to admit her beliefs were ill-founded; (3) she picks a dramatic/extremely inappropriate moment to acknowledge her change.  What poignancy!  Gee, we learned a lot about ourselves.  There were so many \"movie conventions,\" flat, stereotypical characters and cliches in this movie that I felt cheated.  The good characters learn something about themselves and change and grow, the bad characters are called out by the good characters - we don't know much about the bad characters, just that they're bad - and they are put in their place.  The good guys win, the bad guys lose.  Minds are changed.  People grow.  A soundtrack plays.Also, remember Jerry Maguire?  That kid was cute, audiences love that. Let's put one of those in our movie.  We'll give her lots of lines, and we'll be constantly reminded how unusual she is - most little girls don't know football in depth, but she does!! - and hence, comedy.Every time I tried to like this movie (and I went in hoping to like it) it spat out packaged non-reality that jarred me into deep irritation.

Kudos to Disney for putting it out and not making it too saccharine.  Those that have said it was too \"clean\" miss the point.  Disney's goal is to entertain, not necessarily provide social commentary and they succeeded here.\nWhen movies based on true events move me, I look up the real story.  I was surprised to find out the movie was pretty faithful.  For those who are interested, there is a website out there put together by the '71 Titans. As is almost always the case, the truth does not always match the story, but in these cases, the fudging of facts made the movie more entertaining. Some interesting things I found out:1) Ron \"Sunshine\" Bass is not \"gay\" as was implied in some other comments. He works for ABC and is married with 3 kids.  Unlike the movie, he actually beat \"Rev\" out for the starting job.2) Gerry Berthier did get injured in a car crash and became a wheelchair athelete.  However his accident took place on the way to an awards dinner AFTER the championship game.  He actaully played in the game. Also the friendship between him and Julius really occurred.  What's interesting is that in the Titans website there is a picture of Berthier and unlike the movie, he wears glasses and had shoulder length hair! He died when his car was hit by a drunk driver in 1981, which is when the movie begins.3) Lewis Lasik didn't transfer in from NJ but had been a student at TC Williams all 4 years4) Apparently, the TC Williams team blew out their opponents in every game, including the championship.  In a USA Today article, one of the Titans says that combining two teams made the combined team exceptionally strong and they dominated their games.5) Alexandria VA, is not \"red neck\" central.  TC Williams High was, and is considered one of the most diverse schools in the VA area.6) The last discrepancy is a sad one.  It involves Coach Yoast's daughter Cheryl.  Sadly, she married, had 3 kids, but died a few years before the film was made.  I, for one, am glad this was NOT mentioned in the movie.None of these discrepancies should take away from an excellent movie that has a lot to say about brotherhood and achieving a common goal.  With all the crap that passes for \"great movies\", we need more like this one.Rating: 9.5 out of 10 (the soul singing by Lasik WAS a bit corny) :)",

Movies and shows based on history alter timelines and change things to make it dramatic and have faster pacing. The acting in this movie is excellent. And of course it's sentimental, it is DISNEY. We watch Disney to get the warm and fuzzies. An enjoyable family movie.",

When the Titans are returning from a game, Ronnie Bass (Sunshine) is seen wearing a Lettermans Jacket; Letter awards are not given until after the season is over..........The movie dealt about the problems that occurred in the south when athletic teams were integrated. One of the most poignant issues was how the team came together thru the football season including both coaches. Whatever differences that started with the schools integration were soon worked out by the athletes themselves. I think the saddest scenes is the graveyard scene where coaches, football players all come together as one.",

True teamwork, respect and genuine bonding happens in many areas of life. Small towns -- and large ones -- are brought together by their young people's sports endeavors. This is a wonderful movie. It was good to see Will Patton play a likable character. Denzel Washington was very believable as a tough coach, even though he was almost too understated at times. Hayden Panettiere was a little spitfire as the coach's daughter. The football players were also outstanding. Even the lighting reminded me of true high school sports -- it's dark on a lot of those fields. Excellent movie.",

Its really inspirational, appealing and powerful movie that shows how nothing is impossible if we really strive for it. The characters in the movie are well chosen and well played as well.The role of 'The Coach' played by (one of the most likable actor) Denzel Washington is really puissant. The plot of the movie is woven around how 'an indomitable will' of few youths acted in good faith and leadership (by the 'Coach')can make big difference in the society, be it in field of sport or racist-nuances. The movie portrays the building up of team spirit and unity ,(filled with effusive touch of small subtle interactions)overlooking the differences between them, very well. The Story is inspirational,Direction is at par, Screenplay is excellent, music is peppy for the background,Acting is homogenous but Denzel Washington stands out not only because he is the lead in the film but also because of his innate style of dialogue delivery which always gives strength to the role and weight to the character he plays. A must watch for those who like engrossing and piquant movies. I am sure its effect will not wear easily and who knows you might also \"Remember the Titans\". Watch it and you will know what I mean.",

            "review_title": "Remember the Titans",
            "content": "Remember the Titans Engaging But ExaggeratedEven though the film Remember the Titans, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman was a very emotionally engaging and entertaining movie, the sequence of events that occurred were seemingly exaggerated. The film Remember the Titans was inspired by the actual events that occurred in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, which explores many of the fundamental issues of racism in the 19th century.The film, directed by Boaz Yakin, follows the story of Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), an African American who comes to T.C Williams High School to coach the T.C. William's football team, the Titans. Racially divided, Herman Boone faces difficulty in getting the boys on his team to connect with each other, and also faces many instances of conflict with his white assistant coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who had previously been the head coach. After going to training camp together and forcing the African American boys and white boys to further integrate and get to know each other, eventually the team learns to come together despite the racial divide that is still present in their town, Alexandria, Virginia. As the movie progresses, the bond between the players of both races develop and grow stronger, despite the initial hostility that plagued both the blacks and whites on the team. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst also star in the film, playing the characters Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier, respectively. Both characters play important roles in the film, leading and setting an example of the strong relationship that can be developed regardless of skin color. Initially facing a lot of discrimination from other teams, parents, and townspeople, together the Titans eventually start to change the views of the common people through football, in which they continue to have an unbelievable season. The film Remember the Titans was overall a very well made drama that at the same time also informed viewers of the issue that surrounded that time period. Through out the film, you begin to gain a great love for football after seeing how it affectively brings together the whites and African Americans in the movie. Furthermore the choice of music further enhanced the emotional connection with the film while also exaggerating it to make it more amusing. An example being where the song Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terell was played in a scene where everyone was joyfully singing together in the locker rooms. The storyline seemed well developed and was easy to follow, always leaving the viewer interested and engaged with the film. However, in comparison to how the events actually occurred, the screenplay did seem exaggerated and in some cases, the characters misrepresented. For example, near the beginning of the film, on the street you see angry citizens, both black and white, ready to attack each other while standing on the opposite side of the street, divided by only a few policemen. Even though at that time there was a lot of racial tension, the film did over exaggerate the conditions. Ronnie Bass who was portrayed by Kip Pardue in the film was quoted saying, \"They had a community divided down black and white, and it really wasn't like that in 1971 Alexandria,\" in an interview with the Greenville News. Besides this, the scene in which Herman Boone woke his team up at 3:00 am to go to the Gettysburg battlefield to give a motivational speech seemed far fetched from what actually happened. Furthermore, it was Ronnie Bass who also seemed to have been misrepresented in the film. In the film, Ronnie Bass was portrayed as being a hippie who was attracted to guys, where in one scene even ends up kissing a fellow teammate on the lips. However in actuality, these events did not occur and was only added for audience amusement. As for the historical accuracy of the film, the producers and directors of Remember the Titans did affectively present the issue of racism and discrimination in towns and schools at the time. However when looking at a historical timeline of the events that occurred, the film seemed to be a little off as well. In the film, T.C Williams High School is seen as the first high school in their championship tournament to fully integrate black and whites together in 1971. However in reality, T.C Williams High School saw the integration of white and black students in 1965 where at that point, other schools had also began to integrate sports teams and classes as well. As stated before, even with the racial tension that was present at the time, it was not as bad as what was portrayed in the movie, where people were protesting on the first day of school. All in all, the film Remember the Titans is a well-produced film that keeps you emotionally engaged through the events that occur and the characters that are portrayed. Remember the Titans is definitely a movie to watch that will leave you satisfied, but should also be known that in some cases, the events that occurred are slightly exaggerated and inaccurate.",

Being able to listen to the two coaches talk about their experience that year and show their solid friendship was great.

Denzel, to no one's surprise, gives a knock out performance as Herman Boone. The rest of the cast does a great job creating their own characters.

Firstly, the school in real life have been racially integrated before the merging happen in 1965. White people are portrayed as the hero in this movie as they are portrayed to be the antagonist yet they resolve the conflict themselves. Although this movie seemed to support black in a glance, the black are portrayed as the weak who can only rely on white to resolve their conflict which can be seen through how Bertier (white) sacrifices himself in order for society to approve the blacks. It's ironic that some stereotypes regarding social class are still imbedded through this movie although the main objective was to discard those classes. Throughout the movie, white are shown to be prideful shown where Bertier (student) confront coach Boone (black) degrading him.It's yet another clich\u00e9 plot where coach Boone (black) took over coach Yoast (white) job position and fight for their place which in the end agrees to accept each other. Blacks are portrayed as dictatorial through coach Boone showing how they are thirsty for power destroying the good impression towards black. This movie also shows black as the upper social class through their clothe when they are not.",

Set in 1971 against a backdrop of forced integration and mandatory bussing, Washington's character, Coach Boone, struggles to take two teams, one white and one black, and build one winning team out of them. The movie deals with the stereotypes and racial prejudices so prevalent at the time, huge obstacles in the path of one man who just wants to win football games.  Adding fuel to the fire of hatred is affirmative action, which places Boone in the head coaching position over the town's hall of fame white coach, Yoast. Despite these obstacles Boone manages to unite the team, staff, and eventually the town while he leads the Titans to victory, learning along the way some lessons of his own. This isn't your typical Jerry Bruckheimer film.  There aren't any big budget special effects or high-tech glitz.  Instead there is solid acting built around an outstanding screenplay.  The characters are extraordinarily well developed, with great depth, which is no surprise since they are based on living people. Perhaps the biggest fault of this movie is that there was no slow part during which to slip out of the theater.

I am sure though that they felt the same as the Black Men do, but we were a defeated people.  Not because of wisdom or a strong back.  But for many different reasons that we all know and are afraid at times to discuss.  But the Blacks have come out on top in my opinion.

And I can understand his concern, there is such a thing as type-casting.  But I, for one, am very glad that he changed his mind.  I'll see a Denzel Washington movie any day, but what his name brought me into this time was a story I might not otherwise not have been all that interested in.  I have to be in the mood to get into a sports movie - they can be very hackkneed - a good reason why I haven't seen the movie about that boxer.  I admit I might have been interested in a movie about a coach after Mike Krzyzewski proved himself so well this year (yes, I'm a Duke fan) and knowing that he's a great person with his players and in general.

I know I was too, so I wasn't anxious to check out the movie, Remember the Titans (2000). However, from the moment the opening credits started rolling, I knew that this was not only a movie that would hold a place in my DVD collection, but in my heart as well. Due to the fact that this film was based on a true story, it draws the audience in. The story begins in 1971 Virginia at a time when race is a major conflict. A school by the name of T.C.Williams had just been established, forcing black and white students together. The battle of overcoming prejudice was raging not just in the schools, but also on the football field. Players and coaches alike needed to find a way to put aside their differences and work as a team to reach the common goal, a perfect season. The task was not easy, however, as we witnessed several heartbreaking altercations between the players. The turning point of this inspirational tale proved to be an early morning run as part of training camp at Gettysburg College. Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) delivered a speech telling how the team was still fighting the same battle as their ancestors did during the Battle of Gettysburg. Upon returning from camp the team is finally viewed as one, instead of the black players and white players.It seemed that every scene in this film filled me with a different emotion. From one moment to the next the audience is thrown about from the excitement of winning the first game to tears whenever the unexpected happens. The movie is shot in a way that the viewer experiences what the players are going through. This is evident during the football games when I found myself on the edge of my seat, feeling as if I were a Titan.What seals the deal for Remember the Titans is the stellar cast. As always, Denzel Washington nails the part of Coach Boone, giving the character passion, but also determination. His counterpart, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) delivers a love of the game that fuels the boys' desire to win. Standout performances by Wood Harris (Julius Campbell) and Ryan Hurst (Gerry Bertier) allow the audience a glimpse into the inner workings of the team. I was very impressed by this film. From the intense football drills to the touching portrayal of the characters, Remember the Titans has me hooked. At the end of the movie, an adult Sheryl delivers the following quote: \"People say it can't work,black and white; well here we make it work,everyday. We have our disagreements, of course, but before we reach for hate, always, always, we remember the Titans\". After watching this movie, I promise that you will too.",

The movie doesn't show the whole world coming together because of sports.  The town in the movie came together because they had a great football team that just so happened to be inter-racial.  It wasn't about trying to heal the world of racism, the movie shows how a team full of racists, and a team full of African-Americans can not only come together of the football field, but in life as well.  I think you should pop the dvd in your player again, and see what the movie is really talking about.  Assuming does nothing but show YOUR ignorance.This movie was a very good movie.  I wasn't around back when the movie was set, but I did hear from a guy who went to that very school, the very year the movie was set, and he said the racial tension wasn't as bad as the movie suggests, but you have to look at what the movie is symbolizing.  That a town full of racist bigots can come together and support a team that is racially diverse.  I give Denzel a 25, give the guy who plays Coach Yoast a 20, and I give the rest of the film a total score of 8.5.  It does lack certain things, but this is by far one of the best, if not the best, sports films of all time.",

            "content": "Movie Review: Remember the Titans Remember the Titans, released in 2000, is a heart-touching movie relating the game of football to the struggles of racial tension and friendship. Director Boaz Yakin uses just the right amount of drama and action to create a movie deserving a five star rating. Remember the Titans is a narration that not only tells a story to the viewer but it teaches a bit of a history lesson. Based on a true story set in 1971, Denzel Washington shows off his admirable acting skills as he plays Coach Boone who is named head coach of a football team that has recently integrated blacks and whites. While the teammates are more concerned about skin color than football practices, Coach Boone along with Assistant Coach Bill Yoast played by Will Paton, set out to teach them a lesson that is truly priceless.The movie begins with a series of establishing shots as the Titans head off to Gettysburg College for a week of team bonding and football practices. Right from the start Boone forces the players to tolerate their teammates of another race by forcing them to not only sit together on the buses but also room together. Allowing their differences to affect the way they play the sport of football, at first the Titans are no team but rather individual players selfishly tossing around a football. Especially in the scenes where the players are butting heads, close ups on the actors faces are used to show frustration as well as the clash between races and the problems caused by the integration. After a couple days of grueling practices, constant bickering, and a tiring yet meaningful run to the Gettysburg battlefields, the players begin to understand the importance and meaning of equality. Yakin uses low-key lighting in the battlefield scene to show intensity and suspense. As the week progresses the Titans transform from simply football players to a football team. Just as any team has to work hard and communicate with each other the Titans learns to not only communicate but see their teammates for who they are, not by their skin color. Viewers watch as the Titans become a brotherhood, forming friendships, inside jokes, and an overall respect for each other. Actors such as Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris do a particularly good job of really showing the difficulties the team and town were facing. Upon returning to their small town of Alexandria, Virginia as a well bound team, it's up to them to prove to the rest of the town that all are equal, white or black and that the Titans are a winning team.As the Titan's overcome the struggle of segregation and return back to town, it becomes very apparent that they're not at camp anymore. While the Titans work their way to the top, beating not only the opposing teams but leaving racial issues in the dust, they teach the rest of the town \"how to trust the soul of a man, not the look of him.\" While the team takes on Marshall for the title it marks much more than the end of the movie, but rather the start of a new era. Denzel's intensity, Patton's gentleness and Hayden Pannettiere's comic relief, along with the all the actors make Remember the Titans the remarkable movie it is. Not only is it a movie that touches the heart, but one that people clearly put their heart into making, making it a movie well worth watching.",

My most common complaint of today's movies is the predictability factor that runs rampant.

Perhaps creative license was exercised, but I'd like to believe that most of what was portrayed was 100% accurate.If you have the opportunity to watch the DVD, please check out the extras - very cool behind-the-scenes documentaries, and some interesting facts about the movie as well (like the minimal budget it was made on...).

            "content": "This was such a outstanding movie with very memorable performances. This wasn't just a true story but it also had a strong racial background and how it was back then and the changing of views. Some people might have missed the subtlety that what coach Boone (Denzel) put the kids through summer camp was similar to a boot camp. He had to put them through hell to reduce everyone to the lowest denominator of misery so that you learn the only way to stop the pain is to work together as a single unit. This is what made him successful in integrating the players. This movie illustrates well how bad racism was and how it played out on and off the field. Although there were corny moments in the movie and the actors were clearly too old, they were minimal and didn't detract from the power the film. If you are looking at this movie as just another football movie or sports movie how much better can it be than ones in the past. You will be sadly mistaken and you will find this movie to take you by surprise. The film takes place in the early 70's in Alexandria Virginia with the T.C. Williams high school. Will Patton plays the current head coach that is going to be nominated to the high school hall of fame. Then bad luck strikes and a white store owner shoots a black man he thinks has stolen from him and he is wrong. The event causes big racial tension. To try to ease racial tension Yoast gets demoted to assistant coach for the new head coach Boone (Denzel). since a black man replaces a very popular white coach the residents become very angry and players are even willing to throw away their careers and quit the team. To make sure he has the best chance of winning and integrate the white and black players, he doesn't treat either better then the other. He ends up sitting the offense and defense all on different buses black and white. During camp he makes people run a mile for almost every mistake they make. Each and every player has to sleep and get to know their racial counterpart as their homework. They all start to create a special bond and start to act more humane and mature, lacking in the residents of the town. When the team starts to win all race issues are eliminated, and true team work on and off the field is born. With this being a true story and showing the triumph of the human spirit and the positives of change make this all the more enjoyable. The supporting cast do a great job and really make you care about all the characters and what happens to them. This movie shows that when working as a team anything is possible and makes you feel sad and the situation in the past even some now are silly when it comes to racism. See this movie and you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "This captivating movie follows the integration of a Virginia high school football team as they face challenges neither player nor coach could predict. Being the first integrated football team in the area, T.C. Williams High School was challenged with playing in a still racist, mainly segregated league. As the team underwent a painful training camp, the players and coaches were forced to \"come together, right now, on this hollow ground (or) will be destroyed.\" With his job on the line, Coach Boone must lead his team, the only racially mixed team in the league, through an undefeated season. With the season winding down, unexpected events lead the team to form a family bond in order to overcome challenges the whole state thought would tear the team apart. Only once all the coaches began to \"trust the soul of a man rather than the look of him\" could the team fulfill their destiny. Coach Bill Yoast played by Will Patton says this quote at the last games half time locker-room speech. Patton's character represents the change that overcomes the whole town. He was totally against the idea of a combined team but at the end of the movie he loved it, and fought to keep it together. He helped team learn how to overcome their differences and play as one. The team's ability to stay undefeated taught themselves and the town that when people come together anything is possible.",

            "content": "I will definitely say that Remember the Titans was one of the best films of 2000, but unfortunately received little acknowledgment.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the film lacks special effects with bloody, gory bodies. Or perhaps many viewers were disappointed since there were no depressing characters addicted to some type of illegal substance.  Now, don't misjudge me in any way.  I found movies such as Gladiator and Traffic to be incredibly well done and absolutely mesmorizing, however, can't viewers become engrossed in a film that might make you feel somewhat good when leaving the theater?Remember the Titans offers touching comedy and drama with a lesson of friendship supported by an excellent cast.  Denzel Washington brilliantly portrayed Coach Herman Boone, the tough, dedicated football coach of the new T. C. Williams High School.  A good deal of his performance was due to the writing of Gregory Allen Howard, but a talented actor was still imperative to deliver some of those moving monologues.  Although many would strongly disagree with me, I feel that Denzel Washington deserved an Oscar nomination, not necessarily a win but at least a nomination.  This should also be partly due to the fact that he was robbed of it the year before.  I was also very impressed with Will Patton's performance.  I must admit that I had never thought him to be much of an actor, but he really portrayed Coach Bill Yoast in a manner that led the audience to believe him to be a dedicated coach who cared about his boys.  I'm still trying to understand why he did The Postman.The remainder of the cast was made up of several unknowns.  Ryan Hurst who portrayed Gerry Bertier was easy to overlook in Saving Private Ryan and The Postman.  When the film ended though and everyone was getting ready to leave, he was the one people were talking about.  \"Who played Gerry Bertier. He was great.\"  In my opinion, these people are entirely correct.  Ryan Hurst gave a heart-wrenching performance alongside Wood Harris who played Julius Campbell.  The chemistry between the two was absolutely incredible and I am disappointed to say that the two deserved more recognition than they recieved.  The rest of the cast was great as well including Donald Faison as the comical Petey Jones, Ethan Suplee as the unbiased Luis Lastik, Kip Pardue as the good-looking Ronnie \"Sunshine\" Bass, Earl Poitier as the soul-singing Blue Stanton, Craig Kirkwood as the gentle, religious Jerry \"Rev\" Harris, and Ryan Gosling as the adorable, country-dancing Alan Bosley. I hope you enjoyed my descriptive adjectives of each character.  I also want to point out that although I described Kip Pardue as \"good-looking,\" I must say everyone who wore a football jersey in this film was quite enjoyable to look at.Despite the fact that Remember The Titans was absolutely superb, I found that there were a few down falls.  Hayden Panettiere who played Sheryll Yoast was quite cute but somewhat annoying at times.  This wasn't the actresses fault though.  Sheryll Yoast was written as a girl who adored her father and all he was passionate about.  But sometimes I got rather irritated when she would yell at the defense constantly.  Yet, Hayden Panettiere was quite good at depicting a kid who was loving along with quite humorous at times.  Another aspect of the movie that I didn't care for involved the character of Ray Budds played by Burgess Jenkins.  The audience is supposed to see the character as \"the bad guy\", yet I must say I kind of felt sorry for him.  But, then again I'm the type of kid who feels sorry for the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, however, Ray's different from the wolf. First of all, he's not that racist.  He only said \"coon\" once in the film and that's about it.  Second of all, once Gerry befriended Julius, he kind of dumped Ray implying that he should try to befriend some of the offensive players.  It's almost as though a different type of segregation was developing within the team.  I just feel that his character could have been developed more by Howard.  I mean, what actually happened to him after he was kicked off the team?Although the film had minor defects, I was very impressed that I could become engrossed in a Disney film at age thirteen.  Yes, I'm young, but I'm also quite mature.  I know the supporting actors of the cast will soon become household names.  This is an enjoyable film for people of all ages (and races). : )",

The team is taken over by Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) who is a black man from out of town. The town is upset by the school boards decision to let Coach Boone take over the team, because he has a different color of skin than them. Coach Boone makes all of the players go off to camp and room with a person of different race. There ends up being conflict between the players. When the boys return home from camp, they are all getting along and end up having one of the greatest seasons that this small town has ever seen.The main idea in this story is how the players and both coaches overcame their differences. This movie lets us see how much rivalry blacks and whites had back in the 1970s. The Titans helped to show that if we just give somebody a chance it may all work out in the end. There was no black and white by the end of this movie. They were all the same, no matter who they were. This movie shows how we can overcome anything in life as long as we put our minds to it. The thing that really touched me was the way these two different races were so against each other; but when it came down to a game of football, the boys could all learn to get along with one another. This movie is very intense and makes viewers stay interested in it with all of its action and drama. This one single football team changed the opinions of all of the townspeople.

            "review_title": "8 out of 10 Titans",
            "content": "Remember the Titans is a movie set in Alexandria, Virginia in the 1970s when all the high schools in the town were segregated except for T. C. Williams High School. Herman Boone, the new Black football coach who was appointed over a white one to coach the newly mixed football team. The old coach, Coach Yoast, stayed on the team as assistant coach because at first some of the white players threatened to leave the team if Coach Yoast had to leave. The teammates come together before the school year starts at training camp. They came together because Coach Boone knew that if the team were to succeed, they would need to respect one another no matter their race, so that they had great teamwork. After the training camp, when the players had mostly come together, they had to still work together in the eyes of the town who were often quite judgmental. This film tackles racism in many ways, but in one instance, a white teammate tries to let some of his Black friends into a 'whites only' diner and they were rejected. This makes the white teammate realize how prevalent racism still is in his town. There are many sub-plots and other points that happen but by the end of the film, the team had won the championship through teamwork, great leadership, and overcoming racism/prejudice which is what the film is about. This movie is based on a real story, but it is very Hollywoodized.The message of a film is subjective, but I believe that the film's main message is that through friendship/love for your fellow people you can overcome most social justice issues. In this case, the issue is racism (believing you are better than another person because of the color of your skin). This is shown through the various characters, for example, the team leader Gerry Bertier at first is angry that the school would mix the football team. But after getting to know the new players, Gerry learns to appreciate the skills they bring to the team and becomes closer friends with his co-captain Julius Campbell. Another message one can take away from 'Remember the Titans' is that with hard work comes great achievements. Herman Boone, the new coach, worked the team very hard during training camp and during the school year. Since they worked so hard, they were able to win the championship.I enjoyed the movie because it had a great plot, and in my opinion, the most important aspect of making a good film it the plot/storyline. I believe the plot is the best aspect of this film because I watched this film over a year ago and the part that stuck with me was the story and the message. Another reason that makes the writing good was the characters because they could be very relatable to the target audience. The target audience for this film is teenagers because it was produced by Disney and is about high school, since the film is about football many sport-playing teenagers would want to watch it. Therefore, a high school student who plays sports could see themselves as Gerry, Julius or one of the other team players being worked hard by their 'mean' coach, but by watching this movie they would see that the coach works them hard so that the team can succeed. One thing I did not like about the plot was the predictability (the team would come together and win a huge championship), this made the scene where the team was playing their final game a bit boring in my opinion. My impression of the acting, score and cinematography was, it was nothing special. There were no memorable performances or scenes, and the music was quite generic. 'Aint No Mountain High Enough' and 'Spirit in the Sky' are quite basic songs and are in many movies. I find when a film has an original song/score it makes it that much more memorable.This movie relates to justice because it touches a lot on racism which is an injustice. An example of when racism was relevant in the movie was when the owner of the diner did not allow the black players in, then told the white player who brought them in to leave as well. This movie also relates to faith because Herman Boone had to have faith in his team that they would come together, overcome prejudice and win all their games. In all, I enjoyed the film for the various aspects it had.",

So, I go see it with my family, and I was thoroughly enjoying it until the power goes of in the theater during the scene where Boone picks up his daughter and is spinning around with her in the street. This scene also happens to be the scene right before the fate of Gerry. I was oblivious to what was going to happen when we went to see it again, and I totally lost it when this certain fate happens. I left the theatre feeling betrayed, but incredible touched. It took me 24 hours to love this movie after seeing it. The characters in this movie are perfect. The two main football guys, Gerry and Julius, are heart touching, in fact, every single football player on the team is lovable (especially the dude who is loved the stupid music and danced a lot). The young Yoast girl was hilarious, and should be hooked up in a movie with H.J. Osment. Coach Yoast and Couch Boone were awesome, the way they looked at each other was even incredible. I was amazed at how brave Gerry was after his disability, he truly was a champion. Here I am praising the characters, but it was the ACTORS who made these characters. So, kudos and ginger snaps (and hopefully Oscars) to them!! There is only ONE thing that bothers me about this movie: WHY IS DENZEL WASHINTON'S NAME THE ONLY ONE FEATURED ON THE POSTER IN BIG LETTERS? DISNEY- PUT WILL'S ON THEIR TOO!Oh yeah, and a question for the IMDb members: was Sunshine really gay?",

            "content": "When I learned that I had to watch this film for my sports film class, I was not very happy about it. I just knew I wouldn't like it. After all, I'm a girl and the subject of the film was football, my least favorite sport. What could I find enjoyable about the film? Plenty, it turned out. This was by far one of the best sports movies I have watched. Yes, a great deal of it focused on football, but it was about so much more than sports.The film centers on the 1971 football team (the Titans) at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA. The school system is working on integrating a previously all-white school, and the team is doing the same. For the first time, African American and white kids are supposed to play ball side by side, whether they like it or not. In the beginning, all of the players are angry at the situation and the team suffers because of it. As the story progresses, the two races eventually begin to accept each other and even begin to befriend kids of the opposite race. The movie focuses on the racism the players face from their peers and students from other schools and how the team deals with it. Of course there are a fair number of football scenes, but they add to the story rather than detract from it and shift the focus to sports. They help to show how all the individual players, regardless of their race, could come together as one to face a common opponent in whichever team they were playing. By the end of the film, the players realize that the color of their skin doesn't matter. They all face the same problems and have the same dreams.If you were to simply hear the film's premise, I don't think it would convince you to go see it. Sure, it deals with the serious problem of racism and has a lot of cool football scenes, but so what? On their own, the plots and sub-plots don't seem that special, but when combined with the superb acting skills of Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris and Hayden Panettiere, the film becomes a winner. Washington is great as Head Coach Boone, and Patton is equally amazing as Coach Yoast, but the film would only be tolerable without the performances of the guys on the football team. I would strongly recommend seeing this film just to enjoy their performances. They manage to portray the strong racial opposition in the beginning of the movie, and as the film progresses, the way they depict the team's relationship is remarkable. I found that as the movie went on, I became attached to many of the players and their struggles. By the end, I was rooting for all of them to overcome their individual obstacles. They all became real people to me, not simply characters in some film. Adding to the film's appeal was the great soundtrack. The songs played throughout the movie were a mix of Motown, gospel, and 70's rock. They gave the film a fun, relaxed feel and set the time of the film at the same time. If it is at all possible, please go out and see this film. It doesn't matter how old you are. People of any age can enjoy it. The story is interesting, it doesn't get too serious and the acting is top notch. I would give this film a 9 out of 10.",

With the exception of the recently released 'Friday Night Lights', 'Remember' is one of only a few football movies that is based on true events and happenings. With an exceptional cast, Denzel Washington, Nicole Ari Parker, and Will Patton, this movie reaches far beyond that of normal football movies as the cast actually trained for and competed in the film's game and practice scenes. The ability for the cast to both know how to play the game and know how to act at the same time, creates a feel that the boys playing in the game on the screen are actually the boys who played in real life. Their ability to both act and play created a dynamic friendship between the players that helped transfer to their friendships on screen making it more than believable, it made it almost real. I believe this movie to be one of the more better made football movies in a great long while, with the exception of 'Varsity Blues'. I feel that the emotion put out by the actors created and held the audience's attention as they battled through hardship after hardship. Overall, this movie ranks an eight out of ten for realism and entertainment.",

These movies often carry clich\u00e9 messages and dull character interactions. Remember the Titans, directed by Boaz Yakin, is exactly the opposite of these drab movies.The story of T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA, the movie tells much more than the story of a football team. With the school recently forced to integrate, racial tensions are running high not only among schoolmates, but across the town. With the new black head coach, Herman Boone, the team is faced with the challenge of overcoming their differences.Yakin shows us through the film the teams roller-coaster ride through its season. From the beginning of camp, when players of other races are reluctant to sit on the same bus, to the end of the season when a white teammate proclaims one of his black teammates his brother, Yakin shows us the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.He uses their success on the football field as a way to convey their struggles in life and society's. He shows us exactly how the players are feeling, instead of only how good of football players they are. The triumphs of the team not only inspire the players and the coaching staff, but the entire town to attempt to lay aside their differences and respect their brother.",

            "content": "The plot of Remember the Titans was pretty good, especially considering that it was based on a true story.  This is definitely a movie for football lovers, especially those who played in high school.  Some parts of the story line were a little jumbled, a little repetitive, but this did reflect the struggles of real life.  In real life problems don't get solved the first time, especially an issue as big as racism and segregation.  The story line of a high school football team interwoven with illustrations of racial discrimination and de-segregation laws of the 70s created an emotionally rich story that will definitely leave a teary eye or two.\nDenzel Washington was at his best again, just like always.  Only he could pull off preaching about football and the desire to win and make anyone want to get up and do some push-ups.  Denzel adds a tremendous amount of power and drama into this film.  Also, the relationship between the two star players of the team, one black and one white, is one of the best parts of this movie.  True friendship is shown by these two characters who stand up for each other, on and off the field, no matter what happens.  They show the strength of the human spirit and the passion in the human heart.  Kudos to the two young actors, Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst.  A few other characters are underdeveloped, but Hayden Panettiere, the little blonde 9 year old cutie, will make anyone smile.\nOverall I liked this movie, it even made me cry and not just a few tears but a lot (along with my chin quivering a bit).  I am not a big football fan but this movie kept my attention for the most part.  I could have gone for more of the characters and less of the actually football playing, but that's just me.  Great soundtrack!  This movie had one good song after another.  Hey, the movie was predictable, but it also was based on a true story and it was pretty heart warming.  A very good flick for the family to all watch together.On a scale of 1 to 10: 7",

I was a high school student during the time of this story and remember the daily tension as our school was forced to bus kids from inner city schools to the upper middle class schools and vice versa. In most cases, the kids adjusted well but the adults hung on selfishly to the traditional values of separate but equal. I don't know of a better film that portrays the actual struggles of that time period with regard to integration of sports programs. The coaches of the story and the kids who played the game made it work. To see them singing, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in the locker room was extremely inspirational to me and to my family as well. We purchased the DVD the very day it was available so that we could see the special features and hear the actual coaches talk of the times and struggles and the ultimate victories that came from such a time as forged many male heroes out of scared and frightened young men.I recommend the movie to all who care about the integrity of a victorious life that cares enough to be involved in changing lives and communities for the better.",

            "content": "***Spoilers***The theme of Remember the Titans is that even against all odds, a united group can take on anything. In 1971, Alexandria, Virginia was a town against the integration of the black and white high schools much like the rest of the south. Obviously, this sentiment is going to trickle down to the newly combined high school and its football team. The tension in town really increases when black head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is chosen as the high school's football coach. Herman Boone is given the difficult task of trying to coach a football team that is divided by color. The football players are constantly fighting and at odds with each other. At the center of team's conflict are two pivotal players. The black players' main influence is Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) where the white players' tend to be Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst). Even Herman Boone is not exempt from the conflict as he constantly runs into problems with the team's assistant coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Through all of this, the team starts to come together after an influential run to Gettysburg. The lighting really made this part even more profound and impactive. It presented a bleak, gloomy mood as Coach Boone spoke about the reality that many men died for what was still relevant in 1971. This tied to the theme as there is not a more important uniting time then when soldiers are fighting in wars together. I also think the angle was important as it effectively made the scene more surreal as we are listening to Herman Boone talk. The angle helps us really focus on what is being said. It works because it really makes you think about his words as Coach Boone is speaking. Collectively, this scene symbolized the darkness that racism and prejudice can present. It was also a foreshadowing for the adversity the team would encounter after getting back to Alexandria and starting high school. The team might have been ready to look at each other as men and not skin colors. Unfortunely, the rest of the town is not. The team gets back to the real word and is met with this harsh realization. This in turn helps emphasize the theme even more. Even though it is two different genres of film, I can see a comparison of this film to the movie Wildcats which stars Goldie Hawn. This is simply for the fact that my chosen theme could fit both of these movies effectively. In closing, Remember the Titans epitomizes what fighting against all odds can really be about.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans Review\"Remember the Titans\" is a compelling story of perseverance and tolerance that warms your heart with the bond of a tightly knit high school football team. Throughout the movie, there are battles between whites and blacks, and the Titans against their weekly opponents. They are playing to prove that they are the best in the state and that blacks and whites work as one. This movie acts as a metaphor for the struggles of life, which makes it easy for anyone to connect with the movie. \"Remember the Titans\" is set back in 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, less than 10 years after the Civil Rights act was passed. Tension between blacks and whites is at its highest in Alexandria when the high school becomes integrated and Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is hired as the head coach of the high school football team and he replaces, now assistant head coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton). This change causes the white kids to second guess playing football because they don't want to play for a black coach or with black teammates. But both coaches come to agreement and take their appointed roles as coaches. They haul both black and white players off to football camp so bonds can be made and they can learn to play as one. The director, Boaz Yakin, does a great job of showing that friendships are important through the plot of this movie. Boaz gives us an important example of finding who your true friends are. He illustrates this point by showing us a scene where a white player breaks up with his girlfriends because she didn't approve of his interactions with the black players. This one decision made by a white teammate proved to most of the other players that whether they were black or white, that they could put aside their differences and just be friends. Boaz Yakin presents the dialogue and setting of this film in a way that makes you feel like you were watching a movie developed in the 1970's. Like explained before, there was still tension between blacks and whites at this time. This movie really gives you a good demonstration of what life would be like to be black, friends with blacks, or even what goes through the mind of white people who discriminated blacks. This is another aspect of the film where the director does a great job.. Though I really like this movie, there is one thing that might take this movie down a notch. That factor is that it isn't very original. This isn't the first movie ever made that shows the integration of blacks and whites in sports. Also, there are characters that have been used in previous sports movies like the classic fat kid. Or the guy that joins the team and has never played before who ends up being a key player. Then there are the moments where two guys that fight each other end up being the closest of friends. Even though they may not be original thought, I think the director and the actors do a good job of using these \"old news\" situations and making them intertwine with the plot of the movie. The overall mood of \"Remember the Titans\" is excited or happy even though there are some sad moments. I say the mood is exciting because there are lots of moments where your skin begins to tingle from what just happened or from what is about to happen. The mood ties in with the acting and the atmosphere very well. Just look for a slight smirk from Coach Boone or listen to the roar of the crowd. Those small bits in the movie make you feel part of the moment and give you flashbacks of good times. \"Remember the Titans\" is a good movie. It has everything a person could want in a film and everything you really need. I personally feel that everyone should watch it, either just to watch a good movie or to have a very good message illustrated for you. I give it an 8/10.",

The racial differences accompanies the whole movie, and the audience can see how the friendship that emerges among the team members and their struggle for common goals (to win as a team) can diminish the racial tension among the team members and further on in the hole city.

The usual dose of \"eye candy\" was evident in some of the slow motion scenes, but it didn't rule over the film. What did was the strong emotion each scene garnered from the audience. Washington is his usual self, putting on a wonderful performance as Coach Boone, and after several years in the film industry Will Patton is finally getting the parts that make his \"villainous-bit-part\" past a distant memory (i.e. \"The Postman\"). Trevor Rabin scores the perfect music to the scenes that need it - action and emotion alike. Some of the actors were fitting to play the parts of the players... Wood Harris as Julian finally broke into the big time with his role as a team leader along with Ryan Hearst as Bertier, neither will see any starring roles in the near future, but both should see scripts coming their way for supporting roles. This motion picture allows the audience to run the full spectrum of emotions (a very seldom occurence with any Bruckheimer produced film), but Boaz Yakim shines in this presentation of a Remember the Titans - don't get comfortable Boaz I still remember your other films: The Rookie, The Punisher and most recently From Dusk 'Til Dawn 2... you need to create some more quality pictures before I nominate you for a Best Director Academy Award.

Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes \"Remember The Titans\" a real gem.However, the strength and real beauty of \"Remember The Titans\" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.\nI must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter. In \"Remember The Titans\" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Not only does her talent shine through but her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.I hesitated to see \"Remember The Titans\" because I didn't want to see another football film.

Racism and other adversarial forces provide a strong undercurrent of constant tension and immerse a football team and it's coaching staff into a monumental struggle to survive and compete.  It just doesn't sound possible, but you have to see the film and see how it is possible.  The leadership and connection to his players that actor Denzel Washington portrayed was a good example of how at times, the only way to deal with cruelty is with absolute spartan style force....not a pretty site for one with a squeamish stomach or a faint heart.  The end result was that he showed players, that character building was the unifying ingredient that permitted a team to become an effective and competitive force to deal with on and off a football field.

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" tells the story of a high school in Alexandria, Virginia and its football team. In 1971, coach Herman Boone is hired to coach the school's football team at T.C. Williams High School, a school integrated black and white students. Boone is faced with many obstacles throughout the season mainly the rising of racial tensions between his football players. Boone became head coach and coach Bill Yoast got the assistant coaching job. Yoast was the former head coach the year before. Yoast at first refuses to coach but his white players say they'll quit the team if he does not coach. Throughout the movie, there are great visual scenes between black and white players that ultimately reach toward the goal of ending racial conflicts and discrimination. During the season, coach Yoast is told that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose one game implying that he wants Boone fired because of his skin color. This was one of the bigger conflicts throughout the movie. During the season, Yoast sees the chairman in the stands and realizes that they've rigged the game for Yoast to get the Hall of Fame induction and Boone out of the head coaching job. The Titans have a storybook ending and go on with the season undefeated and they win the state championship as Gerry Bertier is paralyzed from the waist down watching the game from the hospital. The relationship between Gerry Bertier, a white team captain returnee, and Julius Campbell, the black leader of the team per say plays a big role in the integrating of the team and fighting through the obstacles between the races. There a lot of great scenes between the two actors but you'll have to watch the movie to find out all of these instances leading to the teams success and legacy. \"Remember the Titans\" is a great watch because of the talented acting by a few actors in the movie.\n The movie \"Remember the Titans\" is based on a true story although it has many added scenes to show the viewers a better representation of how life was during this time. Although this is not completely the true story, it's a great movie to watch. The character play by Denzel Washington as Coach Boone is award winning and eye opening. Coach Boone is faced with all kinds of different struggles throughout the movie, with his family, team, and the community. How he reacts to all of this is why it's a must watch movie. People and reviewers say that he got to play Martin Luther King Jr. And Vince Lombardi in one character in the historic movie. His dedication and drive to end the discrimination and his ideas and philosophies of a team is deeply instilled into his players, coaches and even the T.C. Williams High School community. Because of the such professional acting by the characters, it outweighs the predictable and cheesy scenes throughout the movie. Denzel Washington is known today as a talented actor and in \"Remember the Titans,\" he exemplifies that and shows that extremely well. The movie opened well in 2000 grossing over 26 million dollars in its first weekend and staying in the top five movies for six weeks straight bringing in a total of over 136 million dollars worldwide. Denzel Washington along with other actors in the movie were nominated to many things and won awards including the Best Actor Bet Award by Washington, Human Rights Award by the Political Film Society and much much more. The actors and actresses are a big role in the movies success and a awesome reason why \"Remember the Titans\" is one of the greatest if not the greatest sports movie. \n Overall I would recommend anyone to watch this movie because of the exceptional acting of many actors including Denzel Washington. This movie teaches and educates viewers as to what was going on during the time of the United States going through racial prejudice and discrimination. Along with those problems, it exemplifies extraordinary philosophies of a team and dedication to having brothers of a different race",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is a film about integration of two societies - black and white - in Alexandria in the 70's. The movie shows how a newly integrated school, T.C.Williams, its new Head Coach and the Assistant Coach, and its football team change a society. In the movie you will find the ugliness of racism and how teamwork and friendship can overcome the colour of your skin(no, nothing about football). The acting's great, structure's okay but it's somewhat predictable, and is visually disappointing. If you are a football fan, don't see it, if you're a visual person, don't, but if you're anything else try it.Year 1971, Alexandria, Virginia - two races of America collide with each other when a white shopkeeper shoots a black student under dubious circumstances. To satisfy the angry black population the town decides to integrate a white school and a black school together into T.C. Williams and to hire a black football coach for the school's head coach. The new Head Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is reluctant to accept the position offer and the old Head Coach (now assistant coach) Yoast(Will Patton) cannot imagine himself, the hall-of-the-fame nominee, working under a black person. However they manage to work together and try hard to train the team hard and to change the racist attitude of team members and other people in town, but they have a lot to face...Characters in this movie are great. Denzel Washington skillfully plays his part as a mean - but sympathetic - heroic coach who teaches each member of the team the importance of respect and teamwork. Will Patton is excellent in his part too, and his inner conflicts - pride, success, doubts - are well shown. Coach Yoast's little daughter Cheryl may be annoying to some viewers in the first half of the film but it gets better. How many of us don't know a little girl like her? The characters are realistic, and it's fun to watch.\nThe circular structure of the film - how it starts at a funeral, tells the story and goes back to the funeral - is used well to show continuity of the film. They could've done more than just giving the players' moustache to show that they are older, but it was a good attempt.Shots - this is where the major problem comes in. Yes, we love seeing Sunshine on the close-up and Petey's feelings are better expressed this way but where's the action? The film hardly has any establishing shots or long shots, only midshots to close-ups. This makes the movie dull - even without the cameras it is obvious that the film is trying to follow the documentary format. Could've had more action in it.Predictability is another major flaw - and perhaps this is why this movie attracted only a few viewers. At the first meeting Lewis Lastik kind of gave it away, even though Bertier tried to make it look menacing with his army-like pals. Also, the story primarily focuses on the white students' distress at having to deal with unwanted black students - if the storyline had some depth in it they would've shown how black students felt about being put into a place they were uncomfortable at; Gerry's girlfriend talks, where's Julius's?Although 'based on true story' movies are often badly exaggerated and seem more fictional than the fictional ones, Remember the Titans is an exception. It seems real enough, and it deals with an important issue of racism, if rather superficially. A 7 / 10 ?",

For starters, it's exquisitely acted and the music is nothing short of sensational -- a catchy collage of favorite oldies against a score combining sporty drumbeats and sentimental drama at appropriate plot junctures.Then there's the touching, sometimes-cliffhanger of a true storyline.Based on the tense experience of a Virginia city unhappily facing its first court-ordered school integration, Denzel Washington portrays the real-life Coach Hermann Boone. He acts the part with dignity and enough foibles to convince us he's a human being as well as a tough, drivingly-ambitious football coach. Only thing is, Coach Boone, a PhD, is an African American tossed for political reasons into a formerly all-white high school arena. (Why not unleash the lions, as well, viewers might wonder?) The school's key established team members decide not to play *for* Boone or *with* the bussed-in newbies. As if that weren't challenge enough, the old-line coaching staffers react with attitudes ranging from surly defiance to mutinous fury. Nonetheless, Boone is expected to elevate this football team, the mighty Titans, to its first championship. Will Patton's performance as the deposed head coach with no choice except to defer to Boone is touching, at times bordering on magnificent. Watch for changes of facial expression and body language, often so subtle they're barely perceptible, as Patton's character gradually morphs from resentment of his new head coach, to openly-expressed admiration.The cast of young teammates turn in believable performances, each and every one. A so-called lesser supporting cast also includes brief-but-pivotal appearances such as the confused-but-compassionate hospital nurse, Alice. The gal who plays the part reacts with such perfect timing, her 15 minutes of fame are well deserved.Even the film's final credits hold audience attention. As cast and crew names scroll by, it's fascinating to see flashed images of the young team members and their coaching staff, including Boone, and to learn what's happened to them since that tense season.My family and friends probably rewatch the film, in part, because it restores serenity via value lessons sorely needed in a nation torn for so long by bias and illogical hatred. There's an underlying current of decency despite the horrifying strife and struggle. It's also refreshing to see good guys finishing first, thinking, \"Hard to believe this really happened.\" (It did.)Watch the film, then watch it again. You *will* Remember the Titans.",

            "content": "On April 15, 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. Twenty- four years later in, ''Remember the Titans,'' we are still fighting the very same battle. Based upon a less well-known episode in the racial history of American sports, the integration of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, it provides an awful lot of swelling from within. No matter your skin color, \"Remember the Titans\" is bound to put a lump in your throat and bring out emotions that you may have never known you had. This movie is not strictly about football. \"Football teaches you to control your anger\" Denzel Washington says in the movie. \"Remember the Titans\" provides a compelling and convincing portrayal of how a single group of people, no matter their age, can unite people together. Towards the end of the movie Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) goes to visit Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) who had just been involved in a serious car accident. As Julius enters into Gerry's room the nurse tells him that visitation rights are for family only. Gerry's response is one that can show you the transformation throughout the movie. He responds, \"Ma'am, can't you see that's my brother?\"Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) meet in the beginning of the movie and Coach Yoast shares his concern that his players won't play. Coach Boone then says that the best player will play, skin color doesn't matter. Coach Yoast then responds with, \"Coach, I'm afraid that is the only thing that does matter right now.\" Coach Boone and Coach Yoast do an unbelievable job of balancing the effects of racism in developing these young football players into men. They use football to teach them to control their anger on the gridiron, but most importantly, in real life. One defining moment comes after Coach Boone issues a challenge for each player to get to know a player of the opposite race every single day and report to him what they learned. Julius and Gerry are undoubtedly the leaders of the team, in particularly the leaders of their race. As they accept the challenge they interact in a heart to heart conversation that could seem confrontational, but to them it was eye opening and inspirational. One event stands out so clear in my mind on the maturity and impact these players have in the small town of Alexandria. Gerry and Julius were talking on the first day of school when Gerry's girlfriend, Emma Hoyt (Kate Bosworth), approaches Gerry to talk to him. Julius was trying to be kind, and gently extended his hand to greet Emma and officially meet her. She refused his handshake and just walked away, which lead to Gerry apologizing to Julius. You could easily see that this was something that Julius was used to, so there were no hard feelings. This is something that you will see occur quite frequently in this movie. In the end of it all, this movie crosses more than one goal line and overcomes defeat. The Titans defy the odds and conquer defeat in the game of football, but more importantly, in the game of life.",

            "content": "Remember the TitansCourage, strength, brotherhood, are a few words you could use to describe the movie, Remember the Titans. This movie shows the struggles of southern states in the 1970's, and what one amazing team went through to prove judgment can't be passed based on the color of ones skin. Remember the Titans is a Disney movie but that does not mean it is meant just for kids. People of all ages will enjoy this movie. This is a heartwarming movie that shows the hardships the team goes through while remaining light hearted. The production, script, and acting were very well done and the social themes still have rapport today.The premise of Remember the Titans is based around the south in the 1970's. In the city of Alexandria, Virginia segregated schools are forced to integrate. The conflict arises when two competing football coaches are forced to integrate the football team as well. Production that went into this movie creates a spot-on interpretation of this time period in America.This production shows an accurate portrayal of the era. The costumes are well done in having the hippie look or flared pants along with big collared shirts. The costumes are apparent on picketers outside the school. The props used in the movie, such as the cars involved in the car accident, were pristine examples of the 1970's. Framed by the battlefield of Gettysburg, there so much bloodshed of the civil war occurred Herman Boon (Denzel Washington) gives an inspiring speech to his players about bigotry that was fought then and still experienced today.The stand out performance given by Denzel Washington is aided by a well-written script. At the start he seem like a tough cold guy at times who wants to win at all costs. As the movie progresses you start to see past his tough exterior and begin to see the love and passion he has for the team. The inspirational speech given by Washington's character provides insight into the racial inequality's African Americans experienced at the time without coming off as clich\u00e9. The locker room speeches he gives come alive not just because of Washington's performance but because the way they are written strike a chord in the competitor in all of us.Disney never fails to produce a wonderful movie that anyone will enjoy. Unlike the animated movies, it is more serious at times and dramatic, like the movie Glory Road (2006). Years later this movie is still enjoyable and timeless.",

After seeing this movie, and seeing how well Denzel Washington acted, I now want to see more movies with Denzel Washington. That was awesome how this movie really supported the fact that, you don't have to be the same skin color to be best friends! This movie made me laugh and it also touched my heart, I think that if you like to see a well acted football movie with a good plot, and a good meaning to it don't miss Remember The Titans! On a scale of one to ten I give this movie a Ten.",

It's also a very inspirational and motivational movie which can be translated to every aspect of life, like reaching you goals and never giving up.I ain't givin' it 10 out of 10 for the simple reason that it doesn't gives me that feeling of being witness to greatness, and also because I think that 10's shouldn't be thrown around",

Even more, I loved the idea that THE PLAYERS cared more (by the end of the season) about the team as a whole than themselves as individuals. And the fact that it really did happen!  I gotta give Coach Boone some props on that one cause I can tell you it WASN'T like that when I played highschool sports and I think it rarely happens altogether anymore. Bottom line:  I laughed, I cried, I got chills, I got angry, and it was an uplifting and descent film. You dont see many of those around anymore either.

So this movie is about discriminations that existed in our country.  Well.  Upon further review it seems the writer was just pandering, without really developing the story more.  Many left the theatre unsure why the character \"sunshine\" was in the movie as a gay football player in the 70's.  Indeed, many are unsure if he was gay. If he has no trials, or troubles to show the discrimination that his character would un-doubtedly go threw.  Why do we have the character at all?

'Remember the titans' does just that.

This movie was a well developed film that showed the contrast between race and how barriers can be broken through the coming together of a team.

The best part is that it is based on a true story so you can see how those events could happen now and learn more about a specific event in the past and possibly learn from that event. If you aren't someone who cares about watching a movie based on a true story this movie is still a good football movie.Though it is one of my favorite movies not all of the facts are completely accurate on the other hand it wouldn't be a great movie if Hollywood hadn't exaggerated the truth some. There is one scene in particular that had nothing to do with the plot of the movie, nor was it true which is the locker room scene where Ronnie Bass kisses Gerry Bertier. I feel that the movie would still be a great movie even if that scene wasn't in it.If you like movies that are based on a true story, inspirational, and that are about football then you should definitely see Remember The Titans and also check out Invincible. Invincible is based on a part of Vince Papale's life where he tries out for the Eagles football team and makes it as the underdog. Both of these movies are great but to me, Remember The Titans is better than Invincible.",

            "content": "`Remember the Titans' takes place in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971.  This was a time where segregation still took place and the government was attempting to integrate society.  T.C. Williams High School was becoming an integrated school bringing together students from other schools around the area.  For this very racial divided town, most did not agree with what was happening. The students and staff were told to just make it work.\nCoach Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) was the schools white football coach who led the team to fifteen winning seasons.  When the decision was made to integrate the school, Coach Yoast was demoted to assistant coach and Coach Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), a black man from another school, was to take his place.  Neither Yoast nor Boone liked what was going on but both new they had a responsibility. The high school football team was comprised of two distinct groups of people that were not willing to work together as a team.  A team is all about working together to achieve a common goal and Coach Boone and Coach Yoast taught the boys how to work past racial prejudices and come together as friends and teammates.As the film unfolds and the students start looking past the color of their teammates' skin, two of the boys' friendships clearly stand out.  Gerry Bertier (played by Ryan Hurst,) the white team captain, and Julius Campbell (played by Wood Harris,) a black player, form a true friendship that no one, not even a girlfriend could break apart.  Toward the end of the film Bertier gets into a very bad car accident that paralyzes him from the waist down. While in the hospital, the only person that he wanted to see was his `brother' Julius.  Bertier had once said that he would never play football with a black and here he was referring to him as his `brother.'Coach Boone and Yoast had helped the students overcome and breakdown the once racial barrier of the team.  The 1971 T.C. Williams High School football team was undefeated.  For the first year as the only integrated team of the area, the coaches led their team to championships where they won.  For the Titans it was not only about winning on the field, but it was about winning the battle of racism.Throughout `Remember the Titans,' many concepts/ideas from class are presented.  Motivation, teamwork, and multiculturalism are just a few of them that are portrayed through the story line.Coach Boone is the teams' key motivator.  When he took the job to be the head coach for the T.C. Williams Titans High School football team, not only did he have to motivate the players to break racial barriers and work together as a team, but he also had to motivate his fellow coaches.  He came in coaching for a team that was already very good and had won championships for the past fifteen years.  Coach Boone realized how good they were and decided to take the team to camp anyway.  His purpose of camp was not solely intended to teach the kids about football, but more about how to work as a team and put racial prejudices aside.  He made the students dress alike and become acquainted with team members of the opposite race.After not even a day of being at camp, two of the boys, and then the entire team, got into a fight because of their differences.  Coach Boone brought the team together and told them that they were to redirect their anger and use team effort to achieve perfection.  His goal was to bring these kids from different backgrounds together to transform them into a team. During the Titans first game of the season, Coach Boone talks with the boys before the game motivating them to work as a team.  `Don't let anything, nothing come between us.  Nothing tears us apart.  In Greek mythology, the titans were greater even than the Gods.  They ruled their universe with absolute power.  That football field out there tonight, that's out universe. Let's rule it titans.'While Coach Boone was the base influence for motivation, two of the players really stood out as being the advocates of coming together and working as a team.   Gerry Bertier and Julius `Big Ju' Campbell showed their fellow teammates what it was like to surpass racial prejudices to come together. At the beginning of the movie, Bertier, the team captain, does not want blacks to be playing on his team and his attitude toward the players shows that.  In one of Bertier and Big Ju's first conversations, Big Ju says to Bertier, `attitude reflects leadership.'  This conversation was the stepping stone for them learning to respect each other both as teammates and friends.Coach Boone and Coach Yoast encountered the same challenges that the players did.  They too had to overcome racial barriers and work together as a team. Both Coach Boone and Yoast and Bertier and Big Ju were the main influences of the story.The entire movie deals with issues such as communication, influence, power, motivation, teamwork, conflict, problem solving, authority, responsibility, decision making, and multiculturalism.  It was a very moving film and I recommend it to everyone.",

I use to live in Alexandria, VA and I have always heard the story how things were there before, during, and after segregation. Some the horrible events I used to hear about would blow my mind, but when this movie debuted and I actually got to see stories of people who experienced these trials and tribulations of those struggling to be excepted regardless of their color and the battle of people trying to except those they didn't understand, thought they couldn't relate, or just plain out thought they were better then. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast both had to learn how to co-exist before they could bring the Black Student football players and the White players together, but once these young saw past the color of each other's skin, they would help their city past it too. Even though there was that one member of the team named Ray who was one of the White members of the team who just could not see past color and was eventually kicked off the team by one of his White teammates because he realized that the prejudice had to stop eventually. This movie is a great story in showing how no matter what the color of one's skin is that no one person is better than another. This movie should be required to be shown at schools once the topic of segregation is brought up in history class because it is a very diverse film and it gives a real inside look of the hardships and glory of segregation.",

The film based in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971, and on the T.C. Williams' Titans football team, a local high school. The head coach of the Titans, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), who was nominated for the High School Football Coach Hall of Fame Coach of the Year. The film provides excellent background information to allow the viewer better understanding of the plot. A scene in the beginning of the movie sets the emotional stage for the rest of the movie, when a white store-owner shoots and kills a black man who he suspected of stealing. The resulting protests causes' racial tension in the city of Alexandria and that is furthered by the integration of races in T.C. Williams and effects the players of the football team as well as Coach Yoast. Coach Yoast finds that the school board has replaced him with Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) as the football teams head coach. Some would think that this is a normal part of high school football, the major conflict that both Coach Yoast and the rest of town have with Coach Boone is that he is black and Coach Yoast is white. However, Coach Boone will not allow racial tensions to split the team and during training camp and the entire season, he focuses on promoting diversity by incorporating it into the practices and making the team bunk with someone of a different race and getting to know all of the team throughout.When the team wins the State Championship Game, after losing a star player and banding together to play hard, Coach Boone realizes that his team has made a difference in the community and although the racial tension is still prevalent, a greater understanding among those who are willing to see past physical differences and realize all people should be judged on who they are and not what they make look like, changes are made to make Alexandria a better place to play high school football. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased, and the true meaning of teamwork is born. The film uses great use of lighting to emphasize the emotional atmosphere during certain scenes. The single scene that, I believe, uses this most effectively is the early morning run to Gettysburg. The scene was shot with a low light to emphasize the effect of events that previously happened there. In addition, the fog that used to illustrate the magnitude of the scene was just the right amount with the lighting used. I think that any difference in the amount of fog or light would have rendered the impact of the scene less effective. I think the director did an excellent job of using the sport of football along with the actors themselves to emphasize the theme of equality amongst all people and that we as a society should not judge a book by its cover but only after we have read it in its entirety.",

The main character Herman Boone is played by Denzel Washington who is the teams new head coach. The film follows him as he fights to get him and his team accepted in the community and become a unit by looking past there race and where they came from.Boone takes over for the old coach named Bill Yoast played by Will Patton, who has been nominated for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame and is going to pursue further coaching opportunities elsewhere. After the white players on the team find out the the football team will be integrated with black players and Boone will be the new head coach, some of them refuse to play. Yoast does not want to see this happen because some of the players could be missing out on college scholarships. So Boone offers Yoast an assistant job, which he takes to keep the team together.The film also follows two players on the team, Gerry Bertier who is white and played by Ryan Hurst, and Julius Campell who is black and played by Wood Harris. These two characters at first do not like each other like the rest of the team and the town. But they are both there respective leaders of the two teams. They feud like everyone else during there training camp, but form a bond and slowly along with Boone and Yoast, bring the team together.I would compare this movie to Glory Road, the movies are almost identical themes, except Glory Road is about basketball, and the overall message and racism is a little more hardcore.The film had great cinematography and lighting, especially during the football game scenes. The shots are almost dark and gloomy giving a sense of attrition and an importance of something more than the game at hand. They are fighting for something more than just a win, they are playing for each other, and to show that they are the best team and not just a joke. These techniques aid into the overall them of the movie and showing them overcome there personal and social problems with each other, and the town.Reference Boggs, J., & Petrie, D. (2008).

The movie displays the racial tension between races in the south at that time. In the beginning of the movie the black and white players do not respect each other. The coaches have their differences as well. Through their training camps and season they realize that they have more in common than they thought. The players begin to bond and figure out that they can be great if they work as a team. There are many unfair rules that the black head coach played by Denzel Washington faces. One of these include that he will be fired if he loses a single game.This movie has good acting and a strong message. There are many arguments between players or coaches that get you thinking. You're not sure which side is the correct one and in some cases they are both valid arguments. The only problem I had with the movie was the football game play scenes. They were slow passed and didn't look realistic. The plays didn't get you fired up because of their lack of intensity.

            "content": "An American classic, combining two symbols of our culture: football and Hollywood. Remember the Titans is a movie that brings a deeper message than what you find in its plot. Using T.C. William's High School in Virginia, the movie combines the dramatic effect of Hollywood and places emphasis on outstanding football performance in order to showcase how the sport of football can unite two clashing cultures and ethnicities. The Hollywood aspect was used well in showcasing a problem that is still inherit in today's society, although not as widely seen as it was in the 1970's. The movie itself is about T.C. William's magical run towards a state championship, in their first year as an integrated school. The movie highlighted T.C. William's memorable moments throughout the season, including a heart-stopping championship game win. Racism was something that started off as a problem at the beginning of the movie, but with the teams run to state, very few were mad about the differences in race, as long as the school kept winning. With fights between white and black players, riots between parents and rocks thrown into the black head coach's house, the movie never shortcut how bad the situation of racism was at the time. Furthermore, Denzel Washington and Will Patton did a great job playing the lead roles for this movie. Developing a strong personality towards both of the coaches really gave a feel for the movie. They work together to fight racism within their own career, as they help others move on as well. One white coach and one black coach who put aside their differences for the good of the football team made it possible for their future success as a team.Personally, Remember the Titans is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. This movie combined aspects of humor, drama, and seriousness in order to convey its message pertaining to racism. I would watch this movie again as it helped me believe that sports can have a deeper meaning than just winning or losing.",

Yes, it was sugarcoated, the racism was over-simplified & some of the actual facts were changed, but it's a 2-hour movie & during that time it made me connect with all the characters, as well as laugh & cry & take a deep look inside myself & think about the times that I had prejudices & stereotypes & how I can become a better person. We all have room to learn & grow & this movie helps you realize that without making you feel defensive. It's definitely a `feel good' movie. Some of the messages on this web site ask \"Why so much football in this movie?\" I think it's because they were trying to show that when people have a common bond, they are more apt to get to know each other - it's human nature to want to be with someone like you. So with racism, people dislike/hate other races because they talk different, look different, eat different foods, etc. OK, I am over-simplifying this, but you get my point. Another example - 9/11. All Americans came together with a common bond - we were attacked.  Our differences as blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, etc. were gone because we had a common spirit at that moment.  Obviously this movie was on a much smaller scale & did not address an array of other deep issues, but it was just trying to show that this group of guys who first hated each other, ended up bonding through their common interest of football which helped them look past initial prejudices & become one (team or group).  When they played other schools, they were ONE - the \"Titans.\"  By being forced to look past their outside differences (skin color, economical background), they realized they were basically the same inside - just wanting to play football/sports, hang out, sing/dance/music, maybe go to college....just be teenagers!! REMEMBER THE TITANS is definitely one of my favorite movies now. I love it when a movie makes you feel happy, sad & doesn't end with a total fairy-tale ending....IT MAKES YOU THINK!

The main advantage of setting a specific goal in a team is that each individual sets aside trivial and minute differences and everyone meshes together under one common objective, which is achieving the set desired goal. To be a truly remarkable team, each member must have faith in the ability of his fellow members, be comfortable playing with them, be honest about how they feel and most importantly respect them for who they are and from where they are. Difficulties arise, fights happen and misunderstandings occur, but overcoming those and rising head held high, is the ultimate triumph. The staff and coaches must also have a mutual rapport among themselves; they must be willing to make sacrifices and protect their team from all sorts of animadversions. Prejudice results from lack of understanding and in order to overcome that, one must first approach and understand the life and hardships of the other, in order to possess the power to decide to become their friend or another just a passer-by.",

The performances, including that of Denzel Washington as the head coach, are uniformly solid, the production values are great, the soundtrack is stellar, and the football action feels real.  Where it becomes frustrating, and it happens early and it happens often, is the fact that the swelling music score consistently sets the table for inspirational speech after inspirational speech, all leading to the following questions: Will the players learn to see beyond the color barrier?  Will the team win the state championship?  Will the head coach be accepted by the community?  You probably know the answers to these questions even if you haven't watched the movie yet.",

Denzel's performance in this movie is terrific and the writing for him and the rest of the movie is really good. I think the standout performance in this movie is Hayden Panettiere as Sheryl Yoast, the daughter of the white coach.

            "content": "In the summer of 1971, at the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black head coach who was supposed to lead the black high school's football team, is assigned to the coaching staff under current white head coach Bill Yoast, who previously led the white high school and has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. In an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools are \"white\" only, the school district decides to change course and name Boone the head coach. He refuses, believing it unfair to Yoast, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone, to his daughter Sheryl's dismay. Soon after, the black students trying out for the team have a meeting in the gymnasium with Boone, but this turns into a fiasco when Yoast and several white students interrupt it. After this, Boone takes Yoast aside and explains how he will run the team and that black and white does not matter to him, leaving Yoast with renewed faith in Boone. On August 15, the players gather and journey to Gettysburg College, where their training takes place. Early on, the black and white team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell. However, through forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone\u2014which includes an early morning run to the Gettysburg National Cemetery and a motivational speech\u2014the team achieves racial harmony and comes out a unified team. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice before slowly gaining support from the community...\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., Remember the Titans received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"An inspirational crowd-pleaser with a healthy dose of social commentary, Remember the Titans may be predictable, but it's also well-crafted and features terrific performances.\" James Berardinelli writing for ReelViews, called the film \"relentlessly manipulative and hopelessly predictable\" but noted that it was \"a notch above the average entry in part because its social message (even if it is soft-peddled) creates a richer fabric than the usual cloth from which this kind of movie is cut.\" Describing some pitfalls, Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer said that \"beneath its rah-rah rhetoric and pigskin proselytizing, it's no more provocative or thoughtful than a Hallmark Hall of Fame film or, for that matter, a Hallmark greeting card. Its heart is in the right place, but it has no soul.\" Wilonsky however was quick to admit \"The film's intentions are noble, but its delivery is ham-fisted and pretentious; you can't deny the message, but you can loathe the messenger without feeling too guilty about it.\" Todd McCarthy, writing in Variety, said, \"As simplistic and drained of complexity as the picture is, it may well appeal to mainstream audiences as an 'if only it could be like this' fantasy, as well as on the elemental level of a boot camp training film, albeit a PG-rated one with all the cuss words removed.\"[22] Roger Ebert, in the Chicago Sun-Times, viewed the film as \"a parable about racial harmony, yoked to the formula of a sports movie,\" adding, \"Victories over racism and victories over opposing teams alternate so quickly that sometimes we're not sure if we're cheering for tolerance or touchdowns. Real life is never this simple, but then that's what the movies are for\".\n\n\"Remember The Titans\" ends up in the same trap as \"Friday Night Lights\", not managing to stay on the right side of being a strong drama but rather being a silly melodrama despite being based on a true story and it has an important message concerning race. \"Remember The Titans\" is a stereotypical sports film with silly dialogue/silly scenes and a more or less predictable storyline and a overbearing American gung ho vibe. Denzel is solid as always, but that\u00b4s not enough for me. And I couldn\u00b4t stand Hayden Panettiere precocious 9 year old.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is a masterpiece, probably the greatest movie I have ever watched! This movie has brought history to life. This movie was first introduced to me in middle school, where when I watched it, I thought it was just a football movie that had racism in it. As I continued to rewatch the movie, as my high school health teacher, who witnessed this happening in real life since she attended school with the real characters in the movie, I started to witness the details for its true meaning. I started to put myself in the shoes of the actresses shoes, on how bias the school system was, impacting a sports event, where being a different race should not impact the game, the performance of the athletes as well as the chemistry and performance of the team in whole should be the one to talk and show what the end game score should be. Remember the titans had many symbolisms, from the new head coach being seen as a god and savior due to him bringing in equality for each player to the controversy that each race has faced, both races learning the true meaning of racism from their own experiences, changing their perspective on one another. I have seen other sports movies such as 42, My All American, Dangal, Coach Carter, and a few more, but none of those could stand up to the emotions that Remember the Titans had. This movie tackled real life issues that we have faced over the years and are still facing, such as racism, equality, and death. If you were to watch this movie, you would think it would display just football and racism, but it includes inspirational speeches by not just the coaches, but the players themselves; displaying a few scenes of a musical to show the atonement of happiness. This movie had inspired me to watch several other sports movies and to pay attention to the scenes, either by what the actresses were saying, the music playing in the background, or just by the way the actresses were being presented, such as the zooming in on the actresses and blurring everything out when something important between the two are happening. I would definitely recommend watching this movie because it has happiness and sadness, but it teaches you a whole lot about history and how the impacts were not just impacting adults, but it was teaching the children to hate at a young age. I would watch this movie with anyone who would give it a try, since it just isn't about sports at the end of the day, it is about the message that the movie is trying to give out, by using football as an example of it since this event actually took place in real life with TC Williams High Schools football team.",

Will Patton is sound as Bill, while Ethan Suplee is hilarious in his parts as Louie.\n\nCredit to Ronna Kress for the rest of the casting, a lot of well-known faces in this. Ryan Gosling, Ryan Hurst, Hayden Panettiere, Donald Faison - that's pretty impressive.\n\nAs with most biopics, it isn't 100% accurate but it does a respectable job at the portrayal of problems of the time - even if it is carried by Washington & Co.",

I recall seeing this film shown several times in school to demonstrate true sportsmanship and decency. To understand someone different from your takes a kind of bravery that is integral to society.\n\nThe music score is beautiful much like the variety of 1970's era songs that light up Remember the Titans' soundtrack like the floodlights of a football field. The clothing, language, and social dynamic all fit the era. You often feel you are watching a documentary rather than just a recreation.\n\nDenzel Washington is phenomenal as the tough and groundbreaking coach. His speeches and demeanor will inspire you like his players. Denzel delivers not only a convincing performance, but a dramatic level of acting that touched a generation of actors and audiences. Alongside Malcolm X, Training Day, and Fences stands Remember the Titans proudly.\n\nI must also mention the excellent supporting role from Will Patton. His assistant coach displays an important side to the story of a man that changes his perspective entirely. It is in steps towards progress like this story that we move society forward towards a new understanding of each other.\n\nThis is a great film, an entertaining movie, a gripping football tale, an informative historical piece, and a wonderful parable.

Two schools come together and combine and create one big team. Then the team goes out to a camp called Gettysburg, and study each one another to form bonds between the two ethnic groups. And it also explains how these young men work together to form strong friendships and are able to become football champions. In this paper, it will be explained why and how this movie portrays friendship using the characters, respect, and how looking deeper into other's eyes could possibly change things. The main purpose of this movie is to create friendships, these friendships in the movie symbolises learning about each other and using it to mend the bond. And how friendship is based on the color that stands out to others from the inside, instead of out.Characters in the movie \"Remember the Titans\" makes this movie golden. The way they act, helps the audience see what is going on and the tension that is going on inside the movie.  The way the characters bond slowly throughout the movie with each other, makes \"friendship\" an inspirational aspect. The 2 main characters Coach Boone, played by Denzel Washington, and Coach Yoast, played by Will Patton, also set the movie up. It shows how these two coaches take a group of boys, and make them respect each other, to be successful. Which causes the group of boys to become friends, as well as get to know each other. By forcing the love of football onto them, they realize that friendship is a big deal in any kind of sport you play. For example, at the camp Gettysburg, they will have 2-day practices, until they get to know every person's name, and what that person likes. For example, Louie Lastik, one of the football players says, \"I eat lunch with Rev sir.... Me and Rev both dig on the Temptations sir.\"Boone used the cemetery at Gettysburg, as the example for having the players get to know each other better. He said \" 50,000 men died right here, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting amongst ourselves today.... Listen to their souls man, kill my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family...You listen take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now, on this hallowed ground we too will be destroyed.\" This shows how many people use to fight others over color of skin, fighting over which part of this country you come from. But, he also is trying to say that, if we don't come together we will destroy ourselves without the work and understanding of others. Friendship can be built in and with anybody, and they don't have to be the same color skin, or from the same place that you're from. As a society, we need to come together and put aside our differences.\"I don't care if you like each other or not but, you will respect each other.\" Respect, is something you earn. It's not just given to you, you have to work for it. In this movie, respecting each other is another important point. Having respect for others, especially who aren't like you, is very one, very important point made in this movie. For example, those who have different backgrounds, like the characters in this movie. Judging a book by its cover is not a very great way to understand and become friends with people, and in this movie, it shows us how these young men overcame that. In conclusion, \"Remember the Titans\" showed great emphasis on the importance of seeking the differences in people physically, emotionally, and mentally. And making lasting friendships with people who have different ethnic backgrounds and interests, as well as social lives. It also shows how working together as a team can strengthen each other as individuals, and as a whole. Learning how to respect other people's point of views and understand where they are coming from is a key topic in this movie created by Yakin. The thing that I learned was that different people have different things that they value, and different perspectives that others might not see.",

            "content": "In a time of separation, change, and -in honor of the super bowl- football; a movie such as Remember the Titans is a great reminder of the enduring actions that took place when America was in another time of great change. This movie portrays the real life story of a town called Alexandria, Virginia experiencing major integration transitions in 1971. Not only does their high school, T.C. Williams High, become integrated; but also their praised football team who traded their beloved head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) for an African American coach named Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Washington again provides the world with another great performance. His portrayal of a high-stressed and intense football coach is evident as he tends to obnoxiously chew his gum throughout every play of a game and expresses his anger with football referees by humoring the audience with his lack of personal space and dramatic hand motions. Boone, a humble and family-oriented man, decides to let Yoast become an assistant coach; together the two struggle to work hand-and-hand in front of the town and, more importantly, their players throughout the season. This movie is an inspiring reflection of one of the greatest transitions in American history, shown through the eyes of all ages and a sport that we have all grown to love.\nThe original T.C. Williams High football captain and All-American, Gary Bertier, was brilliantly played by Ryan Hurst. Hurst turns Bertier's natural aggressive body posture into a less-dominant and respectful-type mannerism in times of tension. Usually, this happens when Washington approaches Bertier with his portrayal of an intimidating and almost humorous type of coaching authority. Another character that was delivered by a talented actor was Bertier's new found friend, Julius Campbell (Wood Harris). Harris also turns his intimidating first impression into a surprisingly timid personality throughout the movie. This was conveyed to the audience when Julius walks into Bertier's white dominant neighborhood for the first time and delivers a nervous stutter when confronted by Bertier's neighbors. Ultimately, both of these actors were able to take the harsh judgements people had regarding their new found friendship and reacted in a way that will surely make the audience feel uncomfortable at times. Later on in the movie the actors were able to warm the hearts of all that were watching by bringing comfort and a sense of brotherhood to both of their characters whenever they would step onto the football field. \nScenes like this captured the hearts of many due to the genius behind the camera, Philippe Rousselot. Rousselot's ingenuity perfectly captured a scene where Sunshine wants to take Blue and Petey to a restaurant to celebrate their win. When Sunshine forces his two friends into the restaurant, Rousselot captured Petey and Blue's desire to hide by creating an over-the-shoulder shot, giving the audience the perspective of the two young men's unwelcome feeling in a public venue within their own town. Shots like this helped depict the society-changing transition this town was going through from both the white and African American perceptive. \nThe emotions this movie illustrates to its audience is due to the work of Gregory Allen Howard who beautifully wrote the screenplay for this movie. Howard was able to show the audience how to turn tragedy into togetherness with his inspirational, heart-warming, and witty screenplay. As he located a memorable scene at the Battlegrounds of Gettysburg, he had Washington deliver a speech to the players that will surely send chills down your spine. \nHoward was able to deliver a lesson of overpowering hate with acceptance in a way that makes the audience form a loving bond towards this movie. This lesson was greatly needed for that time (1971), but also one that our society is in need of today. Because \"before we reach for hate; always, always, we remember the Titans\".",

This is one of those films that I haven't seen, and everybody has in school, which I kept in my DirecTV list for a few years. When I was thinking that I need to delete some movies, this was one of them, and after watching it, I had a hard time deleting it because it was better than I thought was going to be. Denzel Washington is just amazing as he usually does, and gives his performances 100% from any film that he's in, and when he gave some speeches in this, it's really effective and make you feel that you're along the ride with them. Will Patton is good in it, and it feels believable when he's going through a transition that is supportable. The characters are a lot of fun, especially the team who are just trying to deal with high school because of the people in there that's racially diverse. The football scenes are fun to watch, even when you know where it was going in the climax. The story is a little bit different than what you see in a film like this, but you can see where it was going at times. There are a lot of good-feel moments where it's the speeches that are well-written, or the dances which I remember seeing something like that in a Frosted Flakes commercial. I like the social commentary of the film with the racial issue as it's similar, but is different for what it is. Remember the Titans is a really great film that honestly could've been worse when it's Disney at the early age when dealing with serious stuff, and while it's not quite as extreme as you usually see, there are some adult moments in there that'll shocked kids, but still have humor and heart in there that'll get kids laughing and smiling with their parents.",

            "content": "Remember This Movie-It's a Score!\nRemember the Titans is quite simply one of the greatest sports movies ever made. From tensions to touchdowns, the film follows the true story of a high school football team that defies all odds by coming together and overcoming racial differences. \nSet in Virginia in the 1970's, the film delves into tensions involving school segregation. A federal mandate to desegregate closed the white and black high schools and students were sent to T.C. Williams High School. Successful football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) was replaced by black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) in an attempt to suppress negativity from the community. Coach Boone accepted the position and Yoast grudgingly accepted an assistant coaching position. The initial challenge the athletes faced came while attending training camp, however. Tensions rose and fights broke out, but coach Boone kept his team in check. He forced the team members to spend time together and get to know each other as people rather than colors. A morning run to the Gettysburg battlefield was a reminder that the battle the team was fighting was the same as their ancestors'. Once those racial walls were broken down, the athletes returned home where the real challenge awaited them: the responsibility to exemplify what they had learned. \nThe film shows racial issues of that time period, but spends more time showing the football team's accomplishments. Nevertheless, the film is still an excellent feel-good movie with emotional scenes between athletes and coaches, the Gettysburg scene being one of the best.  \nUnlike other sports films that focus on successes and trials of individual athletes (e.g. When the Game Stands Tall or 1000 to 1), Remember the Titans is a comeback story about a team's hardships.  \nRemember the Titans is a step above other sports films because the historical and emotional lessons it teaches are fantastic. The film is a successful interpretation of societal issues from the 1970s while incorporating a high school football team's story of overcoming adversity.",

            "content": "A Film Worth Remembering.\n\n\tTaking place in Virginia, \"Remember the Titans\" brings the tensions of integration to life. The film follows the struggles of a football fanatic town as their high school, and football team, integrate. Coach Boone, an African American man, is sent in to fill the position of head coach, knocking out, well known and well loved, head coach Yoast. Though the two men faced their own issues of pride and difference in coaching styles, they battle to overcome their differences and develop a bond that will carry over to their players. \n\n\tDenzel Washington, Coach Boone, encounters racism throughout the entirety of the film. At one point a member of the local black community comes to Boone, asking him to decline the head coach position to keep the town peaceful. Boone responds, \"I just can't do that.\" His wife then walks into the room telling him there's something he needs to see outside. As soon as he steps onto the porch, applause fills the night air. The street was completely filled with members of his community. He stood in awe as they displayed their love and support. The world would do well to learn from Boone's character. We need more people who are willing to not only stand up for what they believe in, but to stand by it - no matter who is trying to push them down. Boone refuses to be bullied or belittled. I'd love to see him and Trump go head to head.   \n\nSome of the most monumental moments of the film take place at Boone's boot camp. As the boys are loading the buses, Gerry Bertier, former team captain, approaches Coach Boone telling him who plays which position and that Boone's black players are basically not needed. Boone stands closer to Gerry and in a soft stern voice tells him to take a good long look at his mama because she's not coming on the bus with him. He says, \"Now when you get on that bus, you know who your daddy is right? Who's your daddy Gerry?\" At this moment, Boone demands respect from the leader of the white half of his new football team. He also establishes that he is a family man, and he fully intends to turn this team into a family. After seating everyone on the bus by position, therefore integrating the buses, Boone announces that the player they are sitting next to will also be their roommate at camp. Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell, new promising player, find themselves sitting next to each other but have no idea their friendship will become unshakeable, and eventually their example leads not only the team, but the town. The moment their movement starts is after they complete a good play at camp. Gerry excitedly shoves Julius and yells, \"LEFT SIDE!\" Julius hesitantly looks at Gerry for a moment, then shoves back yelling, \"STRONG SIDE!\" The chant continues as they grab each other by the jersey and come head to head. Physically, it looks as if they are about to kill each other. They are quite literally butting heads. However, the emotion of this scene is high as it is the first moment that racial barriers truly begin to fall within the team. The two join the forces of their influence to start truly integrating the team. \n\nWhen the season officially starts, the Titans begin winning games, and the town erupts. It seems nothing could possibly go wrong, but like any good film, \"Remember the Titans\" calls an audible, that will surely toss the audience the most stressful trick play yet. It will have the audience cheering and crying along with the well developed characters. \n\n\tDirector Boaz Yakin took it to the endzone with this film. Not only was he able to capture the emotion and tension of the time period, he managed to do so in a family friendly way. The film refrains from major profanity and racial terms, if only our presidential candidate could do the same. The film is well paced and well spaced. All in all, this sports drama might be one of Yakin's best films yet. \n\nAlthough this film is 16 years old, it remains incredibly relevant as our society faces racial and sexual discrimination. We could learn from Boone's integrity, respect, and leadership. It wouldn't hurt for us to brush up on the loyalty, virtue, perseverance and friendship displayed by Gerry and Julius. \"Remember the Titans\" is indeed worth remembering; many of the issues handled within the film need to be handled in today's world. As viewers follow the movement and growth of their favorite characters, it's no surprise they too will leave with the desire to become better and help make our society one history will want to remember.",

Based upon a less well-known episode in the racial history of American sports, the integration of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, it provides an awful lot of swelling from within.  \nCoach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) meet in the beginning of the movie and Coach Yoast shares his concern that his players won't play.  Coach Boone then says that the best player will play, skin color doesn't matter.  Coach Yoast then responds with, \"Coach, I'm afraid that is the only thing that does matter right now.\"  Coach Boone and Coach Yoast do an unbelievable job of balancing the effects of racism in developing these young football players into men.  They use football to teach them to control their anger on the gridiron, but most importantly, in real life.   \nThe moment that changes the team from a group of individual to an actual team is when Coach Boone takes them on a run through the woods to Gettysburg.  He shares his feelings of how 50,000 men died on the very ground they were standing on fighting the same battle they were fighting today.  Life is not necessarily about liking everyone you're around, but respecting them.  That's all Boone asks from them, to help them become a group of men. \nIn the end of it all, this movie crosses more than one goal line and overcomes defeat.

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" is a movie based in 1970s. An all-white school becomes integrated by black students. This soon becomes dangerous when people from the community, parents, and students begin to realize that it is an adjustment that no one is ready to make. The students are divided, but began to break down the color barriers as they realize that they all must work together if they want to win the football championship. The original coach of the football team becomes furious after he is demoted and must now be second in command to an African American (Denzel Washington). This is an amazing film that everyone should get the chance to watch.\n\tThe actors were all top notch performers. Not a second in the movie would pass by where the audience members were not holding on to every word spoken. From the plays, to the locker-room, to the scenes where the players were home, their acting skills would shine through. When a character was introduced that gave the audience a reason to dislike them (like the coaches on the other teams), there would be genuine hate attached to that character.  Each of the players played an important part in bringing the movie to life.\n\tThis is a fast paced drama that depicts racial tension among racially integrated schools and football teams. Race and segregation are both touchy issues, and the film did a good job portraying the issues despite the fact that this was a Walt Disney produced movie. There were few to know racial slurs thrown during the movie (which I appreciated). \n\tThe different settings help add to the progression of the movie. The high-school shows how the students begin acting once the school becomes integrated. Steeped in racial turmoil, little to no contact is made among the football players. As the film moves to the football field, tension is still high as the boys try to outshine each other rather than work together. \nIt isn't until they lose a game that they realize that they must put aside their differences and work together. At a time when people could not be more divided, football brought everyone together. This sudden change of heart allowed the boys to bond both on and off the field. You begin to see their lives, as well as the community, change as they become more accepting of the other race. The head coach (Denzel Washington) is also receiving hate from each of the other coaches because he is African American and coaching an integrated team. Their tones begin to change after they realize that their comments don't hold much value once the Titans begin to win.\n\tThe rich dialogue keeps the audience focused on the excitement unfolding within the movie, but also supplies you with scenes of comic relief. There is a shower scene where they guys bond by singing a song (I know it sounds cheesy, but it works). One quote that many people remember is from the head coach. He is being disrespected by another coach, but responds with, \"I don't scratch my head unless it itches and I don't dance unless I hear some music. I will not be intimidated. That's just the way it is.\" This quote alone shows the unbreakable spirit that the characters in the movie have. \n\tRemember the Titans is a classic. It handles the plot better than a lot of films from its time, and also tops the charts as a family favorite. The film shows the racial tension begin to die down as the football players begin to bond. When the Titans accepted each other as brothers, their community saw them as a team.",

All of this is shown from the viewpoint of Herman Boone, played by Denzel Washington, the black coach who usurped the successful incumbent and stirred racial prejudices amongst the general public.\n\nAlso featuring a cast that includes Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kate Bosworth and an early small role for Ryan Gosling, the film is well acted, and it takes the racial tension and portrays it in a reasonably gripping way. In addition, the soundtrack contains some brilliant tracks. However, the film contains Disney's drawn out cliched tense moments, and is drowned in feel-good syrup, blunting some of the message that this film could convey.\n\n7/10",

Ever films in the genre seem to embody the feel good aspect that has been a staple of the genre since the early sports movies, and I'm fine with that. With Remember the Titans, we have a good drama that is based on real events, and does something a bit different than your normal genre film, but it does add the typical elements that are we come to expect with these films. What is great about the film is the fact that it adds a lot to the story by showing the racial tension, and in doing that, the plot becomes more intricate, engaging and thought provoking. The performances are very good, and there several that stand out, especially that of its lead actors Denzel Washington and Will Patton. The film tackles an important subject that goes beyond the sports dramatic genre, and it does it pretty well. However, I did feel that at times there could have been a few improvements as well. Remember the Titans is a good film, but one that should really have stood considering the subject the film displays. If this wasn't released by Disney, then maybe a much better movie would have been made. This is good for what it is, but you end up wanting more from its story. For a sports film that uses the issue of race in its story, this film really should have been memorable. But what we have here is good entertainment, but to viewers wanting a bit more, you'll be a bit disappointed because like all other genre films, it is a tad predictable, and it left a lot of unexplored ideas that just never came to fruition. Nonetheless, Remember the Titans is a good story, one that showed teamwork in the face of prejudice, and in the end it's all that matters.",

The movie is about a newly integrated high school that must learn to cope with the struggles of school as well as playing football with such high tensions. A black head coach takes a white man's position which causes controversy. The team, now integrated, must learn how to play together on the field and look after each other off the field. In order to be successful they have to put aside the differences of their skin tone. It gives you a slight visual into what is was like back then in regards to newly integrated schools. You can see the struggles the students faced and the director uses a football team to metaphorically show the struggle within the school and how it is possible to become a family and get along no matter what the color of your skin is. While watching the movie you will see humor, happiness, sadness, camaraderie, internal and external struggle, compromise, and love. If you want to see a movie that will tap in all sorts of different emotions than this is one for you. In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made, with a mixture of serious issues with some light heartedness this is a classic that the whole family can see. Whatever your age, you can definitely take something away from seeing Remember the Titans.",

The movie appeals to football fans as well as the average viewer, using a football team to describe the struggles of African Americans in the 1970s and how they overcome the race barrier. Based on a true story, this movie follows the journey of Coach Herman Boone in coaching the newly integrated TC Williams High School football team. Denzel Washington plays the role of the frank, passionate coach who is not afraid to tell it how he sees it while attempting to integrate African Americans into the program. His intensity throughout the whole movie is mesmerizing and he churns out memorable interactions with his players. In one such moment, Coach Boone asks his running back (Petey) after he fumbles a ball: \"How many feet are in a mile? How many feet are in a mile?\" After Petey mumbles, Boone screams at him, \"5,280 feet! You pick this ball up and run every one of em! You're killing me, Petey! You're killing me!\" While the plot is fairly predictable and not necessarily riveting, the movie more than makes up for it with tense emotional moments and a likability the viewer develops for both the players and the coaches. Overall, it is a certainly worth seeing for people of all ages, and also sends a strong societal message to the audience.",

            "content": "The last thing I expected from Remember the Titans was for it to be a Disney movie, but I would never miss a Denzel Washington film and I'm sure that with him on board they wouldn't mess it up.\n\nAmerican football films tend to be dark and gritty as they emphasise the savage nature of football. But with Disney producing the film, they emphasise the fact that \"Football is about controlling anger\" as Denzel Washington rates early on. That way it lightens to mood of the film without ever reducing itself into descending into melodramatic territory. And luckily enough, Boaz Yakin respects his viewers enough not to hide its racial subject matter away from viewers. \nWhile the view of racism is dealt with rather simplistically, it does so in such a basic manner that young viewers are able to easily comprehend the idea and learn from it as well. Although at times it feels like the film is playing it a bit safe and only lightly touching upon its theme of racism so that it can still remain light and family friendly as a way of sticking with Disney standards, overall the experience was good. I liked the fact that the film lightly touched upon the theme because it reminds us that racial equality is really not something that needs to be dramatised, its simply just something that doesn't need to be thought about too much. Equality shouldn't require audiences to think and truly consider if it is ok, they should just acknowledge the fairness in it and move on. I guess all in all I have mixed feelings about how Remember the Titans tackles racism because it doesn't think too much about the idea and plays it a bit safe, but really it doesn't need to. The only problem is that since the theme is one of the most key to the film, it should be explored a bit better. And also, the film is rather predictable from start to finish and implements some childish elements in to make it more of a Disney feature which drains elements of the serious nature of the film, such as the character Sheryl Yoast who really doesn't seem believable and feels thrown in there just so that the film has a child to add to its list of characters. \nAnd also, the drama within the plot elements seems rather scattered. While I enjoyed the drama and that it had a touch of comedy at times to lighten the mood, it didn't always feel like the drama had been as effective as it really should have been. The movie feels perhaps a little too light at times for a story which deals with such themes, and so as a drama Remember the Titans may be effective for young age groups without being too rough but is a little thin for the older crowds.\nBut aside from that, Remember the Titans is a successful film. It's largely a film about coaching, and coaching films don't tend to impress me as much as I'd hope. But Remember the Titans finds an important balance between the importance played by the coach and the actual team itself. Although it may not be as widely intelligent and interesting as it could be, as a sports film, it has a lot of heart and uplifting spirit to it which is where the importance lies.\nRemember the Titans is well written and is packed to the edge with a lot of interesting characters so that every plot dynamic the story goes through maintains various sources of interest. In Remember the Titans, you have to be able to remember that the importance comes from how the coach and the team work together, so a lot of what is interesting comes from the ways that the team members interact with each other throughout the film and its various plot dynamics. And thanks to the efforts of the cast, the characters are interesting enough.\nDenzel Washington is an actor who never lets me down, and Remember the Titans is no exception. His performance captures all the dedicated spirit necessary for the characterisation of Coach Herman Boone without going over the top. Denzel Washington's performance in Remember the Titans is a restrained one and in that manner it proves effective and inspiring, therefore having both Denzel Washington and Herman Boone essentially pay tribute to one another by putting Denzel Washington in the role.  Denzel Washington is the highlight of Remember the Titans, and it is his performance that will actually leave viewers remembering rhe Titans.\nWill Patton's performance is an effective one as well, because due to the strong way he interact with all the other actors in Remember the Titans, his role as Coach Bill Yoast is a fairly good one which pays the man the tribute he deserves. He's no Denzel Washington, but he's undeniably good.\nI'm never gonna forget Donald Faison for her performance as Chris Turk in Scrubs, so I was surprised when I saw him in Remember the Titans. But I was very enthralled because I think he's a great actor who is very talented as well as hilarious, and his performance in Remember the Titans was full of the same energy that he put into 9 seasons of Scrubs without going as far as putting a comedic focus on his character. He just puts a lot of charming spirit into his performance, and it makes the entire experience more enjoyable by playing a friendly figure. Donal Faison is a great addition to the cast in Remember the Titans.\nKip Pardue gave a meaningful and friendly performance as well, as did Ethan Suplee. And a young Ryan Gosling makes an appearance too which is good to see.\nLastly, Remember the Titans is well filmed and benefits from a strong soundtrack. Although some of the time the editing during football matches is rather quick, overall the visual experience is fairly good, thanks in part to a lot of quality scenery which has been shot on location.\n\nSo while Remember the Titans may be a bit light for its own good its sporting spirit and dedicated cast make it an uplifting look at American football that honours the titular team very well.",

In this 2000 film, Denzel Washington and Will Paton bring the movie to life with there amazing acting.\r\n\r\nThis film is a true story of a newly appointed African-American coach and his high school football team on their first season as a team with black members. This was during the time where blacks were discriminated against, so this team was not well thought of. This film had an original plot and kept me on my seat as it was hard for me to predict what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\nI think there was a theme or moral to this movie. Even though the Titans football team was a mix of black and white people, they overcame that and put there differences aside. I believe that there were 2 morals. 1.) To never give up, and 2.) No matter what skin color we are, we all belong to one human race and deserve to get along with one another.\r\n\r\nIn this film the camera work was excellent. Even when someone was talking for 30 seconds, the camera would slowly move up or tilt down. It was rare when the camera would just stay still. The camera work kept me interested in the film but was not so much as to where I was distracted from the movie.\r\n\r\nI loved this film. It is my favorite movie of all time. I would recommend this film to people who love sports, drama, or just being entertained. This film had joyful moments, sad moments, and even suspenseful moments where you could not tell what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\n-CE, 8th Grade Student",

But as I grew up and lost interest in the movie played too often in my home, my sweet summertime memories faded away. About a year ago I revisited the film for a class I was taking, and saw it in a whole new light. The issues the film highlights, racism in a heated and old world town in the south during the early 70s, are raw and real. Though the subject matter is heavy, the characters feel real, real teenage boys on a real high school football team. Denzel Washington, playing the team's African American coach, portrays the father figure needed by so many in the time period his character lives in. The film is flawlessly feel good and frighteningly convicting. A life time must see.",

            "content": "Some movies are so inspirational that you stop what you are doing just to watch it. Disney's Remember the Titans (2000), directed by Boaz Yakin, is one of these movies for me. I remember the high school field trip to Virginia in 2002 when I first saw the movie. On the school bus ride home to New York, I am trying to do homework. However, Remember the Titans starts playing and I could not stop watching it. As with many Hollywood movies, it is loosely based on the true story of the desegregation of the school system in Alexandria, Virginia. In real life, three schools are integrated: George Washington, Hammond, and T.C. Williams high schools. In the movie, it is the integration of the black George Washington and the white T.C. Williams. While the film includes characters with the names of the actual players, much of the racial tensions and drama of the season is sensationalized for the movie. For an excellent breakdown of the parts of the movie that are fact or fiction, please go to http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/rememberthetitans.php. As such, the real life events are less exciting as there is no racial tension among the team and the football team dominated the season. Nevertheless, I agree with the use of creative license. While racial tensions may not exist for the football team in real life, including them in the movie helps reflect the climate of the era. Moreover, dramatic games in a sports movie are important for drama. As T.C. Williams is a dominant team, it would have been very boring to watch them take knees at the end of most blowout wins during their season. Remember the Titans does an excellent job addressing the issues of race and how an unifying force, like football, can bridge differences.\nIn addition, the cast is great. Denzel Washington is a great actor and fantastic as Coach Herman Boone. Will Patton is also brilliant as Coach Bill Yoast. Wood Harris is great as the best of the black players, defensive end Julius Campbell, and Ryan Hurst does an excellent job as the best of the white players, Gerry Bertier.  The cast for the rest of the team is fantastic and are a great group of characters. The film also includes future stars in Ryan Gosling, Kate Bosworth, and a very young Hayden Panetierre. Hayden is the most memorable of the supporting characters as Coach Yoast's tomboy daughter, Sheryl. She is a diehard football fan. In one scene, she is passionately debating strategy with Coach Boone. When Coach Yoast comes into the scene, Boone asks \"Why don't you get this little girl some pretty dolls or something, Coach?\" In response, Yoast answers \"I tried. She loves football\". Moreover, her temper tantrums and frustration when plays go against the Titans during the movie are hilarious. While the rest of the cast are great characters, the movie is driven by Coach Boone, Coach Yoast, Julius Campbell, and Gerry Bertier. Moreover, the film is defined by the relationships between the two coaches as well as the best players, Julius and Gerry.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2013/08/27/retrospective-review-remember-titans/?fb_source=pubv1",

The football coaches of two of the schools, long-time favorite, Coach Yoats (Will Patton), and new-comer, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) agree to try and combine their teams and integrate their players to form the almighty Titans.

Will Patton also played a pretty decent part as Coach Yoates. In some places, I could see where he could've done better, but he did well overall. The other shiners were Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Craig Kirkwood as The Rev, Kip Pardue as Sunshine, Donald Faison as Petey, Wood Harris as Julius, and Hayden Pentierre as Sheryl Yoast. \r\n\r\nSCORE:The score was mainly songs from the time period mixed withe some inspirational themes.

The movie is an inspiring one as all sports movie tend to be, but if you are a tough nut to crack, you may start yawning at some places. It is quite predictable if you look at the movie objectively. There's the first half with all the good-for-nothing individuals, inspiration, motivation and boot camp training. Then there's the second half with the initial hardships, near losses, the inspired masterstroke and the big final win. But thanks to the racial undertone, the proceedings are dramatic enough to watch.The script is inconsistent that is it is too weak/lame at some points but very strong in other instances. Almost all energy has been put into making sure that everything looks right from the outside. Individual characterizations are poor and it shows in the actors' performance. Some scenes are written beautifully but some scenes fail to impress. The director Boaz Yakin too surprisingly sticks with the script and doesn't explore the many possible angles.Denzel Washington does an amazing job at the centre playing the insanely tough and bullish coach, Herman Boone. Will Patton who plays his calm deputy Bill Yoast is passive in the first half (thanks to the poor writing) but comes to the foreground and gives an acceptable performance as the movie progresses. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst share a great chemistry and give believable combined performances playing leaders of the black and white bandwagon respectively.The football scenes are a treat to watch. Make sure you know the jargon and tactics of football because if you don't enjoy them, you are gonna miss half the fun. Everything from the warm ups, the handful play sequences, the individual player's sacrifice for the good of the tea and the exchange between the coaches. The choreographer (if its the right word) deserves a round of applause for his work. Watch it if you are a fan of Denzel Washington or if you want to discover the meaning of team spirit. Watch the movie expecting exactly whats present in it and you will be impressed and walk out completely satisfied. But if you randomly walk in hoping to see something a class apart from others, this one will be a bit of a disappointment. But all in all, the experience will be worth 'remembering'...well at least for sometime.",
