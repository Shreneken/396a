            "content": "This movie came at the height of Lindsay's legal troubles so it was disregarded as an awful film at the time of release I remember, but I honestly consider this to be one of Lindsay Lohan's best films when it comes to darker and more serious work as an actress minus her comedy and family-friendly roles. For me this film has improved with age. It was not released at a time that it would have been found relevant.What was partly misunderstood about this film was it was marketed as a serious horror film that was intended to be frightening but instead it is more of a David Lynch and Twin Peaks kind of thing with an ambiguous ending and a mystery / crime storyline more than a horror one.This film captivates me each time I give it a watch. I would have liked Lindsay to explore more edgy roles in her past career during this time. The ending is quite eerie because it could almost go either way.I think this film is not as bad as Lindsay's Legal troubles would tell you it is. For someone like myself not looking to hate it, or hate on the actress/actors, I find it an enjoyable crime mystery. One of Lindsay's better roles for a more mature minded audience.I know some would find it ridiculous anyone could genuinely enjoy this movie. But it is just such a wacky premise and the themes are deliberate. It's competently acted, and the ending that didn't sit well at first, has improved with age.I think it's unfortunate that audiences didn't appreciate this film, but seeing as it has improved with age, and has kind of a timeless dreamlike quality to it. I would go as far to say this could be considered a cult classic some day. Maybe in 30 years someone else might appreciate this film only at face value.",

            "content": "Look, I have a strong stomach, but I have no use for Torture Porn in my entertainment. A few weeks ago, I saw a preview of this film that gave no indication of it's true nature. This, plus the intriguing poster led me to believe this was going to be a brooding drama in the Hitchcock tradition. Instead, I found myself watching the ugliest, most disgusting film I have ever attended of my own free will. I should have guessed when the cashier gave me a funny look while getting my ticket.The first thing I realized was the script was by an amateur. The scenes and dialog jumping around with no thought or subtlety. Like other reviewers, I knew who the torturing villain was within the first few minutes. But, I still had to sit through several scenes of dismemberment and pain, which made me sick. Sick that I had spent money to watch this disaster.I can't imagine why Lindsay Lohan would agree to be in this production. There are other venues to stretch her acting talents. Neal McDonough and Julia Ormond's rent must have been due.The story, such as it is has at it's core an interesting premise. A top director might have made a respectable film out of it with a total rewrite, without the gore and more atmosphere.This movie is an absolute, total disaster. No one involved has anything to be proud of.",

            "review_title": "A giallo at heart!",
            "content": "I'm going to start this off with an unpopular take. This is not a bad movie. When I first met my wife, she used to tell me how much she loved it and I thought she was crazy. Surely, everyone online that went out of their way to destroy it had to be right, right?Wrong. Go with me on this alternative universe logic - if Lindsey Lohan were a disgraced movie star in 1967 instead of 2007, she would have gone to Italy to make movies for directors like Bava, Argento, Martino and Antonio Margheriti. She would have been in the same company as Anita Ekberg, Florinda Bolkan, Elke Somer and even Edwige Fenech.The film has all the hallmarks of giallo: a serial killer is abducting, torturing and killing young women in the suburb of New Salem. An evening of fun for Aubrey Fleming (Lohan) turns into weeks of torture as she wakes up bound and gagged on an operating table, her hands deep in dry ice.The FBI Task Force has already given up hope of finding the killer, but a driver discovers Aubrey on a deserted road in the middle of the night. To the shock of her parents, she declares that she's really a stripper named Dakota Moss and has no idea who Aubrey Fleming is. And then she realizes that she's missing her hand and half of her leg.At this point, you're either going to give up on this movie or dive in. I advise diving right in.While the police, the doctors and her parents believe that this is all PTSD, Aubrey/Dakota insists that she is not who anyone thinks she is. Things get weirder when FBI agents discover a story on Aubrey's laptop about a girl with an alter ego named Aubrey. And DNA confirms that Dakota really is Aubrey. This inversion of identity is key to the main tenets of classic giallo.Dakota has a theory of her own: She's Aubrey's twin sister and her injuries are Corsican Brothers-like (or Tomax and Xamot, if you prefer) sympathetic wounds as she experiences the plight of her symbiotic sibling.Sure, her mother has a pregnancy ultrasound that shows only one fetus. But Dakota confronts her father (or Aubrey's, stay with me) as she believes that her mother lost that child soon after its birth and that she and Aubrey were the twin children of a crack addict named Virginia Sue Moss. Aubrey was taken to live in comfort city mouse style while she stayed with Moss, trailer park mouse style. The complication? Virginia Sue Moss was yet another character from Aubrey's short story.Richard Roeper claims that this is the worst movie of the 2000s, calling the film \"a ridiculous thriller (minus the thrills)\" and saying that it's filled with a\" nonsensical plot that grows sillier by the second, tawdry special effects, heavy-handed symbolism that's big on electric-blue hues and mechanical performances are all culprits as far as the title's concerned.\" Has Roeper even seen a giallo? Because reading that sentence makes me want to watch this movie all over again!Back to the movie: Dakota starts to see visions of the killer slicing up his captive which draws her to the cemetery. As she investigates the grave of another victim, Aubrey's friend Jennifer, she finds a blue ribbon from a piano competition. Aubrey was a noted pianist and there's a note attached from her (and Jennifer's) piano teacher, Douglas Norquist. As her father (or Aubrey's, look, it's not a giallo if you don't get confused) looks on, she declares, \"I know who killed me.\"That's because the ribbon says, \"Blue Ribbons Are For Winners, Never Settle For The Red, Rest In Peace, Douglas.\" It's a metaphor for the lives of the twins: Aubrey is the blue chipper with a boyfriend that loves her, good grades, plenty of friends and a bright future. Dakota works in the red light district and faces a life of poverty.Without any police backup - again, this happens all the time in giallo - they confront Norquist. Daniel is killed before Aubrey leaves the safety of the car and enters the house. She fights Norquist, cutting off his hand, before she's tied up. He asks her why she returned after he buried her alive before she frees herself and kills him. She heads into the woods where she digs up Aubrey, verifying that she was not insane and had been right all along. Then, she lies on the ground with her twin sister.Some of the few critics who liked this movie compared it to Brian DePalma or David Lynch films. Sure. Or you could go right to the source - Italy.If you replaced the score of the film (that said, I love that The Sword and The Melvins are heard in this film) with some insane synth or orchestral music (someone get Claudio Simonetti, Piero Umiliani or Morricone on the line), if you made the homes space age lounges filled with improbable furniture and if you had more than one scene of Lohan stripping (any of the sex in this movie is honestly the unsexiest sex ever, they should have really studied Sergio Martino movies), this movie would fit perfectly into my DVD collection between Hatcher for the Honeymoon and Inferno. Who am I kidding? It's on my shelf already!This is not the first time Lohan played twins on film, thanks to starring in the remakes of Freaky Friday and The Parent Trap. Again, this is perfect giallo casting - not to mention pure exploitation - showing her gone to seed as two twins who couldn't be more different.However, this was not an easy movie to film for director Chris Sivertson, as Lohan had an appendix operation during shooting. Plus, there were times when she would not show up at all - necessitating a body double be used to film the end of the movie. Even worse, she was followed by paparazzi throughout the shoot and some of them are still in the background of a few shots! There are giallo techniques used throughout the film, such as a neon sign outside the strip club that foreshadows Dakota's injuries and the fact that Bava-esque blue and red lighting determines which character is on screen between Aubrey and Dakota.While so many decry this film for not making any sense, if you've made it through any number of classics (sure, the director claims Hitchcock as a primary influence, but you can say that he's the well from which all giallo flows) like The Bird With the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red or Lizard in a Woman's Skin, you're going to be just fine. The world was just ready to devour Lindsey Lohan and this film would be its sacrificial lamb. Oh if only there were an Italian film industry for her to turn to and appear alongside Ivan Rassimov!",

            "content": "My friend and I were looking for a movie to see in the theater yesterday, everything I saw she didn't ad everything she saw I didn't, but one movie we didn't see was I Know Who Killed Me. We never heard of it, we actually for a minute didn't wanna see it because Lindsay Lohan was in it, but eventually we were just like \"What the heck?\". We needed a couple hours to kill and had free movie tickets that we got as a gift. So after seeing I Know Who Killed Me, I just was thinking of how much of a strange movie this was, but at the same time I didn't think it was all that bad, there were some things left unexplained and the ending was pretty lame, but I think over all, this was a thriller with good potential and just needed a little pick-me-up.Aubrey is a good girl who has strong potential to be a good writer and piano player, she has a good life, good home, loving parents, good friends, and a loving boyfriend. One night though, she is kidnapped and brutally tortured. Someone finds her on the road, but when Aubrey is picked up and taken to the hospital, she says she's not Aubrey, she's Dakota Moss, a stripper with a dirty life who has no idea what's going on, but she's not Aubrey. Is this a story that she's believing too much? Is this a possible side effect from being traumatized? Is this something from the drugs the killer was making her take? Or is she even right? Is it a possibility that she really isn't Aubrey? Everyone calls her crazy and just tries to make her believe that she is Aubrey, but Dakota searches for the truth and wants answers.Like I said, I Know Who Killed Me turned out to be a little surprise of a film, I liked it personally, there were things that were confusing, but over all I think the plot kept me guessing and going. Lindsay I would say did a good job, but the strip scenes at times were a little too much, just because we all know her personal life, so I think it would make us a little uncomfortable. There are some flaws to the film, but I wouldn't say to stay away, just keep your mind open and you might find yourself liking it.5/10",

When the mutilated body of her missing schoolmate Jennifer Toland is found, the locals grieve the student while the police chase the serial-killer. After a football game, Aubrey is kidnapped and then she is mutilated by the psychopath. A couple of weeks later, Aubrey is found unconscious in a lonely road and brought to the hospital with severed hand and foot in the same modus-operandi Jennifer was mutilated. When she awakes, she tells that she is the stripper Dakota Moss and her junky mother had an overdose and died. When the FBI finds that Dakota is one character of Aubrey's stories, they conclude the girl needs psychiatric treatment and protection. But Dakota insists she is not Aubrey\u0085 \"I Know Who Killed Me\" has a promising premise of a girl that denies being herself after a traumatic and extremely violent experience. The cinematography is stylish, with blue color for Aubrey and red for Dakota. However, the identity of the killer is easily predictable when Dakota visits Jennifer's parents. Unfortunately, the resolution is absurd and even ridiculous, imaging that what physically happens to Aubrey happens also to Dakota. The secret of Aubrey and Dakota is excellent, but unfortunately wasted in a bad screenplay. Further, most of the characters (FBI agents, Aubrey's boyfriend, the gardener) vanish near the weak conclusion. With improvements in the screenplay, this movie could be great. Nevertheless, the top nomination (9) to the 28th RAZZIE\u00ae Awards is unfair. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"Eu Sei Quem me Matou\" (\"I Know Who Killed Me\")",

            "content": "That's right, my girlfriend turned to me in the movie and said, \"I think BarbWire was better than this.\" Her opinion and mine seemed to carry through to the whole audience in the advance screening we went to last night. The audience was laughing at the horrible acting, terrible script and crap camera work.Specifics: Lohan works in a strip club where women are topless, yet she never takes the top off and even in sheer bra has pasties on (or were the pasties on top of the bra?). I could care less about seeing her naked, but if you are playing a stripper you might have to at least imply nudity with well placed hands.Someone decided to inject humor into the movie into the most awkward places. The biggest problem was trying to figure out why people were laughing more during the \"serious parts\" than the \"funny parts\".Characters come in, spout some wisdom and disappear behind a rock like the Dungeon Master. I have a feeling that they are supposed to be angels, maybe God himself? The twists in the movie are tough to swallow. I will not even come close to ruining them, they are not even worth ruining. Someone thought they could write a M. Knight script, but failed.Overall, this movie would be worth a rental from the dollar kiosk at the grocery store, as long as everything else is sold out.

The director did not know what to do with the fine actors that he had in the movie. Of the five movies he has down so far, this is the absolute worst movie that Silvertson has ever directed.

            "content": "\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is about a young college student named Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), who disappears one night while going out with some friends. She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor. But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger. Aubrey's worried parents try and uncover the truth, while Dakota tries to convince others that she isn't Aubrey... but is Aubrey really just pretending to be someone else? Is she suffering from a psychological problem triggered by her kidnapping and torture? Or could Dakota really perhaps be a real person? Watch and find out.After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I'm not a fan of Lohan particularly, but this film looked good. Unfortunately, it has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was a pretty good horror/thriller. The plot is original in its essential form, but does contain some clich\u00e9s here and there - all things considered though, this is an original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen in cinema (if at all). It's a mystery film, and it did do a very solid job at keeping the viewer guessing. The expected twists and turns take place as well, and I thought for the most part the plot twists were fairly well thought-out. You don't really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person. I did become a little confused at moments, and there were a few plot holes (which I expected considering the complex storyline), but overall I didn't see anything that affected the course of the movie. Things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much of a problem, but there were some holes that needed filling.Another thing that succeeds in this movie is the cinematography, it was really beautifully shot. Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene. Still, beautiful cinematography and some stylish editing get good points in my book, and this movie had both. Even in the sexual stripteases done by the Dakota character (where Lindsay's body is the main focus), the color use and cinematography shine. Good soundtrack as well that plays along with the flow of the film quite well, and really adds to the movie's energy. I was surprised at the amount of violence in this movie, but don't dismiss it if you are thinking it's something along the lines of a blatant torture flick, because this movie has a lot more to it than just that, unlike the recent trend of horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" manages to pack some suspense and tension that are vital to a good horror and/or thriller, and there were quite a few really scary scenes. Strangely enough, there is some unexpected humor to be found in the movie as well. One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I'm not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it's favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.As for the acting, I think a lot of people are slamming this movie unfairly because of it's lead actress, Lindsay Lohan. Whatever the reason that some may despise her, I'll put it like this - if it were another actress playing the lead, people wouldn't be as harsh as they are. Honestly, I think Lindsay gave one of the best performances of her career (so far) in this movie. Her previous films mainly consist of pointless teeny-bopper trash, so I respect her for doing something with a little more depth, and while her acting and delivery is a bit flat on occasion, she carries this movie well. Julia Ormand and Neil McDonaugh play her concerned and confused parents, and both do a good job in their roles too. As for the big secret ending (which I won't reveal here), I thought it was fitting. The showdown between Lindsay and the killer, while a bit contrived, was pretty scary, as was the villain. The explanation behind the Aubrey/Dakota mystery was really strange, and I wasn't expecting it to turn out the way it did, but I think that's a good thing. It may be a bit of a stretch for some because of the obscure subject (and the revelation seemed to kind of come out of nowhere), but I liked it for being different and not what I'd normally expect in a twist ending.Overall, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is a different but original horror/thriller. Cinematography was excellent, the storyline (while a little problematic at times) was original and very intriguing, there are some pretty creepy scenes, and the big plot twist was different from the norm. The acting wasn't that bad either, don't judge the movie by it's lead actress - I'm not a big fan of her either, but I found her to be fairly solid here. Recommended to horror and thriller fans if you're interested in a bit of a strange but nonetheless interesting movie. It's got a few plot holes and problems, but as I see it, the good outweighed the bad, and I was happy with the two hours I spent at the theater. 7/10.",

A big part of it is that it came out during a time where Lohan's career was at an all time low and the public pretty much hated her. That hatred was projected onto this movie, and so people began to hate it by default. I even know people who claimed they \"hated\" it when they hadn't even seen it. You can't make that claim without watching it first.The movie has a pretty interesting premise. It's a murder mystery involving twin stigmata. From what I've heard, however, most people were expecting some kind of twist at the end where it's revealed that the twins are actually the same person. When the movie didn't go that route, people were upset. That seems to be another reason why people primarily hated the movie. Personally, I think it was smart not to do that. Twin stigmata in movies is not something we've seen that often, but movies with a plot twist like that have been something we've seen a thousand times. The fact that so many people thought that's what would happen proves that. So people were upset that they didn't have some grand twist. Instead, the movie gave you exactly what it promised and was exactly what it was made out to be. Simple, but still good.Overall, I say to give the movie a chance. Ignore the hate you've heard about it and go in expecting it to be what it is, a simple murder mystery involving twin stigmata. Is it a masterpiece? No, of course not, but it's still a pretty good movie that will keep you entertained for an hour 45, and that's perfectly ok.",

            "content": "Combine Twin Peaks, Brian De Palma's Sisters and the latest disney channel star to fall off the production line with an incoming DUI and you have one of the most poorly received suspense thrillers of the 2000's. Us this is not (or it could be, i haven't seen it) as Lindsay Lohan stars in I Know who Killed Me.The film's rather basic story revolves around a student's twin who was abducted and tortured by a sadistic serial killer. She manages to make it out alive but after she regains consciousness in the hospital she insists that her identity is that of another woman.The music score by Joel McNeely is as Hollywood as they come and it ranges from ill fitting orchestral melodies to just plain unlistenable clanging on a piano as if the player's hands were made of potatoes. Parts of this soundtrack are genuinely some of the worst that I have ever heard in an internationally released film.Director Chris Sivertson splooged his VHS collection all over the screen and blinded us all so that we can't make head nor tail of what's going on half the time. There are other reasons why this film is both equal parts predictable yet incomprehensible and we'll get to those, but for now it must be said that the director's visual platitudes make the eyes grow weary with their pointlessness and them serving as reminders that there are several films out there much better than this doing more or less the same in both story and presentation.Apart from Lohan's desperate attempts at credibility, torture porn being shoehorned into this chaste old school thriller is the most 2008 thing about this film. Whilst these scenes are effective, they serve no purpose and just date the film in the most hilarious and original way.Coming now to the unsung arsonist of the staggering dumpster fire that is this film is first (and last time apparently) screenwriter Jeff Hammond. The dialogue is wall smashing levels of on the nose and beyond belief is the film's overall concept, most likely due to the complete absence of likeable characters to distract us from it's high concept spastication.Lindsay Lohan is terrible in this, clearly relying on the bratty charm that worked for her in the Disney period of her career, but it is woefully out of place here in this edgy as balls 'erotic' thriller.Speaking of which, there was a no nudity clause in her contract, yet there is a lengthy sex scene as well as extended pole dancing scenes with her? The skilfulness of an actress should never be defined by her cup size, but why even have these scenes even when their purpose it to be erotic? Nudity also definitely would have gone a long way towards helping Lohan shake off the Disney dandruff. Sadly, it's all perfectly understandable. Lohan was going through a really bad time in her life when this film was being made with TMZ shadowing her every move and encouraging her ever increasing self-destructive behaviour. It was a disgraceful scene that showed a side of the film industry everyone would have liked to forget existed. Until Twitter happened that is and made paparazzi scum out of you all. Nude scenes probably would have just fanned the flames regarding Lohan's situation in the late 2000's.I'll conclude by saying that I Know Who Killed Me is total amateur hour despite having a lot of veteran Hollywood talent working on it. Lohan is hopelessly immature, the direction is insipid and the screenplay is a mess. Some scenes are effective, but only by pure luck alone. Overall the film is just aimless tedium.",

            "content": "It's easy to see how I Know Who Killed Me has garnered so many unfavourable reviews, since it doesn't follow the standard rules of your typical Hollywood horror, and stars Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity has been steadily waning since her much reported 'drunken episodes'. But to label the film as crap is doing it an injustice: had it been made in Italy, it probably would've gone down a storm with fans of Euro-horror.With its preposterous plot laden with totally bonkers moments, a crazy killer who is revealed only in the film's closing moments, and over-stylised direction with a strong use of colour, I Know Who Killed Me shares a lot in common with Italian horror, and, in particular, the 'giallo' genre of movies: horror/thrillers that are often weak on story, but loaded with great visuals.Considering I was expecting this Lindsay Lohan vehicle to be a tame, teen-friendly Hollywood horror, I was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity (but then I love Argento films, which rarely make sense).In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, a pretty teen who becomes the latest victim of a serial killer who has been abducting girls and cutting off their limbs before leaving them to die. Eventually, the girl is discovered, mutilated, but still alive, and is taken to hospital. But when she is interviewed by the FBI, she claims that her name is Dakota, and she has no recollection of her attacker...Things go a little crazy from this moment onwards, and those who prefer their horror to be completely believable need not bother to watch any further\u0097any film that features a stigmatic twin who falls apart for no apparent reason isn't going to impress your 'average' cinema-goer. I, however, was in the mood for some silliness and found the film pretty entertaining, despite being a tad overlong.By no means a modern horror classic, but not the complete waste of time that some claim it to be, I Know Who Killed Me is something a little different in a genre currently packed with predictable gore-fests, awful sequels and dodgy remakes. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",

This movie takes HUGE leaps of logic; I understand that there must be some suspension of disbelief, but it was too disjunctured.

This movie revolved around a chance to showcase Lindsay Lohan as a sex symbol without her nudity (much like The New Guy did with Eliza Dushku, but without the entertaining plot line). It was respectable writing to make Dakota Moss so bold, especially with the language, but it just wasn't enough.Realistically, with as inundated as the television/movie-viewing public is about forensic evidence, investigation, and biology (the worm-in-biology-class scene? Come on...), a movie has to at least seem intelligent.On a side note, I was desperately hoping that everything would be pulled nicely together by the guy on the bus being the boyfriend/brother of \"Fiona\", which would be the girl Dakota found in the glass coffin (Dressed to Kill was one of my favorite movies). Unfortunately, believing in \"stigmatic twins\" is the final leap over \"Lohan is crazy\", which might have turned into a decent ending.",

Her body is found several weeks later after she had been brutally tortured and cutup by her abductor. A few days later, Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) disappears after a college football game, and becomes his next victim. The FBI believe that they are looking for a sadistic serial killer who likes to viciously play with his victims before getting rid of them. The FBI hope they can find Aubrey before she is killed. About a week later, a critically injured girl is found by the roadside and taken to the hospital. Aubrey's parents Daniel (Neal McDonough) and Susan (Julia Ormond) are at her bedside when she awakens. The girl tells Aubrey's parents that she doesn't know Aubrey, and that she is a stripper named Dakota Moss. The doctors believe Aubrey is suffering from traumatic stress of the ordeal and she only needs a little time to recover her memory. Dakota begins to believe that she may be Aubrey's identical twin. The only problem with that is that she was an only child.(My Comment) I know who killed Lindsay Lohan's career. If this movie doesn't do it and of course her drinking, I don't know what will. The movie was supposed to be a suspenseful thriller, but for the most part, it moves at a slow pace. I think Lindsay wanted to make a movie where she could be a bad girl and break the good girl mold. The big problem with that is that Lindsay was not very good as a bad girl stripper in the movie. Maybe a teenage audience might not be as critical with her dancing and acting. The story had some twists and turns that should have made it a good movie, but for some reason, Lindsay's part did not connect with the audience. The one thing I could not watch was the scenes where the serial kill started cutting off body parts. The ending was just a little unbelievable. Didn't anyone have a cell phone to call the police?

The music was also great and very Angelo Badalamenti-ish.Some reviews categorized it as part of the Torture Porn sub-genre, but I disagree, I think the gore wasn't too gratuitous. Whenever there was gore it was effective, it wasn't overused to the point where the audience becomes apathetic to it.I especially liked the art direction, and overall I think it was very aesthetically pleasing. Some interesting surreal imagery. Yes, the color symbolism was overdone, but what can I do, all those lush blues and reds appealed to me.I also thought the script was clever in its \"plants\" & \"pay-offs\" and in terms of foreshadowing.

The director, Chris Sivertson, is the man behind the unreleased adaptation of Jack Ketchum's brilliant novel 'The Lost'. Though I have not seen but intend to see \"The Lost\", this makes me less anxious. This stupidity concerns a rich girl with a passion for writing (Lohan) who is kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer who wears blue gloves. When she is found alive beside a country road, Lohan's character reveals that she is not the person who was kidnapped -- oh, no, she is, in fact, that person's sleazy, lap-dancing twin sister(!) If you just heaved a big groan, you're not alone. To prove to the disbelievers that she is not who she appears to be, the Sleazy, Badgirl Lohan has noisy sex with Writer, Goodgirl Lohan's doubting boyfriend, giving him the kind of good time the Goodgirl didn't. The plot gets more and more ludicrous from this point until it loses itself, literally, in a graveyard where massive silliness is revealed. As usual, there is some torture and a leering, mumbling killer, but the horror is in short supply compared to the boredom. John Leonetti's photography is unimpressive, with a clich\u00e9d emphasis on the color blue, and Sivertson's direction is about original as Paris Hilton's pout. Lohan is not terrible or brilliant. Like her looks, her performance is ultra-ordinary. Will \"I Know Who Killed Me\" kill Lohan's career? I don't think so. It will be a cinematic blip for year end Worst Film lists. After a rotten string of so-called horror films, I totally despair for the state of contemporary horror films. The old American masters are turning out dreck (see the 'Masters of Horror' cable abortions) and the Asians continue to churn out rotten clones of films that were never any good in the first place. It's a sorry state of affairs. Originality and vision have been totally compromised in an effort to kowtow to to the dollar. Ultimately, this will result in financial disaster, not a windfall. Originality takes balls. Since balls are in very short supply, we get crap like this. What would happen if Lawyers and Accountants ran Hollywood? You're witnessing it.",

Well seeing that it is actually a very decent movie, one would assume it is solely down to the lead, namely Ms. Lohan. Sit down, watch the movie and cast aside anything you may know about LL's personal life. The story is intriguing, the direction is superb; very atmospheric, and the performances within are sound. IKWKM is well worth a watch for these reasons alone. The story-line moves along at a steady pace and can seem rather confusing but perseverance will pay off. Like a lot of films of this genre the ending falls short from being truly satisfying and loses touch with reality. A little exposition would not have gone amiss. That said, there is adequate closure so the viewer should not feel cheated.",

Basically Aubrey Fleming (twice Razzie winning and nominated Lindsay Lohan) is a regular high school girl who disappears one night, we see her violently tortured, having an arm and leg severed, and she is found unconscious in the woods. When she wakes she has forgotten her identity, thinking she is a Dakota Moss, a stripper she created for an English assignment, so she is denying her supposed identity. \"Dakota\" is now trying to unravel the mystery of her identity, how she and Aubrey co-exist, and the person/people who abducted her. In the end, after finding out she is in fact a twin, she finds her other self buried alive. Okay, I'll be honest, I confused after about half an hour, so I can't be accurate about the full plot. Also starring Razzie nominated Julia Ormond as Susan Fleming, Neal McDonough as Daniel Fleming, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Agent Julie Bascome, Spencer Garrett as Agent Phil Lazarus, Gregory Itzin as Dr. Greg Jameson and Eddie Steeples as Saeed the Prosthetic Tech. The only reason I have given it an extra star out of ten is because of the quite inventive gore scenes, other than that it confused the hell out of me, and Lohan may be have a hot body, but she and the film as a whole are terrible. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Chris Sivertson, Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie, Worst Remake or Rip-Off (ripping off Hostel and Saw), Worst Screen Couple for Lohan as the twins, Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture of the Decade.

But after reading all the bad reviews (who I quote) say it's \"The worst movie they've ever seen\" It kind of puts you off. I decided to just go with my instincts and buy the movie. I mean, I'm already a massive Lindsay Lohan fan so I figured If the movie sucked, at least there are some great pole dancing scenes.I've just finished watching the movie, and I must say I'm glad I went ahead and purchased. I think the people who called this movie \"Boring, pathetic, confusing\" didn't understand it. They didn't get the story. I also have to say, to the people who said the film was extremely predictable, are you joking? It's not at all. The movie has you guessing right to the end. You will be asking yourself all different kinds of questions. Isn't that what a great movie is about?? I think the reason this movie was panned was because \"Lindsay Lohan\". At the time of it's release, Lindsay was in the media constantly for partying, doing drugs, getting DUI's etc, so when the movie finally hit the screens, most of the public categorised the movie with her personal life - this is unfair. Lindsay is a great actress and carries the movie amazingly. She showed her fans she can make the stretch from cute girl in \"Mean Girls\" to sexy, pole dancing, tortured girl in a thriller. She done a great job. People on here calling her performance \"laughable\" are obviously haters.Take a chance on this movie, like I did.SPOILER.Audrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) has a twin sister named Dakota Moss (Lindsay Lohan) that was separated at birth. Susan Flemings real baby died at birth and a junkie woman down the hall had twins, so behind Mrs. Flemings back Daniel Fleming pays the junkie to keep one of the twins. The real Aubrey was kidnapped by a serial killer (who turns out to be her piano instructor Douglas) and while he's torturing her, in another town Dakota is having the same exact things happen to her unexplainably (turns out to be they're stigmatic twins). So Dakota comes to her town to find out what is going on and is found severely injured on the side of the road so they believe its Aubrey. Dakota spends the whole movie trying to prove that she isn't Aubrey. She eventually finds out what is going on and Mr. Fleming helps her get to the killer. Douglas kills Mr. Fleming then Dakota kills Douglas and in the nick of time finds Aubrey who was buried underground and digs her out from a shallow grave.",

            "review_title": "pretentious twister of a horror-thriller, it won't kill Lohan's career, but it's a definite blotch",
            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me, written and directed by two first-timers respectively (the director has done a couple of ultra low-budget horror efforts, seen only in festivals), is the end result of the two of them (and the producers more or less) watching much too much of the series Twin Peaks and the film Fire Walk With Me without really understanding the symbolism exactly. It's a mystery of a mystery, and it involves stigmatic twins, owls, severed limbs, and severed finger, and a killer who may have escaped from the Blue Man Group and was forced into appearing in this film. Lindsay Lohan, attempting to dig deeper than ever with her acting talents (and for all of her debauchery and self-destruction off-camera she does in fact have a little talent, seen most prominently in Prarie Home Companion), portrays Aubrey/Dakota as a woman/women torn by fragmented memories and a life that's as pulpy as a rotten orange. To go into the plot too much might not exactly be spoiling but merely too disengaging: Aubrey, the girl who's the 'normal' one, goes to school, is smart, has the cute boyfriend, disappears one night, is gone for three weeks and is discovered on the side of the road missing a leg and a hand. In the hospital she also says she is not Aubrey but Dakota, a stripper who's mother was a crack-head and has no social security number.The twists that perpetuate go on until the very end, which soon becomes less confusing and just plain stupid. The condition that Aubrey/Dakota has is explained thanks to an Ask.com entry with a weird man explaining it behind a space-like background. Meanwhile, the director goes to town in illuminating the harsh and would-be surreal psychological states with the color blue. It's a motif that not only falls flat on itself, but becomes part of the unintentional humor abundant in the film. The action veers towards Evil Dead parody, with one shot reminiscent of the classic line \"Groovy\", and there's even one sequence that looks ripped right off of the dream scene in Vertigo, right down to the music. Like The Number 23, the filmmakers attempt at subject matter meaning to be provocative and dramatically tense all the way, but the concepts don't fly by because of a lack of solid skills; with the millions of dollars at the disposal of the crew, why should there be scenes where shots are out of focus and without any significant stylistic effect. How do we care about someone being tortured if it veers into looking like a short film shot by an over-ambitious teenager with a camcorder and a penchant for Tony Scott? As for Lohan, who goes into her role as if it's both The Parent Trap ten years after and a revisionist take on Laura Palmer, it's not exactly a horrible performance in corresponding with not exactly a failure of a film. The problem is that any skills that she puts into the scenes are faltered on the material, and on her lack of experience thus far in tackling more complex subject matter and a character who- had it been under a possibly more competent filmmaker- could be demanding of an emotional upheaval. The scenes where she strips (and a stripper who, as did Jessica Alba in Sin City and Natalie Portman in Closer, is more of a go-go dancer as opposed to a classic striptease artist) are muddled and sluggish, if looking objectively, and it just adds to the exploitive aura of the whole picture. In fact, it probably serves best, particularly if one is going into it looking for unintentional humor (if you're a Twin Peaks fan as well it's likely to pop up every other scene at least), as a low-end exploitation flick that doesn't serve much purpose on anyone who worked on it in the future. Maybe they'll go on to better things, but for now it's sub-par.",

            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me was ignored by audiences when released into American cinemas (hence it went straight-to-DVD in the UK), dumped on from a great height by critics, and was nominated for nine Golden Raspberry Awards. But personally I liked it. It's set in a small American town, where two girls have vanished. After several months the body of one girl is found, the autopsy revealing that she died recently, having been kept alive and tortured (her right hand and lower leg have been amputated) the whole time she was missing. Then virginal high school student and talented writer Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) is also abducted, throwing the town into panic, especially as the FBI and local sheriff's department have no leads. However, after two weeks Aubrey is found unconscious in a roadside ditch, her right hand and lower leg so badly damaged that the surgeons are unable to save them. But her parents' relief that at least she's still alive is short-lived, because when she regains consciousness she doesn't recognise them, claims she has no recollection of what happened to her, and doesn't understand why everybody keeps calling her Aubrey. Instead Aubrey insists she's actually 'Dakota Moss' - drifter, stripper and sometimes prostitute, orphaned several months earlier when her crack addict single parent mother OD'ed. Aubrey's doctors and the FBI believe that she's been so traumatised by what happened to her that her mind has created \u0096 and then retreated into \u0096 an alternative personality. And this theory is seemingly confirmed when the FBI discover on Aubrey's home computer lengthy stories that she's written about a girl called Dakota Moss. But when Aubrey \u0096 still insisting that she's Dakota \u0096 leaves hospital, agrees to stay with Aubrey's parents, and starts trying to piece together what happened to her, the truth is revealed to be even stranger.A mixture of slasher film, psychological thriller, supernatural mystery, and dark drama, I Know Who Killed Me is a truly intriguing movie \u0096 so good that it even survives wandering briefly into torture porn territory. At the time it was released, Lohan had gone down the Tara Reid route of becoming better known for falling out of her dresses at showbiz bashes or sprawling drunk outside nightclubs than for her acting, but she gives an intelligent and cleverly observed performance as the hard-bitten, sexually assertive and foul mouthed Dakota. Clearly taking such an edgy, adult role in an attempt to broaden her profile beyond her tween fanbase, it's therefore ironic that Lohan's dance routines in a sleazy stripclub (seen in flashback) are decidedly unerotic (but maybe that's the point \u0096 that true sensuality isn't to be found in such establishments). It's also somewhat predictable that despite wanting to escape her cosy Disneyified image, Lohan ultimately plays it safe and joins the ranks of Sin City's Jessica Alba and Planet Terror's Rose McGowan in portraying that rare creature that only exists in the movies \u0096 the stripper who doesn't take her clothes off.None of this alters the fact that Dakota is a surprising and welcome combination of amateur sleuth, Final Girl, and action heroine, especially during the climax, when she finds her newly acquired battery-operated mechanical hand is very useful for crushing assailant's wrists and shattering glass doors.",

One the one hand, it's a mystery flick about a serial killer terrorising a small town by kidnapping young women, torturing them, and then killing them. That's all very well, but then there are bizarre supernatural interludes involving psychic and supernatural links between twins who display stigmata-like wounds when the other's injured. Finally, there's a whole host of unpleasant terror/torture sequences thrown in that aim for the HOSTEL and SAW crowd, depicting graphic hand injury and mutilation that's guaranteed to turn the stomach. In the end, I KNOW WHO KILLED ME doesn't work very well at all.The main problem is the plot. Lindsay Lohan stars as the youthful victim with a huge case of mistaken identity. When she's abducted and later found, albeit missing an arm and a leg, is she really who she claims to be \u2013 a stranger? There are a few ways you could interpret this film but unfortunately the frustrating, changed-at-the-last-minute ending muddies the waters still further. I was convinced that Lohan was playing a single character who retreated into her own head during torture, creating a new identity for herself in order to get away from the terror and pain of the present. Had the film followed that route, I would have liked it a lot more, but in the end this mess doesn't know what it wants to be.Lohan is the kind of celebrity I could do without: all you hear in the news is about how she gets arrested, causes trouble on set, etc. I blame the media. I really don't care about actor's lives off-screen; Christian Bale can rant all he wants but it doesn't impinge in the slightest on my enjoyment of a movie. This was the first time I'd seen her acting, and all I could think of was Stacey Slater in the British soap EASTENDERS. She's the spitting image. She's not particularly bad, just not particularly good either, and I could tell she needed more direction and character motivation to keep her going, but she just doesn't get it here.Two actors who've shown fine performances in past films, Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough, are cast as Lohan's parents here, but they're given absolutely nothing to work with and it's a wonder that they bothered turning up on set \u2013 a clear case of doing it for the pay cheque. Meanwhile, the snippets of extreme torture are more degrading than disturbing, more senseless than effective, in effect sapping this film's entertainment value away. Throw in an excruciatingly awful sex scene and some quite awful and unerotic pole dancing (Lohan should have followed Rose McGowan's example in PLANET TERROR) and you have a film that's pretty much a failure all round.",

I'm sure there will be a huge critical backlash against it, which is too bad, because it is the sort of movie that is very rare these days. I Know Who Killed me is a cult/camp classic in the making, and will hopefully be recognized as such. I saw this movie last night in San Francisco. Everyone in the audience seemed to be having a good time, but when we were leaving the theater I overheard lots of people saying things like \"I was laughing the whole time. It was so bad!\" Honestly, I'm pretty baffled as to what these people expect when they go see a movie like this and have that reaction. From all the publicity I saw for this movie, I can't see how anyone could justify thinking that it was going to be some sort of high art psychological thriller in the vein of the Shining, or Vertigo. I was sort of afraid that it would be another one of those mediocre thrillers that take themselves too seriously (Murder By Numbers, Premonition), but instead I was delighted. The movie has a real sense of humor about itself and does not disappoint when it comes to absurd twists and turns and moments of glorious camp. Fans of Grindhouse,Evil Dead, and of Rob Zombie's movies will probably be won over by this movie. Miss Lohan should be proud of herself for her work in this. Despite her recent legal troubles, her role in this film gives me hope that she could have a fruitful career ahead of her if she plays her cards right. The first part of the movie, in which Miss Lohan plays over achiever Aubrey Fleming, is probably the weakest section. It has some entertaining parts (like the strip tease from the creepy gardener character), but overall, it is hard to think of Lindsay Lohan as a straight A student from small town America. However, the movie, as well as Miss Lohan's performance takes a strong turn for the best when she transforms into Dakota Moss, the sassy stripper with a troubled past. Even though the days of Mean Girls have long past, we are reminded that Miss Lohan has great comedic timing, and a strong screen presence. The character of Dakota has a very appealing bluntness, and Miss Lohan is perfect at portraying this. She and Rose McGowan are certainly in close competition for the title of Cult Cinema's Queen, but unlike Ms McGowan Ms Lohan is truly a talented actress. I hope to see her in more movies like this. Although I don't want to spoil the ending, I will say that the final scenes, after we know who the killer is, are downright hilarious. Also, this movie has one of the best final shots I've seen in a long time. If you're a fan of camp, ridiculous gore, general absurdity, and sick of generic Hollywood thrillers with no sense of humor, then I know Who Killed me will be a real treat for you.",

I went into the theater with absolutely no idea what it would be about and with no preconceived notions. I left the theater feeling confused and thankful that I hadn't actually paid to see it.This film takes every thriller movie clich\u00e9 in the book and slathers it on ad nauseam. I'm not opposed to a good clich\u00e9 thriller movie, but at some point it becomes comical. The plot was extremely contrived and had enough holes to fill the Royal Albert Hall. Perhaps the scenes explaining the plot ended up on the cutting room floor in favor of some of the more grotesque and gratuitous gore scenes (of which there were plenty). The film's twist, one so ludicrous even the most die-hard Lohan films will giggle, is pulled directly from left field after a seemingly magical epiphany by the film's main character. The filmmakers thrown in a plethora of minor characters with undeveloped and unresolved story lines in an attempt to \"throw off\" the audience. Nevertheless, not ten minutes into the film, I, along with the others I was with, had successfully predicted the antagonist.The final thirty minutes of the film was a non-stop laugh riot. The packed theater of varying demographics was rolling in the aisles as clich\u00e9 after hackneyed clich\u00e9 flew off the screen in rapid succession to hilarious results. I joked to the person beside me that I hadn't laughed as hard since the first time I saw \"Borat\".Stylistically, the movie is a film school student's wet dream rife of \"artsy\" shots and recurring motifs. Unfortunately, for the audience, this does little to redeem from the film's most blaring flaw: it's entire premise.It's difficult to fairly critique the film's actors given what they had to work with. I can say that Lohan's performance seemed rather bland and stale throughout, as though in the back of her mind she knew the movie was trite and looked at it more as a paycheck than a serious mark on her resume.Aside from the occasional, \"I almost died laughing when....\", I heard scarcely a good comment in the lobby after the film.

One other thing which caught my fancy was the fact that the narrative involved twins \u2013 since, as some of you might know, I am one myself; several movies have been made over the years on the subject, usually psychological thrillers \u2013 this follows in that trend but, at least, provides a new angle with its Stigmata association (though I didn\u2019t buy it myself).I\u2019d only ever seen teen idol Lindsay Lohan in Robert Altman\u2019s melancholy and elegiac swan-song A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION (2006) where, surprisingly, she managed to hold her own in some mighty fine company. On the other hand, Lohan doesn\u2019t quite cut it here as a dramatic actress \u2013 but, if anything, provides reasonable titillation with her steamy stripper act and one sex scene! The film tries to be hip by playing on the unsavory element which, lamentably, seems to have overtaken the horror genre of late and which has been tastlessly dubbed as \u201ctorture porn\u201d. Thus, it presents several totally pointless but unflinching instances of violence \u2013 morbidly lingering on the gory details in what can only be described as a perversion of what constitutes mass entertainment! As I said, it never convinces for a second \u2013 with the revelation as to the villain\u2019s identity being particularly blah; nor does it arouse much sympathy for her heroine(s), or anyone else involved: the police are typically annoying, while Julia Ormand\u2019s role as the mother of the two Lohans is rather superficial. In the end, the overall consensus about the film seems to be that of being a misguided attempt at a mature breakthrough for its talented but troubled star.",

There are horror film elements in the movie -- a hidden serial killer with a fetish for glass knives and amputations; a spectacular climax straight out of a Dario Argento movie -- but this is basically NOT a horror film, and that may confuse and/or disappoint a number of viewers who expect one from the title and advertising which bring to mind something like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER etc. Lohan, in a nifty dual role, gives a very credible performance throughout, and I encourage anyone who sees the film to put pre-conceptions aside and try to look at the movie, and her work in it, with fresh eyes. This is also a very female-centered story, one that hinges on the interior world of its young protagonist -- that in itself makes the movie a unique piece of work. The real discovery here, though, is director Chris Sivertson who more than delivers on the promise of his earlier film, the incredibly disturbing drama THE LOST (see it when it comes out later this year.) I KNOW WHO KILLED ME is much more of a mainstream, commercial movie than THE LOST, but that's not a bad thing -- this is a genre film, pure and simple, and within the rules of that terrain, Sivertson & Co. deliver a strange and hypnotic little mystery that confounds expectations at every turn. Highly recommended for both the movie and for Sivertson's work as director.",

But you are suppose to see the life of Dakota as story-like because you don't really know what is going on until toward the end of the movie. The plot, however, is solid enough to carry you entertainingly to that point when everything become clearer. It is a thriller and I must say it is executed with textbook formulaic perfection.One of the better films I saw in 2008, which is not saying much . . . especially when you consider that I sat through \"I Am Legend\". :(I am giving this film a 10 out of 10, simply because someone needs to balance out all of the falsely low ratings. If I thought everyone was voting thoughtfully, I would give this film a 4 or maybe even a 5. But I see several users have given this film a rating of 1 and, take it from someone who is a very skilled appreciator of film, even if you did not like this film, it at least deserves a 3.

Yes it did have some over the top gory scenes, but isn't that a good thing for adult fans of the genre, i mean how come SAW became so popular and recommended, if you don't like gore then don't watch it, but don't give bad reviews of the film because you are too weak to stomach these scenes, i totally enjoyed it !!! Acting was very good from most of the cast, as i mentioned before this is my first Linsday Lohan's movie i saw and i thought she did a good job. In summary, i thought that this movie was very enjoyable and one of the good movies of this summer, keeps you guessing till the end and has a good plot, so if you haven't seen this, my advice is to go ahead and watch it, it is totally worth it, i really don't get why too many people hate it, it succeeded as a thriller movie, what more do u want !!?? this was more enjoyable to me than : Captivity, Pirates of the Caribbean 3,Evan almighty and I pronounce you Chuck and Larry. so please guys stop the whining and just go watch another PG 13 Disney movie and leave the R rated adult movies for the grown ups !!!! 9 out of 10",

Aubrey Fleming (Lohan) get kidnapped, tortured and mutilated before ending up in the hospital where she tells the FBI that she isn't Aubrey but instead Dakota Moss. The FBI and Aubrey's parents think that she's under some sort of shock but Dakota insists that Aubrey is still alive and being held captive by the serial killer. There's no question this is an extremely bad movie but at the same time this film gets my highest recommendation because you really have to see this film to believe anything about it. I'm sure that this thing is going to go down as a cult classic because the dumbness in this film can't be topped by any other film that I can think of. The plot is all over the place and there are countless questions the FBI could ask to solve the case but they never ask the questions. Why don't they? Because the film would be over. I won't give anything away but the plot twists in this film are so incredibly stupid that you have to wonder why no one objected before filming began. I'm not sure what they were expecting to pull off but they did succeed in creating one of the dumbest mysteries in the history of film and with that in mind the film works. If you really want to see something totally original due to its dumbness then this is the film for you. As for Lohan, this is the first film I've seen with her in it and I've heard from critics that the girl has talent. I should see more before commenting on that but her performance here ranges from very bad to fair depending on the scene. When she's playing the bad girl she comes off pretty fair but her good girl act at the start of the film is pretty poor as are some of the speeches she gives throughout the film. Lohan can also be happy that she's also in the worst sex scene I've ever witnessed in a movie. The scene has Dakota and the \"other girl's\" boyfriend doing it while her mother is downstairs listening. The way this thing is edited together just makes it downright stupid but to be far it's not as stupid as the mystery wrapped around it. Again, this is a very bad movie but the badness is so original that I can't help but recommend the movie.",

Here's the spoiler: The piano teacher did it, a fact which becomes apparent about 10 minutes after he walks out of camera shot. I cannot actually believe that Lohan read this script and thought this would be a good career move for her. Bonus: we get to see her smoke, drink, curse, pole dance and have simulated sexual intercourse (it's rated R). In short, this film is an insult to the movie-going public, and I hope the studio has to eat all costs associated with it.

            "content": "After seeing I Know Who Killed Me yesterday, surrounded by a New York/East Village crowd, I am getting pretty annoyed by the sadly anticipated reviews claiming to whoever might want to hear it that this movie is as much of a joke as Lindsay Lohan's latest \"career\" moves.Being familiar with miss Lohan's personal struggles much more than I am with her movies, I bought my ticket with a somewhat open-mind, even though after seeing the trailer (maybe the only bad element of the movie), I admit that I was basically expecting a teenage slasher movie. Obviously, so did the critics but they won't have the decency to review the movie for what it actually turned out to be.From the little promotion we got, we basically were told that this would be Lohan's first \"adult\" role as a leading lady. I guess the people waiting for a 20yo to play an \"adult\" are indeed going to be disappointed, but let's leave those thinking about the absurdity of their expectations. Lindsay Lohan actually offers \"adults\" viewers a respectable leading performance. Because here what the movie is: a campy, slightly trashy, cult comedy for young adults familiar with the cheap horror flicks from the 80's and critical of the American values of suburban loss.I read about how terrible the movie is because some genius knew who the killer was from the start. I read that the chills are laughable... Reviewers, guess what. You're not cleverer than the writers and director. However you might be one more prototype that movie studios rely on to produce pleasing blockbuster hits.I know Who Killed Me could be classified in the same category as movies like Grindhouse or TV's Twin Peaks. It has a permanent subtle humor about itself and what it depicts. Bored teenagers, immature parents, unqualified teachers and overpowered police... here is the bunch of characters you will get to know. The casting was well directed and miss Lohan does suck you in the movie with her well known attitude and an unsuspected self-cynical humor. She's a teen actress playing a stripper, she knows it sounds bad and it makes the movie good.The ending might be open to interpretation, like most interesting endings always are (Mulholland Drive, Basic Instinct, etc.) but who killed the poor girls won't matter much by the end of this movie. The psychological journey of Lohan's character is the central piece of the movie, and the foundations to it are its own comical elements.Of course, I referred to Lynch, Tarantino and Verhoeven (who interestingly enough suffered the same kind treatment after the camp classic Showgirls) but I would not go as far as saying that I Know Who Killed me has the same rare genius that will make it last through the years, but it absolutely delivered the cynical fun that comes out from somewhere in between utter stupidity and sharp wit.My little East Village crowd surprisingly was open-minded enough to clap the movie throughout the end credits. Of course I pleasantly joined the applause. I pretty much anticipate the movie to join the lot of \"love them or hate them\" flicks, so, just like the movie did, I will not take myself too seriously and just claim that: \"I looooved it!\"",

            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me aims high but ends up a spectacular misfire. The concept is not a bad one, much (but not all!) of the movie is carefully shot with a great deal of attention given to colour, contrast, and photographic effects, and Lindsay Lohan, given a role which demands that she shows her range, delivers a decent performance.Sadly, this is not enough to rescue a film which falls down on a couple of practicalities and, above all, a story which... words fail me. Suffice it to say that I didn't spot the twist. I don't see how any sane person could have.Here's the story, believe it or not - I still don't, and I watched it last night! It starts off with a moodily lit pole dancing sequence. One assumes that the dancer is Lohan, but it's difficult to tell because a) the lighting results in very high contrast and b) Lohan's characteristic freckled redhead appearance is hidden below black hair and makeup. However, it must be Lohan because at no time does she take off her bra or enormous knickers, an interesting approach to poledancing. Then we switch to two things going on at the same time - the police investigating a murder and Lohan's cheerful life - she is a student who is good at writing and piano (which she wants to give up) and a happy home life with Mom and Dad. Can this be the same girl we have just watched poledancing? Surely not! Anyway, Lohan gets captured by the same bloke who kidnapped the dead girl: we learn that he put her through days and days of incremental amputations, and we see him doing the same thing to Lohan. Finally someone finds Lohan by the roadside, mutilated (half an arm and half a leg are missing) but alive. In hospital, however, she reveals that she is Dakota, a poledancer, not missing Aubrey. Is she delusional following her ordeal? Or is something more sinister at work? It turns out - you'll love this (well, maybe not) - that Aubrey and Dakota are twins, separated at birth (Aubrey's Dad bought a twin from their junkie mother when his own child died at birth!). What's more, they are both blessed with that little-known phenomenon, sympathetic filial stigmatism ie. when lunatic serial mutilator (who turns out to be Aubrey's piano teacher!) cuts off Aubrey's fingers, Dakota's fingers fall off in sympathy. So Aubrey is buried by the killer (who is himself killed by Dakota) and Dakota digs Aubrey up. The end.The film takes some glee in the unpleasantries it visits on Lohan, which is not a particularly attractive element. But the overwhelming impression left at the end is simply how utterly, utterly misconceived the story is.I have absolutely no objection to watching Lohan prancing around in her skimpies, but the poledancing sequence extends way beyond making its point and, importantly, does so without advancing the story (such as it is) one iota. As if to reinforce this, the DVD actually carries an extended dancing sequence. I thought I was going to reach pension age before it finished.As a final smidgen of mitigation, there is an alternative ending on the DVD which is an immense improvement on the one in the movie and, had they left it in, my negative view would have been considerably less negative. However, it is an ambiguous ending and, as is well-known, audiences can't cope with those.",

            "content": "but I thought it was a very interesting story.SHORT REVIEW: Gruesome, gratuitously sexual, interesting story, well acted.MY BIASES: I rarely watch horror movies. I never, ever watch gruesome horror movies like \"Saw\" and its ilk. I was really in the mood for a horror movie and LL in a more adult role. UPSHOT: I might be marking a little easy. Maybe. Or maybe not.I felt that the story, characters, and actors were all plenty good enough to entertain me for 2 hours. I suspect that the critics and other people who are dumping on this movie are somewhat reactionary against the fact that it definitely has some gratuitous violence and gratuitous sexuality.I will not spoil any more than the trailers do. Briefly, the story begins with an artistic girl named Aubrey Fleming. A girl at her school goes missing and her dead body turns up with some amputation. Everyone fears a serial killer, particularly when Aubrey disappears. I girl is brought in to the hospital who looks exactly like Aubrey. Everyone thinks she's Aubrey, but when she wakes up, she claims to be a stripper named Dakota Moss. Here we have a problem. This girl is either Aubrey or Dakota. If she's Aubrey, then why is her delusion that she is Dakota so convincing? If she's Aubrey, then is there really a Dakota? If the girl in the hospital is Dakota, then where the hell is Aubrey, and why do these 2 women look identical? It's a fun set-up and I felt that the end result was satisfying and revealed effectively.There were at least 3 scenes that were so gruesome and horrifying that I couldn't watch. I did the old \"cover most of the screen with your hand\" trick.In playing a character who has a drug problem and has an identity issue, I couldn't help wondering if LL was trying to exorcise some demons with this movie. Or possibly she was rebelling against her career which has composed of playing many good girls in movies with more general appeal. I have to admit that some of her fans will see this movie just to see her and will really wish they hadn't seen it. If you're expecting \"Mean Girls\" or \"Herbie Fully Loaded\", you will need some therapy to recover from this one.I should mention that while there is no Lindsay Lohan nudity per se, there are some extremely raunchy scenes involving close shots of various body parts of Dakota's while she is wearing next to nothing and writhing around a stripper dance pole. Just in the interests of full disclosure.In a side-note about cinematography, this movie is very blue, in the literal, colour sense. It's fun to watch just how hog-wild they went with all the blue. I started watching for blue objects and there were many: bright blue lights, clothing, ribbons, glass, eyes, gloves, etc. Not to mention that every shot seems to have a blue tint.So consider yourself fairly warned and enjoy the twists and turns of this movie, if you choose to give it a shot.",

            "content": "My title is a line said by (Dwight Schultz) as the nutty pilot (\"Howling Mad\" Murdock) in one of (The A-Team)'s episodes, which I didn't find anything more suitable than it to describe this movie with!Save few exceptions, Hollywood is owned by the producers. And I think we were raised by them. Yes, believe it or not, we are in a way. Therefore we grew accustomed to some known formulas, and even points of views, in the American movies. Nonetheless, there isn't, and won't be, a story with one side.This movie is a story with another side. It has what - I bet - many producers would dislike and refuse, or at best, repair and polish; like seeing a lead with one hand and one leg. But, away from that, it could have been something revolutionary, reviving, and greater. Or even achieves \"The Formula\" in its own special way. However, (I Know Who Killed Me) isn't any of that at all. While it is a try to make kind of different horror and thriller, the outcome was bad. And not even watchable bad!This plot was impossible, and despite its silliness the movie couldn't, unlike other silly movies, make it plausible. We have 2 riddles (Who's the criminal?, and Who's the lead?) and by the third act, there is a third one already (Where are the criminal and the lead's sister?), but the No writing turned all of that into a bunkum of a conundrum.The drama was one blank circle after another. There were even scenes that sounded vague for vagueness, or just lost along the way. Let alone at least a dozen of provocatively unanswered questions: What were the motives of the criminal?? (So it's natural that the performance of the character's actor looked laughably ugly). Why he kept his victim / (Aubrey) alive that long? Why he let the second victim / (Dakota) alive?? And the wildest of them all is the one-in-a-milliard coincidence about twin sisters who lived in the same city, didn't run into each other during 20 years, and get together again only by a serial deforming killer??!! Surprisingly, the movie got a meaning about searching, rather battling, for your other half - whatever your points of shortage are - to be complete. Though maybe that itself was made without its half, the good half!Many many matters have been exaggerated to dumb extent. I mean look at the gruesome severed members, the free gore, the blue everything.. OH MY GOD. Whoever made this movie was awfully obsessed of butchering meats, throwing flowers and ONE COLOR! Needless to say that the sense of adolescence is totally tangible. So the artistic points didn't manage to affect deeply with a story that seemed hard to follow and eventually unbelievable. Instead, they thickened the atmosphere to be harder and more incomprehensible. As you see, it was a maze that you walk through, blinded by heavy mix of torn-off limbs and thrown petals, to hit at last a frank load of nonsense. So what an annoying waste of time that was!It gives you the feeling that they found a striking title, then wrote a movie around it. And it happened to be so ambitious one too, but has been treated by the most ambiguous ways. So I can't blame (Lindsay Lohan)'s performance. In fact, I'm blaming her choice!Something in me says that (Lohan) picked out that one to declare, once and for all, that she's not a child anymore, rebelling extremely against her image as Disney's so pure child and Disney movies themselves, by being a stripper in a disgusting horror, who says the F word a lot, smokes, and has loud sex in front of her parents, gets mangled, mangles back, and kills. Sorrowfully, it turned out to be that she didn't pick a winner (unless we're talking about 8 \"Razzie\" awards!).Moreover, a great actress named (Julia Ormond). The presence of her gave me distressful feel. Just her talent, and long absence too, represented a cruel irony with the movie that she selected to return with. Although she didn't win, but nominating her for that role as the Worst Supporting Actress of 2007 sure hurt the hearts that she captured through her short, yet unforgettable, career in the 1990s.Nobody could ever know the secret of success before making a movie. Only the secret of a movie if it succeeded or not. And I think that this movie's makers did their best. But that best created a long, very loathsome, nightmare. Empty and cheap as a horror. And idiot as a thriller. It wanted to achieve something far than it can, to end up as random as a hallucination of a guy on nasty narcotic!Thus, what's good in here would be so easy question: it's (Joel McNeely)'s music, dame (Julia Ormond), and that's it! Well, not enough reasons to re-watch the movie. But I know that I won't watch it again at any rate. Not even if I turned into Mad and went Howling!",

            "content": "\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is a vile little horror outing that was designed as some sort of \"comeback\" vehicle for Lindsay Lohan back in early 2007. Needless to say, the movie did not succeed in that endeavor. Anything but.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive, but relatively naive high school student who falls prey to a torture-crazed serial killer who manages to slice off a few of her limbs before she miraculously escapes his clutches. When she wakes up in the hospital, she believes herself to be a girl named Dakota Moss, some kind of fictional \"alter ego\" with a life straight out of a soft-porn novel - which provides us with ample opportunity to ogle the scantily-clad Lohan as she writhes around in slow-motion performing pole-dances at a sleazy strip joint. Is Aubrey, who is herself a writer of fiction, simply a victim of repression, a wild and free spirit so obsessed with being a \"good little girl\" that she's allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious all these years? And is the trauma she's undergone simply the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore? Or is there another, less purely psychological explanation - let's say, symbiotic twins? - for this sudden shift in identity? It doesn't really matter what the answers to those questions are, for this depressing foray into sadism, dismemberment and supernatural hocus pocus is poorly written, amateurishly acted and completely lacking in either thrills or common sense. Actually, the story itself might have had some validity had it not forced the audience to wallow in as much gratuitous unpleasantness as it does. But, as it is, whenever we begin to develop even the meagerest interest in what is happening, we're subjected to yet another round of stomach-churning bloodletting. Yuck.",

The movie has several ridiculously long scenes of Lindsay Lohan twirling around a pole like the seasoned professional she is, and an unconvincing sex scene, (both sans nudity) But I suppose if you have the imagination of a half-wit, you could probably spend a fair amount of \"alone-time\" with yourself in the movie theater. Which would at least give this film ONE purpose. This is a pathetic attempt at an art film, and what is perhaps even more pathetic than the film's overall effect, is that Lindsay Lohan actually thought she'd win an Oscar for this film. The dialogue is insultingly bad. And what I mean by \"insultingly bad\" is that you, as an audience member, should feel offended that filmmakers and screenwriters (like the ones who poured 4 months of their lives into this movie), actually think you are too stupid to understand anything, without being expressly told what to think and feel; or that an art film, by definition should have nothing open to interpretation. The movie looked like it was shot with my home video camera, the characters are one dimensional, and the acting is laughable. I Know Who Killed Me, seemed to be perfectly content, resting its alleged DEPTH upon the standard Independent Film standby elements: Trippy & confusing film sequences, violence, sex, and apparently; a new addition: AMPUTEES!! Save your brain cells for a night of drinking, which will be invariably more entertaining than this piece of garbage.",

Lohan did a decent job but wasn't anything special like some of her huge supporters think she was. The script was terrible and same to the writing. In fact, it was so bad that it may of been intentional.There were a few things that I did like in the film. It was advertised as a horror but turned out to be a psychological mystery instead. I actually like the cinematography of the film and same to the score. There were some cool shots as most other people would disagree. I just didn't really get it and after reading the message boards, there seems to be many possibilities on how the movie was suppose to end. No matter what, pieces don't fit for all the possibilities. Also, I noticed people were mentioning the large amounts of blood and gore in the film. I disagree. If you compare this movie with Saw III, Saw IV, Captivity, and Hostel, the gore was not nearly as ridiculous as those I mentioned.All in all, you might want to skip this movie. It so badly done that it is amazing it even got its wide release and not direct to video. I can't give it a one because I still found decent qualities in the movie. My Verdict (3/10 or a D).",

But when I say this \"thriller\" truly makes no sense, I mean it with the deepest shade of blue. But more on the blue symbolism later. Sivertson's psychological execution had me guessing for hours...just how much Lohan paid the director to do a strip tease. Seriously it's enough to turn any straight man gay. \"Oh, she's suggestively moving that cigarette...ohhh yes, it brushed passed her entrance. Delicious!\". So, a young student is abducted and tortured by a serial killer. She makes it out alive but insists her identity is of another woman, a stripper named Dakota Moss. The story juggles between two theories. She's either delusional and her heightened state of fear caused her to create another identity, or she actually has a twin sister. I shan't spoil it for you, but the end result is predictably underwhelming regardless so you aren't missing out. Amidst the terrible acting, horrific screenplay and mediocre special effects, is a mysterious plot that has more holes than Lohan's cocaine abused nostrils. We are led to believe that the mystical phenomenon of stigmatic twins could be a potential answer to this mystery? To a point where entire limbs are severed in seconds!? Wait! We are led to believe that Aubrey writes an entire fictional novel about Dakota without any prior knowledge of her existence!? Hold up! Her prosthetic leg has the flexibility and manoeuvrability of a real leg!? Hang on! Dakota finds a blue ribbon and just happens to know \"I Know Who Killed Me\" and doesn't call the police!? Blue ribbon, blue roses, blue glass coffin, blue scene transitions, blue filters, blue bedroom, blue gloves. Why. Is. Everything. Blue? This isn't 'Suspiria' or some Lynch masterpiece where it's clever enough to uphold symbolic colours. This is Lohan stripping for men with a severed finger, where her mother actively listens to her having sex. If that sounds like the film for you, enjoy! To everyone else, avoid.",

The folks who made I Know Who Killed Me are apparently from the Bizarro Planet because they started with one bad idea and after that implosion of idiocy, they seem to have put no further effort into this script at all. They came up with a harebrained twist and wrote backwards from that, spitting any stupid thing that came to mind down on the page. The result is a film so incompetent and unpleasant that it probably would have killed Lindsey Lohan's career, if she hadn't done such a spectacular job of that herself.Aubrey (Lindsey Lohan) is a seemingly perfect young high schooler. She's a musical prodigy, a talented writer, the prettiest girl in class and dating the school football star. When she goes missing, it's feared that she's been grabbed by the same maniac who recently kidnapped, mutilated and killed another young girl. Then Aubrey is found by the side of the road, alive but butchered in the exact same way as the first girl. When she wakes up, however, she calmly announces that she isn't the all-American Aubrey. She claims to be Dakota, a stripper and daughter of a meth addict. The cops and her parents think Aubrey is suffering from some sort of delusion, but it's actually the boneheaded twist I mentioned earlier. I'm not going to give it away because you genuinely won't see the twist coming and the only possible entertainment value to watching this movie is the dumbfounded laughter provoked when the secret is revealed. When it's first referenced you'll dismiss it as a red herring, thinking no screenwriter could possibly be THAT clueless. Unfortunately for everyone involved, he was.The rest of the story involves Dakota/Aubrey meandering around in a lethargic pursuit of the real answers behind her situation while other characters aimlessly pass through the story until we finally get the big showdown with the maniac killer, which may be one of the most poorly written confrontations in cinematic history. It makes the climaxes from every single Friday the 13th movie look like Shakespeare, even the one where Jason ends up in the future and turns into a cyborg.Julia Ormond plays Aubrey's mother and has a couple of decent scenes where she tries to deal with the horrible thing that has happened to her daughter. She has nothing to do in the film before those scenes and after them the movie totally forgets her character exists. And aside from Ormond's 4 or 5 minutes of nice acting, there is not a single other second of this story that has any redeeming value whatsoever.Getting food poisoning and puking into your bathroom sink for a few hours is more enjoyable than watching I Know Who Killed Me. Clipping your toenails is more exciting. Having a conversation with the mold growing on the old cheese in your refrigerator is more stimulating. Walking in on your grandma while she's changing clothes is more enticing. This is an almost transcendentally awful movie.Lindsey Lohan had to have been either drunk or stoned when she agreed to do this film. Her agent had to have been drunk or stoned. In fact, her mother, sister, father and everyone around Lindsey Lohan had to have been drunk or stoned to let her do this film. The director and the producers had to have been drunk or stoned not to fire Lohan after the first week of shooting. Her acting consists of reading her dialog like she was still in Herbie: Fully Loaded, just with the F-word thrown in every so often. And in the scenes where she's playing a stripper, not only does Lohan remain clothed, not only does she pathetically writhe around on stage like she's taken too much Prozac, but she also just looks weird. Lohan is a redhead who spends too much time in the Sun, so her body is freckled. Her face, however, is perfectly clear. I don't have a problem with freckles. As someone said, a woman without freckles is like a night without stars. But the contrast between the alabaster skin of Lohan's face and the rest of her speckled form is freakish.I could go on and on about how I Know Who Killed Me disregards even the most basic points of logic and realism or its cringe inducing tone deafness or the blinkered nature of these filmmakers, who don't have the slightest inkling that they're not any good. I'll spare you (and myself) from all of that. Suffice it to say that it's really, really, really, really, really bad. Stay far away from this movie. Stay farther away from anyone who tells you it's good.",

It automatically offends before viewing 80% of female critics, most anyone who specifically claims delicate refinement (most gay critics whose artistic clich\u00e9 sets the stereotype for critics), and any religious/family values critics (who in the PC age make up most the other critics).

You have \"the so-bad they're funny\" bad movies (which are entertaining), and you have the \"bad, just bad\" films (which are unfunny and boring). Unfortunately, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" falls into the latter category.Sometimes, you know right from the first scenes that a movie is going to suck. That was the case for \"Basic Instinct 2\" (which incidentally won the Razzie of Worst Movie in 2006). Right from the opening, with Sharon Stone driving the sports car straight into the river, you knew that what would follow would be dreadful. The same thing happens here. In the first ten minutes, I was struck by how all the actors were so awkward and unable to portray anything correctly. The actors playing the cops took the cake: I've hardly ever seen cop characters played so badly and unconvincingly.And then, the plot starts, so to speak. At first, the premise seems just as interesting as any: pampered girl gets kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer, then mysteriously reappears but claims she's a different person. Sounds intriguing enough, the sort of stuff David Lynch could use. But everything falls apart in no time. The whole thing turns out to be yet another story based on paranormal tripe, and a very boring one at that. The writer has no idea about what makes a good story, character or situation; his script is ridden with clich\u00e9s, plot holes, and cop-outs. Random example: as if the whole \"stigmatic twins\" stuff was not far-fetched enough, near the end of the movie, Dakota suddenly has an epiphany (convenient, isn't it?) that gives her all the information she needs to find the killer. Sure, why bother with rational stuff, just make the character have an epiphany and the job is done! Everything in that script is just botched and lazy.The whole thing is certainly not helped by the weak cast and the clumsy direction of Chris Sivertson whose great idea here is to add unsubtle references to the colour blue all the time while giving a \"clipesque\" look to the extended torture scenes.Now, about Lindsay Lohan. She's the only person who shows some involvement. She's no Scarlet Johansson, or Kirsten Dunst, but at least she tries. The problem is that her acting skills are too limited to handle the good girl/bad girl thing on screen. And the material she's given, whether it's the script or direction, is way too poor for her to salvage anything. The stripping scenes (in which she doesn't even remove her bra, let's applaud the writer again for realism) are totally ugly and un-sexy. The sex scene where she goes at it with her sister's boyfriend seems to come right from the next American Pie movie. Everything is like this but it's not entirely Lohan's fault. She looks competent in some scenes. And she's the only reason why you'd want to sit through this bore until the killer's identity is revealed and the movie ends (at last).That pretty much sums it up. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is clearly straight-to-DVD material that only got released in theatres because Lohan was in it. But again, despite being awfully boring and flawed, it's not the sheer atrocity some claim it is. You'll see much much worse than this (Jaws The Revenge, anyone?). \"I Know Who Killed me\" is just a boring, not-bad-enough-to-be-funny film among thousands of its siblings.",

A guy walks into frame with a blue rose, and the actress says: \"Where did you get that blue rose?\" I can see what it is, no need to tell me. The same guy asks the FBI guys for a condom, and they laugh - then he walks up to more FBI guys and the whole process is repeated.But it does settle down, especially when the lead actress goes hard chaw, and by 76 mins we've got a well paced, intriguing mystery.Sadly the final act crashes down the stairs like a barrel of bricks.At that stage I think they panicked. The plot is so preposterous that they had to use on-the-nose dialogue to tell us what the clues meant. So about twenty minutes before they show us the killer we already know who it is. Plus there's some daft symbolic stuff that turns out to be some ESP between characters. And I howled with laughter at the killer's final gesture.Don't think they could have saved this. Obviously big problems with the plot and screenplay, reinforced by the complete disappearance of the elaborate FBI set up and the total absence of motivation for the killings. The directing didn't help either.I liked the actress a lot - smokey voice and ability to switch from ice to warmth. She did the pole dance stuff erotically, but white girls still can't dance.",

Come on guys! You want to do a strip club scene...please make it LOOK REMOTELY like a strip club. Maybe it was supposed to seem surreal, but this scene looked so contrived it just immediately destroyed any sense of engagement with the story.Then we have the scene at the piano --- **MAJOR SPOILER** -- Did anyone not immediately flag the piano teacher? I was waiting for him to start compulsively cutting himself and drooling, the guy was such a freak.Now this twin thing...how many times has this been done? Take away all these flaws and you still have a movie with incredibly flat performances. They are completely out of sync with the level of \"horror\" being communicated. Criticize the Hostel movies all you want...the actors in those movies actually seem traumatized by their experiences...as you would very well be in the same situation. Lohan, by contrast, seems about as put out by her severed limbs as if she had just endured a bad botox session. And yes, Julia Ormond in particular flashes from looking very bored and confused to line readings that are so forced and leaden she appears to be performing a parody of the Isabella Rosellini role from Blue Velvet.That people actually found this movie engaging speaks once again to the systematic lowering of standards inflicted from...I guess...too much bad TV. This movie would be a stinker in any medium though...it doesn't wear it's insincerity like a camp badge of honor. It's just insincere.",

            "review_title": "Unbalanced and unable to deliver on a number of would-be promises, I Know Who Killed Me is a wavy and inconsistent piece that does not thrill, inform nor engage.",
            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me is a film without an audience. It's too talky too often and doesn't have enough bloody violence for the gore hounds; there isn't enough sex or nudity for those out looking for a big, dumb erotic thriller; its plot is too muddled and not delivered with enough punch to satisfy those wanting a 'whodunit' whilst those looking for a filmgoing experience in which all the basics will hopefully come together and deliver something coherent with which we can engage, will come away befuddled and frustrated at both the sporadic and very wavy content and tone.In short, the film is a disaster. A lost, wandering mess - desperately trying to deliver on several fronts but failing to do so on all of them. The film is a mediation of the serial killer sub-genre, incorporating elements of the psychological thriller; the erotic thriller; the video nasty and the comedy genre, but never really being particularly funny, interesting exciting nor engaging. There has to be some sort of rule within cinema when it comes to films that try to incorporate scenes of paraplegic; ex-strip-o-gram, serial-killer victims whom make love to young males as their mother listens below with a wry smile on her face, there just has to be. If there is, I Know Who Killed Me ploughs straight through it with such disdain and, I garner, a grin on its face ten times the size of that of the aforementioned mother.It is Lindsay Lohan whom is dumped with the extraordinary task of bringing to life a certain Aubrey Fleming, or perhaps Dakota Moss, or maybe neither, or maybe both \u2013 a young and fresh faced girl that enjoys spending hours at her laptop, bashing out words and musings on things; lessons with a certain Douglas Norquist (Tofel) on playing the piano as well as..........dancing bra-and-stockings clad at a local strip joint as bikers and truckers of the hairy and leery variety watch on. Such a paragraph captures the overall feel of the film; an inconsistent and wavy tone which will gleefully chop from obligatory and deathly familiar scenes of suited forensics experts saying and doing the norm, to a close up of someone's ring finger being sliced off by a shard of glass, to a sex scene complete with some pretty out of sorts music.From the instant the film begins with its crane shot that hovers over a poster of a missing girl before providing us with a scream and a murder to establish what's happened quickly followed by a press conference full of cops and press members; you feel uneased, you feel as if something just didn't click right there; like something was done but not done right. You notice something, you notice how un-sleek and uneven that three scene process really was. The film thinks it has the right to be able to deliver clich\u00e9s, obligatory scenes and other scenes of great monotony before pulling a fast one right out of the blue in the form of a twist.The awkwardness as to whether the film feels competent dissipates somewhat when Lohan's character, whatever her name was and whoever she really is, wakes up in a hospital; at which point the whole exercise just becomes plain stupid. Lohan's character(s) actually take(s) everything rather well upon opening her eyes; she's cynical, she's also lost an arm but she's cynical none-the-less, while the manner in which we're meant to believe this girl has 'changed' somehow, and is now more independent and strong willed, is to have her deliver a few f-bombs in a cringe-inducing manner.I can remember; many, many years ago, observing M. Night Shyamalan talking about the use of the colour red in The Sixth Sense and how red clothing, red balloons and other such props used at certain times were a visual signal for impending danger for the characters. I think the writer of I Know Who Killed Me, Jeff Hammond, saw the same tidbit because his script is littered with contrasting red and blues; take for example the spotlights in the strip club Lohan dances; the police siren bulbs at the crime scenes; the many instances in which close ups of red blood will be shortly followed by blue roses are all drummed into us \u2013 the be all and end all of it is that, yes, we get it: there's duality going on here; there's a sense of \"red and blue are different shades and you can easily tell them apart, but, y'know, at the end of the day, man, they're still, like, y'know, colours and that's what they share, man.\" Yes, we get it \u2013 Lohan thinks she's two different people; she looks into it, she's confused; we're confused; we're a bit fed up; she's a bit fed-up; she's missing an arm but she's willing to put that behind her when she has sex with someone; we're watching; we're even more confused; we get to see an online streaming video explaining duality and stigmata, but the only thing we can pay attention to is the little dial at the bottom as we check to see if it'll get as far to the right as possible in time with the video actually concluding.According to IMDb, director Chris Sivertson seems to have a history in being involved with the horror genre \u2013 I Know Who Killed Me is a step up from out-and-out schlock but it's so muddled; and so fabricated; and so mis-guided; and so mind-blowingly-dull for most of the time that the step up is only a very, very slight one. Where the film should be taut, it's hopping all over the place; where it should be somewhat frightening, it's just gross; where it should be intriguing, it just cannot shed that made for TV feel.

There is an overall brooding and confused tone. Aubrey is not set up well and I don't care about her. There is a long middle with questionable dream sequences or confused reality. By the end, I don't care what is real and what is imagined. The movie is one long series of Lohan trying to shed her bubbly childstar image. She gets tortured but it's done weakly.

And indeed it is. The problem is the way it develops its concept. The script is totally overloaded with plot holes and paradoxes. Many people have criticized the overuse of cliche's but... well, horror film industry has literally lived with it since some years ago. For me, the problem isn't that, but the way these cliche's are framed and articulated. They just don't fit. The characters are also bad, don't have a proper development nor any personality. The central character, having two personalities, ends up not having anyone. The film is not clear about the existence of a twin sister, although its suggested. It tries to bet on bloody graphics but fails, and cinematography, sets and clothes opposes the blue and red colors (as the colors-symbol of the two different personalities of the main character), but that gives to the film a far-fetched and almost sickening visual, worthy of a B movie from the seventies. The soundtrack is bad and Lindsay Lohan gives again profs to be a bad actress and a stripper and pole dancer absolutely mediocre.",

            "content": "Lindsay Lohan has had a tumultuous time in Hollywood. She was a fresh faced young actress that charmed us all in \"The Parent Trap\" and people looked forward to what she would do next. She played the daughter in the remake of \"Freaky Friday\" and wasn't bad in the role. And she was good enough in \"Mean Girls\". But then something happened and like a lot of young stars that have too much money and a lot of stress she took to self medicating with drugs and alcohol. She became a bit of a liability on set. Not showing up for her scenes and often times when she was there she was strung out on something and eventually the offers stopped coming in. And to this period of her life we get 2007's \"I Know Who Killed Me\". A movie so bad it garnered 8 Razzies including \"worst picture\" and \"worst actress\".Ms. Lohan plays two characters in this. One the straight A student and the other a drugged out stripper. Guess which role is more believable? I'll give you a moment to think about it. All I really need to say is this is one movie where art imitates life.Well surprise surprise they're twins. Twins in which once was given up for adoption and yet they, just now, share a psychic link of sorts. It's never come up before but now when the plot demands it they're suddenly sympatico. But this comes up near the end and only when they're trying to find the \"killer\" as in \"I Know Who Killed Me\". The clue is in the title.Good Lindsay Lohan one day disappears and they find her two weeks later in a field, with amnesia. But along with this she's like a whole new person. Almost as if it's her long lost twin sister that has suddenly showed up for no reason. I know. It's groundbreaking cinema here. Somebody who was lost shows up later but not remembering who they are and are totally different than the person they once were? That's never been done before in the history of all cinema.Color plays a huge role in this. The \"good\" version of the character is all about the color blue. From her car to her clothes, everything around her is blue. And the \"bad\" one is all about the color red. And just like with the \"good\" scenes often time this color is emphasized so it's the only color seen on screen or it's shot seemingly through a filter with that color. You think this is maybe going somewhere but it really doesn't until the very end when now the color is purple. You got that right. Once everything is resolved and the two twins have finally met and are in each other's lives, the main color is purple representing their unity. I think. I mean that's the only thing I can really get out of this.In the end you're left with a tepid and surprisingly boring mess. There's no tension. The \"killer\" is obvious from the start. And whatever acting talent Ms. Lohan has, it's long gone. This should only be watched for laughs and even then if there's literally nothing else to see.",

            "content": "This movie was bad. Just bad. It wasn't scary or interesting or even unintentionally funny in the slightest. The acting was so wooden and unbelievable it was like a high school production. The lines were some of the corniest I have ever heard this side of \"Stay Alive\". The plot made absolutely no sense. I really didn't care who Dakota or the serial killer were or where the Aubrey had gone. This is Screen writing 101: You need to care about the characters! I guess the writer of this movie missed that class.So much of it was just disgusting, too. Some scenes were so graphic I actually had to turn my head away. For example, where Dakota sews on a bloody and gangrenous finger with a needle and thread, or where the \"killer\" or whatever puts Aubrey's hands between dry ice and when he pulls them apart her rotting hand is pulled in half. Other repulsive scenes were the ones where Lindsay Lohan was pole dancing at a strip club. It's like the writer couldn't decide which avenue he wanted to take the movie down, gory violent thriller, or a drama/suspense movie, and in the end compromised with a boring, lifeless story with lots of blood and gore.And what was with all the blue items everywhere? Did the director think he was being \"artsy\"? The blue computer, the blue curtains, the blue roses, even the knife the killer used was blue! It was not like \"The Sixth Sense\" with the color red, where it was subtle and if you weren't looking for it you wouldn't notice. Every item was blue, and the whole film looked tinted blue like the director was using a blue filter. That was one of the only things consistent throughout this movie. It was as if the director needed to make certain you couldn't forget which movie you were watching, just in case you nod off for a few minutes or something.Another irritating thing were the police officers. Honestly, I don't know if the writer/director of this film figured that no one would have the slightest idea of how real cops work, or if they just didn't want to put in the research to find out for themselves, but every scene with the cops was so unbelievable, and the actors portrayed them too like they'd never seen one before. Maybe it was the lines that were poorly written, but they had no emotion! Turn on Law & Order or CSI once and a while and see how cops really talk and what terms they really use. And then they just suddenly inexplicably disappeared for the rest of the movie, like so many other plot holes. Did they solve the case? Did they lose interest? Or was the writer just too lazy or disinterested to fix that particular plot hole? There are so many nonsensical parts to this movie it's just embarrassing.Towards the end of the movie the \"plot\" starts unraveling and the ending itself makes absolutely no sense, and you really don't care to make sense of it, you just want it over! I guess there's an alternate ending that might shed some more light on this, but I haven't seen it and all I have to go off of was the movie I saw in theaters. I wasn't able to figure out if Dakota was just made up or if she was real, and by the end all I cared about was leaving the theater.",

The fact that it starred a big name celebrity, had decent budget, and used Hollywood-quality production values are the only things separating this from piles of equally poor movies that go straight to the rental shelves.Well, as a fan of trashy movies, I found some entertainment value in this one. Lindsey Lohan is still a charismatic actress, even when saying ridiculous dialog. I feel a little bad for enjoying how unconvincingly she played this character, and I'm sorry she somehow was convinced to make such a bad choice. She definitely came off as trying to get taken seriously, and it failed. As of right now, her career still hasn't recovered, although I would put my money on her making a comeback at some point. In this movie, though, she just looks like a little girl pretending to be grown up, which might sadly be the truth behind the scenes.

I do know that she's a highly capable actress, she did some rather good work in another recent film she did in Georgia Rule. So, that didn't even become a deciding factor as to whether I would like this movie or not.The movie plods along at a very awkward pace and I don't really feel any connections to the main characters at all. The pacing is awful and the camera work is just as painful to endure as the acting.I will give props to some of the plot, as the identical twins aspect kind of threw me off guard. I can say with honesty that I didn't see that part coming. I was thinking along the lines that maybe she was portraying an alter ego and was the one that killed the other girl and probably even dismembered her own limbs. Another scenario in my own mind was that maybe since she loved to write, that the entire movie was just a story she was telling to her classmates.The twist in the end about who the would be murderer is was very disappointing.Do yourselves a favor and avoid this rubbish at all costs.

I trust that most of the people who choose to see this movie will be intelligent enough to form their own opinions, without being influenced by movie reviewers. If I allowed movie reviewers to sway my interest in seeing a movie, I'd miss a whole lot of great performances.\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is an exciting roller-coaster ride that combines the best of several genres: thriller; horror; crime and mystery. One fellow commenter on this site compared it to Twin Peaks. Those of us who love the works of David Lynch will see similarities in the use of color (blue in this case) and the \"film-noir\" feel of the production. I do not mean to say that the director was attempting to model his movie on the style of Lynch. The similarities are most probably unintentional.It is very unfortunate that Lindsey Lohan had a few bad incidences in her personal life almost immediately before the national release of this movie. There is no greater death knoll for a new movie than bad publicity so close to its opening day. Yet, I feel confident that the intelligent viewer will be able to put the \"bad press\" to the side and enjoy this movie for its many strengths.The movie was filmed with an side of gritty realism that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The scenes of torture and mutilation seemed worse to me, by far than those in the movies Saw, Hostile or Captivity. In those other recent movies, the torture seemed staged to the point of unbelievability. In \"I Know Who Killed Me\" it was never overdone, and therefore seemed more believable. I really felt victims' hysteria because the scenarios seemed plausible and therefore much more realistic to me.This is where I have to credit the cast for their very strong performances. I really was touched by the emotions generated by the parents of Lindsey's character and those of the first murdered girl. But, it was truly the amazingly powerful performance of Lindsey Lohan that drove this movie. She possessed her characterizations so completely, that I never felt the need to question the reality of what I was seeing. So, the bottom line is ... ignore the reviewers, keep an open mind, and you can't help but love this movie.P.S. Let's all try to be a little nicer to Miss Lohan. I know she's made a few poor decisions lately. But, the only difference between her and most young people is that her mistakes are broadcast simultaneously on MTV, CNN and the world-wide web. She has accomplished amazing things for her young years, with pressures that most of us could never imagine. I personally wish her only the best!",

I respect that attempts were made to bring visual interest and a sort of intellectualism to the generic torture-porn plot, but these attempts failed spectacularly.I read the reviews and I knew that it would be bad, but I was thinking that it might be bad in a funny way, sort of campy. Unfortunately, that was a bad assumption. I could only get through the first hour of the movie before deciding that my time would be better spent doing... just about anything else. Every attempt at symbolism is clunky, the dialogue is hackneyed, the pacing is jolting, and the plot is at once overly-complicated and lacking in essential details.The problem here, I think, is that everyone involved in this film seems to have really believed in it, they believed that they were creating a worthwhile product. The result of that attitude paired with a horrible script is pretentious film-making at its worst.I've got to say, though, that the most disturbing aspect of the film was not the super-gory torture scenes, but instead the idea behind having a sexed-up teenager writhing around in ambiguous moaning pain/pleasure while being tortured by an anonymous man. The seemingly unintended sub-textual implication that a young woman in pain is a sexy, alluring object was the only frightening thing about this horrible, horrible waste of money.",

After reading a few of the other reviews I must start by saying I agree with them, the acting appeared terrible. However, I feel that has less to do with the actors and more to do with the direction. If any of the great actors of our time were sent in a room to read a line without understanding context they too would look awful. The acting parts seemed rushed to make way for the ridiculous camera effects. I swear some of the actors were reading their lines for the first time and probably thought this was a rehearsal! They too probably though the words coming out of their mouths were ridiculous and expected them to be altered.As for those effects I mentioned, The Sixth Sense used red as a subtle clue throughout the movie, this movie used blue. There was nothing subtle about the blue however, and it served absolutely no purpose. There was also a number of other random shots than made no sense, and a soundtrack that was so terrible it ripped away any immersion and simply made me wince. I did feel like the director was trying to pull on aspects of M Night Shyamalan, but also a little Tim Burton in places, and maybe even Quentin Tarantino. It was simply a mess.The story was vaguely decent though. More and more often these days I find myself willing to give up on a movie before the end, but this had enough to keep me going.

Did the editing staff actually attend a school for their profession? This movie had more holes then swiss cheese. The very beginning starts out with Lindsay dancing on the pole. Was it just me or did she look a little high? She looked like the pole was the only thing holding her up. My friend (who went with me for this reason only) remarked, \"get right to the point, don't they?\" Probably the only time in the movie that they do. The first 1 1/2 drag on. The police/FBI are completely ignorant. They seem to have no idea why they are there or what they are doing. And can someone please tell me why, why does she sit there and tell the police that she doesn't know who did this to her, when she is fully aware that her arm and leg fell off themselves? Hmmm, I don't know about you. But if my arm and leg started falling off by themselves, I would get to a hospital real quick. The whole health insurance thing wouldn't really bother me. And then she goes into that whole thing about \"seeing\" the killer at the bus stop. Since the killer was holding Aubrey hostage this whole time, was she just hallucinating from those little pills she washed down with the bottle of booze? I also loved how she tried to sew her own finger back on too. Cause you don't need those pesky little veins or tendons. Just the skin. Also, when the police go through all the trouble of doing a DNA match, don't you think they would have found information in the system saying there really was a Dakota? Seeing as how she was actually born in a hospital. And then the whole scene where she \"magically\" figures out what happened on the internet. And why was Art Bell smoking a cigarette through that whole bit? Then the ending. Dakota NEVER met the piano teacher. How did she automatically know who it was? And why did the FBI never find this link with all the girls, but the one armed/one legged hooker does? So she and the father go to the house. With NO weapons, no police. They somehow know his address and go straight there. Once there, the father goes in. Dakota is hiding for approx. 2 mins, which gives the killer enough time to drain all the blood out of the fathers body and put him on a table in the same room Dakota is hiding in without making a sound. And then after she manages to untie herself and stab the killer, she also \"magically knows\" exactly where Aubrey is buried. I'm guessing Aubrey had been buried underground for about...oh...maybe 9 hours at this point. And of course she is still breathing. Which brings me to my last question...Neither of them died so why is it called \"I Know Who Killed Me?\" The final scene where they lie there in the dirt together is just amazing as well. I would think Aubrey would be in need of some medical attention at this point. All in all, this movie should have gone straight to DVD. At least I didn't pay for my ticket.",

The plot and premise itself could have been interesting if there was a rational script. The actors themselves performed well enough but nothing could save the movie, not even the pole dancing scene in the strip club. In fact (and I can hardly believe I would actually write this) the pole dancing was probably the most tasteful scene in the movie. (Yes, I am female and resent the way female sexuality is generally depicted in films---so now you know how awful the film really is!) Is it really necessary to show decomposing limbs in what is supposed to be a mystery? I watched the entire movie hoping, expecting it to improve as it progressed. Well, it didn't! I think the producers were trying to show how a crime victim mentally processes and remembers a horrific experience that no human should ever have to experience. Also, perhaps, how society perceives female sexuality. I do appreciate the attempt because it is so difficult to understand if you haven't had that experience yourself or experience the restrictions the culture still places on female sexuality--the virgin/whore good girl/bad girl mentality.

Of course that compliment does not extend to Jessica 'lonelygirl15' Lee Rose, who spent most of her five minutes of screen time staring open mouthed at things. (I need to point out that I was a fan of lg15 before she left and only watched the movie because she was in it.)

In a lame and obviously telegraphed \"plot twist,\" Ms. Lohan plays identical twins separated at birth. One is raised by a WASP-y upper middle class family, and she becomes a glasses-wearing virginal artistic prodigy. The other is raised by a crack whore and is a stripper at the age of 17.This gives Ms. Lohan the opportunity to fail miserably at playing two radically different characters. Many would expect Ms. Lohan to fail at being a frigid prodigy, but curiously enough, she also fails at being a sleazy stripper.Which brings up an obvious topic in the film: Ms. Lohan's strip club scenes. Yes, they do exist. Naturally, they beg a comparison to that other classic badfilm with strip club scenes, Showgirls. Elizabeth Berkeley had an \"enthused but hopelessly inept\" vibe to her scenes as she did an uncoordinated naked strut about the stage with the pole. Ms. Lohan, by comparison, just didn't care.First, the producers must have had just enough money to hire Lindsay Lohan to play a stripper, but not enough money to actually take off her kit and flash her boobies at the camera. So, while we get to know Elizabeth Berkeley way too up close and personal, Ms. Lohan keeps her outfit on. A complete lack of dedication.This total lack of dedication is made all the more obvious by the fact that all her strip club dance scenes are in slow motion! Peeking behind the curtain of ultra slow-motion and lots of colored filters (and, gentle reader, if you watch this film ever, you will be sick of colored filters), the \"sexy strip club\" scenes are nothing but Ms. Lohan walking around a pole and crawling on the ground, slowed down in a lame attempt to make it look more sensuous. Is Ms. Lohan the only actress who can \"mail it in\" in a strip club scene? While we are on the subject of \"mailing it in,\" let's talk about the scriptwriters. When not recycling clich\u00e9s from every slasher pic since Halloween, they are, you guessed it, blatantly ripping off David Lynch and Twin Peaks! Note the significance, and endlessly repeated theme, of blue roses (ripped off from Fire Walk With Me). Also note the incessant cutting away to Owls in all outdoor night scenes (if you don't know where that is from, get off your stupid computer and watch \"Twin Peaks\" now). My compatriot, in fact, was of the opinion that even if Ms. Lohan tried, she couldn't have risen above the lame script.No matter how bad Ms. Lohan's performance, it was eclipsed by the bad acting of the Jullia Ormund, who played her mother. Julia Ormond's descent into Hell is now complete. Either that, or she was just got lucky for a couple of years there in the 1990's.There were torture scenes. The genius of Joss Whedon is that, in \"Firefly,\" he made a torture scene funny. The anti-genius of this film is that it manages to make a torture scene boring. And the less said about the villain, the better. Jason and Freddy are characters of Shakespearean depth compared to this one. One would think that one could wring some sort of emotion out of seeing Ms. Lohan tortured, whether it is disgust or perhaps even Schadenfreude. No such luck here.On the bright side: it is a fairly short film. It lacks the six fake 'em out endings of Gigli. Still, a film for veteran badfilm watchers only. I give it 2 1/2 martinis that you will need to make it through.",

When people talk about the captivating creepiness of \"No Country for Old Men\" I can't but feel that this movie does that movie even better. The script and its delivery is reminiscent of another creepy mood piece \"Dark Water\" released in 2005. The color, the mood, the seamless use of strange and off-balance sequences and visuals fit perfectly with the nature of this movie. Unlike the chaotic, unnaturalness of the non-linear sequences found in \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" the director incorporated a cinematic technique that natural for this type of movie, it enhanced the craziness and the almost psychotic experiences going on. Unlike the flat performance of evil in \"No Country for Old Men\" that captivates, this movie instead captures an intensity of victimization, the harshness of a dramatized reality. Unfortunately, perhaps too many people focus on the disturbing scenes of female rebellious youth, sex, drugs, strong offensive language, female strippers and find abhorrent behavior, repulsive dislike while at the same time able to accept an anti-social psychotic killer. Lindsay Lohan presents a credible performance that isn't sleazy nor cheap. The two weaknesses, if there are any, would be a few off-key talking scenes with Lindsay's script that for some reason feels uncertainly stilted and some possible credibility issues with the plot (though one would have to watch this movie a number of times to be certain). Nevertheless there is a richness and disturbing resonance in her looking for her killer and perhaps even herself. The final scene is more telling than almost any movie this year just because of its relevance to Lindsay own life. My accolades to Lindsay for a great movie! Eight out of Ten Stars.",

Lindsay Lohan survives being tortured yet believes she is someone other than that of her original identity. This all plays out rather clever until the third act where fingers and limbs are shown severed in full detail. Director Chris Sivertson seems obsessed with the colour blue for reasons unknown. This becomes distracting and pointless. Lohan has given superb performances in other films, and this being her first attempt at a horror film should have been a different role to tackle. Unfortunately she comes off as if she doesn't care, and the role is somewhat confusing especially given her behaviour after her abduction where in her traumatic state she believes she is a stripper. Neal McDonough, Brian Geraghty, and particularly Julia Ormond are wasted in flat supporting roles. McDonough and Ormond are Lohan's clueless parents. The villain is a complete moron because his motive are overwhelmingly stupid. It all comes down to a climax of blood, gore and mayhem topped with the highest forms of idiocy.

She gives the most unconvincing, wooden performance I've seen this year, and in her career, and does nothing to make the best of a really dismal script.And lets be honest here: the script really is rotten, from beginning to end. The supposed \"real\" ending is even more moronic than the gruesome scenes including Dakota, which are unrealistic and laughable. LAUGHABLE is the perfect word to sum up this film; everything from the editing, the dialogue, the premise, and the acting from the overall cast (save Julia Ormond, who manages to take her scant lines and create a glimpse of character that could actually be worth caring about, if the rest of the film weren't so contrived).I cannot imagine a bigger waste of anyone's time when it comes to watching films. Its difficult for me to give such a strong negative reaction to any movie; as an avid film lover I quite frequently try to find the good in any \"bad\" or unsuccessful film. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" has no redeeming qualities at all. I think even teenage boys desperate for a peek at Miss Lohan's assets (read: her only real talents) will be disappointed to find her stripping and sex scenes simply more excuses to laugh and cringe, rather than anything else. Men and women alike with any taste or idea of what a solid film should like look with greatly dislike \"I Know Who Killed Me.\" Please, don't listen to the rabid Lohan fans who insist IKWKM is artistic or even watchable - its not even worth the few laughs you'll get from watching a film that's so bad, its funny.",

I mean when I was watching it I had to go put on every color I had besides blue, because I needed more colors! I even thought about going to Office Depot because I just the urge to paint my house every color I could. And this movie was inappropriate! But yeah this movie \"I Know Who Killed Me\", which I thought would be full of every color, was just too blue for me. Maybe in the next movie they'll have more colors!",

            "content": "Really, it could have. My personal opinion of Lohan aside, this movie - like others (Dead Silence for one) relied heavily on effects that at times, become quite distracting. Some of the shots in the film are beautiful, but the use of blue is really overdone, some of the special effects are lacking, and some of the weapons are just ridiculous (The big blue glass knife? Are you kidding me?). Whether you see symbolism in the use of colour depends on the viewers mindset - But even so, the use of blue is just overwhelming at times. This is probably the point - but it starts to distract from the plot. The acting is alright. For the most part, Lohan does a good job. The parents aren't very convincing, and at times the dialog becomes stale, and somewhat corny. However, the movie is easy enough to follow that people who don't like complex horror films can sit back, and enjoy the ride. If you do prefer a bit more mystery, you'll have this figured out about halfway through, and the end will seem to drag. The big plot twist at the end was original enough, however for me it seemed like a cop out. It works fine, it's just not quite as exciting as it could have been. Kind of left me thinking \"Oh... that's all?\"There's a small bit of nudity, a sex scene, and lots of dirty dancing. So if your decision rests on one of those things, now you know.Surprisingly, there are several gory scenes as well. I wouldn't recommend bringing small children to see this, though I doubt that will stop some people from bringing their kids along. It isn't scary, but the gore in some parts might be a bit much for younger audiences, or people who really can't deal with it. It's nothing like SAW or Hostel in the area of gore, but there were a couple scenes that made me flinch.In the end, the film really didn't bring anything new to the table. The storyline is simple, and easy to follow, some of the shots are nice, and the acting on a whole is mediocre at worst. So if you have nothing better to do, it's an alright film to waste an hour or so with. But don't go expecting an award winner - you'll be left disappointed.",

            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me is not the best movie of the summer by a LONNNNG shot. It's not a terrific piece of movie making and some of what critics and IMDb critics are saying is very true but for me it didn't change the fact that the film was half decently entertaining and where some people find it a bad thing that it tries to mix itself as a slasher horror, thriller, psychological drama, and mystery film I find that this is the exact thing that makes I Know Who Killed Me worthwhile. Automatically the film get a bad rap from it's star whose popularity right now is in the toilet but I can easily move past that if the role is right. I thought Georgia Rule was a good and solid film, and I think her performance and this film was decent enough to see. Again that's not to say it was perfect or amazing or anything even close, it definitely had it's shortcomings. Director Chris Sivertson is not even close to being experienced. His range of experience is mostly campy and straight to video which doesn't help the image of this film which sometimes comes across as downright campy. Also as many reviewers are putting it, his direction style blows away artistic and moves into the 'heavy handed' category where he tries to pull off artsy and mysterious but it's overwhelming and annoying (the blue and red, ying yang effect he has going on throughout the film), and also the close ups of the characters extremities (fingers, toes, feet, hands, eyes etc.) It is unusual but overdone and blatant. I don't seem to see the overwhelming plot holes that everyone else seems to rant about, I mean if you look hard enough every film has plot holes, and for the couple of reviewers who said 'they knew who the killer was from the minute they walked on the screen,' well I guess they just must be super intelligent because there is nothing blatant that would provide you with that information.Let's talk cast starting with the infamous, much talked about Lindsay Lohan. She's not a bad actress, she has had some good, fun roles over the years and she's had a tough time as an adult but her performance in this film was not bad at all. She didn't have much of a dual performance to play (in a very creepy throwback to her first role in Parent Trap) because her 'good girl' side didn't last long before being taken. Most of the time she is the much more twisted and demented Dakota Moss and she does a fine job in the role. She really carries the film because no one else really has near the screen time that she does. There is a small and significant supporting cast including decent performances by Neal McDonough, Julia Ormond, Brian Geraghty (particularly strong in his small role as the boyfriend), Spencer Garrett, Garcelle Beauvais, Gregory Itzin and Thomas Tofel. They all share about the same amount of small screen time but they all play their role efficiently.I think perhaps with a more mature and more experienced director that really would have helped the film but nonetheless it is far from the absolute mess that everyone is flailing about. In fact I predict that someday I Know Who Killed Me will be a cult classic, a blue movie (no pun intended) that people may respect. It's not perfect as I've stated. I'm annoyed to pieces that the film is called 'I Know Who Killed Me' and that Lohan's character uses that line because it doesn't make any sense?? No one is dead, and she doesn't know who killed her because she isn't her and she isn't dead. It makes more sense after you see it what I am saying. The film title is poor. As several reviewers have stated I'm no pervert that wishes to Lohan butt naked but because of the sexual nature of this role, and the gratuitous content of violence and sex the role could have been better performed had she done the nude scenes. It would have made more of an impact. The violence in the film is disturbing and gory and really makes an impact. It's of the same nature of any great horror flick (which this film doesn't appear to be on the surface) but there is some damn terrifying and horrifying scenes. Despite it's heavy handed supposedly subtle artsy direction, it's occasionally campy acting and Lohan's personal problems...I Know Who Killed Me is a perfectly entertaining film and definitely not the worst of what's out there right now. This was far more entertaining than previous #1 films Chuck and Larry, and Fantastic Four 2 so ignore the critics and see for yourself. 7/10",

            "content": "Some films have a colour scheme, some films uses colour to make an artistic or symbolic point. I know who killed me is one such movie that at some point might have gotten that memo but something got lost between that memo and the set designers as every...single shot of this movie has blue in it somewhere. I am not joking- honestly as from the very moment this train wreck starts blue is in the shot and it never leaves. The colour is thrown seemingly randomly at anything and everything, there is no symbolism to this blue mess as the only discipline is chaos. I can only see Director Chris Sivertson saying the following \"Paint everything blue! Do entire rooms in the stuff! Everything must be blue!! Blue roses, blue lights, blue rooms, blue clothes? Throw them in! I don't care if it does not make symbolic or artistic cohesion just throw it all in!\" This makes the film look as if it does not trust the viewer to be smart enough to think past the pretty pictures nor does evoke the style of Dario Argento or David Fincher that it wants to copy. Instead it makes the film somewhat ugly to look. It overwhelms the viewer to the point that it irritates them as well as distracting them from the rubbish that is happening on screen.Speaking of rubbish, what is the plot of this movie? Well, Aubrey Fleming (played by Lindsay Lohan) is a fantastic student who is great at writing, she is loved by everyone as well as her boyfriend who she does not want to have sex with (this is going to change later in the film in the worst scene of the movie). Then one night she gets kidnapped by some serial killer (We never get a nickname or why he does kill teenage girls.) She is kept there for a few months until being discovered by a driver in a ditch however when at the hospital she claims that she is not Aubrey Fleming but Dakota Moss, a stripper who looks just like Aubrey in every way expect her personality which is more foul mouthed, sex crazed and all around nastiness that Aubrey is not. Now it is up for the police and Aubrey/Dakota to decide if Dakota is really Aubrey and find the killer.At first this seems like a needlessly gory rip-off of Silence of the Lambs and Seven but it quickly descends into an awe inspiring, incoherent mess that meddles with twins sharing injuries and seemingly supernatural serial killer stalking that does not work in the slightest way. I found myself going between laughing at the robotic acting and shouting a very loud \"What\" whenever something stupid happened on screen. The killer has no motive to speak of and just kidnaps Aubrey from a crowded street with no witnesses what so ever. Even after the killer is revealed it does not make any sense as we had only one scene with culprit beforehand until the end. The film ends very sudden leaving such questions as 'what happens to the other person, what will the parents say after getting back their daughter? Where did the police vanish to in the final act? Why were the police even there to begin with if they did nothing to further the story?' At the centre of all this is Lindsay Lohan. One must not forget that this was the first movie where she is an adult and it shows, the very first scene is LL as a pole dancing stripper whose moments are so sluggish and obviously choreographed that they are about as sexy as a half-melted chocolate bunny rabbit. She is so desperate to prove that she is an adult that there points in the movie where she gawks at shirtless hunky boys which screams \"I like boys do you get it?! I like boys.\" She has sex with Aubrey's boyfriend while Aubrey's mother in downstairs listening in the most cringe worthy scene in the movie. She swears like an angry sailor because she wants to be seen as a grown-up. She wants to prove to us that she is a woman and no longer a good child actress, now she is a mediocre adult actress that killed her career thanks to this movie.I now who killed me is a bad, bad, bad film that thinks its smarter then it thinks it is. It is a graveyard for LL's promising career and is one of the most stupid movies I have seen.",

Lohan plays Aubrey, a high school teen who gets kidnapped by a serial killer. We see her tortured in very grotesque ways. A woman finds a mutilated young girl by the road who is still alive. The girl is identified as Aubrey; however, she insists her name is Dakota and does not know her parents or friends. Dakota's personality is not like Aubrey's. She says she is a stripper and her mother died from drugs. The Flemming's take Dakota home with them; hoping to get their daughter back. Dakota insists her limbs just started falling off. The twist at the end is more than far fetched. The explanation for how fingers and legs could just fall off was more than silly.As many have said, Lohon is pretty bad in this. And her stripper scenes make her look used and cheap. This in not the script to pick for someone trying to move their movie career along.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is so bad that it might actually be one of those films people watch to get a chuckle and play a drinking game.

A week later, she turns up in a ditch and believes she is a completely different girl with a completely different history. Can she track the killer? Is she this other girl or just delusional? Can this plot make any sense at all? Well, I can answer the last question: no, it won't make any sense. There are many parts where the plot seems just fine, but the more questions are answered, the less sense the entire script makes. I did watch it a second time, and although I felt the first half would be complete nonsense knowing how it all ends up, it actually does help. Even after about ten or fifteen minutes, you'll start to get the impression this film is wasting your time. Trust that instinct!I can try to say nice things. The creators obviously wanted to make this an art piece... the constant theme of blue objects standing out (blue glass, blue roses) was a good idea... but they just tried too hard and it went from what should have been subtle artistry to \"hey, look what we're doing!\" in-your-face blatant artistry. A real turn off.The torture scenes were good. Real good, actually -- possibly the only parts that really looked good. The burned limbs and such were well conceived. I was never grossed out or anything, but thought this was about as close to reality as I have ever seen in a film with torture.The guests were okay. Seeing lonelygirl15 in a movie was weird and she looked even more awkward in this way. She has an unusual face that's either pretty or deformed, and I don't know if it works outside of YouTube. Art Bell's appearance was awesome and unexpected, but this is also another aspect of the film that was just silly. They make a detour into discussing stigmata, which is outlandish. They try to blend it in, but they may just end up making less sense.Where does the boyfriend disappear to? I can't discuss the end of the film, but keep your eye on the boyfriend and see when he does and doesn't show up. At some point, he just stops appearing... why? If you're watching this for Lohan's striptease and sex scene, you may be disappointed. The stripping was nothing hot (and she's never nude). The sex scene was a bit better, but nothing worth watching the film for. Really, this was making a promise to the audience they couldn't fulfill.Please don't watch this film unless you want to be frustrated, confused and bored. So many plot holes appear as the film goes on, and I can't even attempt to fill them. Was there a baby purchased from a crack addict? Does the main character have a psychic link that can be brought forth in her writing? I have no idea. The film falls apart so fast and just finds more and more ways to fall apart as it goes... ugh.It does make slightly more sense on the second viewing, and maybe still more on the third, but is it worth that? No. If the DVD had a director's commentary so he could at least try to justify this, that would be better. Maybe you'll like this one if you like \"The Box\".",

I would love to have seen the fat, confused faces of mainstream American audiences as they settled into their seats at the mall cineplex to watch... this! Probably expecting to see some family-friendly thriller like \"I Know what You Did Last Summer,\" and instead being faced with some rather heavy stuff indeed. Here we have a film that is not afraid to be non-commercial and offensive; in fact it looks like it is going out of it's way to be so. The madness begins when Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) wakes up in a hospital bed, minus one foot and one hand. She has apparently lost her mind as well, claiming to be another person altogether; one Dakota Moss, a foul-mouthed, pill popping stripper who was raised on the wrong side of the tracks. The story bends and weaves nicely, and it keeps the viewer guessing, while treating us to some bizarre and often disturbing imagery. A sadistic serial killer has been kidnapping young women and torturing them, by freezing/burning their limbs with chunks of dry ice, before removing them! He is also pumping them full of speed so they will be painfully aware of their own situation. Heavy stuff for the mall cineplex; what were they thinking, showing this alongside commercial fodder like Toy Story 2? The film is quite good, it is different and never boring. There are nice artistic/creative touches throughout, and much obscure symbolism besides. Lohan took the step away from teen roles and Disney, and really went to the other side with a film that is as jaded as it is controversial. And without giving away the ending, I will say how relieved i was that the filmmakers did not go the familiar route of making the whole thing a dream. For those with a strong stomach and appreciation for exploitation cinema, i would recommend it. I call it 'exploitation' because of the numerous and unnecessary striptease dance routines performed by lohan, as the camera lingers on open legs and panty shots, as well as some truly nasty and sadistic gore. But like much of the exploit genre, there is a wild story and some strong ideas to hold the attention beyond the cheap thrills. Now that this has found it's way to video release it might find it's intended audience, and might even gain cult status. for fans of Tom Cruise and Jennifer Anniston films, i advise you to stay away.",

I am usually drawn to movies that are rated poorly, especially when the lead actress is a coke head spiraling out of control. However, this was a resounding disappointment. The movie, in the hands of a talented or skilled filmmaker with actors who were half decent, may have been a moderate hit.

It seemed inconceivable to me that a movie could be just as bad as everyone was saying. Random striptease scenes? Way too much of the color blue for no reason? Terrible editing and horrendous dialogue? Naah, people must be overreacting.They're not.I KNOW WHO KILLED ME, about a GoodGirl who goes missing and comes back BadGirl, is absolutely as bad as everyone is saying. GoodGirl Lohan is a senior in high school, and she likes to write and play the piano. She's good at playing the piano, but absolutely horrendous at writing. Yet, she tells her piano teacher, \"I just got my winter admit to Yale and I don't want to blow it, so I have to concentrate on my writing.\" We hear several examples of her \"writing\" throughout the movie, and it's not something that would get you admitted to Yale. Instead, if you applied to Yale with writing like this, you'd be put on mental health watch.Lohan's acting is abysmal when she's playing GoodGirl, whose name is Aubrey Fleming, incidentally. Every time someone addresses her or talks about her, they use her name: Aubrey Fleming. Just so you know who she is (Aubrey Fleming, in case you've forgotten since the last time I said it.) After she's abducted, her friends go into super-frantic mode looking for her, highlighting some of the worst performances I have ever seen in unnamed characters. This scene is ridiculously pointless; it lasts for ten minutes and only serves to show us that yes, she's been abducted, we weren't imagining it.After some kind of wolfy dog thing runs across the road and causes some woman to careen off the side, her headlights spill across the form of Aubrey Fleming, sans arm and leg. But wait! This isn't Aubrey Fleming. She says her name is Dakota Moss, not Aubrey Fleming. It's Dakota.The movie spirals deeper and deeper into insanity. Flashbacks take place with absolutely no indication that they are flashbacks. That's a problem, when one character is real and the other is an alter-ego, and/or one character is missing and the other is remembering herself... or something... and they're all played by the same actress.Wounds are created and forgotten. Lohan's leg is missing, but it's so incredibly obvious that they wrapped her leg in greenscreen material -- you can see everything behind her pixellated in the shape of a leg. Characters come into play, are featured prominently for two or three minutes, and then forgotten.I can't even go on about this movie. It's so incredibly bad. I don't think there are even words to convey how awful it is. This is definitely a case of 'you need to see it to believe it.' Watch it; you'll be disappointed, but at least you can stop wondering. Yes, it's that bad.",

Lindsey is a very talented actress and plays her roles very well. This movie is actually one of her best. I'm not a big fan of the teenage Herbie and Drama Queen, etc. This role was a good next step in my opinion. I think everyone should go out and see this movie. It was really good. HERE COME THE SPOILERS...1. I can just see Dakota explaining to her new found sister that she slept with her boyfriend, in her room, with her parents in the house.2. Why the hell was the piano teacher the murderer? Was he mad because she had a talent and was throwing it away? That's the only reason I can come up with. Who cares really, the movie made me forget about the killer. I was focused on how it all happened in the first place and the girls.3. Lindsey Lohan playing a stripper? Not a shocker.

Also, the story was ridiculous to the point of being comical. The writer and director should have been dismembered, not the killer's victims. The milieu was prurient, seamy, and exploitative.

The kinda complex plot confused me many times, but invited me to find it out until 80 minutes. After that, there were many unnecessary scenes which may had over-lengthed the movie, unfortunately.There were some incredible facts like the stigmas (not as painful as in the \"Stigmata\"), like every time her twin sister was hurt she was also hurt. So if her sister was having sex, she should feel the pleasure of it as well, not only at the painful parts. Also the reason for her (or them?) being tortured didn't convince me (was that because she gave up playing piano?) Sadly this is the first Lohan's film that I watch, and her acting didn't surprise me. Actually, I found her very amateur as an actress, but I may still watch \"Freaky Friday\" to be sure of that.",

            "content": "I Know Who Killed Me is, without a doubt, one of the most creative and uniquely strange films of the year. Its quirky humor, bizarre plot, and poetic ending make this somehow a really great movie. Lindsay Lohan has always been known to give pretty good performances, but she is at her best here, in a role that seems taylor-made for the actresses' real-life chaos. Besides Lohan, there is really no one else worth mentioning in the mostly forgettable cast.After several disappearances occur in a small town, up-and-coming young writer Aubrey Fleming is kidnapped by a black figure and subjected to a series of grizzly tortures. Days later, she is found near a ditch, her hand in ribbons and her leg torn to shreds. But all doesn't seem to be as it appears. The girl that is found in the ditch claims that she is not Aubrey Fleming, but another girl named Dakota Moss. As the FBI and the police try to get to the bottom of everything, 'Dakota' has to piece together the puzzle and solve it before it's too late.After surprising me in the very enjoyable Georgia Rule, Lohan is at the top of her game here playing Aubrey Fleming/Dakota Moss, who is deeper than she appears. The stripping scenes are done very well, and the torture sequences are beautifully directed with intriguing camera angles and wonderful acting from Lohan. The blood and gore in this film actually looked very realistic, and thus it was mostly disturbing and disgusting.The director, Chris Sivertson, actually crafts an interesting tale, and the use of a frightening atmosphere generates genuine tension and scares. I was absolutely in love with the film's cinematography and the constant repetitive use of the color blue. There is a lot of foreshadowing and interesting subplots. The thing that makes the ending so magnificent is that it can be interpreted in many various ways.Perhaps the best thing about I Know Who Killed Me, however, is that the film never takes itself too seriously. The script is written with a sort of 80's vibe to it, and it plays out like an old-fashioned but stylish 80's slasher movie. I liked the plot a lot, and I found the film to be very original in many parts and full of plenty memorable scenes.I Know Who Killed Me was a very fun, intense, frightening roller coaster ride of a horror film that never takes itself too seriously, which is probably for the better. Lindsay Lohan gives a wonderful performance, but the supporting cast is poor, to say the very least. I liked her boyfriend a lot, and I wish he had played a bigger part. I Know Who Killed Me was intelligent, and it was one of my favorite horror films. 9.5/10",

Lindsay Lohan for all of her faults is a solid actress. She can be funny, creepy, little girlie, doesn't matter. I just hope she gets her self straight soon. This was a solid little movie and I would like to see her in more like this. My only big gripe with this was the very end. The newly reunited twins lying next to each other after one dug up the other. Would have liked to have seen the cops faces and the mother when there were 2 of them and Dakota was really Dakota.

While the movie may have wanted to leave the viewer thinking that maybe she really was telling the truth, there were way too many lose ends.

What was the point of having them in the movie in the first place? They could have saved money by having Lohan play every role herself! The next thing that annoyed me was that the film hit you over the head with the color blue. I mean every scene contained something that was this unnaturally bright blue. Okay, I get it already, blue is significant! I started to feel insulted after a while. Plus, they practically marked the killer with a gigantic blue ring!

Like Anne Hathaway before her who had shed her clothes to announce her arrival (in both Brokeback Mountain and Havoc), Lohan prances around in skimpy costumes, gyrating on a dance floor showing off her pole moves, but yet stopped short from showing what she has already exposed in real life.Her public demeanours aside, which has seen her flash skin (intentional or not), smoke, drink and drive, all hopes of this movie being her vehicle to show what she can do beyond those cutesy teenage roles, go up in a puff of smoke. I Know Who Killed Me sounds like a cheap cousin of the clich\u00e9d I Know What You Did (insert favrourite season here), and works out for the most parts suffering from multiple personality disorder. It cannot decide whether to be a psychological thriller which tickles the mind, a mystery with tons of smart red herrings thrown about, or a gory torture porn movie which really strayed too close into the Elisha Cuthbert Captivity copycat model.Lohan as Aubrey disappears in a small town which had been rocked by a series of missing girls and bizarre killings. Naturally everyone gets worried that Ms Freckles will become a victim, and when she's found, she suddenly deems herself to be a certain Dakota Moss who have absolutely no idea why folks are claiming otherwise, and assisted by some nifty special effects that somehow just makes your skin crawl. So on everyone's insistence she's not who she claims she is, and going down the road of delusions, I'll actually be quite glad if it took that straightforward path, rather than meander through indecisiveness, showing a little of everything, including cheap shock horror tactics, before providing that all important plot twist to stamp its mark and steer the movie henceforth. Credit though to that twist which was something of interest to me at least, but nothing that had already not been done before.What the story clearly lacked was a strong central villain, instead opting for the obvious clich\u00e9s in playing coy with his identity. The movie throws up a whole truckload of supporting characters, and most of them, especially the police folk who were so involved in cracking the case ala CSI style, gets so conveniently forgotten midway through. Subplots introduced were relying too much on many coincidences, and when they do not logically work out, gets dropped wholesale too. All these boiled down in demonstrating the scatterbrains at work here, in dabbling with and experimenting, but leaving those unwanted test results still in the movie.But as mentioned, I Know Who Killed Me is an avenue for Lohan to show that she's bad, and really really bad. But there's absolutely no need to show she's notorious at flirting with the gardener with her come hither looks in tight clothing. She smokes and she drinks, and doesn't demonstrate anything else beyond being the tabloid fodder she has made out to be in recent times. Watch this if only you enjoy being teased by the local distributors - violence and gore is good and uncut, but love making with clothes on gets the snip for the call of the dough.",

We then see where Aubrey is. She is being tortured and her fingers and limbs are being cut off. When Aubrey manages to escape from the physcopath who has been hurting her, she collapses and wakes up in the hospital. To the surprise of the police, family and her friends and doctors she insists that she is not Aubrey Fleming and that she is a young sassy stripper named Dakota Moss. The film is then filled with so-called \"scary\" scenes and lines which are meant to make you think.Sorry to say that I Know Who Killed Me is a complete mess. It is beyond belief the shabbiness and how pathetic the script is. The scenes don't connect and the story is almost comical. I think the people who made this film were more interested in the trendy blue & red screens which distracts the viewer continuously throughout the film. Lohan has always been a good actress, but this let's her resume down! She was disappointing. And yes, I am aware that she was in and out of rehab at the time and she was \"mentally challenged\" at the time of shooting this movie (late 2007, mid 2007 release) but Lindsay was also \"mentally challenged\" at the time of shooting the comedy Georgia Rule starring Jane Fonda (which was released just a little while before this mess) and Georgia Rule wasn't her best work either. The shock to think that people call this a physcological thriller or a horror. Watching Power Rangers is scarier than this garbage. Sorry, Lindsay.* 1/5 stars",

The FBI & various psychiatrists feel Aubrey has a split personality & is delusional but Dakota insists she is not Aubrey & starts to investigate the strange set of circumstances she finds herself in...Directed by Chris Silverston this now infamous box-office bomb & multi Razzie Award winning horror thriller has a really, really bad reputation & has been throughly trashed by critics & audiences alike for reasons which I personally can't quite see since while I didn't love it or anything I certainly didn't hate it & think it gets a fair amount of unjust flak hurled at it. I should just add at this point that I Know Who Killed Me is not a particularly good film by any stretch of the imagination but I just don't think it's anywhere near as bad as some make it out to be. Anyway, the script by John Hammond has a few good ideas in it & I did actually like the central concept of the film although there are some rather major flaws. The plot twist's are handled quite badly & one or two end up coming across as ridiculous with some very poor scripting, the idea that Aubrey has an identical twin is fine if a bit of a stretch but for Daniel to say he paid her real mother to have one of her twins when his real daughter died so as not to upset his wife just doesn't work. Wouldn't the doctors at the hospital question where one of the woman's babies went? Or how a baby that had just died is now healthy? The FBI use DNA testing to see whether Dakota is Dakota or Aubrey & obviously it comes back as identical which it would, a far cheaper & reliable way to check Dakota's story would have been simple fingerprints which are different on every single person on Earth even identical twins. I found the whole twin stigmata plot twist pretty good actually but the way it is handled & introduced with a tacky narration by a chain smoking host on a website is poor. Then there's the killer, he is given absolutely no motives whatsoever, we never find out why he likes to amputate young girls limbs or why he has a room full of prosthetic legs & arms & as a very minor character to start with when it is revealed that they are the killer it has little impact. Having said that I did quite enjoy parts of this, there's some good gore, a few good ideas (although they are quite badly handled at times) & a reasonable twist or two. It certainly kept me watching & I was always interested in what was going on & how it was going to finish so it must have done something right I suppose. The character's are OK if underused & most of them just disappear by the time it finishes, the character of Dakota is interesting since she has her hand & leg cut off she is actually disabled & there aren't many films where the lead is disabled although the character or script doesn't exactly present her in a good light or deal with any of the issues surrounding her disability in a mature way.I also quite liked the visual style of I Know Who Killed Me, director Silverston sets out a clear & different colour scheme for when Aubrey & Dakota are on screen with a definite blue colour palette when Aubrey is about & red when it's Dakota. The film slows down a fair bit during it's middle third as the entire serial killer plot is abandoned & the film focuses on whether Dakota is really Aubrey or not which drags a bit. The ending is typical horror film fare with a young female character the only survivor having to fend off the main villain in a very dark location. There's some decent gore & a few torture scenes that look like they belong in a Saw film, the burning & cutting off of Aubrey's fingers in particular will make a few wince I would suspect. With Dakota being a stripper the makers get ample opportunity to show Lohan in a variety of skimpy outfits pole dancing but she never goes completely nude, there is also a sex scene if that sort of thing interests you.With a supposed budget of about $12,000,000 I Know Who Killed Me couldn't have been that much of a flop since twelve million really isn't that much for a major studio picture these days, it's well made with good production values & impressive special make-up effects although I thought the soundtrack was awful & some of the songs used are just terrible. The acting is below average with Lohan especially poor at times.I Know Who Killed Me was nowhere, I mean absolutely nowhere near as bad as a lot of people would have you believe & in fact I quite liked for what it was although some really poor scripting which ruin the potentially interesting twist's, some bad acting & a completely motiveless killer don't help matters.",

            "content": "**SPOILERS** Garishly photographed in intense blue and red colors the movie \"I Know Who Killed Me\" gives us a clue to what's about to happen within the very first few minutes of the film. This all has to do with honor student and future concert pianist Aubrey Fleming, Lindsay Lohan. Aubrey is torn between following her music teachers Douglas Norquist, Thomas Tofel, advice in putting all her efforts into a musical, playing the piano, career or Aubery's real love in becoming world famous mystery writer.During the opening sequences of the movie there's a search for this missing girl, Jennifer Toland, who's eventually found murdered with her right hand and lower part of her right leg amputated. Jennifer will play a major part later in the film to not only bring out what the motives of her murderer was but how they connected her to both Aubrey and what later turned out to be her identical twin Dakota Moss also played by Miss. Lohan.Attending a New Salem high school football game to see her boyfriend the teams star running back Jerrod Pointer, Brian Geraghty,in action Aubery is later kidnapped by this Man in Blue who holds her hostage for some two weeks. Aubery is brutally tortured by her abductor and left for dead on the side of a road outside of town. Found with the exact same injuries as the late Jennifer Toland, an amputated right hand and foot, it's believed by the local police that Aubrey's abductor and Jennifer's murderer are one and the same person.The big surprise comes later when Aubrey regains conciseness and insists that she's not Aubrey Fleming at all! She's a stripper who works out of the Strip Nightclub in the red light district of town called Dokata Moss!The film has a difficult time getting the ball rolling in what exactly Dakota's state of mind really is. Is she really who she says that she is and if true were does that leave Aubery Fleming? The unseen killer, or kidnapper, had somehow overlooked the fact that he had two, Aubery & Dakota, victims whom he kidnapped and brutally tortured were in fact related related to each other! One of them, Dakota, not only wasn't whom he wanted to do a job on, by torturing and leaving her to die, but that in the end she would be the one who does a job on him!Far too confusing to really follow \"I Know Who Killed Me\" leaves so many loose ends that you feel in trying to understand it's storyline that you'll slip and fall on your head like you would if you forgot to tie your shoelaces when you got dressed in the morning.Lindsey Lohan in what may be, I'm not really sure, her first adult acting part is surprising good as both Aubrey Fleming and Dakota Moss. I never expected Miss Lohan to be that believable in her two parts in the movie with all the bad publicity that she's gotten over the last two years as an out of control drug and alcohol abuser. The really big surprise in the film is not that both Aubrey and Dakota are really identical twins it's that their mother as well as father isn't Audrey's and Dakota's real parents Susan, Julia Osmond, and Daniel, Neal McDonough, Fleming! Thats' what fooled everybody in the movie and most of all the Man in Blue who's both Aubery and Dakota kidnapper and torturer as well as Jennifer Toland's murderer! That major mistake on his part in the end was what not only tripped The Man in Blue up but caused the confused psycho to expose himself where he ended up getting run through by a hysterical and wildcat-like Dakota Moss!",

Not that making fun of terrible movies isn't a great cause I can definitely get behind, but their picks are always just so desperate for attention. Hell, even George Bush won one, somehow. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was one of the most obvious targets of all time (probably together with \"Gigli\"), but as usual it isn't really the worst of the worst. The plot's a jumbled mess (too many cut scenes perhaps?) and Lindsay Lohan is totally unconvincing as a bad girl (which is sorta ironic), but there are some redeeming qualities. The movie's hardly ever boring, the twists might be borderline retarded but at least they follow each other pretty quickly and usually come with some \"enjoyable\" bloodshed. There are also some nice shots here and there, in a tacky off-brand David Lynch sorta way. Seriously, nobody likes the flashbacks? Oh well. I won't heap praise on the movie, because it sucks. All I'm saying is that if this is the worst movie you've ever seen well, watch more movies. There's plenty of stuff I hate more.",

In second place, the movie has a lot of ridiculous situations, like the one when Dakota's finger falls down and she, instead of going to the hospital, she sew it to her hand again, Who in the world would do that!!!! Other ridiculous situation is when she discovers who is the killer, and she goes after him instead of telling police, does that look logical? The movie is very boring, and for those who think that maybe it deserves to be seen because of Lindsay's striper dances, I'm sorry but it doesn't.Concluding, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, I recommend not to buy the DVD, and if you want to watch it, watch it on you tube, at least there it's free.",

I think she was at her best when she was doing Disney films before she was a teenager. If I am going to be subjected to Lindsay Lohan movie, I would rather it be Parent Trap. Outside of that one, there is not much else that she really did all that well in. Getting back to this one, if you are going to pay to see it, wait until it hits a dollar theater.

            "content": "...But I know I'm in the minority. So goes the drama with the teenage drama queen Lindsay Lohan and her recent legal troubles of late. As is the case, she is the latest Hollywood \"it\" girl to fall prey to drug and alcohol abuse, and to have her drama splattered all over the tabloids (which surely gets more attention than any new movies she appears in). Such that it might dog Lohan's new thriller \"I Know Who Killed Me.\"I'm one of the few willing to brush aside a drama queen's drama (I don't know, maybe because I know deep down a real actress is trying to prove herself, or, I had nothing better to do on this Monday afternoon but waste $7.25 on the latest Hollywood thriller). Although the former is true for me, others would choose the latter. In \"I Know Who Killed Me,\" Lohan is the latest pretty face to grace today's brutally violent thriller genre, where said pretty face gets a chance to do something apart from the teen genre and does some real \"acting.\"\"I Know Who Killed Me\" doesn't offer much new to the industry, abiding by typical thriller conventions in a plot about a twisted serial killer who abducts teenage girls, tortures them, and then dumps their bodies once he's through mutilating them while they're fully conscious. The film comes to us from an undistinguished first-time screenwriter (Jeff Hammond) and an equally undistinguished director (Chris Sivertson). But somehow, the raven-haired Lohan's competent dual portrayal here (yes, it's another thriller where we see double, which of course, means more trouble) elevates what could have been a forgettable \"Z\"-grade thriller to a better, more respectable \"B\"-grade status.As Aubrey Fleming, a successful teenager with a lot going for her, Lohan is superb, even if it takes her, and the movie, a while to get going. A high school honor student with a gift for writing and playing the piano, her scholastic achievements don't save her from the diabolical psycho-killer who has been preying on pretty girls and mutilating them for days on end before disposing of their bodies. Subjected to having her digits hacked off with some very sharp instruments, it's an ordeal that she's very fortunate to survive.Aubrey is soon discovered, minus one leg and a hand. Her parents (Neal McDonough and Julia Ormond) receive the phone call that their daughter is alive but doesn't remember who she is. Now calling herself Dakota Moss, a foul-mouthed stripper who also engages in booze and recreational sex, the doctors are convinced that her traumatic experience has allowed her to forge a new identity to help her cope with the ordeal. But Dakota, now a double amputee with some new state-of-the-art prosthetics, insists that she is who she says she is. And if she's telling the truth, then of course it means that the real Aubrey is still out there somewhere, being tortured by a really nasty guy with a fetish for sharp objects.\"I Know Who Killed Me\" won't appeal to most tastes. Some of you might not believe me, but Lohan keeps the project above water for the most part. In a dual role, she believes in the film enough that her performance is convincing, if nothing else. Not a whole lot happens during the first segment of the picture when Lohan is Aubrey, but when she becomes Dakota, we begin to see her in a new light. (Some may argue that this is the \"real\" Lohan here, the one who engages in frequent sex and abuses drugs and stuff like they were really nothing.)The film's torture scenes are as unsettling as they could possibly get. There are some truly horrific things on display here (with limbs being hacked off left and right) as we get to take a look inside a madman's little shop of horrors. Sivertson does have a real eye for gruesome torture imagery, and his cinematography colors nearly everything in a hazy shade of blue. But at the end of the day, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" isn't at all a disappointment, even though it still seems like typical Hollywwod thriller stuff. If you put aside Lohan's recent legal troubles, then \"I Know Who Killed Me\" isn't that bad at all.8/10",

Now, she's not only missing a hand and a foot, she's convinced she's another person...Dakota. And Dakota is nothing like Aubrey. Dakota is a stripper who smokes and loves hot sex...and she insists she is NOT Aubrey and gets angry when people contradict her. As a result, things are also quite awkward at home...at Aubrey's home with Aubrey's parents. To top it all off, Dakota/Aubrey has weird hallucinations...really, really weird ones throughout the film.A huge reason not to watch this one is that at times the film is torture porn. You get some very realistic scenes where the psychotic is cutting into Aubrey and it's NOT for the squeamish. My feeling is that just because you can make realistic and vivid violent scenes look real doesn't mean you should nor that you should show so much. This leads me to the opposite problem with the film. It's a sleazy skin flick...that never actually shows anything! Lohan strips and makes out....and manages to keep her clothing on and show nothing in a rated R film. While I have no interest in seeing her naked, at least that would have provided the viewers with SOMETHING interesting. Seeing her in a bra and panties dancing at a strip club just seemed weird and disappointing...same with her 'hot' scene with Aubrey's boyfriend.Overall, this is a silly and difficult to enjoy film...so much so that I am not surprised that it's currently #67 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. It also was a HUGE winner at the Razzies awards, setting a record for most wins at the time. Poor and confusing writing as well as an unappealing leading lady sink this one.

Surprising too, considering all the other dreadful movies that have been made this year and that didn't even get a nomination. It was curiosity that got me to watch this film. I wanted to see what the fuss it was all about \u0096 if it was really that bad or if critics had just overreacted. As it turned out, both ideas are true.First of all, I'd like to establish one point : Lindsay Lohan's performance was excessively criticized. She was fairly decent in both her roles. Not fantastic, but definitely satisfying. I thought she didn't scream enough when her character Aubrey got her limbs cut off, but other than that, no problem. That would be the \u00ab overreacting critics side \u00bb. Although, since her characters were both pretty shallow, they were both rather easy to play.But I know who killed me is a bad movie. No doubt.Its major flaw would be... the \u00ab out of place \u0096 ness \u00bb. Like the supporting characters. And the cast. They aren't convincing. They don't fit the bill. Especially the FBI agents and the killer : does this man look like a talented piano teacher teaching rich students ? No, not at all. He looks like your typical bad guy, bald, unattractive, with the looks of a vagabond. The right choice would have been an elderly, sophisticated lady with good manners, for instance. And lots of details just clash. The killer's hat. The fake legs in his house. The blue flowers. The gardener \u0096 completely useless, no role at all. Not to mention Aubrey's boyfriend : one second, he feels guilty and cries because he couldn't protect Aubrey, and the next he more than happily has sex with her twin sister. Heavens, let's not even talk about that sex scene. Everything was wrong about it. And finally... no one has a true personality, a true psyche, a true... character development.Any other flaw ? Lots. But let's just say the FBI is dumb. Two girls get abducted and tortured after quitting piano lessons and they don't see the connection ; while Dakota understands everything from a single ribbon. They don't believe Dakota when she tells them who she is, even though new scars start appearing miraculously \u0096 so to speak \u0096 on her body. They did not even try to check if Dakota Moss existed or not when it should have been really easy. Yep, FBI doesn't get the good part in this film.Anyway... the idea of the stigmata twins was very interesting and it does make a good movie subject. Unfortunately, if the subject was good, the movie wasn't. It could have been much, much better with a different cast, a different storyline and stuff. I'm always disappointed when a good idea is wasted.So... if you like good American thrillers, this is not for you. If you like clich\u00e9s, gore scenes and most importantly, if you don't need much to be satisfied, go ahead.",

The movie was way too dark, which is a way to save money on sets. The plot needs a lot of help it is illogical. How stupid is it that Dakota Moss's fingers and leg falls off because her twin sister's fingers and leg are cut off. The writers must have been on drugs while writing the script.

Somehow I think that Lindsey Lohan's reputation at the time was reviewed more than the movie, which is miles ahead of most films in this genre. The dual personalities and the theme of separating reality from fantasy is very well positioned in the script, which brings a level of thematic to the piece that's rare for the genre, as well.

Now, I may have had a few issues with Lindsay Lohan and her much-publicized antics, but keep in mind I have no bias against her as an actress. I do, however, now have a strong bias against the director, Chris Sivertson, and the writer, Jeff Hammond.First off, the movie's a pretentious piece of crap. The director tries for artistic symbolism, most notably with all the reds and blues, and fails miserably. My favorite color happens to be blue, but after seeing this train wreck, I don't think I ever want to see another blue thing again.The script is lame-brained to begin with, and hearing some of these actors, especially Lohan, deliver these lines is just an indescribably awful experience.And then there were all the shots of gore and blood I found completely unnecessary (A word of advice: If you do want to see this, don't eat anything beforehand), not to mention the ridiculous twist near the end. (The deleted ending offers another twist that's just as bad, if not worse, as it makes the audience feel even more cheated) So, overall, this movie sucks, and I would only recommend seeing it if you happen to be a connoisseur of bad cinema, as it does have its fair share of laughable moments as well as boring or disgusting ones. In fact, that unintentional humor is the only thing keeping me from rating this a 1/10.",

            "content": "I went to London Last week and got this movie for only 4 Pounds. I read a very tasty preview in my favorite film revue called \"Mad Movies\". So in the late evening, I was a bit surprised to figure out how much Razzie Awards Chris \"The Lost\" Sivertsons latest effort won. But I didn't care so much because I disbelieve the hype surrounding this ceremony (which is organised by guys who confuse movies failing to find their audience and really bad movies). So I decided to clear up my mind and make my own opinion. I figured this out: it's so easy to hate a picture only because miss Lindsay Lohan's private life appears in tabloids headlines. It is also easy to spit on a movie when you left the theatre, even if, I have to admit, one of the first sequences is really hard to watch. But \"I know who Killed Me\" is neither some sort of a \"career pusher\" for its starlet, nor a torture porn (as I feared it would be at first). It's just one of the most genius DTV movies I saw in the last years. At first, you have to know that I'm a huge fan of Brian De Palma and Dario Argento, as is probably the director himself. Before talking of miss Loan's performance, I was seduced by the movie atmosphere. Lighting and camera direction (John R Leonetti did a great job, as often) sent me back in the first period of two of my favorite filmmakers. But Siveston has his own touch and didn't just try to copy his masterminds. One should try to understand the story as an ironical reinterpretation of the whole slasher genre. I also advise people who laughed when the killers identity is revealed to watch the movie's alternative ending. For sure, they will figure out what kind of intentions Jeffrey Hammond and the director had. And also that both are honest and clever enough not to leave that ending in the picture but to let people think about what they experienced. Not every \"wannabe\" does. For me, the whole stuff is just amazing: Sivertson's direction is brilliant (watch the image of the school fenced balcony at the beginning -which looks like a piano- and listen to the music),especially during the bus-stop sequence, scary as possible. The colors and the dreamy/poetic atmosphere generate a bizarre tone which is in perfect harmony with what this YOUNG, GIFTED and CREATIVE woman has to deal with. Even if I like Douglas Buck's remake of De Palma's \"Sisters\", I think it didn't reach the main point as well as Siverston's movie did. But loving Buck and sinking a promising newcomer who works with Lindsay Lohan is so hype. Poor world. By the way, this girl is a good actress and she shows it here: you need much talent in such a difficult performance and she is pretty convincing in nearly every sequence she appeared in. Julia Ormond is perfect as usual: I am moved when she opens her heart to Dakota. So, if you want to get back to the late seventies, you shouldn't miss this movie; it's a \"must see\" without any kind of stupid twist in the end. I hope that Razzie's bad publicity will just make people curious. Good movies and brilliantdirectors/screenwriters win over the hype! Hang on, Chris!",

            "content": "Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) is a young bright college student, who's lives in a small town with her caring parents (Julia Ormand and Neal McDonough). She's hoping to have a future career in writing than for her talent for playing the piano. One night, Aubrey disappear from her friends and her boyfriend (Brian Geraghty) after a college football game. Now weeks has passed... a stranger finally find her left for dead but she claims that her name is Dakota Moss. A young woman, who lives a difficult life and she's also a exotic dancer. Her parents are shocked that she doesn't recognized them and she doesn't know any of these people from Aubrey's life. The FBI thinks that Aubrey got so traumatized, that she adopts a new memory as Dakota. They also thinks that she might be living in the memory of Aubrey's short stories. Dakota feels that she might be a twin after remembering her life more than Aubrey. Especially since Dakota remembers losing her arm and leg like that suddenly just happen like that. Dakota feels that Aubrey still alive somehow (she's staring to feel her presence) and find her before Dakota might die as well.Directed by Chris Sivertson made an suspenseful mystery thriller isn't quite as bad as some critics said it was. I find myself enjoying this unusual film. True, it has some shares of its flaws and including a few unintentionally funny moments. But the intriguing premise written by Jeff Hammond has some fascinating ideas. The film might be a bit very heavy-handed for its visual style at times. The third act really slow down the movie, it becomes quite weak and predictable. But Lohan is surprisingly good in this film, playing two different characters. Her lap-dance sequences is quite tasteful (Although some male and female fans of Lohan's are probably disappointed, she's not nude in this picture at all). Her exotic dance moves are sexy enough.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Alternate Opening & Ending, Extended Lap-Dance Scenes and Bloopers. I would have love to see an behind the scenes featurette and an audio commentary by the filmmakers. Since this movie was an box office disappointment, the studio felt this film didn't need any good special features. Fans of Horror/Thrillers and Lohan's work will find plenty of enjoy here than the causal viewer. This isn't the worst film, i seen that came out in 2007. There's worst movies than this one. There's some good scenes here and there. Best sequence is when Dakota character finds a loving bond between Aubrey's mother sitting on the couch, while watching a video of Aubrey's been not born yet. Which it's the heart of the picture. But in this interesting but misfired picture, it's more style over substance movie and John R. Leonetti's (Dead Silence, Detroit Rock City, Mortal Kombat) excellent cinematography are the highlight of this effort. For all it's flaws and occasional silliness, it's worth a look. HD Widescreen.

            "content": "People that don't understand the movie \"I know who killed me\" here *spoliers* I'll explain it to you. CobaltDuck explains - The Movie is not about a Twin finding her sister like some psychological mystery crime drama. ITs not really torture porn. Its a Psychological thriller. The movie a about Aubrey using her imagination to try to solve the mystery of who is killing her. Aubrey doesn't make it. Aubrey is killed. Aubrey is captured, tortured, buried alive, and the mysterious killer gets away with it. Aubrey doesn't know who is killing her, so she retreats to her mind and to avoid the pain and try to make sense out of why this is happening to her. That part where Dakota lays down next to Aubrey isn't a tired Dakota taking a quick nap its Aubrey finally dieing. The MOvie on the very first viewing is suppose to confuse you...it leads you in many directions and possibilities.. Does Aubrey has multiple personality disorder, or maybe she is an engineered twin for an experiment (take note of the similar faces of the 2 previous girls maybe they were both engineered twins and killed as well), or Dakota really is a twin... These are just decoy plots. Every time Dakota feels pain..thats not Dakota thats Aubrey feeling it. Every vision Dakota has is not a vision .thats Aubrey seeing the situation. The movie's first viewings purpose is to make you think the story is going in a different direction. Only at the very end does it become clear and the movie comes into focus. It should hit you in the gut that Aubrey didn't make it. Its sad. It should make you angry because Aubrey is strong and not weak but she never had a chance to fight back. The 2nd viewing you have the time to look at all the clues, because maybe the Piano teacher wasn't the one that killed her maybe thats just Aubrey's best guess before she died. Maybe it was the strange man on the bus. Maybe its the psychiatrist. Maybe the killer is hidden in her mind. Maybe no clue in her mind will help her solve the mystery. I like to think Aubrey got it right and figured it out and gave her self some comfort for solving the mystery. People that criticise the movie, including newspaper critics, just don't get the point of the movie. It goes right over their head. They can't see it even though its right in front of their eyes. One could start to suspect where the movie was heading when the \"strange\" explanation for Dakota losing body parts was explained by \"Twin stigmata\". This is a fantasy, they could of equally used Voodoo or witchcraft or alien invaders as fantasy substitutes. Then when Dakota decided to drive with her father to the piano teachers house (with out back up or calling the police i might add) the direction of the story should of become suspect. When Dakota said \"I think i know who killed me\" the audience should of started figured it out, because why would Dakota say \"I think i Know who killed me\" it doesn't make sense, Dakota was never touched by the Piano teacher, nor was she being killed, she said it because she was Aubrey and Aubrey was close to death and wanted to figure it out. Then Dakota finds Aubrey... it should become obvious that all of this is in Aubreys head. Dakota joins Aubrey because Aubrey is in her last breath. The movie ends and goes no further because Aubrey is dead. If it wasn't in Aubreys head then the next scene would show the next day at her dads funeral with both sisters on crutches. But, Aubrey is dead. The movie isn't suppose to make you feel good. It should make you feel sad/angry/depressed/uncomfortable. It is not a normal happy Holloywood movie. But its tragedy will keep you thinking about it for a long time. the stripper scenes make you feel like the movie you see is real. If the ending was a happy ending the effect would not be the same. Aubrey dies... and its really sad and such a waste. I know who killed me is a good movie.",

I will admit that the idea of the movie, while having a lot of familiar elements, did have some promise. But the bad execution of the movie will more likely than not have you thinking this was a REAL bad idea. For starters, the story unfolds at a really slow pace; when the movie gets to the halfway point, the story should have reached that point in the first quarter or first third of the movie. (There are signs that the original cut of the movie ran even longer, such as the fact that some key characters simply disappear long before the movie reaches the end.) The characters are not very sympathetic, in large part due to some really awful performances (Lindsay Lohan's being the most terrible), but also that the characters make a lot of really idiotic actions. If these characters were a lot smarter, the movie would have ended a lot quicker. I will admit that as slow and stupid as the movie was, I wasn't bored at any moment - the botched nature of the movie kept me interested in seeing what new misstep the movie would make next.

This is not Three Colors: Blue man. The 'killer' is maybe from the Blue Man group. There are some red herrings or rather blue herrings. The prosthetics tech guy was a little suspicious. He happens to be Darneo from my name is Earl great show by the way. In the end it happens to be this random guy who frequently appears on the screen that you would think is obviously a red herring but it is him all along. The owl keeps helping our character find the crime scene. That is obviously Twin Peaks. The plot:So basically we have twins separated at birth by Damien Dark from Arrow and one gets abducted by a psycho and he amputates one of the twins. Through the supernatural phenomenon of 'Stigmata Twins' where if one twin gets injured in a particular part of her body, the other twin also gets injured in the same part of the body. 'Twin Dragons' by Jackie Chan comes to mind. Which begs the question how could you conclude that your twin sister is dead because her dying would lead to your death too? Finally the movie should be called 'I Don't Know Who Abducted and Amputated but Didn't Kill My Twin Sister'.",

Despite the fact that its hard to watch Lohan pole dancing, i mean after seeing her in parent trap as a kid and all cute, the movie was just awful. The plot was off, and when you though there was something more after an important scene, it just went downhill into who knows what. The gruesome scenes where very graphic. I honestly wouldn't even recommend renting it for 1$, you might as well ask another poor soul that wasted 1 hr and 42 min watching this movie, about the ending. I can understand why people were laughing, sadly i couldn't join them because i was too busy thinking, \"what on earth is going on?\" I've seen a few of these actors on screen before and they weren't that bad, but this movie just made them look like they didn't know how to act. Although stories are usually suppose to move somewhat quick into their plots, this one just jumped the grand canyon.",

Firstly, I'm not a fan of LH, the only film she actually manages to ACT in is Prairie Home Companion, but I don't have any prejudice against her, either. Secondly, I listened to the critics, which is something I never normally do but the reviews were so universally scathing that I couldn't ignore them.Unfortunately the critics were right.This movie defies all known parameters of logic: A baby sold in a hospital by her crack addled mother and taken from her twin sister at birth; twin knows of other's existence despite never having met her; victim figures out who the killer is despite absolutely no evidence pointing in his direction; etc, etc. I could go on but I won't.The direction is wooden; the acting more so, and the art direction is clich\u00e9d to the point of sleep inducing.Personally, I have no idea how anyone could like this movie.

As we were walking out of the theater, wondering what just happened, even two elderly ladies that had been sitting behind us said \"No wonder she drinks so much! Awful acting, plot holes, just horrible. In fact, it's kind of like a biopic on Linday Lohan's crumbling life.I'm sitting here at a loss for words, trying to figure out how to best describe having lost 2 hours of my life. I'll just point out some of my favorite parts: *The color blue. EVERYWHERE. Tacky roses, bright blue gloves shared by the murderer and the police, blue glass weapons, the list goes on... *The fact that Aubrey is made to be such a good girl yet one of the first things out of her mouth is \"I'm done f**king guys I don't care about\" *Dakota seeing the \"blue man\" while at the bus stop, but he jumps from place to place without actually moving. *Dakota's fingers shrivel up & fall off, but she refuses to go to the hospital because she doesn't have health insurance? And goes about her merry way dancing & hanging out at home? What!? *Dakota figuring out the tie between the murdered girl & Aubrey - just by seeing trophies *Dakota's magical epiphany that explains the mistaken identity - \"your daughter died in the incubator so you bought me from a crack head down the hall!\" - WHAT? *The image of Aubrey getting beaten appearing to Dakota in a misty haze in her bedroom *The father entering the bad guy's house just moments before Dakota finds him lying in a tub of his own blood. *The expression on the bad guy's face as Dakota shoves a glass spiral into his neck *Dakota & Aubrey lying on the ground, cuddling, after Dakota rescues Aubrey from her living grave - which she found randomly in the middle of the woods? Oh, and Aubrey lifting her \"veil\" when Dakota breaks the glass - wouldn't she have already done that??Oh, there are many more, but I'll spare you. The only part of the movie that I liked was watching Aubrey's mom freak out while she hears (clear as day) Dakota f**king Aubrey's boyfriend upstairs. I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie if you want a good laugh, or if you're just intrigued by the mess that is Lindsay Lohan. If you're looking to catch a good flick, this is not the one you want to see.",

I could have picked this one up but downloaded it because I had travel plans and wanted something on my MP4 player.It was $1 well saved.I read some of the reviews here, one of which was written by someone who thought this was an ironic side swipe at the slasher/gore genre.Sorry, but it wasn't. It's pretty clear that this movie was made in all seriousness and is intended to be a gory thriller with a twist ending. I will happily concede that the twist was interesting enough and not one I suspected.But the rest of the movie is just not good. Lohan does a better job as Dakota than she does as Aubrey, but she doesn't have much to work with in terms of character or script. As most others here have said, the killer's identity is clear almost from the get go. The blue motif is insanely heavy handed. Julia Ormond and Where Have I Seen Him Before are both accomplished actors with good reputations and I really don't know what they are doing here. Maybe the producers spent the writers budget getting these actors on board.But in all fairness, this really isn't the worst movie ever made. It is pretty bad, and a little disgusting in parts, poorly scripted, lacking direction and only adequately acted. I think it might appeal to someone around 14 or 15 who wants to be grossed out and maybe a little scared, but to be honest, I think that 14 and 15 year olds are more discerning.Anyway, my advice would be to leave this one alone. It fails to deliver on so many levels.",

            "content": "I saw this movie last year with three friends on the Saturday night of it's opening weekend. Every weekend we go to a movie and that weekend we picked \"I Know Who Killed Me\" because a fourth friend, who's a big Simpsons fan, couldn't make it so we decided we'd wait a week to see that movie so we can see it with him. The theater's filling for \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was moderate probably because Lohan didn't actually promote it (meaning on talk shows, she was rather in the news because of the then recent meltdown) and because it was a R-rated Horror movie with a big blockbuster film opening on the same day (\"The Simpsons Movie\"). That said, I don't think that this movie was that bad. I'm certainly not a \"fan\" of this movie nor would I purchase it, however it certainly wouldn't have been nominated for all those Razzies if it wasn't for Lohan's disastrous period of time right before the film's opening (certainly they only gave two Razzies for one category {\"Worst Actress\"} because off Lohan's meltdown, \"Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie\" wasn't even a category last year, and a screen couple with herself is ridiculous). Personally, I think the worst movie of 2007 was \"Norbit\", closely followed by \"Captivity\" and \"The Number 23\", then \"Epic Movie.\" \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is about a young woman named Aubrey Fleming (played by Lindsay Lohan), a talented pianist and aspiring writer, disappears without a trace. Then one night, a driver discovers a young woman by the side of the road, disheveled and critically injured. The girl is rushed to the hospital where Aubrey's parents, Susan (played by Julia Ormond) and Daniel (played by Neal McDonough), wait by her side. When Aubrey is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a stripper named Dakota Moss. Terrified and confused, she starts seeing visions of a figure slowly butchering his captive which later leads to a frantic hunt for the menace.\"I Know Who Killed Me\" was extremely weird, yes, and the acting was mediocre. There were some scary scenes and intense images. The plot wasn't amazing, but certainly more than \"torture porn\" \u0096 and remember, it's a horror movie, you don't expect an incredible plot line when you go see a horror movie. Some say the ending was confusing, and I agree that it was, but I like that out of a thriller/horror film - it makes you think more about the mystery. A couple people on the board, just like many other movie boards, love to rant and say that this was the worst movie ever, but it definitely was not. The main reason why the movie did they way it did in the box office was because of the big blockbuster ''The Simpsons Movie'' releasing on the same day. In my opinion, to say this movie is the worst ever is really rather foolish because I can't forget these movies: Batman and Robin (1997) with Clooney, Schwarzenegger, & Thurman ($125 million budget) Battlefield Earth (2000) with Travolta, Whitaker, & Pepper ($75 million budget) The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002) with Murphy ($100 million budget) Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) with Liu and Banderas ($70 million budget) Gigli (2003) with Affleck, Lopez, Pacino & Walken ($54 million budget) Twisted (2004) with Judd, Jackson,& Garcia ($50 million budget) Catwoman (2004) with Berry, Stone, Bratt, & Conroy ($100 million budget) Alone in the Dark (2005) with Slater ($20 million budget) Material Girls (2006) with the Duff sisters (unknown budget) Zoom (2006) with Allen & Chase ($35 million budget) Epic Movie (2007) with Coolidge & Hammond ($20 million budget) Captivity (2007) with Cuthbert (unknown budget) Norbit (2007) with Murphy ($65 million budget) The Number 23 (2007) with Carrey & Madsen ($30 million budget) Meet the Spartans (2008) with Electra & Davitian ($30 million budget) All of those movies' budgets were larger than \"I Know Who Killed Me\" \u0096 many of them over 6 times as large (IKWKM's budget was only $12 million, by the way) yet I still would rather watch \"I Know Who Killed Me\" over them. Go and rent this movie if you're curious about it, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is an above average thriller, that's my opinion anyway.",

            "content": "\"She has a trick. She knew how to turn her life into a movie and watch things happen.\" That's the metaphor Aubrey Fleming uses to describe her character to her writing class; a tortured girl who has had to deal with a lot of suffering in her life. It's also the perfect metaphor for the movie I Know Who Killed Me as a whole. The movie keeps the audience at arm's length, never engaging them with the story or characters. The result is a wholly unsatisfying experience. The movie immediately introduces us to three versions of Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan). The picture opens with her at a strip club, pole dancing. Then we see Aubrey presenting her writing to a class. Finally we see Aubrey playing the piano, something she is giving up to make more time for her writing. Aubrey, it would appear, is a multi-faceted girl. She has a boyfriend she refuses to concede physically to, friends she hangs out with, the works. Overall, she has a pretty good life. Then one day, she disappears. The disappearance comes right on the heels of another girl, one of Aubrey's classmates, having been abducted and murdered. Weeks later, Aubrey reappears, claiming instead to be Dakota Moss, a poor girl raised by a crack-addicted mother who had to turn to stripping to pay the bills. At this point you're supposed to be all sorts of curious. Is this girl really Aubrey or is she a different girl, as she claims. The problem is, the movie never gives you any reason to believe Lohan's character isn't the abducted girl. Aubrey wrote about Dakota, right down to an image we see happen on screen with a truck passing her by as she hitchhikes. She also has injuries identical to the previous girl who was murdered \u0096 her right arm and leg have been severed. The primary way Dakota differentiates herself drastically from Aubrey is that she says \"f***\" a lot. No, there's no reason to believe Dakota is anything but Aubrey escaping into an invented character, regardless of how the story suddenly takes an odd turn and starts making the audience think about identical twins, switched babies, and twin stigmata. The movie is permeated with the color blue. The overuse of blue (down to everyone having blue eyes) is yet another reason to believe Dakota isn't real. She prefers to dress in red. That's right, she's a red girl in a world of blue. It has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. While the story wants the audience to start to think Dakota is telling the truth, the visuals are immediately driving the audience to realize she doesn't fit. Along with the audience, the characters are also unwilling to give Dakota the benefit of the doubt. Mind you, these are characters like the boyfriend who cries tears in an exaggerated expression of guilt and relief at Aubrey's safe return (that had most of the audience laughing at him) one minute, and then is f***ing her brains out the next. I guess he gets over her lost limbs and the fact he was supposed to be protecting her really quickly. And the mother who is trying to help her little girl recover, but stays in the kitchen tormented as she listens to Dakota screwing the hell out of her boyfriend - something Aubrey wouldn't do. Real realistic characters here, I tell you. Since the story keeps the audience at a distance, never really putting together the reality that Dakota could be telling the truth, the movie has to make some gesture to captivate the audience. That gesture is gore \u0096 lots of it, as we get a few torture sequences of what happened to Aubrey while she was abducted, from freezing off her fingers and hand to cutting her with (what else) crystalline blue instruments. But if this is a psychological thriller, why do we need the gore? The sequences reminded me how much more effective Michael Madson's torture of the officer was in Reservoir Dogs. We knew what was happening, so we didn't need to see it. Here they have to toss the visuals in, because the story has nothing else to offer. I Know Who Killed Me isn't captivating enough or deep enough to be considered a psychological thriller. It doesn't make a case well enough to be much of a mystery. Instead it's two hours of Lindsay Lohan trying to convince the audience and the other characters she's someone that everything says she isn't. Even the stripper sequences are painful to watch, with more eroticism coming from the archaic crack-w*****. This is the girl who did so well in Mean Girls but hasn't done much since to live up to that promise. Fortunately, it looks like her real life may eclipse this sad chapter of her career. Maybe she can get out of that by claiming to be her own twin sister too. Why not let life imitate art... if you can call this art.",

Its pretty bad.The storyline stretches the boundaries of believability, the acting neither here no there, not terrible but not great by any stretch. Its just the storyline and script itself, with both of these gut wrenchingly awful.It really is a strange mix and I found myself wincing listening to some of the dialogue and thinking just how ludicrous the whole premise is.Characters come and go, say a few horribly scripted lines and then disappear, quite why they are in it or where they get to is anbody's guess.What on earth happened to Julia Ormond, she was in a very good film called Legends of the fall and then she is reduced to appearing in guff like this? The whole film just feels like a straight to video Van damme or Seagal offering but with a better class of actors.

The film was only made because of the pole dancing scenes which where probably the best of the film. The fascination with blue and red became annoying and the film I did not understand from time to time. I do not know why Lindsay signed on for the film but they must have offered her a large paycheck. I attempted to like this film but it was just too confusing and bad.This film is definitely another afternoon thriller film.",

Oh, it was late, I was drunk, half asleep, and I didn't really know what I was doing ... Okay, so literally none of that happened. I was quite sober, with some friends one evening, and we decided to rent it. BIG mistake. HUGE mistake. COLOSSAL mistake. I think you get the picture.When a girl is found on the side of a road one night, apparently having survived a harrowing ordeal, the parents of the girl (Lindsay Lohan) arrive to the hospital to anxiously wait by her side as she recovers. They believe she is the escaped victim of a serial killer still at large, but when she regains consciousness, she insists that she is not who they think she is. That her name is not Aubrey, but rather Dakota ... and that she is a stripper, not their daughter. She has visions that lead her down a dark path, to where she believes the serial killer may live resulting in what was supposed to be a shocking revelation.By movie's end, all of us were shaking our heads and sighing with annoyance. It was poorly shot, the plot was ridiculous and just got worse as it continued, the ending was so absurd that I couldn't even believe what they were trying to pass off on us, the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen, and there were absolutely no real thrills in it. The only good thing I could find in this film was the use of color, especially the color blue. But ... that is it.My only recommendation here is to avoid at all costs. You will actually feel stupid and cheated for having watched it. Not even the most die hard fan of Lindsay Lohan could appreciate this debacle. I am so surprised with Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough (usually appearing in good films) for accepting these roles. 1 star out of 10.",

While the actors themselves did a pretty good job, the writers and directors destroyed any chance the film had of success. And who can forget the holes?

For example, the psychiatrist gives up by calling the patient \"delusional\", something that no respected psychiatrist would ever do. Simple, easy outs that the writers used to move the story along.

Meanwhile, her twin sister, Dakota Moss (also Lohan) wakes up in a hospital and discovers mysterious wounds on her right hand and right leg, before solving the mystery of her killer, Aubrey's piano tutor Mr. Norquist. Atop of the recycled murder mystery plot, those ridiculous blue operating tools, the goofy gore scenes, and the ludicrously preposterous twin stigmata syndrome, here are some of the billion plot holes that earned I Know Who Killed Me its eight Razzies. If Aubrey was buried during the investigation, then why isn't Dakota slowly rotting away like real corpses? In fact, wouldn't she be out of breath by the time she got to the killer's house? For that matter, if Aubrey and Dakota are twins, how could their parents (Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough) not recognize her when Dakota walked in? How did Aubrey's dad end up from the cemetery to a coffin in the killer's lab within ten minutes? If the impact of one twin affects another twin, did Aubrey feel anything down there when Dakota had sex with her boyfriend Jerrod (Brian Geraghty)? And most importantly, why aren't the FBI agents brought into the case again even after Norquist died? I Know Who Killed Me is an extremely stupid movie with not much thrills and a lot more laughs.

Lindsay Lohan plays Aubrey a sweet young girl who gets kidnapped by a limb-cutting psycho. She actually remembers to act here, seriously, in most of the film Lindsay creates two memorable and different characters. Granted, there are a couple moments where she looks like she's waiting for a line to be read, but for the most part she did well. For those who care, Lindsay does show some skin here, and if you have any imagination you'll be seeing all of lovely Lindsay there is.This is a very dark, read gory, twisty thriller that actually does leave you guessing till the final frame. Honeslty, I'm not normally fooled by this stuff, but this one was interesting. The essential twist is rather hard to swallow, but still. The Director did a good job with color and little habits that if you pay attention, reveal the plot. I won't spoil it for you, cept to say they leave just enough unexplained to be interesting, but not unsatisfying. Of the supporting cast only Julia Ormond stands out as Aubrey's mom. She has really improved as an actress. Remember how stiff she was in \"Legends of the Fall\"? She nearly killed a great picture there. Here she's much better, particularly in the scene where Aubrey takes her boyfriend up to her room. Mom lets it happen, hoping it will trigger her daughter's memory. Julia does a nice job trying to show a Mom not wanting to hear her child in the throws of passion, yet hoping to hear a mental breakthrough. Cool scene for Lindsay fans too.I'm not saying this was great but for comparison shoppers this was ten times better than \"In the Cut\" with a puffy-lipped Meg Ryan. That was nasty with no reason. This had reasons, and if they were hard to believe, is life any stranger? I admit Lindsay probably did this just to show, \"See I'm not a child-star anymore! I can say the f-word and everything!\" but the movie was good. I recommend this for horror/mystery fans and anyone with a crush on the Lindsay. Heck, I'd watch it again just to look for goof in the complex plot!",

Now I have been reading a lot of reviews that claim that people are slamming this movie because of Lindsey Lohan's recent escapades. Ed Wood was a messed up guy, but that didn't make his films good. This movie deserves to be slammed by the critics, slammed by the box office, and the DVD's should be thrown away. I say this because this is the worst type of bad movie. It is a movie made for the sole reason of making itself seem smart, and it isn't. The acting was sub-par, the plot was garbled and messy at best, and then cinematography, while made pretty by red and blue flashes was destroyed by the fact that scenes were chopped up into tiny pieces and thrown together in a way that seemed almost random. There are some movies that are funny because of how bad they are, but this movie was just painful to watch, especially in the bloody parts where it imitate a slasher (which it did in an almost laughable fashion). When the movie started I knew it was going to try to seem smarter than it was, by the middle I had a headache from the bad acting and ridiculous story line, and the stupid, out of the blue ending couldn't come soon enough. I hated every minute of this movie which, if I were an idiot killer with no back-story and a fetish with blue glass knives (I didn't know piano teachers also blew glass) I would torture my victims by making them watch it.",

(Children's price no less, there was no way I was paying $10 for this movie, thank you ticket kiosks!) I had a feeling just from looking at the stills and reading the plot that this was going to be cheesy, melodramatic and a little over the top.I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed! There isn't really any emotional depth to any of the characters, and Lindsay comes off as nothing more than yet another angry teenagers with a bit of brains in her head. Not a surprise. The movie is fairly slow paced, and for the way they set it up in the preview, it's a lot more dramatic than mystery or horror inducing until maybe the last 15 to 20 minutes.Of course, the real reason anyone is going to see this is to see her \"strip\", see her get all hacked up, and the lauded sex scene. Sorry boys, you don't get to see much. The sex scene is very ill placed, in fact it's not even necessary and the entire audience was in stitches by the time it was through. She does get naked, but you get the back and nothing more. And no, there is no stripping, she's just twirling around a pole a couple dozen times. Wow, that must have been quite a workout. However did you pull this off, Lilo??? The camera-work was interesting though, and it's why I say this has the makings of a great B movie, horrendous plot, completely transparent plot twists, and obvious ending aside. More than half the movie looks as though it was shot with a basic camcorder that you can find at your local Best Buy. The torture scenes are great, pretty graphic, and help add to the whole \"B horror grindhouse movie\" appeal that this could possibly generate in the future.There are very few scary parts and you're more likely to come out of the theater with great albeit sore from laughing abs than you are shaking in terror. So honestly, if you're looking for a good movie to not take seriously or just looking for a movie that'll kill time - I'd recommend you go see this.",

How many of them have a personal animus against Lindsay Lohan? Of course, I don't know, but my guess is that many of them are reacting to what is happening in Miss Lohan's off-stage life and are piling on with the bile and venom, kicking her when she's down; how chivalrous of them. Yes, Yes, YES, I know her personal life is a shambles, and I really do hope that she can turn things around, and if she doesn't, she will have no one to blame but herself. That being said, her personal troubles don't automatically sentence this movie to the rubble heap. I have seen this movie three times already, and I feel it is artistic in a very dark, chilling way--but hey, it's a horror film; it's supposed to be that way! Helloooooo!Reviewers have been talking about plot holes and ridiculousness; don't most horror movies have a measure of this (a murdering doll named Chucky? vampires in Alaska, coming soon to a theater near you?) Horror films require us to suspend belief in one way or another--heck, lots of other film genres require that, as well! Why all the bile for this film? (Oh, and let's not forget a little 1960's sci-fi TV series called \"The Twilight Zone\"; certainly no plot holes or reality suspension there!) I must admit that I probably would not have seen this film except for the fact that Miss Lohan stars in it, since I'm not in the habit of seeing horror films. Yes, I have a bias, and I am putting it out in the open, which is more than most commentators I've seen have done. As far as I see, Lohan has an intenseness and a force about her that few other actresses have, an earthy, in-your-face kind of energy that other actresses don't possess, as far as I'm concerned (and I realize her major problem is how to control that energy off-camera). This was a gutsy film choice for her to make, considering the subject matter and, of course, the fact that she didn't know how it would be received. She really went out on a limb on this movie--and yes, I know, people will be snickering that she sawed the limb off behind her-- and made an artistic choice, and, well, what can I say? Art is in the eye of the beholder, and this particular piece of art is disturbing, scary, dark, bloody, and so forth, but so what? It's supposed to be! I do realize that those reviewers, both amateur and \"professional\" (as if having a journalism degree and a job at a paper makes someone's opinion somehow more worthy than anyone else's) who laughed at or ridiculed this film are entitled to their opinions, but frankly, I can't see where they're coming from, and I don't share their venom and bile.

Usually I just ignore it, if I'm not in the mood to actually analyse the film properly. When I started watching I Know Who Killed Me, I first thought how weird the use of colour blue was sometimes. It was effective, but sometimes slightly annoying and weird. But since the colour was used so lot, alongside with the colour red, it was clear that there was some kind of meaning to that colour. Those are some strong colours, which affect the visual side of the movie a lot. They look extremely beautiful, but because of the ominousness of the film it was clear they weren't just colours this time.When I read the quick summary on Netflix, I actually thought the roles would be reversed: that the girl who disappeared would wake up in an identical body but have a completely different life. That version would be also interesting, since this way seems typical. It makes it seems that the girl who disappeared, Aubrey, had two personalities, or she's suffering from amnesia. I don't know if the approach the film makers took was original, since they built it in the way it became predictable. This movie is mostly easy to follow, apart from a certain flashback. It feels like the movie just took another turn without any warning, and it doesn't even make any sense. Well, once the flashback is over it's easy to understand what had just happened. Still, it was quite a long flashback without any kind of warning - or did I just miss it? That's possible too.While I enjoyed the visual side of this movie, and Lindsay Lohan as an actress, the story just doesn't do it for me. It has a lot to offer, but that just seems to go down the drain. It's intriguing, but something is missing. It's thrilling, but not enough. The characters are interesting only on the surface, it doesn't feel like there's a lot under their skin. This film has serious Twin Peaks (and David Lynch in general) vibes, but they don't feel as true as whatever Lynch does. I feel like it's good to see this film once if you're interested in it, but it definitely isn't a movie everyone should see. You can live your life happily never seeing this film.

First I will write mine...\nI can see this movie seems to have received a terrible overall score on this site, and a brief look at Wikipedia tells me it had a derisive response. Well, all this is undeserved.I saw this film on TV late at night in Australia, it was labeled here as \"horror\": perhaps so, dunno: it wasn't scary, this movie seems to transcend genre. I won't delve into the plot - others have done this for me. As for genre - this movie seems to move between psychedelic and some implicit sci-fi. The blue roses that crop up in the story: they don't exist in nature, and if they can be bred - probably are not cheap. The dual Fleming/Moss character is badly mutilated pretty much at the onset, and receives bionic prosthetics that seem to be gleefully taken for granted in the film - but do not exist in reality. And this entire plot is entirely set in our reality, not in some alternate sci-fi world.I loved Lindsay Lohan's and Julia Ormond's performances. Ormond's beauty was very much tempered down for this movie.I will see this again if I have a chance.",

It's a real shame that people can't see this movie for what it is.

But it did have n original twist to the whole plot that was not divulged to the end. What it did have was a poor script and bad supporting actors, thogh Lindsey Lohan and Julie Ormond did turn in okay performances. The technique was film schoolish, with blue for the good rich girl Aubrey and red for the stripper Dakota, Lindsay's two alter egos. It had lots of cgi enhancement which was mostly distracting though it did have some promise, maybe with more experience. Plotwise, there is this sadistic serial killer who loves to kidnap and dismember girls in the now classic torture room set. That resulted in gratuitous gore which played against the rest of the film which tried to be a serious FBI trying to catch the crazed killer before he does worse. It was clich\u00e9 ridden though it did have an original sort of paranormal plot twist: non religious sympathetic stigmata between twins or some crap like that. This was revealed in a very cheezy documentary clip, allegedly from the internet, of an elephant eared, cigarette smoking Art Bell narrating the plot key on some internet movie file. That was worth a couple laughs. It looked more like some of the trashier faux documentaries from the History Channel. Inspite of all the glaring defects, and cheezy exploitation crap like Lohan poledancing and one tawdry crippled sex scene, it was a tolerable waste of time, providing you see it for free and expect little",

            "content": "With shades of David Lynch, I Know Who Killed Me is more appropriately described as an intriguing and beautifully shot presentation of motifs rather than a conventional thriller. It begins with Lindsay Lohan kissing her wholesome Disney reputation goodbye by pole-dancing for drooling onlookers in a seedy bar (there are a few of these gratuitous scenes) and for reasons such as this the film has been critically mauled and sent straight to DVD in the UK. There's certainly plenty to laugh at if you're in the mood, but I'd argue director Chris Sivertson's unconventional drama/thriller is a rewarding experience if you indulge in its eccentricities. Placing more emphasis on the colour blue than any character development, it's the tale of a kidnapped girl who emerges from a torturous ordeal with a new personality and name. Is she insane? Is the story merely a metaphor? Was Lindsay Lohan cut out for such a challenging role? All these are questions the film poses. It's a puzzle that once figured out is arguably satisfying. Lohan plays a stripper with bionic limbs and who wouldn't laugh at such a concept. But to mock its lunacy is to miss the point entirely. I Know Who Killed Me, if the title weren't enough of an indication, is entirely tongue-in-cheek. Sivertson even throws in a comical sex scene half way through to drive that point home, though I question that particular decision.Sivertson asks us to accept absurdity and embrace horror and drama equally. Neither as impenetrably dull as an art film or as passively mainstream as a typical Hollywood thriller, his film is both beautiful and brutal, an attempt to unify opposites. This is a film that has multiple levels and pleas for deconstruction. Overwhelming motifs and unpredictable plot developments are used to derail a conventional whodunit to create a self-conscious independent film which like Revolver (2005), The Fountain (2006) and Southland Tales (2006) defies the expectations of a conventional star vehicle. Perhaps even the writhing, freckled form of the former child star herself is a comment on society's obsession with youth and celebrity.",

This is a good thriller. The story-line is a bit surprising at times, when you don't overthink it. Sure, if you really try and think about all the possibilities you will have figured it out before you've seen half the movie, but be honest: which movie has surprises for the seasoned movie goer?And while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act. Most negatives here are cheap shots at LL's behaviour outside the film, or stock replies like bad-bad-bad or morons who went to see this expecting the gore from Saw and Hostel, I mean, how stupid can you get?I kinda hated Ormond though, I don't see why she had to speak in that awful accent.The only thing what was a bit disappointing was the actual identity of the killer. But hey, you can't have it all. And Lindsay shouldn't do stripper like roles with the reputation she's got.

The FBI agents were really bad, yelling at LiLo and stuff when by all logic they should have been treating her as a victim. And then they just disappear from the story. By the time LiLo actually works out who the killer is, the FBI are nowhere to be seen.The movie actually had some interesting plot twists, but then plays them totally low-key, like they don't even matter. Like when LiLo randomly stumbles across \"stigmatic twins\" when she's surfing the internet (must have been because she used some random search engine no one's ever heard of).

But I loved that it was hard for me to figure out.The best indication of how successful the script writer was is that the comments from the people he was attempting to entertain show such knowledge of films, create such beautiful turns of phrases, and OMG even use \"correct grammar\", etc., etc. But I think I understand what the writer was trying to provide for all of us who were this strongly affected by the movie.First of all, a writer needs to select an audience, and this guy sure picked a doozy of one. It must be the hardest audience to try to entertain. It takes one to know one, so he must be like all the others of us who have written comments (I'm basing this claim upon having skimmed 20 comments). I believe that his script was aimed at the minds of everyone who can almost always anticipate a minimum of 90% of the \"twists and turns\" in any plot and often even the exact dialog that will appear on the screen within the next 15 seconds to 120 minutes or so.It's so easy to watch a movie and roll your eyes because the people who collaborated on a script weren't as empathic, intelligent, creative, or nontraditional as you are.But for someone to actually be this successful in touching the most untouchable audience of all with his first movie script... well, we all better keep our eye on this guy.Oh, and although I could hammer so many aspects of the film, I LOVED that in my case my usual ability to predict what would come next dropped from 90+ to maybe 20%.There is nobody in an audience as sophisticated as this who hasn't known all their lives about the basic concept underlying this movie. But ask your self this... what might the movie have been like if a scriptwriter like this hadn't written it? Would the surprising impact this script had upon you have inspired you to leave any comment whatsoever?",

I'm not a Lindsay lohan fan but for this movie to flop is a shame as it was a well chosen cast and this film let lindsay show some more real and raws emotions this is far better than any of her other movies as she actually shows a well acted actress using her talents at her possible best specially the torture scenes they genuinely look real and well played you do in fact get a sense of fear and sympathy for the Aubrey character. the only scene i have doubts in were the whole stigmata story line it needed to explain that a bit more to fully understand why as not everyone understands about stigmata or twin connections but overall this movie is a 9/10. far better than anything i have seen miss lohan in and her best role to date also, if she were to do more of this styled work not aimed for 10 year olds i think she could make a name and be taken as a far more serious actress. see the movie your self and judge it by what you see and not what you've heard about it.",

            "content": "As if LiLo hadn't encountered enough trouble this week, \"I know who killed me\" opened. While the movie managed to be quite humorous at times, it fails to entice the viewer with its twisted plot. It's obvious that LiLo tried to get away from the teenage audience in this rated R film, however, the movie is bound to be the inspiration of many jokes and spoofs.It would have been an okay movie, if the supernatural had not played a part in it. It is easier to comprehend and appreciate an actress who plays a character with split personality, rather than reprise her role from \"The Parent Trap\" almost 10 years later.The use of the color blue is far too much in this movie. While the importance of the color is revealed in the end and ties in beautifully with LiLo's two characters, the color is literally shoved in ones face throughout the movie. Be ready to experience blue to its fullest effects in this film.I'm the first to admit that I am a huge fan of LiLo and that I went to see the movie to show my support for her. While the film has some shock worthy scenes, good twists, and a fresh feel, in the end the movie is almost too absurd. However, LiLo manages to stay strong throughout the movie and shows that she can act, no matter what cheesy lines are given to her.It's not one of the must see movies of the summer, hence it is cheaper to rent it on DVD and see it in the own comfort of your home. Better luck next time LiLo.",

            "content": "OK. I think that I am the only who think this movie is fantastic. I wanted to watch it because I found the title interesting but queer. And I wanted to watch Lindsay Lohan playing in a scary movie. I think everybody's problem with this film is that it is a kind of lashed- together movie. It looks like the creators felt confused the story-line, and they did not want to spend any time to make it perfect and understandable. Therefore it has a lot of holes and black spots which could not be clear for everyone but who wants to know them.The movie and the story themselves are very original. It is classed as a horror film but it's not. It does have violent and brutal elements but the attention isn't focused on them. This is just a little part of it. And not the most essential. The emotions do build up this film. A dreamy, young writers emotions.I like the red-blue contrast, which symbolize many things during the whole movie. Between Aubrey and Dakota. I like very much their sharp oppositions. And yes - somewhere I read this - Lindsay was the only who understand this movie and her character/characters. She plays fantastic. She does not care anything, just jumps into these girls' bodies and enjoys acting.I watched it the second time when I felt again this empty feeling, caused by the black-spots it has. I think if I hadn't been so impatient to understand it I could have found out the answer, the message by myself. But of course it can just be a theory. My theory. And I think these films are the best which make you thinking after having watched. And the answer is your choice.**-- MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --**It is a sad story. Not sad indeed. Tragic. A young girls imaginations while being tortured to death. Aubrey loves writing stories, and made Dakota Moss - an identical twin sister, who helps her when she needs. And in this case she needed help. She was alone, and somebody - whose identity she never found out - was torturing her. She just imagined how Dakota rescues her, and supposed that her killer is the piano teacher because of the blue-razors. But what about the gardener guy? Who is he? Why did he get a part in this story. He actually \"did not do anything\". But I think he did so. He is the actual killer, but Aubrey never could see his dark face. Before having kidnapped Aubrey saw the gardener guy, and she hid behind a tree. He was there. And what about the anticipations Dakota had? She saw everywhere a dark man who followed her. And the police? They read her story on the notebook, where everything which happened to Dakota had already been written. It is not a science fiction where the girl know the future from the first time. And I feel this movie a kind of drama, not a horror.Aubrey had never found out her real killer. The whole movie was her story, like a fairy tale in blue and red with blood and pain. Her last story she wanted to tell which I think she told as beautiful as she could. Then finally when the two halves found each other in her heart, Aubrey passed away from this world for ever. And her story can have the title \"I Know Who Killed Me\".",

Well, finally I rented it when it came to DVD 11/27/2007, to be honest I didn't think that it was that bad! It was a little over the top at times, other times jumpy & left me head scratching & saying \"huh?\", but by the end of it I was like \"Wow, it wasn't \"that\" bad\" (trust me there are worst films out there I.E. \"Rob Zombies's Halloween\")! Say what you will about Lindsay Lohan's erratic and admittedly sad recent troubles with the law, but her mature, poignant performance in \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is the latest proof that the girl has talent. I believe in the hands of a more capable director, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" could have been a lot better film. Yes, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was gory at times, other times a little off and incoherent at times (What was with all the Blue\" color\" through out??), & to me the film had a David Lynch feel to it. But by time the end credits rolled around I said to my partner: \"Yes the story was preposterous even by the standards of the thriller genre, but still the story's developments were unpredictable and certainly intriguing. When the ending comes, & you discover who the killer is, I found myself saying \"I would never have guessed that\"!! Yes the ending leaves you puzzled, but I think that is what the director intentions were. I believe that the director wanted each viewer to draw there own conclusions. Yes there are plot holes, & certain things that need to be tighted within the script, but as a whole the film works! My conclusion: \"I Know Who Killed Me\" wasn't \"THAT\" predictable &/or \"THAT BAD\"!. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" will find an audience, maybe not today, not tomorrow but somewhere. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" will become in years from now a cult film. We both gave the film a C+ (We were mixed between a B- & C+)",

For others, I remain convinced that the bad reviews and ratings are just for the hate to Lindsay Lohan.Lindsay Lohan, who nevertheless is doing very well here, even if another actress could play the role, and it's almost assumed that the critics would have flipped. However, I sincerely believe that the choice of Lindsay's a good idea, so may have noted that \"his\" role suits him like a glove.Come in the film and its inspirations, inspirations coming from as well as the \"Giallo,\" the great Brian DePalma, with a dose of Hitchcock. It gets worse as an influence, right? So if you like \"Giallo,\" DePalma, Hitchcock, and film of the 70s, do not miss out above and given a chance or second chance (for another) to the film.Still on the film, I will also mention the atmosphere particularly disturbing (Again if you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be served). So much blood flows here, so not a single \"Thriller\" formatted as many, sometimes these bloody scenes are also quite challenging.Challenging, certainly, but still used mostly in the plot.The unfolding of the plot, which frankly attracted by its influences so, but because as I said before the film is not formatted it is not heated or otherwise seen.At least to what is seen in recent years.By cons, it's a little more final, which some compared to the entire film. If the final (even if it is not what it is worse in final) had reached the level of the rest of the film, there was a small masterpiece.In short, this film did not deserve a Razzie, so in the year 2007, it must have been much worse and much more formatted, on the big screen.",

However, I think that's because as the movie progresses the plot just falls apart leaving the actors with little motivation to make their parts work. Trust me, by the time you figure out what is going on you just roll your eyes and think, \"Whatever.\" There are some extremely gruesome scenes. The sad part is though, the audience laughed at some of the more gross/intense scenes. Why? Because they are stupid and totally improbable.

I don't think it is AS BAD as the rating says, but it definitely lands somewhere in between an ok thriller/horror and a bad B-movie. Props for it being pretty stylish and having a clear visual sense and point of view, and I appreciate seeing Lindsay in a darker and more artistic movie like this.The main story itself is interesting enough, and the acting of all characters is pretty solid IMO, especially Lindsay does a better job than she gets credit for. However, the writing (such as the kidnapping of Audrey), storytelling, pacing and editing is all over the place/lacking. It's a little hard to follow the story and timeline, and some important details are skipped over, so the story makes less sense.It's unnecessarily brutal and bloody at times which really isn't for me, but the part that just makes absolutely no sense and makes the whole movie stupid is the stigmata thing. It's completely unrealistic that the exact same physical thing that happens to Aubrey happens to Dakota. I would be very much into it if Dakota would experience a level of pain on the same places at the same time as Aubrey, because I believe that twins can tap into eachothers feelings in a similar way and it would make for an interesting story, but to the level of actually losing her leg, arm, finger etc is just plain stupid. Also the reveal of the killer is beyond predictable. I really wish they went with a more surprising character, or even a stranger.Overall it's not a movie I recommend, but it would be a pretty solid one if they changed up the things that made it stupid. It would be so easy not to make it THAT stupid!",

At the start of the film, I expected it to be absolutely terrible. I Know Who Killed Me swept the floor at the infamous Razzie Awards. Also, everyone I know who saw it said it was terrible. Half way through the film however, I asked myself how could this be called the WORST movie of the year? I agree it was poorly written; but, Lindsay Lohan didn't do a bad job. It was also very gruesome, something I don't usually go for, but most of the bloody parts were very real looking. I Know Who Killed Me, kept me guessing the whole. I wanted to know if Dakota was really Audrey or if they were twins, or what. Unfortunately, it was written so badly that the film often became confusing. And instead of helping the audience in their quest to figure out the mystery of Dakota and Audrey, it made it harder. Nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone who likes Lindsay Lohan and anyone curious to see just how bad it was. I wouldn't say it was the best picture of the year, that's for sure; but, I wouldn't call it the worst either. I Know Who Killed Me could have been a lot better.

She just wasn't given very much to work with. The script is very weak. It appears to be trying to mimic the success of The Omen, with babies being purchased to fool mothers whose newborns have died. There are random shots of owls and the full moon. The attitude seems to be, \"I saw this in a different horror movie once, so I guess it's okay.\" Many shots also linger far too long on their subject, making the film very awkward to watch. It's also repetitive. I remember thinking, why are we back here? Didn't we see this exact same violent scene five minutes ago? It seemed as though the audience was supposed to receive some sort of satisfaction for watching Lindsay Lohan suffer. Elements of foreshadowing are so highlighted that it becomes obvious that they will be of significance later. This film has no concept of subtle. Also, I won't give away who the killer is, but I emitted an audible groan when Lindsay figured who it was. Scooby and the gang may have been excited to catch this criminal, but it wasn't worth of a Hollywood movie plot.All in all, I feel like Lindsay shouldn't have received the brunt of the bad press for this.

Credit where credit's due though, she does make a believable pole-dancer with daddy issues - although these scenes don't add anything extra to the plot or character asides from some prurient interest. That said you can't really do a completely convincing gritty strip-joint if you're not going to take your bra off and it might have helped elevate the film out of the generic teen/sleepover thriller category that its wound up in.What points the film earns for originality and intrigue it gives up pretty quickly at the end when it dissolves into a standard \"hero and killer chase in creepy setting\" until the latter is dispatched. A lot of plot features are wrapped up (or not) pretty quickly and inexpertly at the end and certain elements are left without much fleshing out; the killer's motivation for instance, although it isn't particularly relevant as he just serves as a tool for the rest of the story to hinge around. There's a particularly cheesy and cheap bit where our protagonist has a vision of her sister's demise in a mirror which also serves to blow the last bit of credibility out of the water.Could have been a pretty decent film in the right hands and with a different lead but possibly still worth a watch if you've got nothing else on and you fancy some untaxing prurient gore and grinding.",

MY first issue with this movie is how Lindsay portrays Audrey, the main character. She is supposed to be an honor roll, piano playing, creative writing, jock dating girl. It is just not believable. Lindsay did so amazing in Mean Girls, so I know show can play a non-trashy role. However, she was much more believable as straight out the slums stripper, Dakota. In the scenes following the finding of Audrey, NONE of the character's actions were believable. Not Audrey's, her \"parents\", the police, her boyfriend. Okay seriously, you just got home from the hospital with two amputated limbs, and the first thing you do is bang your boyfriend. And he wanted to? I know the guy wanted to get some, but no woman is going to get on top of you and start screwing your brains out like it's the end of the world, when you just lost two limbs, and have no idea who you are. Dakota was a total bitch to Audrey's parents. It was just a mess. The whole twist of the movie is a cool concept, but was played out just plain horrible. The gore scenes are pretty sickening. I definitely turned away at times. The whole blue thing going on throughout the movie was distracting. I am guessing the red and blue is refercing towards the whole twin thing. This movie should have had many things taken out, and many explanations added. Definitely needs better writing, directing, acting, just basically better everything.",

Yes, Lindsay Lohan DID suck, but she was not the sole reason for why this movie wasn't good. As you get deeper into the story (when I say deep, I do not mean that this is a \"deep\" movie, I mean it as you get farther into the movie) you come to find that the basis for why she doesn't know who the Hell the Aubry chick is, is just not probably possible. Why Lindsay Lohan #1 is this perfect girl that strives to become a writer (aka--the character that seemed to be a little bit too hard to play for the actress now). Lindsay Lohan #2 is supposedly the daughter of crack addicts and a stripper and is more believable because it wasn't a huge stretch from her real life.All is not lost in this movie, however. There are a few scenes that had some really strong moments. The one that truly struck out to me was the one with the mother (played by Julia Ormond who is the one lone spot of light in this dismal movie) and LL #2, basically most of all because LL didn't speak a lot during it. I felt for Julia Ormond as I saw her performing strongly next to LL who just failed.I give this 4 stars because of a plot that wasn't THAT bad, but the casting agent just couldn't find the actors that could pull it out. The acting is the main downfall to this movie, not the plot. True, the plot still has a good amount of holes in it, but it was terrible.",

When She manages to escape, the traumatized girl who regains consciousness in the hospital insists that her real identity is that of Dakota Moss, a stripper in a seedy club and that the real Aubrey is still in mortal danger.I definitely can understand why this movie won SO many razzies. Lindsay got worst actress....Come on guys! She wasn't that bad, I thought she was great in this movie.The idea for this movie is great, although they conveyed those ideas so wrongly, and in the confusing order. The storytelling attempted a \"Grudge-like\" storyline which made the initial plots very confusing. This films focuses on Identical twins who are in 2 different locations, the film doesn't explain which one is which,seeing as they are both introduced non-chronologically. There are also too many things going on at the same time. There's the stalker-killer guy plot, then the whole twin plot and then the self-bleeding wounds idea. To understand this complicated movie, you have to watch it over and over again. At first you will find this movie extremely boring, there are many scenes which are too long or pointless, which shouldve been either shortened or even deleted. After watching this around 7 times I have now learned to like it. I love its unique look that it holds, with colours of blue and red which pattern each scene, you will find that in every scene the colour blue is there, almost in every shot. The horror scenes contain gore as gross as Hostel. The soundtrack is amazing by the way!I Know Who Killed Me is such a good film, but has a few things wrong with it. This IS a good film, just give it a chance and be patient with the long boring scenes which separate the good parts. Ignore all the Razzies it won because trust me, I bet there are worse movies out there, with worse actors,directors and writers.",

Plus it deserves much more than 4.5 or whatever it has, because in comparison to the Saw Movies it is much better and those have more.I should probably write down the cons of this movie too, but that wouldn't help because it already has enough so I will skip that part.Over all I think this film is average, but is worth a look.

If anything this film is one to be loved or hated and in most cases, hated, but i have to admit i actually liked the film, not that it was Oscar worthy or even a favourite of mine, but i would recommend it because although the film has it flaws, it does, in my opinion, have some good assets. Linsday Lohan (playing the dual roles of Abrey Fleming and Dakota Moss) plays both characters, who do differ in personality and background, with great passion and is extremely endearing to watch, displaying her dramatic and comedic talents in this dark thriller. Visually, the colours and direction are excellent; creating immense intensity and cinematically, colours that capture each girl (red and blue) being suggestive and extremely poignant. The story to some may seem far fetched, but it is-quite original and offers a lot of thought after i watched it. It can be a little hard to take in but i find it very rare for a thriller/horror to be chilling yet touching. Gore is evident in the film and at times can be quite irrelevant but does have a purpose, yet the \"less is more\" theory really should have been taken into effect in this situation. What made the film bad for me was the awful police/FBI characters that could have easily been in a film which was a parody, but in this film they were laughable, often displaying no emotion or passion, no drive behind the murdered victims. What really spoilt the film for me was the fact that Aubrey was alive, and as depressing as it sounds, i would rather have had Dakota find her dead sister and finding some peace in knowing where she was, even if she was dead. Without Lindsay Lohan i don't think this movie would have worked for me and i know many hated this film, i believe it is worth a watch and does hold some credibility.",

            "review_title": "Thrilling, Entertaining, & Comes With Just A Few More Flaws Than Supposed \"Good\" Films",
            "content": "All the reviews I write are dedicated to calling out the bad in those films that viewers consider great, and the heavily criticized flicks which can otherwise be considered good by the same merits. This film falls on the latter. No doubt, I believe reaction to this movie was a product of the times, that being of Lohan's off-the-deep-end lifestyle choices during its release. Many reviewers chastised the whole reel, from beginning to end, calling it the \"worst thing\" they have ever seen--which I doubt. Some positive reviews give me hope, however, because this film entertained me. At times, it gripped me; and other instances, even made me double back at the chills. So, I'm here to say that that's all a good thing, people. The thrilling plot moves you along fast enough, keeping you guessing at the stabbing question of \"is it Aubrey, or is Dakota\"? And the twist is very interesting indeed, certainly not something I've really seen before. As a bonus the gore is in line with a Saw movie, which is quite unexpected as the viewer thinks this will just roll out as a simple psychological thriller. Also the acting is well-executed almost across the board.That all said, this movie does not deserve more than five stars, and I'll be brief with these five-fold flaws: (1) FBI agents, hospital care, and the character's parents alike all never give enough immediate credence to this girl's claim that she is someone else. I mean, she was found by the side of the road, so its possible. It feels like everyone is convinced that she is Aubrey just based on looks. That definitely sets police identification back fifty years. Double check her story. (2) Also, some senseless areas in the script that suspends enjoyment is exemplified when the announcer at the game says over the PA: \"A moment of silence please, police found Jennifer's body a day ago\" as if the writers saved a minute by copy & pasting a line just recited by police one scene ago. Why would a school faculty member inform students of a peer's death in this way? \"Her body\"? Pretty dark and indelicate. Simply state that she \"passed away\" or that \"we lost Jennifer yesterday\" especially if you are requesting a moment of silence in the same breath. (3) Plot holes also makes swiss cheese of this film, and they are big. The most grievous one is the lame logic of how Mr. Fleming paid off a deadbeat mother to take one of her twins under the hospital's radar to waltz in the delivery room and give to his wife. Uh, did he pay off the entire hospital staff too to not reveal that their own baby had just died? Sloppy. (4) Additionally, the twin stigmata theme, although fascinating, is driven home way too hard for me with her losing whole appendages and no explanations other than paranormal ones. It makes you check your belief at the door, which muddies up the intrigue. The writers could have just made her inflict wounds to herself in delusional episodes with way less personal carnage, rather than having her wake up and discover that she lost a leg. (5) Finally, to append more on that last note, it did not seem like the movie had the budget to carry a double-amputee main character on screen. Her prosthetics were too advanced for me. My complete praises for trying, and somewhat taking the time to show off the state-of-the-art robotic appendages to explain her realistic actions (and acting); but again, this could have been avoided if you toned down the shared twin trauma theme, right? So mistakes were made.All in all, you can give this movie a chance. It will hold your attention until the end. The acting is good, the story compelling, the tone somewhat consistent, and the final resolution...well...its not terrible. But, my promises, you won't feel taken advantage of like some other reviewers might have you believe. Safe to say, we can all agree that there are far worse movies out there than Lohan's homage to self-destruction found in this piece.",

It was a thriller that had you guessing for a short period until they pretty much told you what was going on, but also kept you unsure until the near end. It was meant to be that way. \n\nI just rewatched it for like the 6th time and it's one of those movies where you don't watch it for a few years and it's enjoyable to watch again and again. \n\nI don't want to spoil anything, but I have to say it is one of the more unique and enjoyable movies I've seen which is why is has a low score.",

Lindsey Lohan's acting for a psychological thriller was pretty bland and looked like she didn't give any effort whatsoever. The visuals of the gore presented in this film was not that impressive and quite honestly it felt more like a B-movie. The main antagonist's intentions in I Know Who Killed Me is just like in other popular movies like Saw and Hostel: kidnapping the characters and torture them. This honestly just feels like a rip-off of Saw and Hostel actually. The writing by Jeff Hammond is beyond ridiculous since the audience was presented an extremely bizarre premise.  Especially with a lame twist and the police handling the identity case poorly. However, I did like the nuance moments of cinematography with the colors blue which symbolizes mystery or attaining the impossible and red symbolizes courage. Also, the music composed by Joel McNeely is pretty beautiful and is a decent fit for psychological thriller. Unfortunately, I Know Who Killed Me couldn't save itself regardless of the music and cinematography because the acting, writing, visuals, and the title itself made me dislike the film.",

Meanwhile, her twin sister, Dakota Moss (also Lohan) wakes up in a hospital and discovers mysterious wounds on her right hand and right leg, before solving the mystery of her killer, Aubrey's piano tutor Mr. Norquist. Atop of the recycled murder mystery plot, those ridiculous blue operating tools, the goofy gore scenes, and the ludicrously preposterous twin stigmata syndrome, here are some of the billion plot holes that earned I Know Who Killed Me its eight Razzies. If Aubrey was buried during the investigation, then why isn't Dakota slowly rotting away like real corpses? In fact, wouldn't she be out of breath by the time she got to the killer's house? For that matter, if Aubrey and Dakota are twins, how could their parents (Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough) not recognize her when Dakota walked in? How did Aubrey's dad end up from the cemetery to a coffin in the killer's lab within ten minutes? If the impact of one twin affects another twin, did Aubrey feel anything down there when Dakota had sex with her boyfriend Jerrod (Brian Geraghty)? And most importantly, why aren't the FBI agents brought into the case again even after Norquist died? I Know Who Killed Me is an extremely stupid movie with not much thrills and a lot more laughs.

However, I Know Who Killed Me ends up being, if not good, a fine film. The main problem with the film really is calling it a horror. Sure, there are some scenes in the film with ominous music over bloody images that are kind of unsettling, but the climax of the film is so sudden and unexciting that you're not really truly scared for a second.\nThe plot draws you in but man, there are some bad parts of the movie that kind of ruin what might be a good one. First, there's way too much time in the strip club scenes. You could've just said \"Hey, I worked in a strip club\" and that could've been the end of it. Instead, there's like 10 minutes of just incredibly uncomfortable film. Lohan does a good job of portraying multiple characters, not worthy of all the Razzie awards she won in my opinion, while the supporting cast was not as strong. But there are too many distractions that deter an otherwise decent movie. Like someone learning how to walk perfectly on a prosthetic leg after just one day of PT, or two people going to a serial killer's home with no police backup and no weaponry. I mean, what do you think you're really going to accomplish? These are a few of many dumb things that threw me off a little. The plot and acting are mostly there, and with a little more work this film could've been pretty good, but ended up just being a meh film you'll only watch once and shouldn't waste your time with.",

            "content": "We interrupt this program as we all watch Lindsay Lohan go down in flames in this career-killing thriller (if you want to call it a thriller). \n\nThe quiet suburb of New Salem is being terrorized by a brutal serial killer who abducts and tortures young women, holding them captive for weeks before murdering them. Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), a talented pianist and aspiring writer, appears to be his latest victim when she disappears without a trace during a night out with friends. As the days tick by, the special FBI Task Force convened to track the killer begins to lose hope of finding her before it's too late. Then, late one night, a driver discovers the young woman by the side of a deserted road, disheveled and critically injured, pleading for help. The girl is rushed to the hospital, where Aubrey's distraught parents, Susan and Daniel, wait by her side as she slips in and out of consciousness. When she is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a down-on-her luck stripper named Dakota Moss (also Lindsay Lohan) who has never heard of Aubrey Fleming. Convinced Aubrey is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, her doctors, parents and law enforcement officials can only wait for rest and therapy to restore her memory. But after returning to her parents' suburban home, she continues to insist that she is not who they think she is, despite bearing bizarre wounds identical to those of the serial killer's previous victims. The FBI agents are further mystified when they search Aubrey's computer and discover a short story about a girl with an alter ego named Dakota. When Dakota begins to suspect she may be Aubrey's identical twin sister, Susan (Julia Ormond) shows her a video of her pregnancy ultrasound clearly revealing there was only one fetus in her womb. Confused and terrified, Dakota starts seeing visions of a menacing figure slowly butchering his captive. Convinced that time is running out both for Aubrey and herself, Dakota confronts Daniel (Neal McDonough) with a shocking truth that leads them on a frantic hunt for the killer.\n\nFrom the beginning to end, I Know Who Killed Me is just a ludicrous mess of a film. With a story this bad, it baffles me that a script went through script meeting. And they said yes to it. When I watched this script go on my TV screen, it is so hard to take this story seriously because the concept from the jump is really absurd. And when a story/script is this silly is released to the world, there is no reason for this script to be written.\n\nThe performances are incredibly horrible in every way. However, it is not their because the script is so bad. Lohan, who gives a great performance in the Parent Trap, is especially dreadful in I Know Who Killed Me. Because of her arrest for DUI, on-set bitchiness, and all that jazz, her awful performance shows. The rest of the cast includes Neal McDonough, Julia Ormond, and Brian Geraghty, who are no better-- they are just as terrible as Lohan. Again, the script is just so incompetent and I can't nothing else but the screenplay/script-- which is (I forgot to mention) one of the worst written things that put into celluloid.\n\nThe direction.... what direction? There's barely any direction in my opinion. If there was any direction, in my eyes, I didn't see much of it. It's like Chris Sivertson wasn't on set when this film was made.\n\nI Know Who Killed Me supposed to be a thriller but it really isn't. There are no thrills whatsoever. At the end, I saw everything that coming especially when they reveal who the killer was. And the ending is just so pitiful that it is laughable. I can't call this a thriller but I can however call this a comedy. Also, the film features one of the most unintentionally hilarious sex scenes in recent memory. I will not describe it. You have to see it for yourself.\n\nI can go on how shockingly awful I Know Who Killed Me really is. From the inane script, horrific performances, and the nonexistent direction, I Know Who Killed Me is a disaster for everyone involved-- especially for Lohan herself. I am so surprise that is got made. Based on the plot itself, I Know Who Killed is a film that is so distasteful and so vile that it shouldn't been made. It made several critics worsts of lists and won eight Razzie awards-- and rightfully so. The film tries to be technically eye catching and mind-blowing but it flunks on both of these things. I prefer you to skip this misguided excuse of a thriller, However, if you are fascinated by terrible films like I Know Who Killed Me, then this movie is for you. But, like I said, skip this movie at all cost.",

It has a 6% on here and I can see why. According to this site, it only has 4 good reviews. Were these 4 people who gave it a good review drunk or something? It doesn't matter. \nI forgot how this film starts off but I can say that the ending is just lame and somewhat predictable. For one, the acting, writing and directing here are bad but the visuals are not bad. I would compare it's used of color to that of Suspiria. \nI rated this 1.5 about a month ago and now writing a review. I would go into the plot but who really cares? Lohan plays a teen named Audrey Fleming who is abducted and is tortures and then escapes. After her abduction, she says she is a stripper named Dakota, which includes scenes of Lohan in a strip club performancing some dances. ( The lighting in the club is actually fantastic.) \nAnd, now remembering what the beginning of the film was like. it starts off with a striptease of Lohan.

What did I like about I Know Who Killed Me?  I like that the structure of the film is dream-like, that you have no idea whether the characters are who they say they are or whether they are who other people say they are.  You're also not sure if what has supposedly happened is what really happened or if it's just a delusion or if it will be revealed later on as a dream the character is having.  I was left wondering where the film was going, and I'll admit that I was unsettled by some of the imagery and by not knowing where things were going to go.  Whatever this movie was trying to be, it was working for me.  I was consistently disturbed by it and confused, and at no time did I feel so in a way that suggested I was disengaged.  I was never bored and I wasn't frustrated by it, and I didn't feel like it was trying too hard.

Tabloid trainwreck Lyndsay Lohan flamed out in a spectacular fashion last year and among the collateral damage was the reputation of this star vehicle, which made a virtual sweep of the Razzie Awards for 2007. Apparently taking his cues from influences as diverse as Lynch (the black humor and surrealism), DePalma (the emotional pitch and film brat references), Cronenberg (the body horror) and Kieslowski (doppelgangers), Sivertson plunges the surprisingly game Lohan into a deliriously baroque, color-coded world of adoloescent anxiety and virgin/whore hysterics. With appearances by Art Bell, a hairless cat, stigmatic twins, a rechargeable prosthetic limb and Lohan's deliciously scuzzy poledancing, it's all here--including the film's unforgettable catchphrase cum motto \"Everybody gets cut.\" Darkly funny, off-kilter, scary, sometimes poignant, always disreputable and sleazy, I Know Who Killed Me deserves a second look, HFS style.

First, she was a great child star in The Parent Trap, started remaking Herbie: Fully Loaded, and tearing catfights in Mean Girls. But I Know Who Killed Me? The title is a little fishy, but I know who definitely killed her. Casey Anthony. The film is a mess, a stripteasing Demi Moore-wannabe, and a psychological torture porn movie that is sometimes more like Showgirls 2.0. Still a trainwreck after all these years and as of today, Lindsay Lohan is going to be America's #1 Alcoholic (and Dr. Phil's next door neighbor). Denzel, eat your heart out.",

This movie is not for everyone though, i love crime shows and graphic movies and i did enjoy it but if you aren't a fan of this genre its probably not a good watch for you. I thought maybe it was a inter-dimensional type of movie, but it turned out better than i expected. I was expecting a little more from the ending but it was still good.",

Directed by Chris Sivertson, has a script by Jeffrey Hammond and Lindsay Lohan in the lead role.At first glance, the central idea of \u200b\u200bthe script seems worthy of a good thriller or horror movie. And indeed it is. The problem is the way it develops its concept. The script is totally overloaded with plot holes and paradoxes. Many people have criticized the overuse of cliche's but... well, horror film industry has literally lived with it since some years ago. For me, the problem isn't that, but the way these cliche's are framed and articulated. They just don't fit. The characters are also bad, don't have a proper development nor any personality. The central character, having two personalities, ends up not having anyone. The film is not clear about the existence of a twin sister, although its suggested. It tries to bet on bloody graphics but fails, and cinematography, sets and clothes opposes the blue and red colors (as the colors-symbol of the two different personalities of the main character), but that gives to the film a far-fetched and almost sickening visual, worthy of a B movie from the seventies. The soundtrack is bad and Lindsay Lohan gives again profs to be a bad actress and a stripper and pole dancer absolutely mediocre.",
