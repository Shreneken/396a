            "content": "After suffering a catastrophic stroke, well-loved magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby finds himself the victim of locked-in syndrome, only able to communicate through the blinking of an eye.  Julian Schnabel's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a disturbing but inspiring story of resilience and the power of the human spirit, a film that never stoops to maudlin and manipulative means to express its message.  Schnabel wisely tells the story primarily from Bauby's point of view, using prolonged POV shots from the perspective of the patient and employing voiceovers to express Bauby's thoughts.  Well-acted, ingeniously shot, and smartly written, it never fails to be thought-provoking.",

A first-person take on a paralyzed man who blinked his memoir, artist-turned-director Julian Schnabel ingeniously transplants us into this man's consciousness. We hear what he hears, we hear and see what he thinks, and we see what he sees (the first 15 minutes literally do just that--a feat that is nothing short of a miracle of filmmaking). Everything here absolutely works, from the poetic writing, the perfect cinematography and editing, the nostalgic touching music, to the magnificent acting. All of which tells a harrowing and heroic story, one that genuinely moves the soul. A brave, thought-provoking film that is one of 2007's best",

            "content": "Max von Sydow was 'only' 78 when he played a 95-year-old character in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. The man looked ancient from middle age but he could act the hell out of any role well into his late career. \n\nI wanted to rate this one higher, but ended up being unable to. Screenwriter Ronald Harwood and director Julian Schnabel take a limiting factor - the near-total paralysis of Jean-Dominique Bauby, left to communicate entirely by the manipulation of one eye - and flip the script brilliantly, delivering inventive camerawork and editing to convey Bauby's confusion, inner turmoil, and struggle through a uniquely visual medium. Our protagonist is given depth and humanity in a biopic that leans away from a Puritanical protagonist simply struggling against adversity in favor of a funny, passionate, emotional main character whose suffering is made to be the audiences own. So why do I rate the film a bit low when it combines originality and solid execution? Simple answer: the dialogue just cannot help but opt for low-hanging fruit, attempting to be profound but ending up obvious instead. Winners include \"this is LIFE?\" and comparisons being drawn between an old man (our main character's father) trapped in his own apartment and Bauby's confinement in his own body, with tears shed at this supposedly emotional realization. The concept is good enough to carry the film, and audience members really don't need to be led by the hand with this kind of dialogue. It's more likely to make you roll your eyes than dab them with a tissue.\n\nJust think, Johnny Depp was originally slated to play the role of Bauby, for which Amalric earned a C\u00e9sar Award (mostly for making his mouth askew). Why did Depp pull out of the production? Scheduling conflicts associated with that other cinematic titan, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. (3.5/5)",

Let's just say first off, I had no context going into this film. I knew nothing about it so I didn't really have any expectations. However, it turned into something so powerful and so unique that it really became a memorable experience for me.\n\nFirst off, I didn't realize this was a biopic. That's absolutely mental! This told the story of a man who lost everything that made him, him. He took that loss and at first, wanted to give up. But with the help of people around him, he realized he just wanted to live. We've seen stories like this before but not like this. \n\nThis film had gorgeous cinematography. It was blended so well with the story telling, as the camera really was it's own character. A lot of times, we were in the POV of the protagonist and it just felt so immersive. The entire film felt immersive and so real. \n\nThe story itself is very powerful. I know people might want to skip over this because it's a foreign film or it uses subtitles, but it's ultimately worth it in the end. I think there's some really beautiful themes in here that are so precious. It looks at the idea of life and death and what you do while you live. It's an emotional ride and oddly, a very relatable one at that. \n\nThe actors were also fantastic in this film. For me, I didn't recognize any of them but they all really carried their own weight. Each one brought a powerfully grounded performance and each of them got their moments to shine at one point or another. \n\nIn the end, I highly recommend this film, as I feel like it's flown under the radar in the film community.",

Then he writes his memoirs.\n\nAmazing true story, very well told by director Julian Schnabel.   Jean-Dominique Bauby's story is quite depressing and his ordeal quite harrowing.  However, it is ultimately quite uplifting, as he overcame his massive physical impediments to connect to the people he loved and to write/dictate his memoirs.\n\nThis could easily have ended up as a dry biopic / docudrama, but thanks to Schnabel's ingenious direction, it isn't.  Schnabel tells the story almost exclusively from Bauby's perspective.  The majority of shots are from Bauby's point-of-view, helping the empathy and engagement enormously.  You can feel what Bauby is going though, and it is far from pleasant.\n\nGreat movie.",

            "content": "Hello, all!  Do you find yourself overly happy about your life?  Been plagued by a bout of cheerfulness you can't stand?  Could you stand to have your mood dropped to something less merry?  Then do I have the movie for you!  I used to think the most depressing, joy stomping movie ever made was the adaptation to Cormac McCarthy's The Road starring Viggo Mortensen.  A new movie holds that spot for me now and it is The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\n\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" is, first and foremost, an amazingly produced and directed film.  I know nothing of French cinema but I was astounded by the writing, the acting, but most of all the camera work.  For once, the 1st person POV worked in conveying how stifling, frustrating, and claustrophobic it can be to live in a body that does not work but still have your mind intact.  The first 20 minutes alone make this movie impressive.  The actual story is also impressive in that Jean-Dominic Bauby, through sheer force of will and with help, was able to dictate an entire memoir, letter by letter, while suffering from locked-in syndrome.  \nTherefore, the real issue is can the individual viewer handle this movie?  It is not entertaining.  What humor it has comes from Jean-Do's snark at dealing with his situation.  It is not grueling, but it is a heavy movie.  Its verisimilitude will trigger a lot of emotions inside the viewer.  That's what it did for me.  I know a lot of the blurbs for this film say it is uplifting and a triumph of the human spirit.  That triumph is not so much uplifting as it is hard fought for.  YMMV but for me, at the end, I just felt drained.  It is not a movie to just watch casually, even if you like movies with similar subjects.\nSo who is this movie for?  I highly recommend it to people who have friends or family who provide long term care to a loved one in a situation similar to Jean-Do Bauby's.  I think many caregivers become invisible, sucked into the lives of those they care for.  I also think those afflicted like Jean-Do also become objects; this movie allows us to see they are not.  The movie shows how much these people go through.  The main emotion one feels after watching this movie is empathy.  I think the world could definitely use more of that because I don't really think one understands this world unless one has been in this world.  Still, this is a difficult movie to sit through.",

            "content": "A couple of weeks ago I saw a presentation about consciousness that discussed \"locked in syndrome\" (a terrifying experience in which people are fully paralyzed yet fully conscious); the speaker mentioned this film based on a book dictated by a person with locked in syndrome using only eye blinks.  So, I thought the film was going to be a documentary and that it was bound to be depressing.  To my astonishment, director Julian Schnabel instead used actors to dramatize the book, told primarily with subjective camera shots from the one non-paralysed eye of Jean-Do Bauby, former editor of Elle magazine, played by Mathieu Amalric.  We follow Bauby's journey and we hear his internal monologue as he realises he is paralyzed and as he slowly comes to terms with his plight.  We marvel at the team of health professionals who find a way to communicate with him and his drive to document his experience in a book.  The relationships with his ex-girlfriend (Emmanuelle Seigner), mother of his three children, and his current girlfriend, who is afraid to visit, as well as his 92-year-old father (Max von Sydow) and other friends are now filled with heightened emotions.  Schnabel keeps things impressionistic and humanistic, showing Bauby's fantasies, his memories, his regrets.  The film is almost experimental at times.  You can't help but feel empathy...and horror; it makes you want to throw yourself into life and experience it to the fullest.  Let's do it.",

One reason I had to stop watching this and only continue watching a long while later was because it was so upsetting. It is a very good film though. I listened to the audio book many years previously which I rated really highly. I rate the film too, but prefer the book although they are both good for different reasons. The film often focuses on Dominic's one working eye, whose pupil is the only part of his body he can move and therefore communicate with since he has locked in syndrome. It is also filmed as if from his point of view, too, which works. You can really feel his emotions. In the book he comes across as more inspiring. I've read elsewhere that the film portrays him in a more negative light than the book he 'wrote', letter by letter via blinking. He died just a few days after his book, which the filmed was inspired by, being published.",

Then the next half hour he goes through self reflection and becomes a better person because of it... and then there were about 40 minutes still left of the movie.\n\nThe first hour and twenty minutes felt very satisfying, but the movie then seemed to be out of material as the rest of the movie relies too much on expressionist flashbacks that don't really blend well with the human drama happening in his hospital room. It feels oddly paced, since I was full of emotions about an hour in, and then the movie just keeps trying too hard to hammer it home in the last third of the movie. He was a very sympathetic character for most of the movie, but because it seemed like a script that relied on \"tugging the heartstrings\" it fills the last act with unnecessary scenes to garner more sympathy. It's kind of self defeating and reaches a point where I stopped caring and just waited for him to die already, as opposed to hoping he might pull out somehow.\n\nThere's also a lack of development for the other characters, namely the woman who helps Bauby write his book. I was actually intrigued by her story even more, since it would take a lot of patience and determination to do what she did. However, the movie kind of glosses over her, using her more as a prop than developing her character further. I understand it's about Bauby and his struggle, but the movie feels a bit one dimensional when he's the only character with depth.\n\nI've heard that it's pretty accurate and close to the book, so I guess it can be forgiven if a lot of this stuff is glossed over in the book and the filmmakers wanted to stay true to the material.

            "content": "Holy Hard-to-Watch, Batman! The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a film based on the true story of a man who suffers a massive stroke which results in him having locked-in syndrome. This is the condition where a person is completely mentally aware but loses all ability to move or communicate. All he can control is one eye. Naturally this is going to be difficult to watch, but it is accentuated even more when we spend large portions of the movie looking from the main character's point of view. So we are subjected to the same uncomfortable feeling of being locked-in with one view and only seeing things if they happen to pass within his vision. It's actually staged really brilliantly, and we are allowed to hear Jean-Do's thoughts just enough so we can sympathize with his ordeal. Mathieu Amalric has the unenviable task of trying to emote without being able to move a muscle, yet somehow I really do feel it all coming from that one eye.\n\nI absolutely love the parade of nurses, friends, and family that interact with Jean-Do. The acting is so convincing that you would think they are really dealing with the frustration of communicating with someone who can't talk back. My favorite is Henriette who devotes herself wholeheartedly to helping him communicate again. Her exchange with him, particularly when he's still feeling sorry for himself, is one of the most heartfelt moments of the movie. The other scene, which had tears streaming down my face from start to finish, was the phone conversation Jean-Do has with his father played by Max von Sydow. I have just come to naturally expect this kind of stellar acting from von Sydow, but he is masterful here. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is definitely an emotional film. It doesn't feel particularly manipulative either, because these are simply real situations as they would play out. It's hard to nail down a rating, though. It was well-made, and it definitely touched me, but I can't imagine I will want to watch it again any time soon. Yet I can recommend you watch it, because it is inspiring how much Jean-Do does with his life despite what is wrong with him. If you're looking for a good cry, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is the film for you.",

            "content": "\"I decided to stop pitying myself. Other than my eye, two things aren't paralyzed, my imagination and my memory.\"\n\nJulian Schnabel's French film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, is a powerful and emotional film about a man suffering from locked-in syndrome due to a stroke. Despite having his mental faculties intact, he is almost completely paralyzed and unable to communicate with the outside world. The once successful magazine editor is now living as a prisoner of his own body. The only muscle he is capable of moving is his left eye and with the help of a therapist he manages to communicate by blinking his eye. Mathieu Amalric gives a powerful performance as Jean-Dominique Bauby, and most of the film takes place from his point of view. Schnabel brilliantly and effectively uses camera angles to give the audience a glimpse of what this person's claustrophobic world was like. From the very opening scene we are hooked and drawn to Jean-Do's new world as he's trapped in his body. It is a very emotional film based on the autobiography written by Bauby himself who managed to write the book with the help of his therapist through the use of a communication system they developed. The sole fact that this man was able to write a book in the condition he was in, is reason enough for me to want to read his book or see a movie based on his life. It takes a lot of courage to open up the way Jean-Do did, and I think it is one of the main reasons why this film worked so well for audiences across the globe. It says a lot about how powerless we are against these illnesses, but at the same time we can also share Jean-Do's approach of learning to deal with his disability and facing the obstacles with optimism. He realized that despite being physically disabled he still had his mental faculties and was able to break those boundaries with the power of his imagination. I am also certain that this element is what caught director Schnabel's attention and what pushed him to make this film. He tells the story with such class that despite the emotional moments you never feel he was trying to be manipulative or force the audience into feeling a certain way. The performances in this film are also outstanding, making this an even more engaging movie. I also loved the beautiful imagery that Schnabel used, turning the film into a poem at times. \n\nThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly was a personal film for me considering that my father is going through a slightly similar experience as the character in this film. He suffered a stroke four years ago and hasn't been able to speak since. The right side of his body was paralyzed, but with help from therapy he has been able to walk again. Despite not being able to speak he understands everything and communicates with us through signs and facial expressions. The brave way in which he has managed to face his illness by always being in good spirits and not letting the disease get the best of him is a constant reminder for me of how much our attitude influences the way we approach life. He could be feeling sorry for himself, or he can stay positive and continue to improve with therapy in a similar way that Jean-Do did with his locked in syndrome. Having your mental capabilities intact is a major force considering you can escape those limitations in your mind and let your imagination fly. In a way, it was a turning point for Jean-Do when he realized this and Schnabel managed to capture those moments really well on camera. The scenes he shares with his family members are among my favorite in the film. I loved the scene in which he's in the beach with his ex-wife and kids. It is such an emotional scene but at the same time it felt authentic and real. The scenes with his father, played by Max von Sydow, are also extremely powerful and effective. You rarely see a biopic like this one, and Schnabel deserves all the credit for making an original and moving picture.",

Also, Almaric is mystifyingly good as Bauby (not to mention.. almost all the females in this movie are fashionably French and have those Naomi Watt-esque eyes that could revive any man from the depths of despair). 5/5 Did I mention there's a bevy of French babes in this movie?

            "content": "With art-house films, there are always two options on your opinion on it: 1) it was boring but well-made; 2) it was artistic but it went nowhere-- possibly \"Le Scaphandre et le Papillon\" is more groundbreaking because it's as unconventional as an art-house movie should be, but is so easily absorbing that it moves you by the end.  It's as if Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut made a film together, because the beauty is all there, and so is the story.\n\tJean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) is a high-powered editor for \"Elle\" magazine who finds his world shattered when, out of the blue, he has a stroke that paralyzes his entire body.  His mind is still in perfect condition, so basically he's in a \"prison\".  At first he has a cynical outlook on everything that's happening, but when he learns to communicate just by using his eyes, he decides to put his new skill to test by \"writing\" a memoir, with the help of a nurse (Anne Consigny).\n\t\"Le Scaphandre et le Papillon\" is a film experience unlike any other.  It's claustrophobic, scary, and strange beyond belief, at least for the first half.  But it should be.  We don't really watch the film as much as live it, as we see the world through Bauby's eyes.  It's uncomfortable, but fascinating; most of us luckily won't get the chance to face paralyzation, and it's here.  Experimentation like this really shouldn't work, but it remains to be artistic and unique throughout.  \n\tAs Bauby becomes more well-acquainted with his handicap, the film opens up.  The cameras rid of the first-person view and the aura goes from pessimistic to optimistic.  Whether or not it's symbolism, it comes across in a way that surprisingly isn't jarring.\n\tJulian Schnabel doesn't direct with any hint of pretentiousness.  It instantly appears that he's trying to create a world of empathy.  Though it's an adaptation of the memoir it's based on, it doesn't feel like one.  He's brave in how he shapes every scene, and it pays off.\n\tBauby is of course, a character that should be more unlikable; he cheated on the loyal woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) he can call the mother of his children for a narcissistic woman, he loves his kids but doesn't see that they need a family to truly be happy, and he's played by Amalric, who plays bad guys so well.  But because of the way he handles his condition, he instantly becomes a hero.  The fact that he can see the humor in his downward spiral gives him respect, and that's where the empathy really ties together.\n\tWhat if we had an American version of the film instead? Most likely it wouldn't be filmed in the same way and its main character would be a dime a dozen.  It would throw away the memoir that it's based on and instead make it as sweet as sugar.  Bauby would end up completely recovering and all the women would be played by a Kate Hudson type, all bidding for an Oscar nomination.  What's so refreshing and so \"un-Hollywood\" about this film is that it gives us a realistic look at a total nightmare, and doesn't shy away from the hardships going on.\n\t\"Le Scaphandre et le Papillon\" is an excellent film that grips you from beginning to end.  It's great any way you look at it.",

The acting is very good, although that is not what is most impressive about the film, which is how it is told through Amalric's character's perspective, showing just how much of a struggle something like this can be. While it is relentlessly sad, it is powerful and incredibly moving all the way through. This is a movie that should be a must-see for anyone who knows someone dealing with a stroke or some other kind of physical ailment.

            "content": "This is a unique and very different film. Based on the book of the same name, this is the true story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor of Elle in France, who suffers a massive stroke that leaves him almost totally paralyzed. The only muscle he can control is in his left eyelid--he can blink that eye but do nothing else. And yet that blinking eye allowed him to dictate the story of his stroke and how he recovered. In fact, the book he dictated is the one the movie is based on.\n\nBauby's therapist and friends would recite letters of the alphabet from most frequent to least. When they reached the letter Bauby wanted, he'd blink. Slowly, letter by letter, he would dictate his wishes and his book. Over time, his \"interpreters\" got very good at telling where he was going, which saved some time.\n\nTo recreate Bauby's experience, the movie starts off from his point of view as he awakens from the post-stroke coma he was in. His vision is blurry. We can hear his thoughts, but no one else can. When Bauby blinks to signal to his doctors, the camera blinks too. This is a very effective way at putting us inside Bauby's head. Recognizing that it could quickly become claustrophobic, however, the film eventually shows us the \"outside\" view as well, but still remains firmly rooted in Bauby's experience. In addition to what he sees, we also see what he imagines, from sumptuous meals to scenes of terrible isolation to calving icebergs.  It is a wholly remarkable experience of a man who's pre-stroke life is revealed for its shallowness and self-centredness. He does his best to make up for it by re-connecting with people whom he'd let slip away.\n\nThe movie is in French, with English sub-titles available. This led to one odd quirk: when Bauby is spelling out words, the sub-titled letters don't match the spoken dialogue, because, of course, the French word he is spelling isn't spelled the same way in English. For example, his interpreter spells out \"m\", \"e\", \"r\", and knows that the word is \"merci\". Meanwhile, the sub-titles are showing \"t\", \"h\", and \"a\" for \"thanks\". Otherwise, the sub-titles seemed to be an excellent match for the dialogue. The acting is superb from everyone, including Mathieu Amalric as Bauby, who had to hold his body absolutely still, including a twisted mouth, while letting that one eye roam and blink. The cinematography is gorgeous, in a slightly washed-out palette that might symbolize Bauby's sensitivity to light. It's not clear there is a universal lesson here, but certainly this tale of how one man responded to a rare and frightening fate is nothing short of heroic.",

            "content": "From acclaimed director Julian Schnabel, and the screenwriter of \"The Pianist\", comes a remarkable and inspring story about the power of imagination. The astonishing true-life story of Jean-Dominic Bauby -- a man who held the world in his palm, lost everything to sudden paralysis at 43 years old, and somehow found the strength to rebound -- first touched the world in Bauby's best-selling autobiography \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\" Bauby was able to compose a memoir through a painstaking process of blinking when an assistant spoke the alphabet aloud is nothing short of miraculous. The book was published in 1997, just three days before Bauby died at age forty-five.\r\n\r\nA descent from a wealthy and congenial playboy and the editor of French Elle, to a bed-bound, hospitalized stroke victim with an inactive brain stem that made it impossible for him to speak or move a muscle of his body. This prison, as it were, became a kind of \"diving bell\" for Bauby -- one with no means of escape. With the editor's mind unaffected, his only solace lay in the \"butterfly\" of his seemingly depthless fantasies and memories. Because of Bauby's physical restriction, he only possessed one channel for communication with the outside world: ocular activity. By moving his eyes and blinking, he not only began to interact again with the world around him, but -- astonishingly -- authored the said memoir via a code used to signify specific letters of the alphabet. \r\n\r\nSchnabel begins the film with a subjective camera, so that we see the world through Bauby's eyes as he wakes up to find himself in a hospital. We soon become familiar with his limited field of vision and aware that he can't move his head - thus things keep happening outside the frame. We hear Bauby's thoughts, and knowing what he wants to say helps us to feel just a hint of his frustration at not being able to communicate. It takes some time for Bauby to realize that his imagination can help ease his misery, and that's when the fantasy sequences come. But Schnabel uses them sparingly and with care. He never pretends that imagination can offer anything more than temporary consolation, and so beautiful sequences of a magical hospital corridor, with miracle cures or a leaping Nijinsky, land with a thud into reality. \"The New Yorker\" calls the \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" -\"nothing less than the rebirth of cinema. It is a marvel.",

But, well, here goes: This film is a poorly made, utterly pretentious, art-house bore. While good cinematography and decent performances save it from being unbearable, Julian Schnabel (an Academy Award nominee and an Independent Spirit Award winner for directing this film) has NO idea how to construct a compelling narrative or create emotional attachment to characters. He's a painter, for god sake, exactly when did he earn the qualifications to tell us a feature-length story? In a flaw exhibited in earlier films of his such as \"Before Night Falls,\" Schnabel presents us a chronological blow by blow of an over-sentimentalized story without any eye for pace or beginning, middle and end. This creates a complete disconnect between us and the characters we are supposed to be empathizing with, and also creates a repetitive narrative structure that, in plain English, bores the living hell out of anyone who isn't just trying to like the movie cause it got a 92 on metacritic. See it, and then test out your acting skills as you try to find ways to agree with the embarrassingly enthusiastic reviews.",

If you're in need of a clue as to why beautiful women fawn all over Jean-Dominique Bauby(Mathieu Amalric), aside from being the former editor-in-chief of Elle; the camera, his eye(the other eye suffered a death by non-irrigation), provides the answer. As Jean-Dominique's physician extols the cosmetic virtues of Henriette(Marie-Josee Croze) and Marie(Olatz Lopez Garmendia), the camera pans to an attending doctor, because Bauby knows women; even a professional woman wants to be thought of as pretty in his model-centric mind, and her exclusion from the doctor's pantheon of attractive medical professionals strikes him as callous and rude. If Jean-Dominique's eye could talk, he'd reassure her with some kind words; something along the lines of, \"You're no chopped liver, yourself, you lab-coated mademoiselle.\" Even though locked-in syndrome is a nightmare, Bauby fills his mindscape with images steeped in a learned man's knowledge of history, art, and dance. Don't feel sorry for him. Laugh at him. Jean-Dominique gives you permission when he refers to his face as being dipped in formaldehyde. \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" isn't a love story, but it's a story about love. Save your tears for Celine(Emmanuelle Seigner). Nobody loves Bauby more than her, but she's in competition with his mistress(Agathe de La Fontaine) and translator(Anne Consigny).",

This inspirational feature is based on a true story about a man who becomes a vegetable for the rest of his life and somehow later can communicate by only blinking one eye, which leads him to pursue his imagination in writing a story. The motifs and symbolism in the film keeps you thinking at first, but once you analyze those motifs, you will understand perfectly as to why those themes are there, including to add the things from the title of the film to the actual plot itself. The use of the camera movement and spaces are natural and unique compared to a typical Hollywood flick, though beware of many extreme-close ups and canted angles in this film if you have a fear of claustrophobic spaces. However those chosen spaces and shots are used for a reasonable purpose. For artistic filmmakers alike, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a must recommend feature to view.",

Honestly, I can't even imagine, it must be stifling. But this is precisely what this film addresses, thanks to a first-person testimony, adapting the autobiographical book written by Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Elle, in his last months of life, shortly after a stroke left him totally paralyzed, except for one single eye, which he used to communicate thanks to an ingenious and slow communication system.It is an impressive film, starting with the theme and narrative in the first person. Like him, we started the film without realizing what is going on, but gradually we go, with him, to discover the harsh reality. Bauby was, then, a man in the force of his life and with a reputation as heartthrob, adventurer and sportsman. This abrupt beginning immediately takes us to the environment of the film and to the desolate feeling of that man, who suddenly saw life disappear and confined himself to a bed, where he cannot even move or speak. He's devastating.One of the aspects that draws the most attention in this film is the masterful mastery of shooting techniques and camera angles to show us exactly what that man saw, and to put us directly in his skin. Taking advantage of all the cinematographic techniques, from close-up to blur, we can see through Bauby's only good eye, and that gives the film another kind of impact. The sets and costumes are extraordinarily realistic and give the film all the weight of a true story of suffering, but also of overcoming beyond what could be thought possible.The cast is very good. Being a French film, the language used is, of course, French, but I confess that I quite liked it, since several of the actors involved are regulars in English-speaking films, and it is pleasant to hear them in their native language. Mathieu Amalric is an excellent actor and was perfect in the role of Bauby, and in the way he expressed it, albeit in a static way, without moving, his voice being heard as if it were his thoughts. Emmanuelle Seigner and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze are also noteworthy for their positive work.",

You can only imagine how incredibly frustrating and upsetting itI found this movie fascinating, although a bit hard to watch in parts, mainly when they sewed up one of his eyes much against his wishes which, of course, they couldn't hear. You can only imagine how incredibly frustrating and upsetting it must have been, being stuck there in a bleak/bland hospital rather in the middle of nowhere, a town that he wasn't much keen on, not being able to communicate minus via a one blink for yes and two blinks for no system.He has speech therapists who are very enthusiastic about helping him 'speak' and communicate, although he initially doesn't share their enthusiasm, particularly after believing his physical state is temporary and then having to deal with the shock of seeing himself in a mirror. What makes this movie (or/and the book its based on) really work, I feel, is the dialogue - his sarcasm/wit as he narrates the movie, us as viewers hearing what he's thinking while paralysed. He's clearly a witty person and its interesting how he interprets things and his, sometimes particularly strong, reactions to the situations and environments he's placed in. As well as this, we learn alot about him prior to the accident that caused his stroke/paralysis, which of course helps us understand more about his viewpoints.It really is one of those movies that make you count your blessings and I found it interesting to see how the movie developed. Of course there's the worry that it'll be far too depressing, of course this isn't a movie that would strike many people as being very positive, although I can't help but feel like there is an element about it that is somewhat uplifting - the narration and his take on certain things brought me to this conclusion.Something I haven't mention so far is, of course, the fact that this movie is French, so of course you have to rely on subtitles in order to understand it (and yes, I'm sure it'd be possible to make some witty remark about being able to understand the movie in the same way as the characters in the movie struggle to communicate with the main character) but I didn't find this to be a big problem really. I've seen a few movies in other languages, this one I found the subtitles were somehow less tiresome and complicated to keep track of, if that makes sense. I suppose alot of it is visual based and less of it is dependent on catching (or more reading) every word that appears, I feel.The scenes that come from his imagination, (which is one of only 3 elements that he has the use of, the other two being his memory and his one remaining eye) are quite intriguing and I like how, as the movie continues, we learn little by little about him, not only his personal background but about his family and partner and also in the present time, we learn the different reactions from his different friends and relatives who learn of his condition and how both they and him react to this.To summarise, it is quite thought provoking and while it provides some uncomfortable viewing in parts, there is a nice element of optimism somehow which isn't in a patronising way, and I found it overall quite poignant, making a compelling and intriguing watch, so yes I'd say that it was a well made movie which I would recommend to others.",
