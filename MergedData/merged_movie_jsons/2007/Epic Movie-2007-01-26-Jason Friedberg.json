            "content": "I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago, and I was really hesitant of seeing it, after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film, and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you, after seeing this travesty for myself, I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude, vulgar, over-familiar and even contrived, and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur, Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie, and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia, it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad, the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful, and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now, that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies, merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films, but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie, I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in, that's how painful I found it. All in all, probably not quite the worst movie ever, but along with movies like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered, it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions, and one to avoid, even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh, I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "After watching this movie, I just couldn't stop talking about it. Mind you, not in the sense that someone can't stop talking about a great book or show, but more along the line of how someone can't stop talking about their colonoscopy during a diner conversation. In other words, after seeing this you can't help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.This movie entered with the tag line of being \"written by two of the six writers of 'Scary Movie'!\" What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately, this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy, which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah, not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.\"So,\" you ask, \"What makes it so bad?\" I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews, right? No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way \"Hogan's Heroes\" was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie, you start to ask, \"Why was that funny in the preview?\" The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.Do yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It'll be twice as funny, make three times more sense, and be only a fifth as painful.",

I didn't have a clue what was going on, the 'script' was idiotic, the actors were totally lame and annoying and the jokes were pathetic and UNFUNNY, how this ever made it to the silver screen i'll never know.I advise anyone who's thinking of going to see this piece of JUNK, to stay well clear and save their money, thank you and GOODNIGHT! 0/10",

This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it. I didn't find any of the gags clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. The casting directors also found someone who looked surprisingly like Jack Black, although sadly the script didn't give him anything funny to do.Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental.",

I liked it because for once I finally understood all the jokes. All of the movies they were making fun of are very well known good movies, so it was easy to see where they were making fun of it. Perhaps someone could find it offensive if one of the movies they are joking about is your favorite. But this is the main purpose of a parody, to cut up other films. I really enjoyed how they tied in so many different movies into the one. It was cooling seeing the doubles they picked to act as famous actors, in all honesty they did a great job with portraying who they were pretending to be. I personal enjoy parodies for what they are, over the top silliness that makes no sense other then to cut up other films.",

It is disappointing to see that actors who have received some acclaim from both critics and the public alike have starred in this-the worst movie ever made-worse than Grease 2. And only a few minutes longer than a regular TV show except without interesting commercials, it is highway robbery to make anyone pay to see this half-baked movie where writers, producers, actors and directors have only put half an effort to do something that at least would be satisfactory. And half is giving them too much credit. Unfortunately for Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Faune A. Chambers and Crispin Glover (you waited for this movie to return to the big screen? where were you last couple of years? in detox?), I won't be running to the theatre any time soon to see one of their movies any time soon.Studio decision-makers have to take a stand against these movies-and so does the industry. Pre-teens, teens and young adults have shown that they have interests in seeing well-written, acted, developed and intelligent movies. Don't take the easy way out to do these useless piece of junk.",

In parodying said films, they merely reconstruct the setting (poorly) i.e. Willy Wonka's chocolate river becomes poo. The references to pop culture are 1: over used 2: Poorly used 3: Irrelevant and not funny. It appears that the budget was spent on midgets and a dance choreographer (apparently it is funny when medieval knights, pirates, dwarfs and oompa loompas dance). The narrative is infantile and not remotely funny, no imagination could possibly enjoy the pure nonsense of the characterization. Parody films are meant to parody and this one fails to come even close to funny, it irreverence is pathetic, not hilarious and the writers...well, where to start with them.If you like watching pictures move and people talk, this film is probably for you. If you like films that are intelligent in their parody and genuinely funny, then stick to the Scary Movie catalogue. Even Date Movie was better than this\u0085and that's saying something.This film trades on the pretension that it will be funny\u0085it is not, someone should report it to a fair trading body. I personally wonder what is more disturbing, that people would enjoy this movie, or that Hollywood thinks that people will enjoy it.",

The ceiling's holes would show more creativity and humor than the script of this film, and they would act better than the people in it, too. I'd compare this thing to the foul smell of a rotten egg, but it's worse than that. The talentless Friedberg & Seltzer are back from their Date Movie debacle with more trashy, unfunny \"spoofs\". For example, a bullet bounced off of Superman's eye in his movie; now, the bullet pokes his eye out. Gee is that original and hilarious or what? Not a single joke works, and the only surprise of this movie is that these two hacks keep getting funding to produce flop after flop. This is just so painfully bad.

(If you've seen the clips during MTV video awards, you get the idea on the kind of jokes I'm referring to). Epic Movie tries to cash in on the Scary Movie, Date Movie, \"Movie\" Movie franchise, but doesn't measure up to the originality shown in the Scary Movie series.It doesn't take a genius to recommend that you save your box-office ticket money, and if you're interested, wait for the DVD, since this isn't an essential big screen movie.",

It's unfunny, it could be deemed offensive, there is virtually nothing positive I can say about it, the acting is unforgivable in this day and age, it smacks of 1980's b movie all the way through, I realise they were up against it with the script, but come on.

I choose to watch this, I will NOT dignify it by calling it a film as I don't want to sully the word, this thing out of morbid curiosity at just how bad a bottom 100 rated thing on IMDb could possibly be. I was not ready for this inept 'spoof' film that is cringe-worthily unfunny The lame pansy ass shots at movies actually spells out what the spoof they're doing is from!!! So it's not only vastly unfunny, it also treats the audience like some severely mentally retarded sloths (which, I'll concede, is in likelihood the coveted demographic they're going after). EVERYone involved in this soul-sucking piece of rancid dog feces should not only be deeply deeply ashamed of themselves, but should actually be sentenced to do community service of some kind. I think it's current standing of 43rd worst thing of all time is actually way to optimistic, as it's not one of, but THE worst supposed comedy I've EVER seen in my life. Trust me I've seen a lot and suffered through many a bad film. But in all sincerity this thing is as painful an experience as having a gravel enema, while your eyes are held open by rusty priors forced to see grandma provide fellatio to a sickly dog who gets so exited his bowels go and he defecates in a baby sister's mouth which she gulps down with delight. No wait, this is worse MUCH MUCH worse. Now i'm not a movie snob in the least. my tastes range from Shawshank redemption to Polyester. From Die Hard to The Toxic Avenger. I love spoof films like Airplane, Naked Gun, Kentucky Fried Movie and Scary Movie (the first one).But I sincerely do NOT want to meet anyone who even chuckled once at this abomination. It's utterly and supremely horrid in every single conceivable way, from the wanna-be Anna Farris, Jayma Mays to the proof that Kal Penn in Harold and Kumar was his highest achievement in life to the brain numbingly so called 'spoofs'. David Carridine, do you need the money THIS badly? Carmen Elektra, what in the hell were they holding over your head?? must have been supremely embarrassing indeed as you were married to Rodman. Fred Willard, where the hell did your career go??? Poor poor Kevin \"Kids in the Hall\" McDonald how could you slum this badly?? Lastly (and i DO mean lastly) to Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer: How can you hate all of humanity with such a passion as to inflict these travesties on us. Every single film you've done thus far, and likely in the future, is complete and utter sh*#. You've totally bypassed other horrible incompetent film makers as Uwe Boll, and others that names escape me at the moment. You're both the worst.My Grade: F",

However with Epic Movie I can honestly see no point because the \"story\" is a lazy aping of popular films and television shows in an untidy and unsatisfying mix. The film is of course described as \"spoofing\" these films but this is not the case because it doesn't spoof them so much as just \"do\" scenes from them. If it were funny then I wouldn't mind so much but almost without exception it is unfunny and crude. The target audience of teenage boys is clear with the inclusion of nudity and excrement but I do still think even for them it is poor.OK so teenagers and males have more basic senses of humour but surely not this basic? There is nothing approaching wit or intelligence about the comedy and it is no more developed than the gags you hear the annoying teenagers passing among themselves at the back of the cinema. I think I let out a very slight chuckle about twice and for the rest of the film the best I could hope for was that it wouldn't offend or annoy me. The excrement stuff was quite repulsive but what really got to me was the sheer stupidity and laziness of it all. It really is as poor as others have said and I suspect very few viewers will enjoy it.The cast can do nothing to lift it but in fairness they deserve what they get for being involved in this \u0096 I know everyone needs to work but surely they have some ethics like the rest of us, after all they are not starving. The usual rubbish faces are in the lead and I expected nothing and got nothing from them. The bigger disappointment is seeing people like Coolidge, Glover, Electra, Carradine, Willard and others \u0096 OK so they lowered themselves to this but couldn't they have asked to be removed from the credits. In particular Willard and Coolidge should be above this.Epic Movie is just what you expect it to do \u0096 nothing. It is clumsy and lazy with nothing to offer from the gags other than basic impersonation and stupidity. I am very glad that I am not target audience for this stuff or I would feel aggrieved by the slight on my taste.

            "content": "Blockbuster Movies are what make Hollywood into a successful business. These movies are so big they need the italic title 'epic' to describe them. So you would think, parody movies about them, would be, worth the big bucks and worth seeing. However, most of them, the most recent ones are pretty lousy and way low-budget. Probably one of the worst, is the film series, movie 'movie'-cash-in, created by director/writer duo, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. These movies from them, ranging from 2000's Scary Movie, 2006's Date Movie, to 2008's Disaster Movie, doesn't have the cleverness or smarts to take something serious existing, and make something new with their comedy. These men, are no Mel Brooks, Monty Python, or even Zucker Brothers. I think, the reason, why these two writers are not that funny, is because they create comedic movies that parody and reference recent pop culture without concern for the overarching plot or characterization. There is no bigger example of bigger mishap of that, then 2007's Epic Movie; which goes all over the place, ranging from parodies of music videos, viral memes, commercials & television shows that has nothing to do, with epic movies. It's a reference overdosed. Even, when the movie focus on movie parodies, they pick some of the worst choices to parody about. Honestly, ask yourself this, how do you, make a parody of already establishing comedy. The jokes are not new, nor fresh. Like really, what was the point of having 2006's Nacho Libre & Borat in this type of a film. What does they, have to do with epic movies!? The reason, why I ask this, is because, when most people think of epic movies; most of them, think classic historical fantasy setting, or extreme science fiction settings. In my view, I see those two examples as nowhere near that. One of the main criticisms of their work is that the pop culture jokes that they rely on become outdated within just a few years, with the things that they're parodying having fallen out of the collective consciousness. A few of their gags had fallen out of memory before the respective movie came out. Their tendency to base brief parodies on the trailers to movies that wouldn't be released until well into their own production probably has something to do with it, is jarring. Since this movie has little to no continuity, there is no stalks in caring for the story or the characters. Don't get me wrong, all the main actors and supporting characters were mostly fine, is this film, but when sub-plots, like a group of adult orphans, Edward (Kal Penn) & Peter (Adam Campbell), Susan (Faune A. Chambers) & Lucy (Jayma Mays), being force to be turn into food at the factory, are quickly replace, by a Narnia parody that overtakes the rest of the film. It's become really off-centered. Themes like that, and the out of nowhere, horrible deux ex machina ending made this film, really confusing. After all, there is little to care about their plot conflict. The movie treat death, as if a cartoon. These people get seriously hurt, and are perfectly alright in a few moments later. It doesn't allow enough time for these slapstick jokes to sink in. I get that most of the time, they trying to go the low-brow cartoon-like violence route, but most slapsticks comedies, work best, when you can really sense the pain and misery. The movie has no stalks. Then, there is the somewhat offensive, vulgar humor that movies like this, have. Other films work best with this type of humor, because it allow the scenes to have context. In here, it's mostly use as a throwaway gag like the pointless nudity, this film has. Even the low-brow toilet humor felt kinda forced. Yes, some of the gags in this movie kinda works, but most of it, really fall flat. The \"uncut\" version of this film, apparently decides that the best way to improve its below average comedy, is to add more same running jokes scenes as the original version. In my opinion, it does add anything, worth-while. You could argue that the spoof genre would have died out in the late 2000s regardless, as audience tastes moved to \"bro-comedy\" films, ensemble pieces and more intellectual comedies, not to mention the rise in popularity of quickly-produced, and, therefore, more topical web-based movie parody comedy like College Humor, or Funny or Die, but Seltzer and Friedberg helped completely drive the genre into the ground, with Epic Movie being one that officially signified its own death. These days, most spoof movies are relegated to Direct-To-Video. Due to the nature of their films largely being simplistic parodies of whatever is popular at the time, a number of other parody films in the same style have been wrongly attributed to them. This includes 2001's Not Another Teen Movie, 2008's Superhero Movie and 2009's Dance Flick. While, I wouldn't say, all of the recent parodies are super-awful. I do have to say, overall: Epic Movie is one of those, that is.",

I don't typically expect much from crappy spoof movies, but I at least expect them to try. This came off as too much of a bad Saturday Night Live or Mad TV sketch that runs on way too long. A number of SNL's movies have felt that way, but really....Why can't they ever pick _good_ \"two of the six writers from Scary Movie\"? I feel like I've seen this brand of dumb humor a million times before, albeit much better presented. I don't mind abstract references that would seemingly change the storyline (the four protagonists becoming part of Wonka's candy, but seconds later reverting to normal, for example), but these \"Family Guy\" style cutaways were so poorly done, it almost made me want to leave. I felt genuinely ripped off, longing for satires like Spy Hard, Last Action Hero, and Spaceballs. A friend and I debated whether this film or Scary Movie 4 was worse. We agreed it was a tie.The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down. Scary Movie 2 contained a number of bad jokes, but it was okay because the filmmakers had a general idea of where they wanted to take the \"story\", and at least made a concentrated effort to tone down the absurdist humor in places where it wasn't needed.Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable, unfunny jokes close to the end of the film, when Kal Penn (who made two Harold and Kumar references, also falling quite flat, even amongst the largely tweenage audience) spells out the film's moral--a sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family. The repetitive use of the word \"Bitch\" to refer to the antagonist, played by Jennifer Coolidge (\"Stiffler's mother\" in American Pie, a point also mentioned) got tiring. I will admit there were a few laugh-worthy moments, notably in the name of Jack Sparrow's parody, Jack Swallows. The actors were all fairly devoid of talent (especially that kid from the MySpace movie, playing Ashton Kutcher), and the directing seemed nonexistent.Seeing the trailer is a bit of a spoiler as well, as you can tell when certain parts are coming up, effectively ruining the humor. Plus, the trailer has all the reasonably funny moments. It feels as if they directed the rest of the film as merely filler between the points showcased in the preview. I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything, because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.My recommendation: don't see it in theaters. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it on TV when nothing else is on. Forget it was even made. Trust me, you're not missing anything.",

Wait, scratch that; Hollywood doesn't just hate us; they think we're stupid, insignificant creatures of habit, too. That we're nothing but a bunch of mindless apes willing to throw our hard-earned bananas down on any old piece of crap they manage to squeeze out that week. And it saddens me to acknowledge that to a large degree, they're right. We do throw our bananas down on just any old thing, as proved by \"Epic Movie\" being number one at the big B.O. opening weekend.

I feel sorry for people like Kal Penn, Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, and Crispin Glover who seem to have become so jaded with their careers that they could confuse accepting this cinematic skidmark on their resume as something remotely resembling a good idea. Especially in Penn's case, as he's on the verge of shattering the Kumar image most people still associate with him.\"Epic Movie\" is supposed to be a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it.

            "content": "When you hear the title Epic Movie and also hear that its a spoof, you automatically assume that it will be spoofing such movies as Lord of the Rings, Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven etc. In this respect when I first heard the title I will admit I was a tiny bit intrigued. And then the trailer was released, my respect for the movie and its concept went dramatically downhill from there until now I sit before you having seen a movie that really, really, really is the most excruciatingly example of poorness that you will ever find on the cinema this year! You see Epic Movie decides to spoof such movies as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lione, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand, Borat, Nacho Libre and oh way too much more as well. I can accept movies taking the mickey out of other movies, admittedly I quite like the Scary Movie franchise, sure Scary Movie 4 was a bit of a letdown, but that movie at least has some inventive ideas around it. This movie didn't have one half decent or remotely funny idea at all. When you sit there wishing you were watching the real Nacho Libre when you're watching the Nacho Libre spoof on this you know there's something horribly wrong with the movie. This fails at everything, the idea is pathetic, the cast are pathetic, the jokes are pathetic, hell even the sets are pretty pathetic. And that's the key word for this movie, pathetic. Its like a hyperactive five year old jumping in front of you for the entire movie, its basically screaming at you for attention, and no matter how much you ignore it it just keeps coming back for more. Its a mesh of horrid jokes ranging from slightly (and emphasis on slightly as I didn't even smirk) funny, a beaver getting kicked, to pretty bad (a Mystique scene where a man wants her to become a fat woman), to excruciatingly awful (the horrible Kribs sequence) to just plane suicidally awful, the Punk'd spoof. Epic Movie is neither epic, nor funny, its just a wretched thing that's wondered onto cinema screens and unfortunately the morons of our society have decided to lap it up, which undoubtedly means Epic Movie 2 is being wrote as we speak, god help us all! The major problems with Epic Movie fall into the fact it is not funny at all, ever, not even a teensy weensy bit amusing. And another fault is that it dares to take the mickey out of things that are funny in their original movies. Borat for example, now the mickey take here is ludicrous, and actually I'm still baffled as to how Borat got into this movie at all. But sure enough a man trying to act like Borat shows up, imagine Borat but without a joke and that's what he's like here, just simply walking on for the hell of it. The movie also decides to laugh at Johnny Depp's performance in Pirates 2, except here it seems like a man doing a poor Keith Richards impersonation more than anything else. The scenes where he waddles about singing an odd Pirate rap didn't make me laugh, they just made me sit there with my mouth hanging wide open as to why I am enduring this monstrosity. Then it tries laughing at the movie Click, I haven't seen Click so I can't really comment, but I still don't understand how they tried to take the mick out of it. They even repeated the slow down time to see a woman run joke in this movie, and it was lame here. But the movies ultimate, ultimate mistake is daring to try and laugh at Snakes on a Plane. It falls flat on its face, dramatically so. Whoever let these people try and write something funny about Snakes on a Plane needs to be forced to watch this movie back to back! I mean, what's even slightly amusing about a man trying to be like Samuel L Jackson and repeatedly saying \"I've had it with these goddamn snakes on this goddamn plane.\" And saying it at least ten times in a row! My other big moan before I call it a day and try to recuperate from watching this thing called a movie, I will basically slag off the actors as much as possible. First up is Kal Penn as Edmund, now he's probably the least eye gougingly annoying of the lot, but by the time he's on screen with Jack Swallow (the annoying version of Jack Sparrow) you get sick of him. Adam Campbell is definitely the worst male in the movie, he is just ridiculous. He does a brief Superman parody that irritates more than anything else, and the fact his ludicrous English accent just sounds well ludicrous made me despise him even more. The two lead girls are equally as awful and both deserve to stand in a corner, and bow their heads in shame. But the two cast members I'm still amazed that signed on are Crispin Glover and Jennifer Coolidge. Glover is in a disturbing but unfunny parody of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Coolidge tries to scrape some laugh as the main villain, she fails dramatically. Why these two talented actors signed on is above me, and why they even read the script still amazes me as well.Epic Movie is another front runner for worst movie of 2007. I thought Employee of the Month was bad, Employee of the Month looks like a masterpiece compared to this wretched movie.

            "content": "The fact that this horrid piece of trash got the green light is definitely a sign of the apocalypse. I'm a big fan of the parody, as a genre. We've seen great examples of it in films like \"Airplane\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie.\" Fast forward about twenty-five years later and what do we have? \"Epic Movie.\" How anyone can laugh at something this juvenile is completely foreign to me. First of all, it's supposed to be a parody of \"epic movies,\" and almost no epic movies are parodied! Do you consider \"Snakes on a Plane\" to be an epic movie? Do you consider \"Nacho Libre\" to be an epic movie? And many of the films being made fun of aren't that great in the first place. The first rule of the parody genre is to poke fun at \"good movies\"! You don't insult bad movies, because a bad movie is an insult within itself! Duh! The filmmakers didn't even make honest attempts to make each gag funny. In the parody of \"Snakes,\" an amateurish black actor plays Samuel L. Jackson and repeatedly yells out \"I'm tired of these G.D. snakes on the G.D. plane!\" Obviously, he didn't say \"G.D.,\" but the point is in the real movie he says, \"I'm tired of these motherf**kin' snakes on the motherf**kin' plane!\" But of course, that can't happen because ooooh, then the film will be slapped with an R-rating. The idea of people under the age of 17 not being permitted to see this trash is positively frightening to the studio. If you ask me, no one with an I.Q. OVER 17 should be permitted to see this movie. What I'm basically saying is the joke doesn't work because he's not even saying the same line! The joke would've worked if, first of all, the directors hired a much better actor who does a much better Sam Jackon impersonation, and second of all, used the line that was in the original movie. Because there has to be a \"truth\" to every joke! Speaking of bad actors, the cast consists primarily of amateurs. The directors probably could've snagged better actors from a high school play. There are some exceptions like Kal Penn, Tony Cox, and Fred Willard (who has the one funny scene in the movie), but obviously they're not given much to work with. I assumed at first it was Crispin Glover that played Willy Wonka in the parody of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" but then I said to myself, \"No! Crispin does a movie, like, once a decade.\" Sure enough, it was him. Say what you want about Crispin's real life persona, but he usually has much better taste in films (i.e.: \"Back to the Future\" or \"River's Edge\"). He must've been horribly desperate for a paycheck when he volunteered to participate in this amateur hour. Hector Jimenez, the actor who played Jack Black's friend in \"Nacho Libre,\" also has a role in the film. It makes me glad that his character said few lines in \"NL.\" Obviously, English is not Hector's first language, and he butchers every line of dialogue with his strained delivery. I always say it's important when you do comedy to hire actors who speak English as a first language. If that sounds racist, I'm sorry, but unless you're playing a Harpo-Marx-type role, comedy is all about inflection. Watch the movie \"Chasing Papi\" if you want to see a good example of an American comedy being executed badly by actors who don't speak the language very well.About the only incentive to watching \"Epic Movie\" is getting the chance to see Carmen Electra prance around half-naked throughout most of the flick. But even that welcome eventually gets worn out, since we later get \"treated\" to a scene where Carmen transforms into a fat woman with a unibrow. What is this trend with making Carmen do something horribly unappealing in every comedy she does? In \"Scary Movie\" there's a scene where she farts. In \"Scary Movie 4\" there's a scene where she takes a gigantic dump. Is this a conspiracy to stop men from fantasizing about Carmen? Sheesh! If crude, brainless gags about puking and peeing is your cup of tea, then \"Epic Movie\" may be the film for you. But I do suggest if you do enjoy it...please schedule an appointment with a therapist. Or make an appointment for a cat scan, at least.",

            "content": "I'm bothered by the direction that movie parodies are going. Remember the good old days when talented writers created movies like \"Airplane\" and \"The Naked Gun.\" The thing is that many of these spoof movies are turning into sketch comedies with actors embarrassing themselves trying to recreate the scenes and lines from much better movies with really bad lines thrown at them. Epic Movie is crammed so full of movie scenes thinly woven into an incoherent and pointless time-line that nothing makes sense much less remotely funny. It's basically struggling actors impersonating other actors with a lot of needless profanity, unnecessary nudity, objectionable references and failed jokes that get more a smirk than a laugh. There is nothing clever here; the film is lacking in imagination and creativity. It's parodying other movies and that's about it. It runs along as if it was made up as it went along with random references tossed it. I got to ask: \"Who approved the money that went into this?\" I tried to listen to the commentary on the DVD, but it's the commentary from another movie; the creators wouldn't even comment on their own film. The only good thing are the closing bloopers. Apparently, the actors thought what they were filming was going to be something special, and they had a lot of fun making it, but if you're going to approve a movie based on the success of two guys in another movie, you might want to read their script first.",

After watching the actual movie however I was extremely disappointed. 95% of the movie I didn't even have a little chuckle or a laugh. I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment.",

From there on, the movie consists of a bunch of people getting hit in the face over and over and over again. Most of the movie parodies The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe with stabs at The Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, Harry Potter, Click and some others. None of which are really that funny (There is a funny line about Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and that is probably the only funny \"joke\" in this movie.) The whole thing is rather pathetic on all ends. Even most of the cinematography was awful.Please do not go see this movie, because it just encourages them to make more.

Yes, there were a few (and I do mean a few) funny parts, but this entire movie could have been condensed into a MadTV skit that would have been just perfect. I literally fell asleep during the movie.

I know if you were like me you would have to go see it for yourself and make your own determination, but please, I beg you, do not see this movie, do not buy or rent the DVD.

I usually stay to the end because I keep hoping that something will happen to make it worth it, but this time, I just couldn't do it.The acting was horrible. It looks as if the script was written by the writers by simply going on a drinking binge then eating a lot and then throwing up, looking at the random chunks, and then trying to visualize letters that formed words, and then writing those imagined words down as the script. Then what you see on the screen, is the end result.I love spoof movies. Naked Gun series was excellent. The Scary Movie series was pretty good as well. Scary Movie 1 was excellent; number 2 was good, 3 had a few good moments but wasn't that great, and 4 was about as good as number 2.I do love a good spoof movie and had hight hopes for this movie. The trailer made it look great (as they are supposed to do) but in the end, it was simply worthless. I can't even believe it got the green light to be made. Another disappointment is that they had some good actors for what they were doing and they still couldn't pull it off. Jennifer Coolidge, the White Bitch, was great for that role. She is good in these types of roles but it didn't help. Really, she is the ONLY one that was any good in any of the roles.If you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T GO!!! Don't even rent it on video, it's not even worth that. I know there are a few people that have given this a rating of 10. I would say that they were either joking, being sarcastic, or slept through the whole thing and didn't want to admit it.Simply put, don't bother!!!!",

I also felt there was a lot of wasted talent in the film. Jennifer Coolidge is a brilliant comic actress but her performance in Epic Movie was cringeingly bad. Overall the funniest bits of the film were in the trailer and only 4 months into 2007, i can safely say this is the worst film of the year!!",

This movie is merely a re-shoot of all the films it parodies with different actors. There is no originality in the script, the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.The main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie, as the biological family consisted of a black father, Indian mother,and white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.I just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.The film does nothing but expand on the trailer, I recommend that if you want to see the film, watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket.",

Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows, the newly reunited family must team up with Also, a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.So two of the six writers of Scary Movie (as we keep on being reminded in the trailers so we don't forget) have come up with another 'parody' movie, but is it really necessary? The story is awful and lacks just about everything. The characters are made to be dumb for cheap laughs (yet again), the acting is a joke as none of the cast could act if their very lives depended on it and the direction was torturous.

I mean seriously is this the best filmmakers got? Tell me please this isn't what's considered comedy nowadays. Cus if it is then the film industry is in serious trouble!! Just a sad sad attempt to TRY to make human beings laugh. What we have here is a mind numbingly awful, crass, crude, ATTEMPT at comedy!! I wasted my time by turning the TV on Comedy Central to watch this 1 night! I was amazed at just how stupid and awful it actually was!! And the acting oh please just forget it!! There really is no redeeming value in this film. It's not in the Least bit funny, there is no one attractive in it, and I really didn't care about anyone in it! So please DO NOT watch the worst movie of ALL time, no really it's the worst movie EVER MADE!!!",

He looks exactly like Johnny Depp!' They should rent out some of the above films and ask themselves just WHY the pop culture parody elements in those films are funny; it's not all, or even mostly, to do with the giddy thrill of recognition.Shockingly bad.

Watching it is torture, as simple as that.Probably the worst script ever, and the most stupid and lame acting in years are only some of the millions of flaws that invade Epic Movie and make it easily the worst comedy ever made.

I did kinda look funny in the trailer but again at the time I had no idea how bad this would turn out and the worst part about this is they made even more of these godawful parodies and I even made the same mistake again and even saw Meet The Spartans. While that film was slightly better, it was still pretty damn awful. If I had a time machine I'd travel back to 2007 and warn my 18 year old self not to see this movie and that it is awful and downright unfunny and that he could spend his $5 elsewhere, maybe on some fast food meal, anything than this godawful film. A word of warning, don't buy this, rent it, watch it on Netfilx, or even YouTube for that matter. It is not worth your time, in fact rent Norbit or Jack & Jill instead. Yeah both films are still pretty awful, but they are watchable compared to this piece of crap film. In fact, any comedy not made by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg is better than this film, no matter how bad they may be. Avoid like the plague OR ELSE!!",

But, what do you know, they were actually right for once! Not only are the jokes not funny, but the movie totally lacks a proper story. It's basically a big pulp of sketches that are done randomly, then stitched together in the hope they will form some kind of movie. They try to make fun of movies who are already more crazy than this one, like the Borat movie, and it just does not click.urgh, no, I wasted too much time watching the movie already, so no point wasting more time writing about it.

They also seem to toe the line of plagiarism quite often. Honestly this movie is just garbage in every way. Writing was almost non-existent, and the acting was bad as well.

            "content": "My Take: A one-joke movie? I never thought there were any jokes at all! The tag-line of the posters of EPIC MOVIE (as well as its infamous predecessor DATE MOVIE) says that it was brought to us by 2 of the 6 writers of SCARY MOVIE. Why couldn't they have picked the two good writers? Okay, finding two 'good' writers in any of the SCARY MOVIE films need a little miracle to pull off, but why did it have to be Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? To make this question far more simple, hear this: Did the world really need a disaster that is DATE MOVIE? Well, enough blaming it all on J&B. As long as this things are making money, this guys have a job. And believe me, this is the worst job you can ever land on a Hollywood affiliation. Exhibit A: EPIC MOVIE. After the 'success' (money can do everything, you know?) of DATE MOVIE, J&A felt \"Hey! People got sucked into that one, why not make another pile of crap... I mean movie?\". And so it is. This time, the choice of parody are big 'event' blockbusters. Not sparing STAR WARS, the film also parodies scenes and story lines from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE DA VINCI CODE, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2, including lesser not-so-epic films as NACHO LIBRE, CLICK and BORAT. There are more, but it's only a waste to list them all down here. Why is that? Of all the scenes it lifts and references from other movies, none of them really are funny. J&B really have to know that, in making a movie parody, it's not enough to simple get the scenes and re-paste them right here, they have to make them funny. And when I mean funny, I mean hilarious. Not gross, icky and poor excuse for a sex joke. But the real term of funny doesn't seem to be on the J&A vocabulary. In fact, I bet if they even try to look it up, they'll end up with the same old fiasco of EPIC MOVIE. Apparently, their taste of humor are far different from the audiences. Still, what baffles me more than this films being god-awful disasters, is the fact that these films actually make money. Seeing this film actually going somewhere after opening night is a sign of the Apocalypse. Has the standards for entertainment really have gone into this? Looking at the bright side, I bet any of this films won't see the light of day after many years. Someday, a guy runs up to you and asks \"Hey! You remember that movie called EPIC MOVIE?\". And after answering with a \"No\", the guy replies \"Of course you don't! I don't either.\" EPIC MOVIE isn't the kind of movie that stands the test of time. In fact, any movie under the shadow of the infamous J&A will never see light in a matter of years. I'd like to make my testimony of hating this film a little longer, but I have a couple more J&A films coming soon, and I plan to save whatever speeches and adjectives I can think of right now for later. For now, I say don't see EPIC MOVIE, and when I mean don't see it, don't wait for it even when it comes to TV. Unless if you, like me, haven't seen a bad movie for a very long time, and really wanting to hate something real bad. Then, in that case, EPIC MOVIE is a movie for you. Rating: 0 out of 5.",

            "content": "Earlier this year, probably while \"Epic Movie\" was playing in theatres, I can't remember how, but I came across its page on this site. I had never heard of it beforehand. Seeing that it was in the Bottom 100, I did not intend to go and see it on the big screen, but after it came into stores, I rented it. In the end, I was not left wondering why this parody movie was so hated, and I'm now joining the thousands of others who have given it the lowest possible vote on IMDb, 1/10! Four orphaned teenagers, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edward, all win golden tickets to go on an epic adventure! However, while in Willy Wonka's factory, they learn that he wants to use certain body parts of theirs to make candy! They manage to escape, but the evil chocolate factory owner is after them, so they must all find a place to hide! Lucy finds a wardrobe to hide in, but after she enters, she soon finds herself in the land of Gnarnia! Soon, the other three also end up in Gnarnia, and all four of them find themselves in more danger! Their new enemy is the evil ruler of the land, the White B*&#%! Unfortunately, Edward is fooled by this villain and becomes her prisoner, so the others have to try and save him! Why is this parody of several movies from recent years so bad? Well, basically because it's incredibly stupid! Now, comedies can be incredibly stupid in a good way, but \"Epic Movie\" is in a very bad and frightening way! Not every single moment of this movie is absolutely disgusting, but a lot of it is! I usually don't have a problem with crude sex jokes and toilet humour, and there's plenty of that kind of humour in this movie, but here, it's done extremely poorly! Terrible \"gags\" include Willy Wonka wanting to use the main characters for candy (especially the \"nuts\" part), a pregnant Hermione (from the Harry Potter stories, but portrayed a lot differently in this movie) farting, Susan throwing up all over the place, the sex scene with Peter and Mystique (from \"X-Men\"), among others! Some of these may be worse than they sound, and the gags that are not outright bad are simply mediocre, so they are of no significance.I haven't seen every movie satirized (I don't know if \"satirized\" is the right word, more like \"ripped off\") in this spoof, but have seen a handful of them, and they're all better than this, even if some are not that good. Not that good is better than horrendous! The ones I haven't seen, I would probably MUCH rather watch any of them than this stinker! Spoof movies can be very funny, and one can enjoy them whether they're a fan of the movie(s) they parody or not. However, with this 2007 flop, it's the opposite! It doesn't matter what you think of the movies lampooned here, because this horrible excuse for a movie is unacceptable either way! What was everyone involved in this steaming pile thinking?! Trust me, if you have any taste whatsoever, and the word \"intelligence\" means something to you, you do NOT want to watch \"Epic Movie\"! I don't know how long this will stay in the IMDb Bottom 100, but for however long it stays there, it's a good place for it!",

Probably because they tried to stuff too much into too flimsy a container. Even though the movie is relatively short, people, and I was one of them, began walking out not even half way through it. Save your money and rent it from NETFLIX, as it is sure to be there shortly. I also thought that the movie's passing homage made to bestiality, should have denied it it's PG-13 rating.

Epic Movie got like 4 laughs, while they were incredibly stupid and predictable jokes, I admit there were a couple parts I couldn't help but laugh too, like the Click parody and the Jack \"Swallows\" character. There were so many mistakes in this film, I think some were done intentionally though and people were kinda going crazy on them.Four orphans go to a chocolate factory where they discover a closet, where the inside leads to the world of Gnarnia. But it's being ruled by, well, a white B-word, the land needs saving. The four orphans discover not only that they are related, but that they are destined to take over the land and save the goat like people, with some other parody characters.Epic Movie is annoying, stupid, and immature, but I think people did jump a little too fast to just give it the most nasty review possible. I mean, come on, I think there are WORSE films, we know it. This is a movie you might just wanna open your mind too and see where it goes, like I said, it's a stupid movie that I would not be surprised if it got a couple razzie awards, but I think you might get a couple of silly laughs.2/10",

Luckily they find a wardrobe that sends them to the magical world of gnarnia where the Whitebitch (Jennifer Coolidge) rules over the land, the half-man half-lion named Also (Fred Willard) and characters from other movies like \"Harry Potter\", \"Superman Returns\", \"Borat\", \"Star Wars\", \"Casino Royale\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" etc. to battle her.Truly terrible and unfunny spoof movie from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer! some of the movies in this feature that they attempt to spoof are hardly epic like \"Borat\", \"Legally Blonde\", \"Snakes on a Plane\", \"Tallageda Nights\", etc. but there are a few movies that are epic like \"Narnia\", \"LOTR\" and \"Star Wars\" even \"Harry Potter\" that they spoof but fail. The rest of the film is just crummy references to recent stuff, pop culture and stuff they read from tabloids. The so-called humor in this movie is groan inducing and not witty at all, it's just plain crappy as it just doesn't make you laugh but more like turn your stomachs into knots. I mean, come on?

Yes I do realize it's supposed to be a comedy but a movie needs to have a script for it to actually work. These movies just parody random scenes from movies and then try to make them fit together. You go from Borat, Prince of Narnia, to Pirates of the Caribbean and it's just mind numbingly bad there's no cohesion between the scenes and it makes it that much more painful to watch. There's not a single funny moment in this movie. NOT ONE. I challenge anyone to find a scene that is actually funny and gives you a hint of a smile. The acting is terrible, the set pieces are absolutely horrible, and the only people who find this remotely funny are 13 year old prepubescent teens.

How these guys keep managing to make more films (Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, and now Disaster Movie) amazes me.

There is a line to be crossed with that kind of 'comedy' and it was definitely crossed. All it seemed to be about was sex, half naked girls, racial jokes and general lameness. I don't think I laughed at all but maybe smiled at one point. Some parts of it seemed to be completely random and irrelevant. Maybe it's just that American comedy isn't funny, or that this movie took it to a whole new level of dumb. It's also very short, which I suppose is a good thing because any longer and I might've walked out. The person I went with agreed that it was rubbish. I think that'll do.

I hear Disaster Movie was pretty awful but 'Fool me once...' and all that, I dodged the bullet of watching it.The whole mindnumbing experience is simply a series of pathetic spoofs of blockbusters, with the merest thread holding the weak storyline together. Basically, there is no point going into what little plot there is as you would need a death wish to watch it after the sound advice on this site. Of course, some of you will watch it to see if it is indeed as bad as people are saying. Trust me - it is. And it's not funny in a 'so bad it's funny' kind of way. This is no Plan 9 From Outer Space!

In fact, you will likely sit quietly seething, grinding your teeth and clenching your fists.The idiots responsible for this detritus should be imprisoned for crimes against humanity.

Among other things, it had a plot and didn't needlessly generate discordance (hey, since we're speaking of spoilers, I'll put in a spoiler for people - Will Farrell's Get Hard. period).Point being, it's a lampoon of movies which came out at the time. And overall, it handled those lampoons quite well, and where it succeeded was making me feel relaxed and not perturbed (Will Farrell's Get Hard, people). So, jokes apart, watch it.

I left feeling dumber than the two of the six writers of Scary Movie series who directed this masterpiece. Then again, I can only blame myself, as the trailers looked dreadful and it was by only 1/3 of the Scary Movie team (probably the ones who took a massive pay-cut).There are a few funny moments in Epic Movie: Borat appearing in the end was funny, as he says in broken English, \"Yes a-man,\" or whatever that funny thing he says in Borat is. Seeing him in the green thong was disturbing, but funny. Jack Sparrow (hilariously titled Jack Swallows here- please notice the sarcasm) makes an appearance, providing some funny scenes; at least the directors knew that the best part of Pirate's of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest was the wheel fighting scene, and they took advantage of that by including it in Epic Movie.Now for the rest of the film\u0085ouch. Directors Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer and their team of crack heads try so hard to be funny, but the only people who should be laughing are little kids and people who are smart enough to avoid watching this movie.

Drawing its material from some of the largest \"summer\" blockbusters, like The Da Vinci Code, X-Men, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Borat, Pirates of the Caribbean, Nacho Libre, Click, Snakes on a Plane, Fast and the Furious, Harry Potter and Superman Returns, Epic Movie follows the formula of taking a mickey out of genre movies. Written and directed by two of the many writers who gave us Scary Movie (a dig on horrors, thrillers and slasher flicks, the strongest of the franchise and still going), and Date Movie (one off bomb, taking a dig on romantic movies), Epic Movie is uninspiring, and the jokes are very lame.In fact, I found myself yawning at the juvenile antics on screen, playing up plenty of times at the expense of sexuality - big boobs, kinky names, and countless gyrating female bodies. Even Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge makes an appearance as the White Bitch, as do many other celebrities having themselves spoofed at by lookalikes - P Diddy, Ashton Kutcher, Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton, Michael Jackson, Samuel L Jackson, James Blonde, I mean Bond, even, and various Star Wars characters . Even theme songs from the movies get parodied, the most obvious being Teriyaki Boyz's Tokyo Drift theme.The only kudos you can give to the filmmakers, are how they try to gel all these skits into one coherent movie - having all the different movies put together into a common thread is indeed a challenge, and you can't deny the effort. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe forms the backbone of the story, while the rest are scenes which tangent off, or brought together into the world of Gnarnia. The sets too from the movies it adapted from also get recreated, probably on the cheap, and they do look as good as the original (if not gotten from them).To really make your money's worth, stay throughout the end credits which run pretty long, where you'll see three sequences at various points, and you can bolt out of the door once you see the jab on Mel Gibson. For those who want to give this a miss on the big screen, a word of advice, don't even rent it on VCD unless it's free.",

I saw a number of people walking out, by the middle of the movie. The commercial was funnier than the movie, and that says a lot in itself.I DO NOT Recommend IT, even i it was the last movie in existence. I thought with some many funny jokes possible with all those movies out, they would of come up with funnier spoofs.

For SOME INSANE reason my friend wanted to see this movie in the theaters. Well after seeing that I vowed to NEVER watch that movie again.I was at another friend's house one day and they had RENTED this for some reason (I must have some retarded friends or they at least have TERRIBLE tastes in film I guess...at least some of the time). One of them wanted to watch it. I ended up having to sit through a majority of it a second time. Well it turns out the second time was the \"unrated\" version (it just had different takes of the same shots where they said the F-word instead of what they said in the theatrical version of the film). It was no longer. Thank God. It sucks that it wasn't made shorter though because this film is TORTURE to sit though even ONCE.Up until seeing Epic Movie, the \"worst film I had ever seen\" title went to a movie my friend showed me one time called \"Malibu Beach Vampires\". I have seen parts of \"Malibu Beach Vampires\" since watching Epic Movie and \"Malibu Beach Vampires\" doesn't look like such a bad movie anymore.I'm serious, I have NEVER EVER seen a movie that I just absolutely HATED the entire time I was watching it, but THIS is the first. I have disliked movies, I have not been able to stand some movies, but there has NEVER EVER been a film I just completely hated before I saw this film. They try to make everything so wacky and it's just SO BADLY GRASPING for laughs that (when I saw it in theaters) no one was laughing! They think that the more retarded hip hop musical sequences and midgets there are in this movie, the funnier it'll be. Well I'll say it was more and more clich\u00e9, stupid, and annoying the more it went on.The film relies more on parodies than it does a cohesive story or any jokes that are actually supposed to be funny. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer I cannot stand you two. I hate to say it but you two SUCK. Your previous films have been \"parody\" comedies (if you can even call them comical in ANY WAY) and just recycle previously used jokes. A joke is funny when it's the real thing, not when it's a rip off, generic version of the same joke that was previously told in a better fashion.Jason and Aaron, I hope that you two never make another film again (even though sadly they ARE making another film) because your movies are unoriginal, generic, filled with horrid acting, reused jokes, and just abominations in the eyes of God and all of his people (which includes the entire human race). I'll say it again, before seeing this movie, I have never EVER just outright HATED a film but Jason and Aaron, your movie SUCKS! I intend to be a filmmaker myself and I can say that the few shorts I've made will entertain people more than this piece of trash.DO NOT see Epic Movie if you want to keep your soul in one piece. After watching this trash, I feel that a part of me has died and I want my money back for having supported this horrifying abomination. If Jason and Aaron expect me to see their NEXT film, they will have to pay ME because Epic movie was one of the WORST things I've ever witnessed in my life and will be one of those things I will shield my kids away from seeing some day.

I mean in the Pirates of the Caribbean scene, where in the actual POTC movie did it involve half dressed women, gyrating in front of the camera? Same with the first scene of The Lion, Witch and the Waredrobe. That's not parody, it's stupid, a bucket of sand could've wrote better material than this.Not only was the parody material very weak, the jokes (if there were any) and the humour in general was just not funny. I never even laughed or reacted at anything in this movie because there's nothing to laugh at.Those are the two point's that stood out to me while making the huge mistake of watching this movie, that and the fact that it was just awful in general, not worth watching even just to kill a empty 70 minutes of time.

Because I refer to a Marvel superhero but say nothing funny about it. That's how most of the movie's references work. The ones they try to make a parody out of are just ruined one way or another, and without a proper storyline with actual effort put into it, that's really all the film is hanging on.The film is terribly unfunny from start to finish and all I could think of while watching it, was: \"Make it stop\".

Its childish immature humour makes the film sound and look like it was written by a 9 year old child.This is the only film i have ever walked out of the cinema while watching and the only comedy I can remember where i failed to laugh at all, not even a slight chuckle. the jokes are horrendously awful and they even go as far as steeling...THEIVING from Laural and Hardy a joke that only they could make funny(its the \"OUCH you standing on my foot\"/DA vinci code bit) awful i hope you agree.I am trying really hard to think of a reason why studios make films of such a consistently low standard. parodying films that are much better (borat) and films that are a lot better but still not that good (snakes on a plane-most unfunny parody of all time). The reason is that the make money and there is indeed a market for them, that is perhaps the scariest thing of all.over all id say this film is a disaster there are times where i may say \"not my thing\" or \"I can see why people like it\" but no. I find it hard to believe that an actual human could find this funny but then again A LOT of people must have. DEAR OH DEAR!!IF you are thinking of watching it, DO!! so then you can inform everybody of the horrors that EPIC MOVIE has to offer. This film doesn't even fall into the file \"so bad it's good\" need i say more ? no so i'm not going to.total garbage 1 out of 10",

Willy Wonka treats them like slaves in the factory by making them do everything. the find a closet while hiding from Willy Wonka and go to a huge snowy place. watch the movie to find out what happens.",

            "content": "This is nothing but a very bad comedy. Very bad to a degree that made it a full lesson in making a bad comedy:_The repeating: I don't know how to stand this in comedy. What really exploded the movie, and maybe its viewer, was that the repeating this time came not only for many times, but in many forms too. To instance, repeating the lines sickly like the ones of (Samuel L. Jackson)'s impersonator, or the ones of (Lucy - 2014)'s character (yet endlessly!). And repeating the jokes as well, starting with \"You're standing on my body\" of (David Carradine) coming from other movies, to the matter - it's the matters - of \"human married an animal\", ending with the urinating; which's ugly unfunny one in the first place. This is boring, before being poor and so stupid!_The repugnant impersonators. The problem is that THEY ALL CAN'T DO COMEDY; their only talent is looking and talking like someone. And the bigger problem is that they are just too many: (Samuel L. Jackson) from (Snakes on a Plane - 2006), (Johnny Depp) form (Pirates of the Caribbean), (Jack Black) from (Nacho Libre - 2006), (Paris Hilton), (Borat), the (X-Men) team, and the worst of them all, the one who did (Johnny Depp) from (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - 2005); he was unbearable and creepy!_The parodies are totally meaningless. Some parody movies, the smart ones, used to mock at real bad points in other movies. But here, forget it. So I didn't even smile at the (Harry Potter) segment. Simply, they selected this time not impersonators to do the job, but old people. That could have meant anything if the actors in the original movie were actually older than their characters!_It mocks at the image goofs of the movies; with the stuntman, of the lion-man king, is so visible as Asian. Or using a doll as a body double; like in the cell scene. But that was outrageous and very embarrassing itself, since the movie is replete with great number of its own goofs. For example, someone is dead then comes back to life, someone is torn-apart then be complete in the next scene, someone is stabbed then no wound of any kind is appearing, Ahhh, the list is awfully LONG; which makes me ask, what kind of nasty drug the movie's 2 writers and directors were on?!!!_When it's as wretched as that; throw in sex jokes. But even if, the ones in here are no less wretched themselves. It hit the rock bottom of cheap triteness, being perversely adolescent, or wildly disgusting, all under the name of comedy?! This is disturbed and disturbing!_The dated jokes about insignificant things, such as ads, TV programs.. etc. Namely, it isn't enough to produce slight gags that only few, only American, viewers, who would understand, No, they must be dull too, so no one would laugh!!_The plot: It's surrealism meets serious idiocy. This movie says a lot about how writing a parody movie has become so easy job to do. It takes only a viewing to some \"actual\" movies, then re-assembling them horrendously. Still, the surprise is that this easy horrendous movie is produced by major studio?!! I know homemade videos that are extremely comic compared to (Epic Movie) and no Hollywood producer cared about them, even for making good money or good comedy!While it is a spoof, it needs a spoof. On second thought, it doesn't deserve the efforts. It's where the only thing with work behind it; is (Carmen Electra)'s make up as (Mystique)!Fairly, I loved factors from it; (Jayma Mays) is one. There is a magically delicate secret about her in this movie; the line between childhood and femininity, she danced on it attractively. Some motion in the first sequence of presenting the main characters seemed good. And the (Punk'd - 2003) part; at last, someone punched (Ashton Kutcher) on the behalf of us, taking revenge from his annoyance. But none of this or that could make up for the painful rest!(Epic Movie) is a course for anyone who wants to make a comedy; as the consummate guide of \"Don't do that again\". Let alone that it fits perfectly as a comedy, a black one, about the production system in Hollywood lately. And finally, it solves the mystery of (David Carradine)'s death. The poor thing must have watched it, then hanged himself right off regretfully!",

It's just a lightning fast parody of many movies of those years. And here we come to the biggest problem; there are too many movies lampooned and so much jokes to cram in one film. Many of the movies spoofed are HARRY POTTER, X MEN, SNAKES ON A PLANE, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (with Crispin Glover in the role originally by Johnny Depp), THE DAVINCI CODE and some others, but 90% of the jokes never worked.Now please understand, I can enjoy a parody of various movies.

Basically four troubled orphans: Edward (Kal Penn), Peter (Adam Campbell), Lucy (Jayma Mays) and Susan (Faune A. Chambers), from four scenarios, are brought together after getting a golden ticket to a wacky chocolate factory, only to be trapped by its owner Willy (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover). Hiding from the scary chocolate maker, Lucy gets into a wardrobe leading to the magical world of \"Gnarnia\", greeted by Mr. Tumnus (H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez), who tells her everything she needs to know. Soon Edward enters the world too, and meets its ruler, the nasty but sexy White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge), who obviously needs to be defeated for everyone's freedom. Soon all orphans are in Gnarnia and all find out eventually that they are related, and that they are prophesied to take over Gnarnia. After seeking a little help from randy lion-man Also (Fred Willard), some training at the castle of Harry Potter (Kevin McDonald), and joining the armies of X-Men heroes and swash-buckling pirates, without drunk Captain Jack Swallows (Darrell Hammond), the battle for freedom begins. Featuring attempted spoofs of The Da Vinci Code, Snakes on a Plane, Nacho Libre (Jareb Dauplaise), X-Men: The Last Stand, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Mission: Impossible III, Superman Returns, Punk'd, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Casino Royale, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Click.

            "content": "The creators of Date Movie bring us an actually decent spoof film the one and only Epic Movie.While certain things are stale and lame most of the spoofs and jokes are funny and therefore the good humor outweighs the bad humor making Epic Movie a pretty enjoyable experience.I think for the most part the acting is good very TV sitcom like which i find hilarious.They make fun of every hit movie in the book X-Men,Superman,Pirates Of The Caribbean,Narnia,Harry Potter etc. and for the most part they do a good job and create some funny spoofs.Quite like Date Movie Epic Movie has a lot of random humor and seems to attempt at trying a Family Guy style and while that made Date Movie fail it makes Epic Movie pass because the jokes don't come out of nowhere and have a stupid punchline or no punchline at all the prime reason Date Movie sucked so badly.This is kind of like watching a sketch comedy series and although they have a thin main storyline that links things together for the most part you're wondering what's going to be spoofed next so you really don't care much about the actual characters.Date Movie also had a very sketch comedy feel but more of a low budget sketch comedy show like Comedy Inc or The Underground (lots of unfulfilled potential)whereas Epic Movie has good quality spoofs and is more of a Mad TV,Saturday Night Live feel.Date Movie made spoofs to a lot of things that weren't well known so to most the spoofs seemed like they made no sense but Epic Movie was smart and spoofed films almost everyone has seen therefore it is a lot funnier to people and they actually understand the jokes.Is this as good as Airplane!, Space Balls, or South Park?Certainly not but it's not as bad as Plump Fiction or Date Movie it's on the same fence as The Scary Movie franchise which I say is a huge step up from the directors last bomb (Date Movie).Overall i enjoyed the film it's funny not overly hilarious but there are quite a few laughs enjoy it for what it is.",

Even TV reality shows get spoofed to extend its lame running time!I only watched it to give my brain a break, but didn't think it'd break my balls with its inane plot! Kumar and White Castle are added to poor Kal Penn's scenes, as if the rest of the film isn't embarrassing enough!As another reviewer stated, only 2 laughs to be had!",

What do they have to lose they already lost respect from almost everyone.There work has already rubbed off on another Scary Movie writer. Craig Mazin who made Superhero Movie is trying there way to. I am yet to see Superhero Movie. But it does look like another piece of trash.The humor in this is terrible. The jokes go on and on and on. Not funny at all. If you think watching a Da Vinci Code spoof with break dancing is funny then you will like it. But for me it was terrible. The worse movie to come out in 2007.I don't recommend this. I wouldn't even recommend to someone i hate. The only reason you should be caught watching this is to see how bad it is for yourself.So we have yet another spoof movie from two of the worse directors/writers in movies today. Sorry Seltzer and Friedberg you two are probably really nice guys but I HATE YOUR MOVIES.1/10",

Oh, this was something else! Me and some friends went to see it thinking it would be mildly entertaining... WRONG! The acting was horrible, the jokes were irrelevant, not funny,and actually stolen from real movies (when wolverine flipped off whats his face in epic movie, it actually came from an actual x-men movie), and we were tempted to walk out, but we hoped it would get funnier. It didn't. I don't remember a single time that I laughed during the movie, and quite frankly I'm getting really tired of the almost naked girls running around for no good reason (apparently the sexual fantasies of a 12 year old), the oral sex jokes, the irrelevant cultural references (Sudoku? please. A fifth grader could've thought of better jokes), and the potty humor. A 6th grader could've thought of a better movie, simply because I'm guessing that's what the target audience was. I'll give everyone a few words of advice: 1.Don't even bother with this at all. I wouldn't even waste money renting the DVD. 2. If you actually want to see a parody of these god awful movies that shows them for what they really are, search \"Vague Genre Movie\" on Youtube. Not only is it hilarious (made by Maddox), it's free and about 10 times more entertaining.",

I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you. However, for me, it was all in very bad taste. I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started. This was certainly not intended to be a kid's movie. I don't even think I would let a teenager watch this one. It took one of the best kid's movies ever made and turned it into a nightmare. We felt it was so bad that we immediately had to go see another movie to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the horrible images out of our heads. Parents BEWARE! This is not an appropriate movie for anyone under the age of 21!! And even then, I wouldn't suggest it.

I can't criticise this dirge highly enough. Due to the nature of my work, I get to see a lot of films and I'll go out on a limb and say this is by far the worst film I've ever seen. The plot is so thin it's transparent and the humour is so lowbrow, it's practically underfoot. And I thought the recently released Employee of the Month was bad! I've seen a few films of this genre (the scary movies etc) and found them to be OK, quite entertaining and humorous in parts, but this film has no redeeming features whatsoever. I honestly didn't laugh once. If you find this film funny, you are either a moron or in serious need of a humour transplant. It's obviously just a cash in and no thought has gone into it whatsoever. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and the jokes are so bad and so ill thought out, they are cringe-worthy (chocolate river is actually a river of excrement - a bit like this film - hysterical. Man gets bitten on the crotch by a snake \u0096 genius). It makes me cringe to actually think that I actually sat through this mess. The best thing about the film is the running time, about 80 minutes (even though it feels like a lifetime).I know the film is 12A but that is no excuse for a lack of plot or humour. There are many films of 12A or less that are far superior and funnier than this drivel. If you're thinking of going to see this film, don't. It really is that bad.",

It's a disgrace to the classic and or brilliant films we all enjoy. Boring Predictable, as a parody film usually is. un-original silly the humor is just pointless use of 'slap-stick' , lame sexual humor, and manipulating other films in a predictable way. A Waste of time. The Villon / 'bady' of the film's name is the white bitch of Gnarnia, originating from the white witch of Narnia. Congrats guys, you can think of words that rhyme!

(*sarcasm*)The writers/directors seem to be under the impression that humour stems from throwing in as many references as possible. The same with gross-out humour. It was really disturbing to look at half of the time.I genuinely remember thinking one scene in the film was funny (or rather, the trailer) and it's when Jayma Mays' character discovers the iconic wardrobe from Narnia, opens it and a tonne of junk and random items come bursting out of it and fall on top of her. Not a hilarious joke, but funny when I was 13. The scene plays in the actual film, the junk falls on top of Jayma Mays, and then in the next shot, a fully nude woman comes running out of the wardrobe.

Jennifer Coolidge will appear in anything.2.) So will Carmen Electra.To say this is a parody movie is an insult to parody movies. What in the hell were Crispin Glover and David Carradine doing in this? And Kevin Mcdonald's paychecks must have really dried up since \"Kids in the Hall\" ended. Even with Coolidge forever immortalized as the \"MILF\" i've seen her in funny roles, wicked roles and even charming ones. She's capable of a lot more than this and the dreaded \"Pootie Tang\". If I can find something nice to say it's that her wardrobe and hair were pretty cool.Kal Penn, in a rare time out from stoner films takes on the only role capable of making him look dumber. Adam Campbell annoyed the living s**t out of me, and most of the other supporting cast barely put out a detectable pulse, and therefore aren't worth the mention.However, as much as it pains me, there were two parts of this movie which I actually thought didn't suck.The first, the fight with the \"monk\" and Fred Willard. I thought it was actually kinda funny they way they kept switching between Fred Willard, and the Asian stunt guy. (No mistake, it was meant to be obvious.) And the second was Darrell Hammond, who actually escapes the talent sucking soul that is this film, and does a pretty good Jack Sparrow impression. (Jack Swallows.) I couldn't tell it was Hammond at all, he's got the look, voice and mannerisms. If you add up the screen time for those two parts, it amounts to less than ten minutes.

This movie was totally garbage and whoever made it should be ashamed of themselves. Hollywood is turning out some real crap these days. There are enough problems in our world today.

What made these films classic were the nonstop assault on the funny bone with continuous sight gags, wacky comments, and ridiculous situations. This movie just stumbled from the get-go and left the audience to try to find any bit of humor in any manner they could from what they were being presented on the screen. Any joke that was offered was grade school humor and was overplayed and extended to the point of being annoying. How many stupid spoof rap videos can be randomly inserted into scenes of a movie? How many times can one person get kicked between the legs? It was if the movie intended to be played by second graders in a school pageant! And even that would have been a major improvement! As for the actual acting (if you can call it that), it seems that the cast just wanted to get over with filming and collect their pay. Someone else described this movie perfectly, as being a really bad extended \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.With that said, you can take this review as being useful or not.

I won't even go into the plot, I'll just say: Avoid Epic Movie.Other than the god awful script (I mean, just awful rehash of a bunch of movies thrown together), the less than great acting and the poorly executed timing..........well, okay, this movie's got nothing. I laughed, nay, chuckled once at something that wasn't actually funny, but it hit me enough to elicit a small chuckle. I can't even remember what the bit was, but it wouldn't make SNL these days, and we all know how bad that's been the last decade. Now, I'm of the school that Date Movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I still stand by that assessment and this one is actually better than that one. But, by better I mean bottom 20 and and not bottom 10 of all time. If there's something good to be taken from this it's this: if you're a young filmmaker (or going to school to be one), this gives you hope that you can get something green lighted by someone somewhere. If these two guys (who might be the worst comedy writing team since the dawn of man) can sucker people into green lighting two of the worst scripts the world has ever seen, than anyone can get their idea made into a feature length movie, even if it's near Ed Wood quality. Some thoughts on the actors: I do admit that the Mays chick is kinda cute-ish, but I'm partial to redheads. She's not fantastic in any sense, just cute-ish. Meanwhile, Kal Penn is losing his humorous touch, I think. Between this and the apparently awful Van Wilder 2 (I was spared that one, thank you Satan), I think he's just about finished, which is almost too bad, but then, how far can you go being a one trick pony? And the Campbell guy........I really just haven't gotten his appeal as an actor. He's goofy looking, he has very odd facial expressions and isn't much with the comic timing, so it's not hard to see how he's been in two of the worst 'comedies' of the last 2 years. Oh, and Carmen Electra does her usual slow-motion body rub that would win some AVN awards but will never do her any good in the mainstream acting world. Can't go without that, right?If that's a spoiler, than standards are too low. See it if you must, but trust a man when he implores you that this is one of the worst movies he's ever seen.

Their interpretation of a gag consists mainly of people/animals getting hit, preferably in the crotch. Gets pretty dull after the, erm, 20th time? In conclusion, the movie is so boring it's not even worth watching it for making fun of it. Doesn't work, just a wast of time.

Don't worry this is much much better than date movie, and i will recommend it to everyone.I guess the only problem or the only part which i didn't like at all was the one which made fun of snakes on a plane it was really lame and irritating.

Secondly, I think I lost at least nine brain cells in this terrible spoof. Thirdly, the acting was worse than in any movie I have seen. Sure, they made me laugh at least once, but only once in an hour and twenty minute movie, that was supposed to be a comedy, not an idiot movie. The same jokes were lapped over and over and over again, until I almost fell asleep. During the first five minutes, I could tell that this movie was going to fail. I even saw twelve people leave. Well, to tell you the truth, I never even wanted to watch the movie in the first place, but all the other movies were uninteresting, and I was bored as hell, so I just decided to watch it, I got out bored than before.",

Its a natural idea, since the genres that are the target are always about other movies anyway. The meat of the joke is how many films are used and how they are shown to be so similar.The second kind is the ordinary sort, gags that are supposed to make us chuckle, quite apart from the referential humor. Over time, these jokes have become more puerile, as we've moved from the Zuckers to the Waylons to these guys. You know, I can tolerate a lot on that front, so long as the backbone of the thing is rich. Actually, this is. Enough so that I will watch the next one, even though I'd prefer the decoration to be intelligent. I fondly remember Leslie Neilson's elaborate setup in \"Airplane\" which ended in \"ham on white and hold the Mayo.\" And so far as references to films, my favorite approach is oblique, like the second \"Charlie's Angels.\"What's interesting to me is the two women here. One is the reliable Jennifer Coolidge, who with Parker Posey is the way Christopher Guest penetrates into our ordinary films. Her comedy always references outside worlds. She anchors this.The other woman plays a stupid teen. She's a redhead. Her character's running joke is that she repeats what the other girl says. I have a minor study in redheads in film. Its the most reliable quantum states in film. She's not a talented actress, not an actress at all. It doesn't matter because she likely has been exposed to these personalities all her life. Its the one thing that saves the superficial jokes. Writers know this redhead rule. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

If you think the way to spoof \"Snakes on a Plane\" is to have a plane with snakes on it, then this is pretty much the level of originality to expect here. \"Nacho Libre\" - hey, a Mexican Jack-Black clone wrester in an identical costume... with nachos! Woo! No-body will ever think of that gag, right viewers?

Well, is it bad? For me, obviously not. It was much better than \"Date Movie\" and you can tell the filmmakers that they actually changed some of their plans to make this movie funnier. And it is.I would compare this to \"Monty Python's Holy Grail\" because this film has its shares of laughs and unfunny jokes. The good thing is the movie is really quite refreshing in a way. Why? They never actually spoofed fantasy movies before. Does it make a difference? Yes, it does.What gets better in this movie other than the jokes are the elaborate costumes, the extensive (and wonderful) set designs, special effects, and score, if you care to know about any of that. Although you may think it's a bigger budget than \"Date Movie\", it's surprisingly the same, if that interests you.The jokes in here are funny because it mocks other films, makes obvious clich\u00e9s and surprisingly turns them the other way, one continuing joke which I found really funny even if it goes throughout the film, a joke they continued from \"Date Movie\" (the obvious stunt double and dummy), and the randomness.The target audience is apparent: Those who have and liked \"Date Movie\" or have seen the films spoofed in here, including \"Nacho Libre,\" \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" the \"X-Men\" pictures, \"Superman Returns\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", and a lot more. More or less, put that down to teens.So, if you're a wise adult, you probably wouldn't be surprised not liking this movie. I, on the other hand, am a teen, and it's not surprising enough that I enjoyed it very much so. Also, I like to applaud Jayma Mays for her very funny role and others like Jennifer Coolidge and Faune A. Chambers.If you're a person who doesn't like stupid comedies with some immature and childish jokes, unlike \"Knocked Up\", you should stay very far away from this. Why would you see it? You know what to expect. If you're a person who's in their teens or just like to have a good short time, then watch this. There's no harm to go through it for a short 80 minutes.",

Going into it, I honestly was not expecting a whole lot from it. Scary Movie 1 had a couple of redeeming qualities, but they had been getting progressively worse. Date Movie, in my opinion, was the worst so far. That is, until I saw Epic Movie. There is not one moment of this film that I enjoyed. Every joke they did has been done to death. Every other scene in the film, they break out into a rap song. If this movie was rated R and had nudity in it, it might have given me something to look forward to. But alas, Carmen Electra was never seen nude. This is the worst piece of garbage to touch the face of this planet since Vlad the Impailer.SPOILER BELOW*****Not that there is anything to spoil because the movie is worthless, but in a scene where they are making fun of Snakes on a Plane, a man dressed as Samuel L Jackson comes in and says \"I'm tired of these god d*mn snakes on this god d*mn plane.\" He repeats the phrase four times to try and be funny. He failed miserably. They spoofed a movie which was almost a spoof in and of itself. Also, they couldn't say f*ck because of the PG-13 rating. To quote a co-worker, they have to repeat the jokes in the movie, in case you did not realize that they were trying to be funny. For example, someone spoofing Pirates of the Caribbean bursts in and says \"I'm Captain Jack Swallows\". Then, Kal Penn says \"Swallows?!?!\" that stupidly fake inquisitive tone. The repetition of the joke was unnecessary because it was not funny the first time, and therefore, the second time will make me despise it even more. This movie is crap.",

            "content": "Epic Movie (2007): Dir: Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer / Cast: Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Crispin Glover, Tony Cox: Satire making fun of massive productions in big films. Four orphans travel to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory only to escape through a closet into the land of Gnarnia ruled by the evil White Bitch. Starts with promise before showcasing cheap production values and overplayed jokes about urination, vomiting and bestiality. Directed half heartedly by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who prove that two people can make just as bad a film as a solo individual. Kal Penn seems stranded among the victims as he searches for answers. Jennifer Coolidge is typecast as the White Bitch whose ambition is to rule Gnarnia. Fred Willard plays a sex addicted man lion whose transformation from human to lion ranks among the worst display of special effects. Crispin Glover appears as Willy Wonka in full Michael Jackson mode. Glover is funny for the brief time he is present but perhaps more footage would have hit home. Tony Cox is also featured as the dwarf henchman for Coolidge but he presence is becoming tiring in these film and too much of a self parody. Making fun of epic movies, particularly The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it becomes one big embarrassing epic for one's patience. Score: 3 / 10",

            "content": "Obviously, I am not going to be the first person to crap on Epic Movie. It is a sweltering turd, and you absolutely should not watch it. Now, it is worth point out that I am a giant fan of kitsch and camp, and love gems like \"Troll 2\" and \"Freddy Got Fingered\". Sometimes, if a movie can stretch itself too being ridiculously absurd, it can actually manage to develop its own sense of charm. This simply is not the case with Epic Movie.And honestly, I expected it to be a bit more likable as camp. After all, cult favorites David Carradine and Crispin Glover appear in it. However, their appearances are little more than cameos, and neither are given an opportunity to camp things up appropriately.So what makes this movie fail so detrimentally? For one, the writers spend too much time explaining their jokes. They should take notes from the Coen brothers on this one. They obviously feel the audience is completely retarded. But since this movie has an IMDb overall rating of 2, they apparently misjudged the audience. Second off, it would help if the jokes were funny. The typical joke for this movie is making a pop culture movie reference (may or may not be from an actual epic movie), point out where the reference came from, and turn it into a fart joke. I honestly laughed at no more than two of their jokes, and those laughs were more light chuckles. There simply isn't any sense of invention here.It is clear there isn't any intent to make quality cinema here. I mean, there is NO intention of any kind. I'm not sure what the business model is, maybe they are making this on a low budget and getting a lot of sponsorship money and then making enough on ticket sales to come out in the green over all? I don't know, but the mind certainly boggles that these guys are able to continue making films. It is really surprising they are not getting financed the same way Uwe Boll does in Germany. However, the bottom line is: avoid this. Even if you think it might be funny to watch as a bad movie to make fun of MST3K style, don't do it. Because this isn't even unintentionally funny. It's just not funny, and it sucks. Stay away. Do not watch this movie. Seriously.",

Where this movie suffers is very weak writing. The story relies upon visual gags that just aren't original or even interesting. The plot is not logical and it serves only as a mechanism to jump from visual parody to parody. Some of the parody scenes just seem to be tossed in as an afterthought. The Superman parody doesn't affect story flow at all and it just isn't funny. The Borat parody is equally pointless. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that the writers have mocked so many other movies and couldn't find anything to develop into humor.If you liked the Scary Movie series and Date Movie, don't assume Epic Movie comes close to living up. It doesn't. I only gave this three stars to see if I could give it the best review on the site. I can't give it just one star because I did laugh about 5 times.

It's a compilation of spoof after spoof that tries so hard that it burns the eyes and ears. The main spoof focuses on Chronicles of Narnia, and that's about as solid as the movie gets... that solidness being equivalent to pudding. Stay away from this movie, for the love of God, Buddha, and The Great Pumpkin Man. You will sincerely regret watching this disaster and will have wasted any money on it.

They must defeat her to save the world and free Gnarnia.In this movie, we see one parody after the other, but done so in an unfunny, tasteless, overly-crude and overbearing way. What follows is a boring story with silly characters and dumb antics. What renders this movie to borderline annoying is the use of excessive rap songs in a number of scenes.

            "content": "First off, all I have to say to sum up this movie is this: \"Epic Movie\" is one of the worst films of all time, and certainly the worst comedy of all time. I could leave it at that and hope you take my advice and save yourself the $8.00, but I know many of you will see it anyway. \"Oh, but the trailer looked so funny,\" you'll say. I almost thought about asking for a refund, and not only that, but also my hour and a half back, and my lost brain cells. I will explain the reasons this film is a literal piece of garbage, and should be buried thousands of feet beneath the earth where it will rot away, never to be seen again. The trailer promises hilarious spoofs of films ranging from \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", to \"X-Men\", to \"Narnia\". I tell you this; the only funny scenes in this film are in the trailer. So watch the trailer a couple of times and you've seen the movie. Every other scene is boring, retarded, unfunny, and horribly made. How the studio actually ended up OK-ing \"Epic Movie\" is beyond me. The acting is dreadful, granted it is a spoof, but even spoofs need semi-good actors. The continuity is non-existent; the stunt people will play the characters in a fight scene on full on display for the camera. I think the directors thought it would be funny to show bad continuity, and it isn't in the least. I'll wager that the writers all got drunk and said, \"Ok, everyone say something funny.\" \"Let's have Captain Jack dance!\" \"Great! Let's go film the movie dudes!\" Anyone could make a movie like this, absolutely anyone. What's funny in their stupid mind isn't funny to the smart, movie going public. I should've expected this since they are the same guys who made the horribly unsuccessful \"Date Movie\". In fact, it is apparently so bad it made IMDb's 100 worst films of all time list. \"Epic Movie\" will undoubtedly make it as well. It is the worst film of the year, and next year, and probably the year after.So save yourself and your brain cells and don't see this sad excuse for a film.

For the most part the supposed parody scenes are carbon copies of the source material, but sometimes the makers also take a break from flat-out theft to bring in some embarrassing bathroom humor. It's truly a fantastic formula, you could churn out a hundred movies a year using it. Want to parody \"Harry Potter\"? No problem, copy some of its scenes but make one of the characters fart halfway through. Genius. There are just two things the makers (accidently) got right. Firstly, the Crispin Glover cameo (as Willy Wonka) is amazing. During the two minutes he's on screen the movie almost becomes tolerable, I've never seen such blatant case of an actor being way too good for the movie he's in.

It is an endless sequence of ill-timed and poorly written one-liners, sight gags and unfunny depictions of other movie characters. Honestly, the script seemed like it had been written by a bunch of ten year olds during morning tea. \"Like, make it that, like, Harry Potter's really old, and, like, it would be real funny!\" \"Yeah, and Hermione can be like, pregnant and smoking a cigarette!

Seeing previews for it before, i was familiar with the title but never saw it, i decided to plop this baby into my ps2 and see what unfolded. I am lucky my ps2 didn't throw this movie at my throat. From the start, there lacked a plot. Something about orphans going on an epic quest but that was quickly dismissed as the nacho libre joke came into play which a blind man could see coming from a mile away. The joke of him holding the NACHO!! scream for an extended time. Movie on from there, there was a repetition of every scary and date movie ever conceived. I did not even crack a smile during this movie due to absolute poor writing of every joke. I don't know how anybody could laugh at this because every joke had been done before in every other movies by these people. Scary Movie was the first..gave me some chuckles.....2 was the same thing with new movies, and after that it was just an avalanche of horrible cinema. If i could go lower than a 1 i would. however the ratings do not so i am forced with a one. Especially on a major company with a budget, it still remained a disgrace and will remain a skid mark on any actor in that movie's career if they ever become good, besides David Carradine.",

            "content": "After the horrendous Date Movie, I was hesitant to put myself through Epic Movie. It looked nearly exactly what the preceding film was, had a few of the same actors, and the same writers/directors. But the more I missed it, the more I felt the dire need to see the film. And after sitting through the whole film, I almost wish I did not even bother.If the film was merely titled \"Pop Culture References of 2005 and 2006\", I think it would have been a lot more of an appropriate title than Epic Movie. The film lampoons not just epics like The Chronicles of Narnia (where the film finds its key references), Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, but takes jabs at the likes of the X-Men series, Borat, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Da Vinci Code and Nacho Libre (going so far as to cast that film's supporting character H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez in a key supporting role).But like Date Movie before it, the film does not parody the films it references as much as it directly steals right from them. Whole lines and sequences are lifted directly out of movies, and even TV shows like Saturday Night Live and Chappelle's Show. Surely either Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer (the still advertised \"2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\", as they have yet to prove themselves to truly be box office gold) know that the general population of people who would even give this film the time of day would have watched the films and shows these two steal directly from. Or maybe, as this film suggests, the only people who want to watch this movie are people who watch MTV, as the Cribs, Punk'd and numerous music video references would seem to idealize.I think what is most disgusting about this abomination of a film is that these two filmmakers (if we even want to refer to them as that) are plagiarizing the work of others. In the Scary Movie series (and going so far back as the work of Mel Brooks and David Zucker's earlier, non-Weinstein produced work), despite some of the films being worse than terrible, the filmmakers still attempted to give some semblance of originality to the references and parodies of films they were doing. They were simply not copying and pasting someone else's work and calling it their own. In the real world, if someone does that, they can be fired or expelled from school, and are practically blacklisted for the rest of their lives. Why is it that Friedberg and Seltzer are somehow allowed to do this criminal act? Has Fox somehow given them a pardon just for the fact of giving them some cheap profits in the Winter movie season, and a rather easily profitable Unrated DVD release? Well, Meet the Spartans comes out on DVD in a few weeks, and it looks to be on about the same page.But it could also simply be for the fact that the jokes Friedberg and Seltzer come up with themselves are almost not funny at all. I smirked at the preppy school X-Men send-up, and a few other choice scenes, but the majority of what I could tell was original work, was not funny at all. Maybe Fox gives them a pass on stealing other people's stuff just because their own work is not funny? Or maybe they are just being duped into thinking it was original, and not copyrighted by somebody else? They must know that work is being stolen. Why else would the White Bitch character (played by Jennifer Coolidge) talk about her evil plan, only to have another character joke about how it was directly ripped nearly point for point from Superman Returns? What I found peculiar was that for such a ridiculously written film, so many recognizable faces showed up to \"act\" in it. Coolidge, Fred Willard, Tony Cox, Crispin Glover, Carmen Electra, David Carradine and Kevin McDonald have all acted in some really funny movies, and somehow, it seems that bringing them all here might give the movie some sort of credibility in being funny. Only their acting leaves a lot to be desired. Yeah, Willard tries for a bit, but no one else seems particular enthusiastic that they are a part of this production. They look like they are waiting for their money, and then are going to run off with it.They also seem to have put more money into sets, costumes and music too (when it is not just being taken from the top chart of 2006). I was actually rather amused by how much work went into some of these things, and how it looks like the filmmakers were given so much more money to make this movie than they were for Date Movie. Did Fox really have that much faith in them? I digress however. I got actual laughs in the film courtesy of a completely unrecognizable Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows (a parody on Johnny Depp's Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow). He is pound for pound, the funniest thing the movie has to offer, and nails each and every moment he has with an amount of perfection completely devoid from the rest of the production. I am unsure if Friedberg and Seltzer wrote Hammond's lines (they look more improvised than anything), but if they did, I concede that they might have some sort of talent if they get the right actor to read them off. I laughed a lot during the bloopers shown through the credits as well. It just looked funnier to screw up the terrible lines than to actually say them.And if the bloopers are the funniest thing about this so-called comedy, I think there might be a problem. Hopefully Meet the Spartans has more originality, and less plagiarizing. Otherwise Friedberg and Seltzer should be looking at some fines to pay.1.5/10.",

The Harry Potter part and Pirates of the Caribbean looked amusing. On the contrary, they were bad, very bad.

The film is 90 minutes of unbelievably mature poopy, pee-pee, penis and va-jay-jay jokes that will most likely be the best film you've ever seen -- if you're in second grade. The movie would be tolerable if they wouldn't take a joke too far, which 'Epic Movie' does every two minutes or so. The only really humorous scene was Mr. Tumnus' home sequence which spoofed MTV Cribs. That was funny for the first minute or so of the joke, but became annoying after the five decades the joke continued into.

            "content": "Clearly the people of this movie don't know the difference between parody and reference, and thus a convoluted abomination that has no right to call itself \"spoof\" was born. I personally like to see something to parodied if it's done with effort, take Spaceballs for example. That movie works because it takes a look at a Star Wars like universe from a comedy standpoint, you have a big powerful leader but underneath he's a complete fool, and it's funny because you may find yourself wondering, \" What if Vader was really like that?\" In this abomination against mankind they look into various pop culture references that are popular and do nothing clever and comedic, they just put it in the movie and say \" Hey, that exists!\" Rumour has it Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have never seen the films being mocked, they just saw trailers and said \"Okay, we'll do that one,\" and that wouldn't be surprising to say the least.While I sat watching this garbage, I instantly knew I wasn't gonna laugh. The \"movie references\" come off as painfully forced, like when someone plugs your nose to make you eat something you don't want. None of the references connect in any way, they're just there. The movie begins with narration from the Babe narrator which made me wish I was watching Babe. We then meet four orphans/siblings who are adults who require parenting because they never had a real family. First there's Lucy (Jayma Mayes), Edward (Kal Penn), Susan (Faune Chambers) and Peter(Adam Campbell). Yes these adults still need parental guidance, if that's the case, how did they even get where they are, they should be dead. Anyway they all win golden tickets to a factory filled with poop jokes and cheap gross-out humor, eventually they discover a wardrobe which takes them to enchanted world with the worst, rushed and unnecessary parodies. Lucy meets Mr. Tummies who takes him to his \"Crib\" where he gives a stupid tour of the place MTV style and then asks her to leave thus making the Cribs joke entire pointless.The only reference that made me give a tiny chuckle was the White Castle joke with Kal Penn, but everything else comes from nowhere and its atrocious to watch. The Pirates joke was the worst excuse to make the movie longer I've ever seen. Edward breaks out of jail with Jack Swallows after making a homophobic comment, where Jack takes Edward to his ship and gives us a music video but in a stupid turn of events, it was an elaborate scheme by the White Idiot (can't curse) to get information out of him. When the other three orphans meet the king, he agrees to help get Edward back in exchange for having a four way, I was ready to lose my mind at that moment. Thankfully the king dies after rescuing Edward, and before the war takes place the following day they throw a party, why? It's just pointless filler with gross-out humor that made me wanna vomit and I did. When the war happens Lucy, Edward and Susan die, and Peter pauses the bad guys with a Click remote he found, uses it to heal his siblings and they kill all the bad guys and they become rulers of the world, they urinate and they get rolled to death, movies done! This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, everyone in this movie is brainless, the acting is the worst, there is no existent plot just pop culture references, and it has a running gag in which Lucy repeats everything Susan says and it made me cringe every time. After I discovered this movie in my storage of old movies, I smashed it to pieces with a hammer. Nothing about the movie is good or redeeming about this abomination.

Also, while the gags were the thing, I also think a little more attention was paid to both characterization and plot. As a result, little dated either one. Watch something like Epic Movie, however, and you can't help but think they've thrown everything (from various TV shows and movies) but the kitchen sink (and no sink is literally thrown as far as I can tell). This results in such a hodge podge of parodies upon parodies that the plot gets interrupted constantly and characterization (what there is of it) is violated for cheap laughs (of which there were few on my side).

Epic Movie is exactly the kind of film a spoof movie should be\u0097funny as hell, not taking itself too seriously, contains decent acting, and makes constant references to pop culture and other fields. In my eyes, it was a comedic masterpiece, and there wasn't a moment where I stopped laughing. By the end of the film, I was completely breathless.The characters in Epic Movie are your usual stereotypes, but this time around, each of the actors brings something hilarious to each role. Even the brief cameos, which could have gone badly, work extremely well; in one of the movie's funniest scenes, David Lehre, in a spoof of Punk'd and Ashton Kutcher, yells \"shwam, shwam, shwam!\" as he 'punks' one of the characters. The movie also features lots of 'in-jokes' if you've seen a lot of movies. For instance, Kal Penn of the film Harold and Kumar go to White Castle says \"It feels like I've been there before\" when the White Bitch says she's taking him to her White Castle.The spoofs are also well-executed, and a lot of them are done with flashy music. Crispin Glover brings an incredible energy to Willy Wonka in his few scenes that it's a wonder he wasn't given more to work with. Darrell Hammond is uproarious as Captain Jack Swallows in a spoof of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.Overall, Epic Movie is the perfect spoof movie in every way, if spoofs are your cup of tea.

If you find it hilarious when someone breaks wind or gets injured, you will be rolling in the aisles. Otherwise, you will be staring stone-faced at the screen in disbelief at the awfulness.Famous recent movies are \"parodied.\" So are TV shows, celebrities and the Bush administration. There are a handful of amusing lines, but not enough to make it worth the ticket price. Several supposedly well-respected actors appear (no, not Eugene Levy), making you wonder if they did it out of friendship with the directors, or if the directors perhaps possess incriminating photos.At one point, the Peter character calls for mercy on the \"White Bitch,\" and decides that she will be tried by a jury of her peers. Hopefully, the same will happen to everyone involved in this train-wreck, who will decide whether or not they can be trusted with more movies in the future.",

Some of the set designs and character re-creations from real movies are done in great detail and are actually pretty good. For this reason, the movie wins extra points, and yet it still deserves less than a 1/10. Like the other garbage regularly let loose from this group of talentless buffoons, Epic Movie is yet another barely decipherable shoestring of a plot draped carelessly over a bizarre series of idiotic skits lampooning current popular movies (notice \"popular\" and not \"good\"), resulting in another romp through the asinine sense of humor of writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By the way, these guys remind me of strippers or porn stars. I always wonder what these people say to their parents about their \"careers.\" Likewise, how can Friedberg's and Seltzer's parents not be horribly humiliated by what their sons do for a living? How difficult is it for them to keep secret what their kids are currently doing to the world? I mean, can they really possibly watch a movie like this and think, \"That's my boy!\" I should think not. I would wonder about them, too. But hey, these guys are laughing all the way to the bank. They spend all summer at the movies and then go home and rip off as many films as they can and throw in as many disgusting jokes as possible and they are making millions of dollars every time. My only consolation is that I live in China and, since everything is pirated here, those jerks didn't make a dime off of me because I watched it on a pirated DVD. Yeah, that's right. I bought a pirated copy of Epic Movie and I own it. I paid 10 yuan (about $1.35) for it, which is about ten times what it's worth. What a ripoff.Actually I take that back. My other consolation is that they are running out of generic genres. What's next, Children's Movie?",

Hip Hop comprises the majority of the soundtrack, with some songs re-used throughout.

It makes way to many references to brand names and celebrities, and not at all with the talent of the South Park crew. They are still my benchmark in comedy. I will let you in on the part where they mock Harry Potter; it is the most sidesplitting part of the movie.Now some of you may be thinking that it is disrespectful to mock the \"Epic Movies\" noted in the film.

Our four main characters are brought together by four funny opening sequences, each receiving a random ticket to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. When they discover he's really planning on using their body parts to make candy, he locks them in a house, where Lucy wanders off and finds a Magical warbrobe leading to the secret land of Gnarnia. The others soon follow suit, and are caught in the middle of an ongoing war between the White Bitch and the rest of the creatures. They are called to unite and defeat the White Bitch and rule Gnarnia with peace.I know my description of the plot makes it seem like the movie actually has an actual plot. And it actually doesn't. In any sense of the word. But then again, Scary Movie 1,2,3,4 and Date Movie didn't have much of that either, so those who will attend this movie know what they're getting themselves into. 'Epic' is a plot less, aimless, pointless feature, but it's also quite amusing.In comparison to 'Date Movie', 'Epic' does a much better job at literally making fun of the movies it promises to make fun of. It doesn't just make fun of the movies. It makes fun of the characters and distinct pieces of scenes, and even gets a few jokes in about problems Hollywood has, such as noticeable stunt person.'Epic' starts off to a surprisingly hilarious beginning, retains it's hilarity for awhile, then loses some steam once we enter the wardrobe, although the entire picture is uneven. Some jokes work, others don't. Some scenes work, others don't. But as a whole the movie hits the mark more than it misses. So to sum things up: From a cinematic viewpoint, 'Epic Movie' is below the mark. But for this genre, it meets the standards and delivers what it promises, for the most part.2.5 from 4",

I think Scary Movie (all of them) were travesties to film making along with so called classics like Hot Shots, Naked Gun, Airplane, and follow that with Not Another Teen Movie, Date Movie, and now the EPIC MOVIE!! People complain endlessly about \"how stupid\" these movies are but they always make lots of cash and spawn plenty of sequels. So in order to appease my review readers I bit the bullet and went to see Epic Movie. As spoof films go Epic Movie turned out to be the least of this crappy genre!! It certainly wasn't great or overtly entertaining but from the perspective of spoof films it wasn't bad. It's one of those spoof films that mercifully doesn't shove the spoofs down your throat or go out of it's way to find a way to spoof whatever they want to. I mean to a certain extent they have to do that and there is no way around it...and as with all spoof films lately it's brutally short because you can only mock other movies for so long. As far as story lines go as hard as it is to have one...this one does manage to have somewhat of a watchable story.Kal Penn, Adam Campbell, Jayma Mays and Faune A. Chambers all do a decent job playing off of each other and they suit their respective roles. Kal Penn tends to be the strongest but then he is the actor and comedian with the most experience in this cast. Add in some very funny performances by Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Crispin Glover, Carmen Electra and a brilliant turn by very funny and clever comedian Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows.As expected most of the humorous scenes are in the trailer and you can pretty much see the jokes coming from a mile but it's still entertaining enough to not make you groan a lot of the impressions in the film are funny and quite often spot on (ie: Darrell Hammond.) One of the most impressive things about this spoof film that automatically gains points for me is that the dirty, bodily function jokes are barely existent!! It isn't constant fart, barf, urinate jokes although there are some...remarkably it isn't the major focus. When all is said and done there are a million things better to see than Epic Movie but to each their own and some people like spoof films and if you don't you might not hate this one too badly. 5/10",

This is probably the only film I will ever address like this....Normally I would break the film down here, but this is a parody of other films so all the visuals and images are substituted from the base content. They don't tell jokes in this. This isn't a comedy movie. This is a film that aims to repeat, verbatim, everything the source material said to the point it becomes excessive, boring, and gives you a headache. I disliked Date Movie. I haven't seen a Scary Movie since the second one and from what I hear, I left it behind at the right time. This was the worst attempt at parody I've ever seen in my life and I've seen Reality Shows parody Human behavior. This was BAD bad. You can't even get a good riff going. It isn't bad on purpose. It feels like it was written by an unfunny twelve year old, whose parents had lied to them telling them they were funny, only motivating the little pr*** to keep trying. They shouldn't have kept trying. This cinematic abortion is probably the worst movie I've ever seen on all scales. I've seen The Room. I found humor in that. I've seen Dragon Wars. I found humor in that. This was just...crap. An attempt to take films that did fairly well, cash in on how recognizable the characters were, and then just repeat scenes shot for shot.

Nacho Libre was OK but it surely wasn't epic. They put movies in it for he hell of it. Did they really need Paris Hilton jokes.

I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance.

Every single one of them has been hysterical in other comedies, and really good in dramas, too, so we know they can act.The best thing they can do for their careers is to cut off all contact with the lameoids responsible for this film, and scratch EPIC MOVIE off of their resumes.

From a few of the writers who did Scary Movie, and those solely responsible for last year's Date Movie comes this mindless and flimsy foray into the fantasy genre mock-up. It seems to be an unusual thing, how these movies keep getting made despite ending up near the top of every worst-of list, be it critical or popular opinion. One must conclude that the majority of people who go out and give these movies the smallest amount of stars possible are simply not the intended demographic (which, after 5 progressively sleazy incarnations, should be apparent).Because someone is obviously watching these movies. Yes, the demographics of slapstick humor might have taken a severe nosedive over the past ten years, but that is not to say that films like this are not tailor made for the current pseudo-hip-hop youth culture. And it is that young audience who will likely find the most joy in this positively mediocre effort. Epic Movie is even more dedicated in wooing young urban teens then the more vulgar Date Movie was, infusing an unnecessary amount of it's jokes with awkward rap interludes and cameos. It has become more apparent that the intelligence factor for these types of movies has truly gone down to a lowest common denominator, but that still does not give one the right to say there is nothing here for anyone.Yes, Epic Movie suffers as pretty much all the others like it, in the fact that there is about one funny joke for every ten or fifteen that feel positively dirt-cheap. But those occasional jokes that do succeed prove that this comedy does at least in some small way live up to it's genre's promise. Primarily, Willy Wonka and Chronicles of Narnia are parodied, while dozens of characters from more of last year's films pop in and out for very frivolous appearances. The majority will be a bore, even for a group of drunken teenagers, but there are at least half a dozen gags that are still funnier then most of the material non-slapstick comedies provide, and in this pitiful day in age where Epic Movie remains the flagship of this dying sub-genre, where else can we turn too in Hollywood to see overexposed characters, phrases, and scenes get put in their place?",

It has its funny moments but its just something you wouldn't pay to see. They said it was like scary movie its nothing like scary movie. people say its the funniest thing they have ever seen!

Ha....ha....HA!!This movie is, quite simply, not funny. The movie (AHEM) spoofs James Bond, \"Pirates of the Carribbean\", \"Snakes on a Plane\", Paris Hilton, Harry Potter, The X-Men and also throws in references to MySpace and MTV. Could someone PLEASE TELL ME WHAT ANY OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE EPIC GENRE?! If you were going to spoof the epic movie, what would you choose? \"Ben-Hur\"? What about \"Lawrence of Arabia\"? Even \"Chronicles\" loosely fits the epic genre. Where does Paris Hilton fit into any of these films? Or for that matter, this genre? Well, she is epically stupid but I don't think that counts.I will be fair. The Willy Wonka parody with Crispen Glover is actually kind of funny. Reimagining Wonka as break-dancing pervert is amusing but it's a pretty fleeting cameo.This cast reeks of \"they only did it for the money.\" Fred Willard is a funny guy but is made out so ridiculously. I also find another trademark of these two hacks to be wearing pretty frigging thin. The constant references to woman's breasts is just getting tired. What's so funny about them anyway unless you think it's amusing to see a blue colored Carmen Electra have her boobs inflated to three times their size. It's more weird then it is funny.Bottom line? If your looking for a good laugh fest, rent this piece of garbage but if even your garbage film love has standards, then let this utter disgrace pass you right by.",

They find themselves locked away until they discover a wardrobe which they enter to find themselves, in a send up of Narnia, trapped in a world where they must over throw the evil White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge- imagine how many arms would be up if she was a black actress playing a character called Black Bitch???) who's enforcing a cruel reign on everyone. So Edward the Jock (Kal Penn), wimpy Peter (Adam Campbell), dopey Lucy (Jayma Mays) and aggressive Susan (Faune A. Chambers) must band together and stop her.It gives me no pleasure to knock a spoof film. I've always had a soft spot for these send ups of big budget films that take themselves too seriously, even when everyone else generally gives them bad reviews, but the negative comments on Epic Movie have been pretty consistent (telling by it's current position in the IMDb bottom 100) and it's fair to say this is pretty much one of the worst of the genre I've seen in some time. It had the potential to be one of the best, a promising and ambitious send up of very recent blockbusters (so none of the jokes would be lost on anybody) but that it should be so virtually laugh free through-out should be some indication of what a failure it is. Another thing that brought it down were the spoof scenes with a hip hop theme to them, with the booming, heavy based music playing over everything whilst women in skimpy bras and bikinis dance around. These weren't even funny in the two most recent Scary Movie films, but there's a real obnoxious element to them here. As I mentioned in the PS, one of the main character's is called White Bitch, a nasty piece of racial stereotyping if ever I heard one that won't have as many of the minority groups up in arms as much if it had been the other way round. This, along with the standard exploitation of women, really brings out the worst in the black culture the film seems to revolve around.That the film only manages to raise one of two very mild titters, when it should have had me roaring the roof down, shows all the lost opportunity. *",

I was wrong. The basic plot of this film is four orphans win golden tickets to a chocolate factory where the owner tries to kill and torture them and make them in to candy. To hide they end up finding a wardrobe and going to Gnarnia. It is a really terrible parody, and is really unfunny. They just took a bunch of random movies and connected them very loosely and called it a movie. It's more of a bad sketch comedy. The positives of the film are the camera work and special effects, which are pretty good. Also Darrel Hammond of SNL did a terrific imitation of Johnny Depp in Pirate's. The negatives (I'll try to make it brief) are the writing, which is terrible, the acting, where everyone tries their hardest to be funny, and it ends where nobody is, and everything else. I have no idea why somebody would think it would be funny to parody Chronicles of Narnia. Other unfunny parodies in this are Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter, Nacho Libre and Snakes on a Plane. All of those spoofs were awful too.

Every chance they had to make some type of knock off they did, regardless of how funny it actually was. Also, there was entirely too much slapstick - like the producers though every person getting hit in some weird way would automatically make the movie more funny. **I feel very comfortable saying that I got my money's worth from finding out that Reno 911 was getting its own movie.

But let me tell you this film is about as funny as a funeral. No worse, as funny as going to prison. The film tries to rely on it's \"jokes\", which are no better then fart and poop jokes. My 5-year old cousin could've wrote a better script.so, in another words, only watch this if someone else's life in is danger.",

Lucy is from the Da Vinci Code, Edward is from Nacho Libre, Susan is from Snakes on a Plane, and Peter is from the X-Men Series. First off, none of these films are \"epic\", they barely take themselves seriously. Then, the four orphans end up recovering a gold ticket for an epic adventure from the Willy Factory (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). What follows is a series of unfunny exploits that tries to spoof Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, Talladega Nights, Casino Royale, Mission: Impossible 3, Superman Returns, Star Wars, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Shrek, Click, Borat, V for Vendetta, Scarface, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, American Pie and Beerfest. However, if you think it ends there, you're wrong. They also parody Punk'd, MTV Cribs, 50 Cent, and take unfair cheap shots at other celebrities and shows. The film goes from one reference to another, never creating any valid storyline or joke. The characters they do parody end up doing dance routines (Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka).

The memory of that day quickly faded, and I was able to resume normal life thereafter......Seven years later and I'm hit with a moment of deja vu. I had just seen a preview for one of the Scary Movies (2 I think?), and my mind started scanning through all the crappy films I'd ever endured. For the life of me, I could not think of this title, but I was so positive in my disgust that I began searching for it -- starting with IMDb's list of the worst 100 movies of all time. I began at the #1 spot, passed a Paris Hilton flick along the way, and finally landed on #53, Epic Movie. THAT WAS IT.Epic Movie! I knew the title was just as abysmal as the content! The funny thing is, I haven't seen any of the movies ranked lower than this. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen. Since I'm obliged to say why it's so bad: The jokes are distasteful for any age group, the parodies are weak, the cast literally could not be worse together, and the plot is so aggravatingly predictable and boring (from what I can remember -- I refuse to watch it again).Congratulations to my brain's waste management system. It erased this title clean out of my head. Two thumbs down. Would not recommend.",

Jackson, Mel Gibson, and especially Johny Depp as captain Jack Swallows. That guy that played him (captain) should get some award for the impression.

            "content": "Where do I start with this film? (Slight Spoilers).First off, there were three moments in this film when I smirked gently, and reluctantly. The first being when 3 Hogwarts teachers were killed, the second when the four main characters woke up abandoned, and doing a typical heroic charge were all slaughtered with in seconds. The third was the Superman parody. I did say 'smirked gently'.I've got to say that I'm amazed that at the time of writing, there are 602 \"10 star\" ratings. Nobody in their right mind would award this a 10. I found it an insult to my backside that I sat through this drivel \u0096 but mercifully the filmmakers didn't have enough material to make a normal length movie. This is very shot at 68 minutes, and frankly, that is something of a blessing.Okay, I'll try and justify why I'm so against this movie in a series of points. Hopefully some people will listen and save themselves the price of a cinema ticket. I'll cap this at ten points to keep this post short(ish).1. Every joke falls flat. Every single one. 2. The quality of writing is appalling. People urinating or being sick just isn't funny. Especially not when it's done as badly as this. 3. You genuinely despise the writers by the end of the film \u0096 to the extent where you are loathe to even smile. Jokes about large breasted woman are especially unfunny when you realise that they use them because they didn't have any material to fill the gaps. 4. Oh look. Gay jokes. A gay beaver and part dear/part human joke should be funny \u0096 but it just isn't. 5. The acting is depressingly bad. I genuinely felt embarrassed watching these people make fools of themselves like this. Comedic acting is an art form which is hard to get right, but here there is no comic timing, line delivery or posture. It's just a bunch of people dithering from disjointed scene to disjointed scene. 6. The music is diabolical and irritating. I don't get hip-hop anyway, but putting in several hip-hop tracks to fill in time like this is plain insulting. 7. All the \"funniest\" parts of this movie are in the trailer. 8. Even the choice of movies that is parodies is unimaginative. 9. This movie tries to offend everybody, but it's done so badly that it is like an irritating drunk prat mouthing off in a chat room. 10. The public deserve more intellectual respect than this film offers. Seriously, this movie treats you like a moronic simpleton. We can handle clever jokes - maybe these guys just couldn't write them.I've got to put this to the people voting this a ten. Why? What possible justification is there for this sexist, unfunny, badly written cash-cow crap to get a ten?So... Just don't subject yourself to this. These b@stards have already made a fortune, and they don't deserve to make a penny more. I hope that those involved in the high-level decisions have ruined their careers, I really do. I hope they sack the two writers responsible, and force the remaining 4 \"Scary Movie\" to sit down and write something that is genuinely funny for a change.If you feel that you want to argue with me about this, you either have not seen the film, or more probably are scoring lower IQ results than the bedding you sleep on.

If anyone takes exception to the Also character (and he WAS pretty objectionable) I don't think the writers intended it as a blatant attempt to offend us.Taken on its own merits, don't go see the film if you want some intellectual stimulation.

Unfortunately, most of the humor is half-baked adolescent antics. Moreover, when the jokes fall flat\u0097as they often do, Friedberg and Seltzer fall back in desperation on lowest common denominator clowning, such as having their characters spell their names in the snow with their own urine. Other instances include spitting, drooling, breaking wind, projectile vomiting, and slurping up raw sewage. Friedberg and Seltzer skewer a number of Tinsel town blockbusters, principally \"Nacho Libre,\" \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Click,\" \"Snakes on a Plane,\" the \"X-Men\" trilogy, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" flicks, \"Superman Returns,\" and \"The Da Vinci Code.\" \"Epic Movie\" follows the exploits of four twenty-something orphans drawn together in a common goal to save themselves from a wicked plot concocted by a madcap Willy Wonka (Crispin Glover) who wants to cannibalize their body parts for his tasty new chocolate bars. More by misadventure than design, our quartet of protagonists\u0097Lucy (Jayma Mays of \"Red Eye\"), Edward (Kal Penn of \"Van Wilder 2\"), Susan (Faune A. Chambers of \"White Chicks\") and Peter (Adam Campbell of the TV's \"Commando Nanny\") obtain tickets to tour Willy's magical kingdom of chocolate. When our heroes and heroines realize the pot into which their body parts are about to be stirred, they try to escape Willy's premises by ducking into an apparently ordinary wardrobe (a free-standing, old fashion closet) and wind up in the land of Gnaria\u0097the G is silent for legal purposes\u0097where they stumble upon land of enchanted animals. Some of these creatures are part beast and part human, and they are locked in a battle for survival against a dastardly dame (Jennifer Coolidge of \"American Pie\") appropriately named the White Bitch. Kal recognizes her immediately in one of the film's few clever moments: \"It's Stifler's mother!\" She captures Kal, and he divulges the whereabouts of his cohorts after a pirate captain (Darrell Hammond of TV's \"Saturday Night Live\") tricks him into a confession. Happily, our protagonists elude the notorious White Bitch and link up with the half-human/half-beast rebels led by Also (Fred Willard of \"Date Movie\") who is the half-man/half-lion that leads the insurgents.\"Epic Movie\" does an adequate enough job of imitating its source material, but a good parody must do more than imitate. The best parodies mock the clich\u00e9s and conventions of its source material by revealing the absurdity that lies beneath those formulaic elements. Most of the time, however, \"Epic Movie\" only imitates. Furthermore, \"Epic Movie\" rarely exposes the absurdity of the movies that it derides and more often than not what should be absurd ends up being asinine. The opening scene that pokes fun at \"The Da Vinci Code\" is as witless as the nitwit character that it introduces. A later scene where a Samuel L. Jackson look-alike actor spouts blasphemous language constantly, like a compact disc stuck in repeat mode, is just as cretinous. The goal of a good parody is to stand something serious on its head to show how goofy it can be from another perspective. Neither \"The Da Vinci Code\" nor the \"Snakes on a Plane\" scenes reveal the lunacy behind the plots. \"Epic Movie,\" however, wastes a first-rate cast. Christian Glover of \"River's Edge\" is ideally cast as the sinister Willy in the Johnny Depp role from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" Similarly, Darrell Hammond's impersonation of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow from \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is dead letter perfect. In \"Epic Movie,\" he is called Jack Swallows rather than Jack Sparrows. Ha, ha, right? Jayma Mays does a better job of spoofing Anna Faris from the \"Scary Movie\" franchise than Anna Faris does playing herself. Meanwhile, Jennifer Coolidge is appropriately villainous as the White Bitch and Fred Willard excels as the brave lion Also, both of whom hail from the \"Narnia\" film.One of the best scenes shows Harry Potter as a 50-year old and his girlfriend Hermione Granger as a pregnant, chain-smoker who lets her full to bursting belly bulge from beneath her blouse. This scene works nominally better than most because the actors in the \"Harry Potter\" movies have grown older than the actual age of their characters. Another good joke involves the talking beaver from the sleep aid TV commercial who helps our heroes and heroine in this efforts to defeat the sorceress.",

I mean, I actually liked \"Soul Plane\" for what it was and I think its OK to laugh at a silly Leslie Nielsen every now or then. But \"Epic Movie\" is just plain and simple a bad movie, with no redeeming qualities.So, what is the problem with \"Epic Movie\"? Well, what isn't? First of all it just seemed to me that the writers at advance made a list of all 2006 movies they wanted to spoof. Then they thought to themselves how to connect all those different spoof sequences and make one whole move out of it. The end result is unfortunately what the poor viewers got presented. There is not obvious connection between everything which makes this a terrible disjointed spoof to watch, with something that is supposedly supposed to be a story but feels more like a labyrinth, that goes from left to right and flips over, with behind each corner a total different movie it spoofs, as you go through this mess they call a movie.On top of that, this movie just really isn't funny. Seriously this is the best they could come up with? I mean, it's not like 2006 didn't had any good spoof-able movies. There were so many opportunities for them but instead they came up with incredible lame and unfunny sequences, characters and dialog. It makes you wonder, didn't the actors realized that what they did just wasn't funny? Why didn't they just quite and walked off the set, that would had saved them a lot of embarrassment.The movie still has some good production values and is good and professional looking, which is basically the only reason why I just can't rate it any lower.2/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

I laughed once in the entire film (perhaps due to a sugar high from the vat of coke) and although my friend and I raised the average age of movie-goers in the cinema by about 15 years, none of the kids were laughing either. With so much material to choose from, the decision to focus on The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe for 90% of the film was misguided and oh, how it dragged.

The original concept of the lampooning of real epic movies is a good concept, and the potential satire in this type of project is, or should be, a gold mine. Historically, these types of movies have been reasonably successful, and most of them rate at least a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. But the uniqueness of this effort allows it a rating that only few producers can have nightmares about.Some of the adolescent, and pre-adolescent audiences may find this story, and all of it's gags, to be funny. But not enough to make it successful. For most adults, however, this film probably misses the mark by a mile. With all of the gags being hinged together so loosely, and with no credibility or sensibility attached to pull them off, one can only hope the movie ends as soon as possible. In comparison, the first few installments of Scary Movie were funny, proving that the concept and format has a chance. But unless you have about an 8 year old mentality, and then are willing to let anything pass for entertainment, you may think twice about paying to see it. This gross, and raunchy type of humor is for children who get their parent's okay to watch it.Unfortunately, the theatrical trailer is better than the overall production.

            "content": "The last time I saw a parody film that I thought was surprisingly okay was Date Movie. I gave that an 8 out of 10. People probably thought I was something of insane, but I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was funnier than Scary Movie 4, for sure. Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer must have realized that their movies make a nice mint, because they made a sequel titled Epic Movie. I guess what I thought was funny for Date Movie, they just duplicated with different movies, and the result, probably to their dismay, was just not good. Here's the story: 4 orphans (Kal Penn, Adam Campbell, Jayma Mays & Faune A. Chambers) who have no real connection to each other, since they lived in different parts of the world and coincidently, live in different movies (Kal's in Nacho Libre, Adam is the Superhero parody, Jayma is the Da Vinci Code, and Faune is Snakes On A Plane), have all met based on the finding of a chocolate bar, which leads to Willy's Factory. Willy is maniacal, and wishes to use the orphans for his candy. They escape into the large wardrobe into Gnarnia, where the four discover they are the only ones who can save this mystical world.The movie has great ideas, but does not execute them well. Some \"jokes\" (If you could call them jokes) have slight humor only in that they are recognized in Pop culture today, such as the Snakes on a Plane reference where Samuel L. Jackson (Only an actor, not really him) states that due to the internet, the only thing he's most recognized for is his famous quote which he repeats to annoying affect. By the 3rd shouting of this quote, it started to become obnoxious that the writers have indeed, made their point. Why continue? Also, do not be deceived by the title. It says Epic, and many would define \"Epic\" in the sense of film as something that is legendary, such as a lot of the classic films like \"Ben-Hur\" or \"Gone with the Wind\", or \"The Sound of Music\", where the budget was no where near as important as the story telling, and people preferred the Quality of the movie instead of how much money went into it. What the creators define Epic is any movie out now that is overblown to large proportions based on Controversy, content, recognized quotes, or anything else that would not define a film connoisseur's taste for what Epic would be.Some of the humor, and by \"some\", I'm really trying to find points that are funny, can actually provide a laugh, but expect a \"Ha- Ha\" moment. Not a laugh that you would get from watching Airplane! or a classic comedy Jerry Zucker film. The film parody section, like the Zombie section or the Family Travel film section in Hollywood has been played to death. This stuff is beginning to come off as a get rich quick for stringing a bunch of movies together with no real plot connecting them into a 80 - 90 minute film. There are much funnier parody films out there. Chances are you have probably seen them already. Go pull them out of your tape case or re-rent it and have a bowl of popcorn and sit home and watch a movie. Trust me, you'll have more fun listening and probably quoting Leslie Nielsen's movies than sitting through this \"Movie\", if it can be called that.I rate this a 3/10.",

Date Movie was painful, it was agony to watch and I gave up on it pretty quickly; maybe 20, 25 minutes. Epic Movie is more along the lines of dull with occasional amusing bits (notably a silly running gag of one character repeating another's lines). This is not to say it doesn't have painful moments (particularly anything based on MTV/Hip Hop/street culture. I watched about 35 minutes and then began to fast forward looking for amusing bits without much luck. So I probably wound up actually seeing about half the movie.Scary Movies 1 through 3 were all much, much better than Epic Movie. I don't have a strong recollection of Scary Movie 4. I don't think it was as good as the first 3, but would say it was still several steps up from Epic Movie.There's no real reason to see this movie, but at least it's not Date Movie.

The writers have to think of fresher ideas.Another thing that bothered me was the amount of recycled actors that had previously appeared in Date Movie. Could we get someone new? The shortness of the movie was also a problem. It's a little more than an hour long, and most of the scenes are filler material. The filler material also got me really upset. The film maker has to justify putting in a bunch of half clothed women just to make the audience pay attention.

Although watched the unrated version this time around and there were slight noticeable differences (more cursing, longer extended scenes). It was funnier as a whole though very briefly. Even though the film is a mess and tries too hard in being funny, it is not meant to be taken serious.One of the better spoofs was the Samuel L. Jackson Snakes on a Plane reference.

Let's get a huge budget,take a bunch of pretty successful films,take some actors that will pretend they're drunk and let them soil their future careers,make a lot of vulgar and stupid jokes for the piece of trash with no plot that Britney Spears can enjoy, mix it all together and we get a huge grossing crap that people will go see to waste 8 bucks on to leave after 20 minutes!

I suppose this movie was meant to be utterly stupid.. so you just have to be the kind of person that is able to laugh at this kind of stupid stuff, and make a fool of other movies (even if you do love the movies it makes fun of.)

And so I've grown a healthy jadedness about Hollywood, but do occasionally enjoy a good mainstream satire, even if it promises to be Sophomoric. But this film was so atrocious that it invites several questions, all along the lines of \"How the f--- did this film make it so far?\" If they had taken any writer from any decent TV show and said \"you have a week to make a parody of every trendy film from the last year\" they would have all come back with something better than this. How the hell did David Carradine, Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge attach their name to something so atrocious? Are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer living in a complete f---ing vacuum? They don't have other writers that they can ask for advice? Friends? Family? Janitors? Is everyone they know completely mundane, ignorant and juvenile?

The movie tried to be \"too funny\" to be funny at one time. If you ever plan to see this, take my advice...don't go!

Well first of all they were movies with an attention to the plot, a vision of how to properly portray the parody and actual jokes. These jokes ranged from clever visual gags, to clever wordplay, to just ridiculous situations. Epic Movie had none of those. Instead what we got was gross out humor, jokes that are stretched way too long and pop culture references. Lots of pop culture references. You know, things that a year later are no longer relevant or are, in and of themselves, not funny?Here's an example, they're \"spoofing\" the \"Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\" or the first Narnia movie. And then just throw in pop culture references. In the first five minutes we get bits from \"Snakes on a plane\", \"Nacho Libre\", \"The DaVinci Code\" and something else I can't quite remember because it's so forgetable. Are you laughing yet because this is the formula for the rest of the movie. Something happens, pop culture reference. Something else happens, pop culture reference. Something follows and is followed by a pop culture reference. These aren't \"jokes\".An actual example of the movie is the Satyr, I can't be bothered to check his name, is showing one of the main characters around his place. And it suddenly turns into an episode of MTV Cribs. Where's the joke? The only purpose is for people to look at that scene and say, \"I know where that's from!\". And this goes on for 90 minutes and ends with Borat. It's 2019. Who remembers Borat? This instantly dates the entire movie whereas movies like the ones mentioned before are still funny to this day.There is no reason to see one of these movies by Seltzer and Friedburg.

            "content": "\"Epic Movie\" (2007), this is another rookie mistake that people make in the world nowadays; calling something \"epic\" before it actually occurs. Probably the area suffering the most is the industry of film and television. That's really starting to get on my nerves, where someone says: \"this is going to be epic\", or \"I'm looking forward to an event of epic proportions\", and so on. If you have the nerve to call something \"epic\" before it happens, then you had better be accurate with your predictions! What happens if the event, or movie, is a total bust? Well then, you'll sound and look pretty stupid, wouldn't you? Any way, I've made my point, now let's get to the review (rant) of this \"film\". It's probably no surprise that this is one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. Lazily pointless story, horrible acting, cheap special effects, boring sets/locations, and finally a cliched predictable dull soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. The story, or lack thereof, is just a cliched plethora of subplots with a cliched boring narrative and cliched snore fest that goes absolutely nowhere. Now don't get me wrong, I love parodies when they're done right. But this \"movie\" does it wrong in every sense of the word, and then some! Plot? What plot? What did I just watch? It's like I hit \"play\", watched the \"film\", nothing happened, it ended, who cares? Kind of like the train wreck known as \"Diner\" (1982)! This \"movie\" has some of the worst direction that I have ever seen. Keep in mind, this \"movie\" has two directors. Yet, they still somehow managed to screw it up! Speaking of the film crew, what in the world were they on while making this \"movie\"? Whatever they were smoking/drinking, they must have overdosed. What brain operated by a flickering bulb, with broken gears would be stupid enough to green-light this garbage?! A parody movie like this had potential to be funny, but they forgot one thing: the humor. The real tagline of this \"film\" should be: \"a comedy movie, but without the humor\". As far as the acting goes, it is so dreadful, that it almost should be illegal! Most of the so-called performances are so bad, that it leads you to question: \"what were you thinking?!\" Or another question, \"what kind of direction were the actors and actresses given?\" As for the special effects, the majority of them look cheap, cheesy and generic. Therefore, the special effects have not aged well. The sets/locations look dull and boring, and most of the interior scenes were obviously filmed in a studio. When it's obvious you can tell that a movie is filmed in a studio, that's a problem! Isn't it? Finally, the musical score is cliched, predictable and tired. No part of the score is memorable at all. \"Epic Movie\" (which it isn't), is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It angers me how bad it is, but it's also boring in some places. Those are the two worst things a movie or show can do to me, bore and anger me. This \"film\" is so bad, that I'm embarrassed for anyone subjected into making it. Even though they don't deserve any sympathy, they knew what they were signing up for! \"Epic Movie\" should be required viewing for film students in college, so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie, to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. The only positive thing I can gather from watching this \"movie\", like most other bad movies I've seen, is that I'll never have to watch it again.

And let me tell you, after seeing this travesty for myself, I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude, vulgar, over-familiar and even contrived, and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur, Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie, and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia, it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad, the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful, and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now, that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies, merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films, but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie, I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in, that's how painful I found it. All in all, probably not quite the worst movie ever, but along with movies like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered, it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions, and one to avoid, even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh, I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox.",

Due to the success of the SCARY MOVIE franchise, the film-makers decided to come up with other ones like DATE MOVIE and this one. It looks like that the writers got their ideas from Mad Magazine, The Far Side, or they must be watching too much cartoons. The film blatantly rips-off all those well-known and insignificant movies (such as CLICK). This is what I call drivel with a capital D. The writers put all these references and spoofs in the plot at random. Here's the worst part, all those sick and twisted jokes, especially ones related to bestiality such as the true parents of Mr. Thumnis, the fact that the beaver and Mr. Thumnis are gay, and Also the Liman's true parents. Yuck! My mother was right, this film IS epic trash. This film is a far-cry from what the other films are spoofing, it is the title that seems to deceive the audience. I'd rather watch 300. Now THERE'S an epic movie. Rated PG-13 for comic violence, comic gore, language, and sexual references such as bestiality.",

After hearing good and bad reviews of this film, we decided to watch for ourselves. Well, to be honest, the film was a mess, the jokes make no sense and are repeated at random, the only shock on the use of a midget was the midget actually agreeing to be in the movie. The 4 main characters were awfully shallow and weak minded and seemed unable to think of a joke worthy of even reflecting off in thinking of bad movies. Instead of trying to parody things, they just got the same joke from the film and copied it (This being seen mostly by the Borat ripoff character, the only word changed was Gnarnia (They didn't name this because of legal conditions, just because they couldn't think of anything to parody except the magical silent g that does not parody but just adds another letter to the word so cleverly thought up by whats his face). Some of the stuff in there was not a parody, just a scene to show stripper pirates, fawns and mutants. The nudity was pointless and stupid, their not being a use of the two women who show all in this shame fest of a movie, and many a people with horns who bear their ugly face in the movie, proving they struggled to hire real people to the roles of the people in the film.TL;DR This movie is repetitive, non-parodicial (I made a new word in disgust), and just rips off the original movie. The film is a disguise to the public and to movie fans and makers everywhere. I rate this film 12% with a 3% laugh hit and miss rating.",

It manages to cobble together a coherent storyline, and hilariously mishmashes characters and settings from the blockbuster movies of 2006. I am actually glad these trite, mediocre, yet inexplicably lucrative movies are made fun of and torn to pieces by \"Epic Movie.\" The movie is definitely weird, filled with careless non sequiturs, shoddy editing, and strange, inappropriate hip-hop songs and references; yet it is because of, rather than in spite of these poorly-done and weird cuts, that \"Epic Movie\" is so enjoyable. One of the best scenes involves a fight scene with a kung-fu body double that looks absolutely nothing like the main actor. Dismembered limbs magically reappear as though the character was not hurt. Comedy needs to be weird, over-the-top, and nonsensical. \"Epic Movie\" is all of these, and as a result ends up being a classic of weird comedies.The actors are actually competent and very funny. The beautiful Jayma Mays is excellent as the exaggeratedly stupid, goofy, and childlike Lucy. She clearly understood how to make this character weird, surreal and memorable. Faune Chambers is somewhat of a foil for Lucy's antics. I loved the credibly cowardly character of Peter. Crispin Glover, master of the bizarre is wonderful as a creepy and unnerving Willy Wonka. Darrell Hammond is absolutely spot-on as a parody of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow; he has an eye for detail and mimics the character perfectly.This movie is not well crafted in terms of a smooth plot line or story structure, but it's weird enough to work.

The script absolute filth. the jokes they piled on top of each other like a pile of crap and none of them were funny. the characters they were just atrocious and don't even get me started on the acting. worse than awful a mix of bad taste stupidity and unbelievable neglect to the human intellect. simplistic and terrible, poorly written. it looked like it took the writers about an hour or less to complete the script. now i know the journey always seems easier for the one who hadn't taken it but putting my self in place of Aaron and Jason, the writers of the film, i would either spend some time on writing something smarter or change the subject and back away from the genre of parody. and the saddest part it had kal penn in it. after seeing him in harold and kumar i wasn't expecting to see him in such a stupid movie, in case he did not know, it's called turning down the role, lots of famous actors do it. and unlike will smith, who dropped the role of neo and regretted it afterwards, kal penn would have been proud if he did drop the role. one more thing before i leave.

(might be just me, but without any materials with Swearing, Drugs or Sex, a movie cannot be funny).It was just so badly scripted (even though it does not have a script, but just ripping other movies off, at least try to pull the movie together).Lucy (Jayma Mays), who i am assuming is trying to be like Cindy Campbell (from Scary Movie, which she cannot pull it off) just tries to hard to act stupid and hardly isn't funny at all.Peter (Adam Campbell), being British myself could not see the funny side to him. He was not funny in Date Movie either... only part i found funny in Epic Movie with him was the superman part, that was about it.Susan (Faune A. Chambers), i wasn't expecting much from her and pretty much didn't see any comedy from her anyways.Edward (Kal Penn), i expected him to be funny... but he wasn't... the chemistry between him and the a other actors just was not right and just made him boring.Well to sum up, \"worst episode ever\" (aka. Crap Movie). You are better off watching Scary Movie 1/2/3/4 (and upcoming 5)Don't waste your time watching this movie, you will understand if you have watched the movie already and you are reading this comment... if not, wait for the DVD and rent it then you'll understand my comments...",

Spoof veteran Carmen Electra is almost unrecognizable as Mystique, another hot chick in blue, while the Johnny Depp clones are expertly cast, especially Hammond as the effeminate Jack Swallows (Get it?).

But if you come into this movie expecting any less than what you saw in the Scary Movies, then of course you'll be upset. This movie isn't made to go down as a classic. It's made to keep teenagers entertained.And, trust me, it does.Parodying every intense summer movie (from X-Men to Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean to Da Vinci Code), Epic Movie delivers hilarious lines, entertaining slap-humor, and makes even the most action-packed films of the summer look simply ridiculous. The acting isn't top-notch and the special effects aren't special...but that's simply what makes the movie funnier. People will surely laugh when they see a Japanese stunt double in clear view and a stunt manikin collapse to the ground.If nothing else, this movie is a fantastic and hilarious Friday night out.

I've watched this film over 50 times I would say and every joke still cracks me and my family up. This movie makes Kanye West feel like a bad rapper. This movie makes Ninja feel bad at fortnite. This movie makes the story to Breaking Bad seem bad and boring. The acting on this movie makes the acting in the wolf of Wall Street feel like a joke. This movies action scenes make cobra Kai feel mid. This movie has every character ever dreamt of from Willy Wonker to Jack Sparrow. I have creamed my panties more times I want to admit watching this film. I don't understand how this film is so slept on because the whole film had me laughing and creaming.

I should have listened to my gut instinct and waited until the movie had been properly review by qualified film critics.This movie is \"crap\" in every sense of the word! There's really no story in this movie, so the \"synopsis\" follows four \"orphans\" as they come together, discover they're brothers and sisters, and stop the evil White B@#!$ who allegedly killed their parents. From that point on, there is no plot. It's just taking some really good movies and turning them into crap.I would say hilarity ensues, but there was very little in this movie that was hilarious. Most of the jokes were crude, obnoxious, or gross-out. There were a few things that made me laugh, such as Mr. Tumnus' crib, Captain Jack Swallows, the White Queen's turbo sled, and even adding some Imperial stormtroopers to the Queen's army. Unfortunately, these jokes aren't enough to save the movie.It seems all spoof movies these days are about being rude and gross. The movies being spoofed are just in there as a backdrop for the movie's \"dumb time.\" Half the movies spoofed in this movie, such as Borat, Nacho Libre, Willy Wonka and Click, aren't even epics. For my final thought, I would just like to ask, \"Wouldn't it be great if they made a spoof movie that was actually funny?\"If you have any dignity, or respect for the movies spoofed in this movie, then avoid this movie.",

And when the writers were on the cusp of putting together something humorous, like the age of the Harry Potter cast, they couldn't leave well enough alone, and unnecessarily went over the top.This movie was so unentertaining that it (combined with an entire tub of popcorn) made it necessary for me to leave the theatre 10 minutes before I could have sneaked into \"Departed\", just to cleans myself of the experience.Don't even rent this one.",

He then died of cardiac arrest, an exit to the misery that was Epic Movie. There is not ONE funny moment in this entire movie. The fact that it is labeled a comedy is not only an insult to comedy, but an insult to us all. 5 year olds see this movie and become scarred for life. 50 year olds see this and want to end their life.

If George Bush were to do ONE thing right in the rest of his lame duck Presidency, he would do a house-to-house round up of all copies of Epic Movie (should be easy, as nobody would EVER buy this), and bury them in the desert next to ET, the game.

What I don't understand is how this thing could of ever been made. The problem with the film is that is a poorly organized collection of attempts at spoofing hit films using comedic elements that are mostly puerile and sophomoric (basically it looks like it was written by people with the comic sense of a elementary school kid). I mean, there is a take off on Willy Wonka where the guy starts eating chocolate from a river and cannot stop, and is then told it is a sewage line.The film is extremely muddled and disorganized. It's really hard to describe. It is almost unwatchable.Yeah, there were a couple of high points - seeing Fred Willard again was one, and the part where the Fred Willard character was Kung Fu fighting using an obviously Asian double was actually good - but that was it. Some of the beginning was good - the Davinci code knockoff was OK. But that was it. And, for no apparent reason, there are a couple of unclad females - nice to look at but irrelevant.If you want to see good movie spoofs - watch \"Airplane\", \"Hot Shots\", the vastly under-rated \"Top Secret!\" and \"Spaceballs\" - these movies succeed without resorting to excessive stupid humor and do not require that the watcher have intimate knowledge of the movies they're spoofing. The movies also have a coherent story (note to writers - WATCH THESE FILMS AND LEARN!!!!!)",

You really know that a movie like this has failed when its parody of another movie (an action movie!) is less funny than the original.

Trampling all over cherished highlights of great movie making? Right-o. Overuse of bodily functions? Check. Hitting below the belt? - Belt?

Sorry, I think pop culture spoofing of other movies are generally good when its actually done with someone who actually has talent in writing funny things. That was simply a stupid filler movie with bits for 2007. With very few bits that were funny enough to smirk. I've seen TV original comedy movies, like example Men in White, being funnier than this train wreck of a movie. It could be just sign of me getting old, but only people generally laughing in theater was teenagers who properly haven't seen a decent comedy movie before.",

The idea for this movie was clearly concocted in a marketing meeting with a bunch of fat execs who sat down one day with their big Starbucks coffees and Dunkin Doughnuts and came up with a movie idea that would hit all of their target markets, whilst ripping off any movie that has made money over the last yearYeah, Scary Movie did it, but at least it was funny, and was poking fun back at Hollywood by showing that movies designed by marketers were the real joke. I guess the marketing people didn't get that joke either.I mean what is going on in this world? Who read this script and thought it was a good idea? How did this movie ever get made?

            "content": "*REVEALS SPOILERS TO BOTH \"EPIC\" AND \"DATE\" MOVIES\"*I saw it with my younger brother. We laugh at just about anything. But for this \"movie\" spoof, we rarely laughed at all. Sure we thought Kal Penn with top-billing would be a nice touch. But it's only a touched, Because the real star is the idiotic Adam Campbell with second billing. He not only has more scenes then Kal Penn, but the story revolves Campbell because he's the leader. Not helping either are the two female leads who I've never heard of and probably won't remember. \"Date Movie\" was far much worse, starting with opening credits of a fat chick dancing to a lame song. At least there were no opening credits to have the audience sit in agony. Plus it's a spoof on romantic comedies only your parents have seen. Are we supposed to be entertained by movies that came out so many years ago? Like with the \"Lord of the Rings\" joke for instance. Which wasn't funny. The saga ended in 2003 and we see this film in 2006. Don't these film-makers have any sense of cultural relevance? In this new spoof of very recent Hollywood blockbusters, the only highlights are a training montage at Hogwarts, Carmen Electra as Mystique, and Crispin Glover as a rightfully creepy Wonka. That's it! No other laughs, no coherent storyline, No climax, no clever dialogue, no decent acting. No funIf I could give career advice to these two directors it would be two pages long. But I guess I'll have to condense it into one paragraph. 2 of the 6 writers of \"Scary Movie.\" If you want your future films to be funny here's what you do. Remove fat jokes because they aren't funny, avoid cheesy celebrity impressions from semi look-alikes. Put in some more flashy special effects and not ones stolen from other films. Negotiate a few big stars to be in the lead. Minimize dance and rap moves. They only work in concerts. And above all, try screening your films to tests audiences. That way you know what works and what doesn't. Nows your chance to emulate the Wayans brothers since they've recently made bad films. I suggest you take that rare opportunity. And I hope you the viewers and the film-makers will find this information useful.",

Even if the plot was even slightly comprehensible, the actors don't seem to know what they're doing, or where they are, or even why they've allowed themselves to appear in such shameful trash.There is no humour in Epic Movie; the \"2 out of 6 writers from Scary Movie\" just rely on mind-blowingly stupid, pathetic parodies to \"entertain us\", which are nothing like the parodies in the Scary Movie franchise. Those were actually funny. It's like they've taken the most extremely straight-forward, obvious aspects from well-known movies, added an unprecedented level of stupid childish homophobic potty humour and tried to make us laugh by showing the characters from Narnia, The Davinci Code and Charlie and the Chocolate Factor dancing to hip-hop music.When you can't even successfully parody something that actually deserved to be made, THAT's when you have a problem.3/10.

We were in that stage when being the biggest menace to society and crude as possible was cool and fun. We sat down and watched this movie in the theater, and laughed our butts off. Wanna know why? Because we were kids who didn't care about the \"plot\" or anything like that. We just wanted to laugh and have a good time. And the crude jokes just made that easier for us.

This IS the worst movie I've ever seen in my 29 years on this earth. It's not funny to watch to laugh at how bad it is either...it's just HORRIBLE.

Funny tidbits and some interesting movie veterans, I think, gives it a good excuse to kill an hour and a half of fun.

Afterward, I lamented to my friend how awful this movie really was and even he, having slept through around 2/3 of this movie knew, commenting \"Yeah, you didn't wake me up from laughing.\" Do not see this movie. It is of the same line of films as the \"Scary Movie\" and other such dreck. At least the \"Scary Movie\" franchise scores a few laughs now and again. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL!

With a combination of bad parodies, M-TV spoofs, and poor slap stick comedy the movie just fell flat.The only way to describe how I felt through this movie is that it was like a Bad \"You had to be there kind of story\" from an annoying co-worker, they tell you its gonna be funny, but as they tell you the story it just gets worse and worse.Sure the movie made me laugh a few times, but they were too few, and too far apart.Even the rest of the audience *and the theater was packed* laughed hardly except for an annoying fat guy in the back who laughed at everything and probably anything.*Spoilers* The only thing I actually thought was funny was the ending *even though it was kind of moronic* was how it incorporated one of MAIN jokes from the Borat movie *I'll let you guess what joke it is..........NOT*.Aside from that, the movie is really only worth it if you have nothing better to do.",

Quite frankly, this movie provokes descriptions such as disgusting, disrespectful, perverted, vile, inappropriate,,,I could probably apply every negative word I could think of here, but you get the point. Here are a few of the many examples I could give for my negative opinion of \"Epic Movie\": --Lots of sex, sexual innuendo, some very explicit, many very perverse. --Producer obviously has an agenda. Many social norms are ridiculed and many social perversions are made to appear the norm. --LOTS of cursing including use of the \"F\" word. --LOTS of violence, not just sword fights and gun battles, bit people just out of the blue turning around and using brute force against the person next to them, repeatedly, for no apparent reason. And, this type violence is prevalent through the whole movie. --Many scenes based on watching people urinate.I honestly do not understand why this movie is not rated R and wish it would have been so that I would not have seen it.

Words cannot describe just how much this movie sucks. I have seen better story lines and funnier material come out of a junior high school production. This doesn't even qualify as a movie. It's a sting of skits thrown together one after the other in an attempt to make fun of different movies. That's not the problem though, I've seen those kind of movies before with Scary Movie(s) and others of that type. At least those movies were well written and the jokes were funny. This junk wouldn't even appeal to a 10 year old. I won't waste my time or yours by going on and on. This movie isn't worth the effort. It sure as Hell isn't worth the money to see it.",

The entire theatre seemed to feel the same way, I only heard a couple of chuckles throughout the movie, and I am not even sure it was the movie they were laughing at.

            "content": "Boredom is a tricky being. It is a tragic time and happens frequently among those who invite it in. I had the boredom bug tonight. It makes you do strange things that you would never do if you were thinking clearly. I called friends that did not pick up their phones. I eventually called one who suggested that me, him, and some friends all go see \"Epic Movie\" because they were going to see it anyways. Normally, I would not be phased by friends to see a movie I have sworn on two Holy Bibles not to see, but this feeling of boredom led me to go all the while knowing exactly what I am getting myself into.I tried on several occasions to get the fellows to see a different film, but I did not prevail. We sat in the theater, the lights went down and it actually started off really, really well. And by \"it\", I mean the previews. Gosh darn it, I wish they had gone on forever. Eventually the \"film\" started. I put quotes around film because I can not call this monstrosity a film. I can call it an embarrassment of technology. It's films like these that make me think that maybe humans don't deserve to live on this planet. Maybe just a big radioactive nuclear missile should just go off and take out the planet for millions of years. From where I'm sitting right now, it doesn't sound half bad.The movie begins and already we've got idiocy I've only heard about on the E! channel. As I sit through this movie, I start thinking of many ways to hurt myself to take away from the pain that I'm feeling. Randomly throughout the movie, I punch myself in the leg to deaden it... fun stuff. About thirty minutes in (what felt like three days in the Sahara desert with no water and a troll following you around telling you how gay you are) I haven't seen or heard a single solitary joke. I've heard scarce laughter, but I didn't know why! When something was said on screen when I thought \"huh... wow, is this what eating too many aspirin's feels like right before you die?\" others were laughing and going \"My, what humorists these thespians be\".By the end of the film, I had only laughed once. Yes, it is true, I laughed once and I think it was part because of something so unbelievable outrageous happened and part because I thought about if I worked at the movie theater and could run the reel to the film that I would do the decent thing and destroy all evidence that this actually hit theaters. It's been almost an hour since the movie ended and I haven't blinked yet. I think back to what the movie actually was: a film that basically had other actors portray characters from summer movies doing the EXACTLY THE SAME F***ING THING AS THE CHARACTERS IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIES!!! Oh, but they added a fart, pee, or poop element to them. I apologize for using such strong language, but I don't feel to well right now. It might be because the minute I got home I drank an entire bottle of drain cleaner to get out all the \"bad\" that Epic Movie instilled in me. The film also had the elements of randomly throwing in attractive blonde, scantily-clad women coming in to dry hump air to \"awesome\" (sarcastic quotations there) rap music. Shakespeare would be proud.This bulletin has been written for three reasons: a review, a warning, and a renouncing. That's right as of right now I am renouncing my faith as a Christian. There can't be a God if he allows movies like Epic Movie to be made and somehow led me astray to the theater and into that room, that dreaded room where I saw my life literally crumble into a thousand tiny pieces of badger excrement. I'm not mad, though. Oh no, I am merely embarrassed for us as a society that we can accept such trash into our theaters and pay more for it than a warm meal.Don't let the boredom get you, my friends. Here are some suggestions of what you can do instead of see this film: Buy a bunch of Sheryl Crow CD's and listen to them while cleaning your kitchen with a small toothbrush.Find a younger sibling and give them a screwdriver, then proceed to tell them to play dentist with you, you'll start by being the patient of course.Bake sugar cookies, but replace every element of sugar with chlorine. Bake for ten to fifteen minutes and enjoy.Go clubbing with Paris and Lindsay.Eat a live animal and don't cry. See if you've got what it takes to be \"a man\".Watch reruns of The Golden Girls while counting all the individual fibers of your carpet... naked.Urinate on some motorcycles outside a Biker Bar... see how fast you can really run.Shoot a cop... spend the rest of your life in prison.Just please... for the love of God... do NOT watch Epic Movie. There is only one thing this movie is good for and that it's one of the greatest sources for a reason to commit suicide and die young that I have ever seen. It will probably be named, in my book, not just the worst movie of the year... but probably of ALL time. Who knows... I haven't even seen Date Movie. Crap.",

            "content": "I have a personal policy against condemning any film, or book, or TV show, or band, or comedian, utterly. There's enough negativity out there from the flamers, the trolls, people who like to spew venom and hide behind their cybernetic anonymity. Besides, why should we listen to the opinions of others, going into something lacking an open mind, just following sheepishly on advance word or The Buzz, or the words of some mealy-mouthed critic who was probably a failed filmmaker-novelist-musician taking it out on others who at least have made an attempt at something? Give everyone a fair chance, man! Does this mean that Epic Movie defied the critics and turned out to be a good movie? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Are you kidding? It was dross! But no, I am determined not to add to the general negative karma that's floating on the electronic ether. Stay positive, stay positive. Thankfully I didn't spend any money on this, just lost a bet and had it given to me to watch, before passing it onto my 12-year-old niece, whose friends had watched it and liked it. Upon viewing it herself, she liked it too, though she's astute enough to be equally embarrassed at liking it. And having seen it as well, it was initially successful at the box office, and was trimmed on general release to get a wider audience, as only 12 year olds would appreciate it. 12 year olds who undergo involuntary spasms of laughter when they hear swear words and sub-Carry On puns (\"Harry Beaver\", anyone?), and generally have sufficient attention deficit to half-watch it while ruminating over whether or not Johnny Depp is hotter than Orlando Bloom. (He is, by the way. I'm straight, and even I know he's hotter than most main sequence suns in our galaxy.) Epic Movie has been made by the same people who did Date Movie, and to judge from the titles, presumably also Not Another Teen Movie and the Scary Movie series. Or maybe they all attended the same grade-school classes where all their best jokes were written. I think I saw Scary Movie once, so I'm certain I've seen them all: some semi-talented and talented people embarrass themselves to varying degrees while spoofing other films in amazingly limp and uncreative fashions. No, spoofing's too strong a word; that implies even a measure of wit involved- No, wait! I'm starting to contradict my earlier Mission Statement on promoting positivity. take a deep breath, start again\u0085 The plot is a Frankenstein monster of, you guessed it, epic movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Da Vinci Code and The X-Men, with minor organs in the beast garnered from less epic fare such as Borat, Nacho Libre, and Snakes on a Plane. Again, I can't use the word \"spoof\" here, because there's almost no attempt at any wit or satire with these. And no, I don't count showing Magneto with a giant Warner Brothers cartoon-style magnet on his head, or calling the Narnia villainess the White B*tch instead of Witch, or having Willy Wonka as a cannibalistic maniac. Mel Brooks at his worst remains superior to what's offered here, because he at least can recreate the target scenes and provide jokes, however lame. Yes, I have just stated that there are worse films than Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and I'm sticking by that claim with Galilean tenacity. What makes it more tragic than deplorable is that there seems to be a genuine, professional attempt to make a decent film (some scenes demonstrate at least an aptitude at creativity) as well as rich, faithful recreations of many of the various elements of the original films. Of special note is Crispin Glover's uncanny impression of Depp's Wonka, and SNL's Darrell Hammond's equally laudable copy of Depp's Jack Sparrow. But giving nothing but accurate recreations is no more funny than that class clown who thought it was amusement in itself to mimic everyone's voices around him. It's as if the screenwriters abandoned the notion of providing humor in favor of letting the audience play Reference Bingo and go, \"Oh yeah, they took that bit from The Fast and The Furious!\" But not totally; there are brief moments that made me chuckle, maybe even laugh if I'd had another beer in me. But it becomes embarrassing, like watching a drunken friend humiliate himself by trying to walk a straight line in an effort to prove his sobriety when everyone knows he can barely manage a few steps. And when they weren't mostly failing to be funny, they had their characters break into hip-hop gyrations. The first time, seeing Oompa Loompas do it, is almost funny. Seeing pirates do it, then mythical warriors, then mutants following, and this tenuous bungee cord of a gag is ready to snap\u0085 The four leads are forgettable, as they're meant to be, and I expect nothing less- no! Stop that, it's mean! It's not as if the better, more talented performers who appear could do much better with what they were given: Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Glover and Hammond have appeared in some of the funniest films around, and I'm confident enough in their abilities that they'll survive this. There you go: the scenery looked nice, I almost laughed out loud, and I liked some of the performers to wish them better roles than what they had here. See? That was positive enough, wasn't it? Take that, Samuel Johnson!",

She discovers that \"lame\" has seven letters in it, and hurriedly buys candy as she is chased by an annoying psychotic albino guy who has a whip. the candy gives her a golden ticket, which leads her to Willie wonkas factory. Meanwhile, one of the other orphans, Susan, is on a plane. This becomes a parody of one of the most easily laughable films of the year, snakes on a plane. They discover the snakes...on the plane, and she is thrown out of the plane to crush a decidedly self-absorbed Paris Hilton. She finds a golden ticket in her bag. the humor ends here. all of it. The other two discover tickets in similarly ridiculous situations. once in the factory, Willie wonka reveals to them that he has an interesting plan for them, and fergie music blares as he traps them and harvests their organs for candy. They discover the wardrobe to Gnarnia (Narnia) in Mr. wonka's factory. Lucy, the first one in, meets Mr tumnous in a stupid cribs parody, and meets his life partner, the beaver. The orphans are separated from Edward, who was deceived by the 'white bitch'(ha ha very funny) and is now captive in a jail cell. He meets up with captain jack swallow, a pirate on a fake ship. Cue the scantily clad women dancing. the pirates then dance to rap music and we are sickened by a fat man washing himself. The writers apparently found this so side-splitting that they used this rap video type thing one or two times more. The orphans meet up with harry potter who agrees to teach them to use spells, fight, and such. I'm going to skip right over the part with the pregnant Hermione, and continue on to aslow's camp. they are greeted by, among others, James bond from the recent casino Royal. This just shows us how quickly they threw this thing together.there, everybody gets drunk, bonks aslow, and we are subjected to the thousandth unnecessary pop culture reference when they make a fat Britney spears joke. OK, the battle. they get there, realize that they are outnumbered, and are about to fight when the white bitch turns into an..er..extremely effeminate Davy Jones. He mixes a few rap tracks, everybody dances, and in comes Jack swallow on his wheel. an octopus attacks his face, so he looses control of it and just crashes. the writers have now backed themselves into such a corner that the only way they can get out of it is with a major cheat. Peter discovers the remote from click and uses it to stop all the opposing forces. they then take great joy in stabbing, spelling, and breaking chairs over heads of their frozen enemies. at the end, they re-discover the wardrobe, tumble through, and are greeted by borat when they are all crushed by the giant wheel.the end. Okay, there are many things which would have been funnier than epic movie. among them... 1) a six year old making her dog dance to la cucharacha. 2) eating a chunk of asphalt. 3) shaving your hairy great aunt bertha. 4) OK, i've been to funerals with a better sense of humor. So,if you are looking for a laugh, save yourself the 86 minutes, see another movie, go bowling, attend a funeral, just please, don't see epic movie.

And when at the end of the movie, 4 of them get crushed by Jack Swallows. What was that?!! But there are some of the scene that makes me laugh a little bit. Like when Susan get kicked out from the plane and fall on top of Paris Hilton (the look-alike). And when Lucy freaking out and kicked the talking beaver (two times but different scene). I don't know what you guys think of this movie. But for me, I think it's a waste of time. Just like Date Movie. BORING!!! I think that the director who direct this movie haven't got any idea with the jokes. I cannot wait for the Scary Movie 5 (I don't know it's true or not. I saw it in this site).

Then waste your money and see this movie. Other words use your 9.50 and see a good movie like Children of Men, or Pan's Labyrinth. Epic Movie was a disaster. I have a feeling this is the sort of humor you would get if you put Condoleeza Rise and Dick Chaney and told them they had one hour to come up with 100 jokes. Not a good thing.The movie made fun of various pop culture ideas, Paris Hilton, Borat, Snakes on a Plane, Sudoku, Dead Mans Chest, and many others. Tell me what part of Borat, and Snakes on a Plane warrants a satirical view? They are already satire! The humor was very stale too, they took the jokes already said in other stupid humor movies and said them again. It's like watching Airplane, then Airplane II the Sequel, all the same jokes repeated.This movies humor was so stale, that the few one-liners I thought were amusing, were only amusing because of how UN-amusing the rest of the jokes are. The simple placement of \"Chuck Norris Rocks\" now that I think of it is no longer funny. A year ago yes, but not anymore. I chuckled though because I was desperately searching for something to laugh at.The jokes in the movie were not at all creative, most stupid humor movies; their jokes are actually creative. Not epic movie however, for example, they switched up the most obvious things. Changing Willy Wonka's chocolate river with a sewage line, Changing The White Witch in Narnia to \"The Wight Bitch.\" The jokes were just plane, and UN-inventive.I am a sucker for stupid humor films. I loved all the good ones, all the Mel Brooks flicks, Kung Fu Hustle, Shoulin Soccer, Monty Python, Black Adder, I love it. I never thought that it was actually possible not to be successful making a stupid humor film; however that's exactly what Epic Movie Did.

All those other reviews saying it sucks the proverbial balls are right on the mark! My friend was very, very annoyed with me for making him lose 60-odd minutes of his life (and rightly so) but I sat there the whole time thinking \"It's gonna get funny any minute now, surely?\" but then all of a sudden it's over! And although the short run-time is a bit of a rip-off, in retrospect, it's probably a good thing.A big thank-you to the reviewers of IMDb for confirming it's not just me - this movie both sucks AND blows. Stay away from it. It could be more detrimental to your health than the video from RING!",

In my opinion these are wonderful, hilarious films that despite being silly, are also quite enjoyable.Sadly, the parody genre has degraded a lot over the last few years. I thought Scary Movie 1 & 2 were okay as well as Not Another Teen Movie, but this is nothing but a low-water mark in comedy. It's like they went into this project, thinking: \"Whatever, it's not like we're making a real movie, it's just a parody.\" Well, a funhouse needs a good structure as much as any other building, or else it will fall apart.First off, the story, if you can even call it that, makes no sense. Don't get me wrong, inconsistencies and such makes other parodies great, but they also have some kind of plot, whether it's taken directly from a different movie or something original. What we have here is just a bunch of scenes put together where the humor depends too much on the likeness of the films they spoof.Second, the tempo is awfully frustrating. A good joke needs timing, whether it's quick or slow. In Epic Movie, the jokes are stretched out like saltwater taffy, as if the directors are thinking: \"Sooner or later they'll laugh at it\".Third, there are too many different movies from too many different genres in the mix. A spoof on Narnia should mainly be crossed with LoTR and Harry Potter, Superman Returns with X-Men The Last Stand, et cetera, but to go this far is just annoying.Fourth, so many good talents are wasted here. Seeing Jayma Mays acting like an overgrown, lisping 8-year-old just breaks my heart. She seems very sweet and I think she can do better than this. Same goes for Jennifer Coolidge. She can be really funny, but the only thing she did that I laughed at was this line: \"The kids have es-kay-puh-duh.\" The fact that she never screams bugged me too. She's the bad guy, for crying out loud! A good villain should be able to be somewhat loud and menacing, even if it's just a parody. Heck, even Dark Helmet did that better than her.Thank goodness for people like Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, known for their work on Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. These guys know how to make good parodies/homages and they show us there's still hope. I know everybody has different tastes and opinions when it comes to movies, but people ought to be smart enough to figure out what they really want to get for their money. If Hollywood starts to notice garbage like this doesn't do well at the box office, there might be some improvement. Hopefully.",

I guess this is a movie where you either love it or really, really hate it, judging from the votes. By the way, I also found the Scary Movie franchise very, very funny, and they kept making these.

Even the acting was pretty darn nifty. Crispin Glover was an inspiring Willy Wonka. Carmen Electra, though recycled throughout the Scary Movies, still shows she can play the scene straight and let the jokes blossom... even if part of the joke is that she's a shape-shifting mutant who acts more like a pussycat doll in the hallway of a school. Faune Chambers played her role beautifully as well, and good luck w/those adoptive parents! Even Jennifer Coolidge stole my heart (\"that's Stiffler's mom!\").It was the script itself that doomed this film. I really did enjoy the concept where four orphans from different cultures (and films) would meet up and go on a quest together, but the idea isn't enough when it's laced with poor dialogue and over-used references. Even the Pirates of the Caribbean music video, which I had seen previously on YouTube, was just too obscure for this film. I want to believe Jayma Mays is talented (I loved her in RED EYE), but that she was directed to be an even more stupid Cindy Campbell from Scary Movie fame, which numbed me from giving a damn about her. Overall this movie had great moments which I had wish would've lasted longer (X-Men, especially), but once it was cut together, those few moments of enjoyment just weren't enough. This movie is best saved for DVD when you can watch it while heavily drunk with your friends, but rather then rent it, buy it! ...and make sure it's the (inevitable) Unrated version, as there may be jokes you'll miss from being so far drunk and laughing w/your friends.",

The plot was thin. Even though it is a spoof, it'd still be good to at least have a structure that you could build on, with entertaining characters. Maybe then you wouldn't need so many useless Mtv references.The characters, as stated before, were weak in character and in action (save for the performance of Kal Penn, which could be the only saving grace of the film). It was tedious to view all characters acting to the same caliber, Lucy being my least favourite.There is also the question of title.

Not paying to see the film, not seeing it in 2007, and seeing it after some of the actors have become more familiar provides an altogether different perspective, and possibly this film's reputation deserves some rehabilitation.The fact that we only started to watch it during the 'Nacho Libre' scene and didn't change the channel immediately I think has to be a sort of recommendation. In fact after settling into it we managed to watch it through to the end. And it wasn't completely terrible!There's a mixed bag of humour, from very obvious visual gags, contemporary cultural references and parodies, and the whole storyline is creatively stitched together in a kind of absurdist humour, reminiscent of Monty Python.It was quite nice during the character introduction to recognise actors like Jayma Mays, Kal Penn, and later Jennifer Coolidge, from their later appearances in hit US comedy shows: Glee, How I Met Your Mother, and Two Broke Girls. But of course six years ago they were still relatively unknown, and so that dimension of familiar recognition would have been lost. Shame. But it speaks highly that the casting director picked out such talent back then, and they each play their roles quite well.As a TV movie it definitely works, and approached with low expectations can be pleasantly surprising. It doesn't look 'cheap': the indoor sets are very creative and well finished, the photography is pretty good, and as mentioned the talent also delivers. It doesn't take itself seriously, at any point, and frequently breaks the fourth-wall to remind you of the kind of movie that you're watching.Even the cultural references have a kind of a point now. This films dates itself very firmly by references to the source material of the time (all of which I saw back then) so it was nice to be reminded of those other great films that I did enjoy, six years ago. I doubt I'd watch it again though. I certainly would not have paid money to see it, but then professional film critics never pay either...",

Whatever moments in previews that were funny, I tell you, that is IT. There is nothing worth seeing in the actual movie.

Fred Willard was worth a point and a half with the other 1.5 belonging to Jayma Mays. I remember a small laugh here and there during the move, but I don't remember why or what I was laughing at 48 hours later. I do remember which parts were worse than others. The whole Willy Wonka satire, any line said by Captian Jack Swallows, any satire of Cribs, Punk'd, or any other MTV related show. However, I may be overlooking the true genius of this picture: It made big bucks. It took a genius to take this bag of moldy tangerines of a movie and make money with it. They got my $8.50. The only way I could see this movie growing on me over time is if Jayma Mays marries me. Then this would be a 10 out of 10 stars!",

Imitations are to make a copy of; reproduce closely (dictionary.com).All-be-it mostly unfunny, Saturday Night Live is still best at doing satirical parodies. They know how to take the situational or character flaws of a celebrity or news figure and exploit them to the point of enjoyment. (There are many gems coming out of the SNL camp, like new heroes characters and Andy Samburg's digital shorts).An imitation will use an original as a template, or if extremely lazy completely just rip off the source material. Since we're contrasting imitations with parodies, imitations in this case usually put a twist to the source. For example, Mr. Tumnus in Epic Movie is played by the actor who brought life to Nacho Libre's tag partner/ Napoleon Dynamyte's friend Pedro. In order to make the character funny, they just made him look really weird, essentially he played the exact same character of Mr. Tumnus in Narnia- the first time.Epic movie also put a FULL 5 minute imitation of MTV cribs. Yes their observations on rappers and scarface were true, but it was funny the first 4 years of my life I saw it on SNL, Mad TV, any other show that actually takes itself seriously in the form of Cribs.Epic movie also put a FULL 4 minute imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia song that came out --( notice my imitation of paragraphs)------ oh I don't know, over 1 year ago? The Chronic-What-cles of Narnia is technically a comedic parody in itself: it parodies hard rap and nerds that really want to see an epic movie like Narnia. RULE: Never Ever Make A Parody of a Parody. It was virtually the same beat, with a new movie title put in.Oh and if you make an Epic Movie --- make sure all the movies IMITATED are Epic. I don't think Talledega Nights is considered epic, nor was it a blockbuster. Neighter was Borat, or Nacho Libre. --- And Paris Hilton isn't epic.",

Although, I think it's because I love Family Guy because of it's oddness, and randomness, I think that's why I found it so enjoyable.This film first starts out, with a narrator (much like Charlie and the chocolate factory's style) introducing each character. While introducing each character, the characters each find a Golden ticket in a Willy Bar. *Spoilers* From there, they go to the Willy Candy factory (they don't use Wonka for legal reasons) and Willy shows them the candy room, complete with open sewer line. Then, Willy tells the orphans, that there will be a piece of them each in his candy. It's what makes it so delectable. He locks them in the candy room, and takes a body part from them each. Then after wards, they are in another room waiting... and they hear Willy coming, so they all hide. Lucy finds the room where the wardrobe is kept, and opens it. A ton of junk crushes her. She goes in, and is taken to Gnarnia. The other orphans follow shortly after. They must stop the \"WHITE BITCH\"This is actually a really good movie. If you love random things happening, like \"FAMILY GUY\" style, then this is for you.",

Date Movie went all over the place,it hard to spoof already funny movies. So I gave Epic Movie a 7 out of 10 for the effort.Kal Penn was great in this and I hope to see more of him in leading roles.The Things I liked The Harry Potter part was funny I loved the Jack Sparrow parody The Use of the Witch,The Lion and the Wardrobe as the glue for the movie.I wont mention the bad, I think everyone has covered it.",

In fact, the funniest parts of this movie were the quick little references it made to movies such as Star Wars and James Bond. Seeing the Stormtroopers as part of the White Bitch's army was among the funnier parts of the movie. Considering the amount of hype this movie got, and the movie it could have been, it was epically awful. Please, God, make the next spoof movie clever.",

Some people say that this movie \"sucked\" or this movie \"rocked!\" In my view, I say that this movie \"rocked\" and I do plan on buying this one on DVD. No Epic Movie is not a blockbuster but it is something you should pay about $6 to enjoy. You will be surprised on how well the impersonations are, the spoofs are, and the stunts are.

This movie is a definite for anyone with a funny bone and likes any films like Pirates Of The Caribbean, X Men, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory (2006), Snakes On A Plane, Narnia, Nacho Libre, Da Vinci Code or any of the other big blockbusters next year.If your willing to risk it, see this movie.If you don't find people taking the p*** out of blockbusters and involve urine, vomit, turd, farts and stuff like that, STAY AWAY.10/10 from me.",

If you did not like Scary Movie then it is obvious Epic Movie will not be your cup of tea. I think that the people reviewing this movie should have that particular sense of humor associated with parody movies. I am one of those people and i loved the Scary Movies, my favorite songs are my Weird Al Yankvich and i was in hysterics for a lot of Epic Movie.So a word of advise for people who review movies... Of course there are going to be bad comments if the person doesn't enjoy the genre they are critquing, so give every movie a fair go and let it be judged by the true fans of that genre. We are the only people who could really judge the quality of one parody movie to the next.Thankyou and goodnight.",

Finally, that a movie can really be 2 out of 10 or less. I feel as if I could make a funnier spoof with no funding or professional filming/ acting. To give an idea of the lack of humor, imagine a man with severe AD/HD with a camera and script in his hands. Not only was this film hard to follow, it wasn't worth following.

In all actuality though, the movie wasn't THAT bad. It was far superior to Date Movie, which I walked out of last year. But the movie itself is so short (iMDB says 86 minutes, but it didn't feel like it even cracked the eighty minute mark) that it didn't seem worth the price of admission. It actually didn't give you time to walk out even if you wanted too.The two (out of six) Scary Movie writers, Friedberg and Seltzer, were hit or miss with their bits. But luckily there were more hits than misses. I've got to tell you though; these dudes are OBSESSED with the black rapper and MTV culture. Every other joke is someone having a grill or break dancing or getting \"crunk\" or being a DJ on a turntable. And in Date Movie they did the \"Pimp My Ride\" joke, so of course here they've got to do the \"Cribs\" knock off. If you find that kind of thing funny, this ones a can't miss.But...I will admit I laughed at quite a few of the bits, and the performers did pretty well. Jayma Mays was spot on with her Anna Faris impersonation, and Kal Penn (who seems like he should have grown past these type of movies by now) was able to hold it all together real nicely...as was the rest of the cast. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie in theaters unless you're extremely bored and need to waste eighty minutes, but I would recommend seeing it when it comes to HBO or Showtime. It's decent for what it's suppose to be, but it's not really worth the price to get in.",

The \"segments\" in the trailer is pretty much all that particular spoof is, they last no longer and have no more jokes. The only movie they seemed to make fun of was Narnia, and even that was done somewhat poorly. Not to mention the string between all the movies was weak and made hardly any sense. The budget was also pretty cheap, and was silty reflected in the film. Not to mention the movie seemed to be strung together pretty quickly. And finally, it has too much humorless physical violence, lets face it, no amount of hits in the cock is going to make the movie any better. So if you are planning to see this film, do yourself a favor, save some money, and just see the trailer on the website.My Rating: 4.5/10",

The characters were brilliant and comical. I would have to say I would like to go see it again. It was actually more funny than I thought it would be, because date movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.

A lot more could have been done to make this a solid movie, but as in all parody type movies, what do you expect?

Eventually they find the wardrobe in the room and enter the wild world of Gnarnia (the g is silent, spelled so for legal reasons) where most of the movie takes place. Movies parodied include Nacho Libre, Xmen, Superman, Chronicles of Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean, DaVinci Code, and a few more.. you lose track after a while.. The credits at the end are long because a couple times they break into song and dance yet again.. so beware if you are one of those people who flee out the door as soon as the credits roll, you might miss a chance to see more goofy stuff.I'd give it a lower rating for the cheesy acting and storyline, but I digress a little because I appreciate a good sarcastic apathetic make fun of comedy.

Jackson look-alike said was \"I'm sick of these god-damn snakes on this god-damn plane\" and he said that about 4 times before the spoof thankfully ended.There was also small spoofs of Superman Returns, Tallageda Knights, James Bond, Star Wars, Click etc. But those lasted either a minute of a few seconds. Also they do make fun of Kanye West, Ashton Kutcher, P. Diddy and Mission Impossible.They made of Harold and Kumar: Go to White Castle a lot in this movie, which was really funny because of Kal Penn even allowing them to do so.The movie does have a lot of swear words, a couple s***'s and one f-bomb and a bunch more but that was about it.This movie did have some moments, but unfortunately, not enough to prove me wrong.I give this movie 4 stars/10 stars.",

It is only funny in a movie if a person falls on a bike jump (for real) or a skateboard movie. But getting a fake beer bottle thrown at your head and falling over doesn't make people laugh. It makes people cringe and want to barf all over this piece of crap. If there was a rating lower than 1 that is what i would rate Epic Movie.",

Even though the move contained great casts whom I have enjoyed in movies from American Pie, Harold and Kumar, Date movie, etc. There was really no plot to this trash but just an ongoing plot to make fun of other movies in a way that was just not to taste even for a comedy buff like me. Not once did I laugh throughout this whole movie. Either the movies that they tried to burn were too hard to burn or they just did not put enough effort into it either way this movie was just not up to par.

            "content": "\"Epic Movie\" is epicly bad! It may have been number one at the box office, but it's clearly due to the amount of hopefuls, much like myself, who were praying for a wonderful comedy. The film was written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who were responsible for the \"Scary Movie\" motion pictures. That should have been my first clue. The film, in my opinion was a pathetic attempt to recreate a series of films, which are already terrible enough. The ironic part about the entire thing is that spoofing, in the heart of \"Saturday Night Live,\" is one of my favorite mediums. Friedberg and Seltzer have no idea how to do this properly. They took what was advertised as a hilarious spoof on a large collection of movies and wasted that potential within the first half hour or less of the film. The remainder of the movie was only a spoof on the film \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" which lacked imagination and talent. One of the lead characters, \"Lucy\" played by Jayma Mays, was a clear rip off of on the Cindy Campbell character in the \"Scary Movie\" series, which was played by actress Anna Faris. I can only guess that Faris turned down the role in \"Epic.\" The only redeeming quality in this movie, for me, was the ever hilarious Darrell Hammond as \"Captain Jack Swallows\" and Fred Willard as \"Aslo the Lion\" from the land of Narnia. Both of which were severely and unfortunately minimal roles. The film over all is absolutely terrible, with an equally terrible script, horrendous acting, and is an epicly huge waste of time and money.",

People were leaving at the middle of the movie, and they weren't even paying attention to it.

            "content": "By far the worst movie I've ever seen. I get it... its not meant to be an Oscar winner, but this goes beyond terrible. We get it, you can make fun of a lot of different movies in an hour and a half, but enough is enough. The first two scary movies weren't terrible(not my favorites) yet they still spoofed plenty of movies, the difference is they had a plot, and many of the spoofs were more subtle. I don't normally criticize movies because everyone has different taste, but I feel like it is my duty to society to warn you about this one. If I can convince just one person to not see this movie then it will have been worth it. I now have to live with the shame of watching this movie, something that nobody can take away.Here is a quote from IMDb's FAQs list \"There are many(spoofs), but the main plot revolves around \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", \"X-Men\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Snakes on a Plane\", \"Nacho Libre\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".\" THE MAIN PLOT REVOLVES AROUND 7 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIES!!! In other words, there is no plot. That mixed with no humor makes a terrible combination. They jumped so quickly from idea to idea that i had no idea how the purple pirate midgets got onto the Death Star made out of swiss cheese(never actually happen, but you get the point.)It wasn't even silly to the point of being good, I spent the entire movie wondering how many movies they could possibly fit into a scene. Most porn has a better plot than this piece of garbage.You might as well watch Mad TV....if the writers were replaced by ADD five year old children picking plots out of a hat....and any possibly talented actor was replaced by a brain-dead chimp. There was too much time spent trying to tie everything together and throw in more references to make an actual joke. It was a terrible film.Its a shame this movie set out to be a spoof. I think that if Friedberg and Seltzer were trying to produce a real movie we could all laugh at how bad it was instead of having the movie shove itself in your face like a obnoxious drunk.",

The script is comparable to someone taking a crap on a piece of paper, and saying, \"Oh, LOOK, it's a movie!\" The acting was mediocre, the story line made NO sense whatsoever. There were only two good things about the movie: The scenes with the Borat look-alike, and the guy who played Captain Jack Swallows. He was at least funny enough to get a laugh out of me...something the rest of the movie failed to do. Thus the two star rating rather than one.The part in which Harry Potter was parodied was especially terrible. Definitely NOT funny, it was simply disrespectful, pathetic, and stupid. If they're going to parody a movie in which the actors play characters who are much younger than them, Harry Potter is NOT it.I'm just glad we only borrowed this movie from a friend, and it only cost us a little bit of time to watch.

Perhaps the only bright spot would be Jayma Mays as the dim-witted, but cute Susan. While only a pale imitation of Anna Faris, she does make the best of a badly-written clich\u00e9 of a role, (in stark contrast to her appallingly brief appearance in \"Heroes\" as the charming, but doomed waitress Charlie.)

On the other hand, Epic Movie is a train wreck.Ah, where to begin...first of all, I thought much of the \"humor\" was vile and vulgar (or, what was at least supposed to be funny). There are several jokes about going to the bathroom, flatulence, impotence, vomiting, so forth and so on. Good parodies such as Spaceballs and Spy Hard can spoof without resorting to toilet humor...toilet humor is used in Epic Movie, and it is childish, gross, and not funny. In addition, many of the scenes parodied were just jumbled in the middle of the film and made no sense to the plot, such as a parody of Superman, a James Bond spoof, and the parody of Scarface. Many nonsensical jokes fill the plot of the movie. The numerous jokes about rap music are not funny, not even unintentionally.Avoid this film. It is absolutely awful.

We were laughing so hard, especially during the Willy Wonka part.

            "content": "All I can say after watching this movie is \"How did this script EVER get green-lighted?\" It goes without saying that the latest \"Movie\" movie is by far the worst to date. Not only that, I believe this movie is certainly in the running for worst comedy of the year. The \"Movie\" movie franchise should have died with the original \"Scary Movie\", though I did get a small amount of enjoyment from it's subsequent sequels.\"Epic Movie\" is a spoof comedy that revolves around several popular movie franchises that I suppose could be called epic - though the term is sometimes a stretch. Films such as \"Nacho Libre\", \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and YES, even \"Snakes on a Plane\" make an appearance here. The movie is fueled by terrible writing, and is riddled with awful comedy. On top of everything else, the film is only 75-ish minutes long, which typically wouldn't be bad except for the 20 minute breakout in the middle of the movie where the faun of \"Gnarnia\" (Narnia) shows us his house a la MTV's \"Cribs\".The crude fart humor that this movie consistently pumps out at you is enough to make you want to choke. Essentially, that is all this movie is, as there is no solid plot line to speak of other than 15 minute forays the characters in the movie have with one epic movie to the next. Think of it as the story of four orphans who are kidnapped by Willy Wonka and escape his \"evil clutches\" by going through a magical wardrobe. I am totally serious.This movie should rightfully be getting a rating of 0/10, but for the sake of making SOMETHING about this movie funny, I have decided that it deserves 0.002/10. IMDb is requiring I give it at least a \"1\", which in my opinion is too high. Honestly it's that terrible. For those of you who are 12 or younger, or just in general enjoy fart jokes and bad movie references, there might be something here to see. Otherwise, steer clear!",

The costumes are good. The scenery and props are great. For all intents and purposes, Epic Movie is made perfectly. HOWEVER, it is the jokes or rather the lack of them that makes Epic Movie really bad.The film is a spoof of other films, which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But what makes it a bad thing is the fact that of the jokes, I'd say about 85%-90% of the jokes (jokes being the things that are supposed to make you laugh) are just slapstick. I'm not exaggerating here. There is no \"intellectual\" humor at all, in other words, there are no jokes that require any amount of thought. Just slapstick and spoof is all you'll see.Please do not go see Epic Movie. It really is that bad. If you do go and see it, consider yourself warned.",

And the \"summer blockbuster\" type of movie is ripe for parody. Epic Movie doesn't even bother to poke fun at some of the obvious excesses of the genre. Instead, they take characters and concepts from some of the major movies of the last several years, most notably Chronicles of Narnia,put them in some lame and generic gags, most which deal with urination and goofy dancing, and offer only half hearted jabs at the movies they parody. For example, instead of poking fun at Nacho Libre for the obviously Anglo Jack Black attempting to be a Latino, they just have one of the kids beat up one of the main characters.

I'm disappointed in every actor or person in this movie. Im angry for all those great undiscovered writers and directors around the world that work hard dreaming of finally releasing a movie that 1,000 people might see and then watch as this movie rakes in more money than some Oscar nominated movies.

What's worse is that the commercials portray it as a good, fairly clean movie, maybe not an award winner, but a movie you could see on a Friday night and actually enjoy. I went to see it expecting a good laugh and all I got, for most of the movie, were girls who were wearing clothes that barely covered them, if they were wearing anything at all, and men who gave the image that these girls were doing things that they liked. While some people may enjoy this, a far majority of the population does not find girls who display themselves in revealing ways appealing. So, if you have the urge to see this movie, you can get the same experience in your own house, without paying 10 bucks. Go sit down in front of the TV and watch crappy music videos for an hour and 28 minutes. Enjoy!",

We measured', you can almost certainly conclude that its probably a film to miss. I was right. Anyone above the age of 14 can come to an instant deduction that it is a terrible film. The 'plot' jumps around, following a group of high school children, who embark on a supposedly epic quest, making parodies of various other films along the way. However, after the first 20 minutes or so, it becomes all to clear that the film relies heavily on the frequent use of crude toilet humour, and persistent references to feces. I am all to sure that a pack of 12 year olds will think that the height of all wit has been reached in this film, and would have spent majority of the time watching the film, rolling on the floor, giggling away at the references to the male genitalia, and laughing out loud at the abundance of slapstick humour that features throughout. Luckily, the people who will 'love' this film, (children aged 8-12) are those that feel you are incapable of stringing an amusing sentence together, without unleashing one of their newly discovered swear words, or making some sort vulgar reference to fart jokes. It makes me somewhat scared that if the latest crop of 8-12 year olds are so captivated by swearing and any form of slapstick and toilet humour, they fail to think of anything original and funny themselves. Is that really what the future holds for comedy? All jokes making some sort of allusion to excrement. I think you can probably guess by the 'two star' rating that this is a film to miss. It, I know, it is a generous rating, but, though ashamed to admit it, I did laugh twice, partially fulfilling it's role as a 'comedy'. At least now 'HMV' will know which genre to place it under, making the film all to easy to find for those 12 year olds, so eager to grasp hold a copy of possibly the worst film of the year. E.S",

Crispen Glover made an interested choice for Willie Wonka, but interesting does not make a great film. The premise was trite and overwrought. The jokes meant to be funny weren't.

It could have been done a whole lot better. I thought this movie was suppose to be funny. There was no one laughing in the theater when we saw it. I'd just wait to see it when it comes to HBO or Cinemax or Starz, which ever company it is going to go to. Harrold and Kumar go to white castle was better than this movie.

Wow, the beaver's name is Harry Beaver, and he makes out with a faun. What a waste of time. That's an hour of my life I'll never get back. I want my $8 back. The movie also relied heavily on the fact that Kal Penn was in White Castle with the guy from American Pie. They actually show White Castle, which is where the White Bitch lives. Coincidentally, the White Bitch was played by the chick who played Stiffler's Mom. And when Penn sees her for the first time, surprise surprise, he goes, \"Whoa, Stiffler's Mom.\" Someone needs to beat up the idiots that made this disgrace to cinema everywhere",

This film is absolutely dreadful with poor acting, poor sense of humour which are just not funny whatsoever and a pathetic attempt to make it a parody from other films. I honestly do not know why these kind of films are still being made today, (Scary Movie 5 etc.) there are so many aspiring film makers out there (myself included) that are being denied or restricted the opportunity to show off their true potential skill and knowledge in film making when crap films made by crap directors and producers like this so called 'comedy' are being made today. Now don't get me wrong, I do have a sense of humour and I enjoy watching comedy films now and again, just not the ones as badly made as this one. Even when I was made to go and watch this film at the cinema when I was 13 years old I still didn't find it funny or humorous at all. If you're a normal human being with a sense of humour, even if it's vague, watch something else other than this pathetic excuse of a film. However, if your idea of a sense of humour is tying a cat to a ceiling fan and watch it being hurled around the room for your amusement, then this is the film for you.

They start out by covering some CRAPPY songs by other unimpressive bands... but you decide to give them a chance....surely, its bound to improve right? surely the entire concert can't be covers of crappy songs? The above scenario does not fully describe the atrocity that is 'Epic Movie'. Imagine that same concert, except every NOTE to each song is out of tune... Imagine how you would feel if not one single note of one crappy song was played in tune, or with any type of coherency for that matter? That about nails this movie on the head. I won't bother summarizing the plot, because, as you no doubt have guessed, there is none. This movie is a collection of crappy actors, spoofing crappy (for the most part) movies for an hour and twenty minutes.... EVERY SINGLE JOKE falls flat on its face... the few laughs me and my buddies had (we downloaded the movie and watched it on our big screen via an extension cable) came from thoughts of \"how could this possibly make it to theaters? who OK'd this material?\" I suddenly felt an intense desire to meet the man that said \"yea, thats good, lets put that in the movie\" to all of the garbage i witnessed.There are wild inconsistencies. People are decapitated, thrown off airplanes, castrated, yet... fine in the next scene. While I realize this is intended (it must be, although such carelessness wouldn't surprise me considering how poorly this movie was put together), it was just plain dumb... not funny 'Epic Movie' intrigued me because I thought it mite be one of those \"funny because its terrible\" movies.... but it wasn't... it was simply a terrible movie that wasn't the least bit funny.When I saw 'Epic Movie' was number one at the box office, what should have been a sense of disbelief that came over me was replaced by a sense of acceptance. When you all sit around with your friends, and say \"we could write a movie better than this\"... you are right... and i don't even know you... but ide bet the lives of my family you could do it As an American I feel slightly embarrassed this movie topped our charts even for a week or so, but if Bush is President, should i really be embarrassed by this 'epic' catastrophe? probably not save your time, your money, your sanity, and your life by not seeing this movie if you already saw it in the theater... well... its alright, it happens to everyone once in awhile... the best thing is to just not think about it and move on worse than battlefield earth. and i thought that wasn't possible",

Date Movie was an atrocious film that is a disgrace to spoof movies everywhere, so, naturally, I wasn't expecting much out of Epic Movie.I was pleasantly surprised.While it is nowhere near the level of some of the great spoofs of the last 3 decades (Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Mafia, Hot Shots, Scary Movie, etc.), Epic Movie certainly has it's moments.Though it contains a lot of the unfunny, ridiculous drivel that is apparently a feeble attempt at spoofing that we saw in the last film, it has quite a few worthwhile, funny moments.It starts off quite unfunny, but don't give up on it too early! It does go somewhere, and the film really gains steam as it progresses.The highlight of the film is Darrell Hammond's GENIUS spot-on parody of Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean. He truly does a masterful job spoofing the character.Please note that you will have to be sitting through the numerous spontaneous hip-hop numbers that appear in Date Movie, but they're mercifully few and far-between.Over all, I'd give Epic Movie a 6, purely for it's spirit, and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's drastic improvement in quality from the last film.I'd say that the next one might actually be a decent comedy film.",

I noticed it's rating so i decided to watch it because I wanted to check if it really was that bad. So even I didn't think it was brilliant. An OK film (actually, good enough) is not really doing so well.There was a few funny scenes, the best being punk'd. I thought it would be crap but it was actually OK. So, I don't care what other people say, this film is actually OK. Anyway,it seemed to get a lot of money in the cinema but no one liked it.It is worth watching, and is better than its sequel (which I rated 4 out of 10).I haven't seen Scary Movie so I cannot compare but I would also like to see that as well. So, i thought this film was definitely worth watching.",

Although it is bad, I must say that I saw a lot of films which are much worse than this one (e.g. \"The silence of the Hams\"). The idea of making a \"funny\" movie which contains no plot and simply consists of a sequence of parodies of other popular movies is really not fancy.

Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off Tuco's bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco comes across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor (Bill Carson) that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie meet with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000 worth of gold.

But, sadly, that's really not the case; it's just not funny. I laughed out loud in the cinema once and then immediately felt bad because I was the only person doing it. With the exception of two 12 year old boys in the row in front; I envy them the fact that they found it hilarious.All this said, I got home and when I thought about all the separate little jokes and spoofs, I really did have a good laugh. I think that the 'setpieces', I suppose you could call them, were actually really funny out on their own - I laughed for about half an hour about Sudoku in the snow when I got home - but putting them together weakened them. It just didn't work.Although, I have to give kudos to Darrell Hammond for his 'Captain Jack Swallows' (how obvious was that joke going to be?).

It was so horrible, that me and my friend just got up and left the theater in the middle of it. We couldn't stand another minute of it and it was such a waste of our money.No originality on the humor whatsoever. All they did was take beautiful classical works, humiliate it and make fun of it, and I didn't even laugh at all (except maybe at the scene with the Paris Hilton thing-- I guess that was sort of funny.) But be warned everyone-- DO NOT waste your time, energy and money on this movie. It was a complete disaster.",

As one of the previous commenters summed up, it will leave you wondering \"What did I find so funny in the trailer?\" There were a couple places where a joke here and there was somewhat funny, but the writers relentlessly turned what would have been a funny 5 second joke into a 10 minute running gag.

Random collaboration of mass horrors. - For a long time I've been getting random questions, one day one of the questions was \"Hey Sparky I wanna make a random movie, but I want it to be best but I don't know where to start how I can make it not be like a steamy pile of poop??\" - And my answer is... As much as it PAINS me to say it.. Watch this. - WHY you ask? - Because... It gives you a good clue in on WHAT NOT TO DO when trying to make a random collaboration of events. - OK sure, some of the plot holes where hilarious, I love plot holes, BUT the problem lies in the repetition of them, plot holes are really hard to get right, the timing has to be at least decently good and the plot-hole absolutely ridiculous but different from the previous ones. It looked like they got desperate or something and decided to throw a bunch of random crap in for the sake of throwing it in. - Another problem is the MUSIC!!! Oh gods!!! Downright annoying, way to much rap!! It's not even funny rap it's downright plain old drum-mashing' person-blabbing' on top kind of rap. Of all the annoying music I've heard the ones in this movie takes the cake. If you love rap it's great but if you don't it'll be a torturous crawl. - What REALLY lets this one down is the enormous amount of pop-culture references.. Waaaaay to much!! I betcha if they left out the pop-culture references and filled them in with something else the overall greatness of this movie would skyrocket. - Also, this movie isn't MY idea of a good quality PG-13 movie, AT ALL, there is A lot of suggestive and inappropriate stuff. It should have been rated higher. - The best jokes where the simple slap-stick humor ones, which there wasn't very many of, most of them are pop-culture reference jokes (It's so bad it needs a second complaint round) that you pretty much have to know exactly what their referencing for them to be funny, of course here's another problem, a lot of people, myself included, don't pay attention to pop-culture at all, so are left thinking \"Well that was dumb\". - It seems to me that this was a decent attempt at random craziness, but it wasn't ironed out NEAR LONG ENOUGH and top of that the base was unstable anyway. - Making random crap like this is like tailoring a rug together from scratch, every thread and string must be picked carefully and strung well, if this movie was a rug it'd look like a totally rushed piece of cloth with strings of all different sizes sticking out everywhere that are in every color and pattern imaginable. - Oh yea, and it'll have a cardboard cut-out of a smiley face glued on to it. - What I'm trying to say is it was rushed, not well thought out and way to stupid!! I usually like stupid movies, but all the stupid ones I like would, on rating of 1 to 10, rate at about 9 or 10, this one breaks the scale by rating at the amazing number of infinite. (So in other words it's *epically* stupid) - Is that 'infinite' even a number? Don't think so but whatever, close enough. - So this WAS inspiring to me, no, not in the way you might be thinking!! - It inspires me to avoid the mistakes made here and this is among ultimate examples of 'lame', so, if you ever wanted to make the world's most awesome random movie, study this sucker (And others like it) to the letter and avoid those 'letters' and chances are, your movie will be great. - Anyhow, after barely managing to survive this torture all I can say is my IQ must have dropped by 99% for at least a couple of days, with at least 5% of the damage being permanent. - It's *that* bad.",

This film shows that veteran comedy actors Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard are the only people who bring anything to this film. The films lack of a spoofing genre is ridiculous. The directors have decided they can spoof anything around but all spoof films need a genre other than spoof. The spoof of Punk'd and Cribs is pointless and bring nothing to the film as well as spoofing Lord of the Rings and other films for no reason other than to show characters is just plain lazy film-making. Despite the film's gross-out and stupid humour there are a small amount of bright sparks. The actor playing Jack Swallows plays the spoof so well however he is given no real significant involvement and features on screen for no more than 5 minutes.",

The jokes were not extremely original, but the whole theater was laughing and it was fun. Every movie does not need to be original. That being said, I have seen better movies, including the pinnacle of this series, Scray Movie 3. It was on about the same level as Scray Movie 4. One thing I loved about this movie is that I had seen many of the movies that they spoofed, which always makes it more fun.My other main complaint is that it ended rather quickly, at not even an hour and a half.",

In my opinion 'Epic movie' isn't funny at all, it's very mildly entertaining, which is a generous statement. The film has no good qualities at all, badly written, stupid plot; no offence to the actors, but the acting was terrible, in their defence this is most likely how the film makers intended them to act, which clearly is an even bigger insult to the film. After I had seen the film I honestly thought 'what a waste of a couple of hours!' For a person who is passionate about films it made me angry, that this film was put on television. Or even that it was made in the first place. Why did they spend so much money on all the costumes, when they didn't bother to put the effort into the script? The film is entirely pointless and annoying. Overall I thought the film was pathetic and unoriginal.",

Epic Movie is about as funny, as shoving your head into a dustbin and vomiting or just watching the Irate Gamer. Epic Movie constantly just recreates scenes from other movies with things that ruin any magic the old scenes have, and just end up being an insult to both the film and the audience's intelligence.

This movie is cancer to the movie industry and cancer to its genre, its getting harder and harder for me to see a future where this kind of movie is beloved again.

The acting is horrible, no real chemistry, no effort put into line delivery just over the top delivery with stupid dialogue. The cinematography is bad with shots being centered on the actor and nothing going on around them, and everything else being out of frame and cheaply designed sets and costumes. It looks Bad to begin with despite the tons of different exotic locations. The editing is bad also with every new location feeling like there is no flow or consistency to them outside of terrible jokes. The pacing in this awful also because  there really isn't a consistent plot throughout this. Rather things just happen until we get to the second half when it becomes a Nardia parody. The jokes are incredibly bad full of pop culture reference humor popular in the mid 2000's, cheap over the top slapstick, gross out humor, and offensive shock humor at times that feels more offensive than funny. The Plot also is worth mentioning again is nonexistent until like the second half but you could take the first half out of this movie and nothing would be lost. One of the worst comedies ever made easily. Stay Far Away.",

None of the jokes work, the movies that are being spoofed aren't even actual epic films and it doesn't have any plot. While the Scary Movie...movies had parody stories, they still benefited from its charming cast and still had a tinge of originality to them. In Epic Movie, however, the infamous Friedberg-Seltzer duo I've been hearing so much about seem less interested in making a consistent movie and instead inserting as many pop culture references as possible. The editing is terrible with characters that come out of nowhere and various nonsensical things, an obvious stunt double in one scene and cliched and predictable jokes (example: NACHOOOOOOOO...cheese-flavoured Doritos are delicious. Hardy-har, how much did they pay the Jack Black lookalike for that product placement?). The actors are incredibly cringy especially Jayma Mays as the stupid one out of the four. In fact, I think Friedberg and Seltzer just cast Kal Penn and Jennifer Coolidge for a White Castle joke and a reference to American Pie. If you saw X-Men and Click, you'd know that two \"jokes\" involving these movies, were already done in the actual movies. And, it gets worse, even when the credits start rolling, they keep you trapped with a mid-credits scene that has V from V for Vendetta for some reason, then there's a parody of the Willy Wonka song from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, then there's a joke involving Mel Gibson in prison. Epic Movie is an epic fail and I strongly advise you stay away from it at all costs. Even Dumb and Dumberer had better jokes than this pile of crap. Didn't get a single laugh out of me.",

Right when the opening sequence for this film was over I absolutely knew what this was going to be: A uncomfortable experience filled with awkward long lasting sequences ruined by completely unfunny pop culture references. And that's really what this entire film was. They went really far with the pop culture references this time and I mean almost every miniute a unfunny pop culture reference was just thrown out to take up running time. Slightly better than \"Date Movie\", this film was dissapointing because it could have been really smart and well made, but it turned out to be a horrible experience, especially since some well respected actors were in this film and these people have shown before that they can be funny and talented.

Seltzer and Friedberg are really bad about latching onto premises that have promise, and then picking the most one-dimensional, unfunny cast possible. This breed of satire isn't funny anymore, because we've seen it a million times before. Look at movies like \"Kingsman\" or \"Cabin In The Woods\" or \"You're Next,\" for instance.

Out of the sheer power of the human instinct of survival you'll make it out alive, but afterwards you'll feel dirty, disgusting, smoldering and partially wishing you had simply dropped dead instead. Here is the closest this movie comes to a plot: Lucy (Jayma Mays) finds her adopted father semi-naked on the floor in a way similar to \"The Da Vinci Code\". He is dying after being attacked by Silas (Kevin Hart) an albino white man that whips himself. After doing a break dance in which he spells out a clue for her, she finds a Golden Ticket (similar to the one from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"). The movie switches to Edward (Kal Penn) an orphan living in a Mexican monastery. A parody of \"Nacho Libre\" gets upset when he doesn't appreciate the food and throws his out of a window. On his way out, he finds a Golden Ticket (but not before Nacho shows off some tasty Doritos, available now at the concession stand!) Next we have Susan (Faune Chambers) who is on a plane when all of a sudden snakes pop out! Cue the Samuel L. Jackson impersonator. Susan is thrown out of the plane, lands on Paris Hilton and finds a Golden Ticket inside the dead celebrity's purse. Finally we have Peter. He's a highschooler and a mutant who is bullied because his mutant power sucks (as the movie spells it out for its audience, he has chicken wings instead of angel wings). He finds a Golden Ticket too and joins the other orphans at Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Willy (Crispin Glover) reveals to them that the special ingredients in the chocolate are human body parts. Cue the nut jokes. The children run away inside a magical wardrobe, which brings them to Gnarnia in a spoof of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Lucy befriends Mr. Tumnus (Hector Jimenez) while Edward is seduced by the White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge). The children discover that they are actually all brothers and sisters (whatever) and ally themselves against the White Bitch. Edward is captured while the rest of the group enter a training montage at Hogwarts. Peter, Lucy and Susan meet a parody of Aslan named Aslo (played by Fred Willard) in the hopes that together they can formulate a plan to save their brother, and the kingdom of Gnarnia.\n\nThere's no reason for anyone, ever to watch this colossal piece of crap. For my own personal reasons I had to, just so I could vow never to watch it again and to write this review but really, why would you even be tempted by this? I watched the unrated version, which at least had the \"Snakes on a Plane\" spoof done correctly, with the actual wording accurate but how bad does it show that in the theatrical version of the movie, Samuel L. Jackson says \"goddamn\" instead of \"motherfucking\"? I counted 9 testicles jokes, 5 piss jokes and 9 other jokes that related to body hair, farts, poop or similar material. When it comes to the spoof segment of the film, several of the jokes don't even make any sense. There's an extended joke where the film makes fun of the actors in the Harry Potter franchise. The joke is that in this film's version of Hogwarts the actors are much older than they should be. Maybe the directors didn't realize that not only are the actors playing Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edward adults themselves (So way off the characters they are spoofing) but the actors in the Harry Potter films were always the same age as their characters (plus maybe a year or two?) so it's just an excuse to have a bunch of ugly people dress up in funny costumes. To the film's credit, that could have actually been a joke. Sometimes it misfires so bad that some of the \"funny\" moments aren't even jokes or references. When you insert a character named Borat into your movie, you make him look like Sasha Baron Cohen and you give him lines like \"This is my sister, she is number one prostitute in Gnargnia\" that isn't a reference, that's just plagiarism. While we're at it, how do you make fun of a movie like \"Snakes on a Plane\" which not only ran its own joke into the ground before the movie was released in theatres but was a parody in itself? I get a head ache just reading my notes about the movie.\n\nEverything could be forgiven if this film was actually humorous but it isn't. There are two jokes in the whole hour and thirty-two minute running time that might actually make you smile. One is a reference to White Castle. Kal Penn was in \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\", so that's an actual joke. I didn't laugh, but I recognize the effort. They later run that one into the ground, but I'll give them that. The other running joke, which is the poor production and special effects, does work. They make absolutely no attempt to make the stunt doubles look like the actual actors, the special effects are terrible and even the sets look cheap. It's probably a way to mask the fact that making an actual spoof of an epic would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but I did laugh at the cheap, fake-looking dead cat and the obvious beaver puppet. Were my standards just falling so low that out of desperation my mind latched onto these moments? Who knows.\n\nThe movie was pretty much doomed from the start because the two directors/writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are two mentally deranged idiots that can't make a good comedy to save their own lives. The blame does not rest solely on their shoulders though. Who green-lit a project named \"Epic Movie\" that contains spoofs of Shrek, Mel Gibson, Ghost Busters, Click, Tivo, Bobby Beats Whitey, Punk'd, Brittney Spears, Star Wars, 50 Cent, \"Get Crunk\", Rick James, Rocky, Batman, MTV Cribs, Laguna Beach, Dr. Phil, Casino Royale, Talladega Nights, Brad & Angelina, Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Siegfried & Roy and insurance commercials? There's maybe one or two of those that could be considered grand, action packed films that could be considered epic in the sense that they blow you away and have to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated but for the most part, what do any of those have to do with Epic Movies? While we're at it, who actually remembers half of those references now that it's been 6 years since the movie has been released?\n\nYou've heard enough. Just from the Dvd cover or any trailer you can tell this limp comedy is about as unfunny as finding your pet stuffed inside a blender. Even the ending of the film is incredibly lazily put together thanks a Deus ex Machina that's allows our \"heroes\" to win. As far as I'm concerned, if you like this or even think it \"isn't that bad\", if you complain that I \"spoiled too much\" or you are willing to give this movie a chance despite all of the negative press it's been given you need to really re-evaluate your taste in everything and I really hope you grow out of it because otherwise we can't be friends anymore. Any movie that references \"Scar Face\" by playing \"Say Hello to my Little Friend\" over and over almost automatically gets the lowest score imaginable and boy, this one deserves every insult it's got coming.
