I don't know how he plays several characters so well it's impressive! Great how much story driven Norbit is that's important sometimes especially to some people.

It doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's a film aimed for laughs and it does exactly what it delivers.To fully appreciate and understand this film you need an enlightened and intelligent sense of humour to comprehend the genius film that is Norbit.

My local newspaper gave this movie an F. Right next to it, an article.....well Norbt destroy Murphy's Oscar chances. What a freakin joke! Did you guys enjoy Coming to America? Look if you liked the Nutty Professor movies this movie was A LOT BETTER.I am so upset with movie critics. Seriously have you ever seen a movie get that bad????? Epic Movie did not even get a rating that low.We live in a PC society. Good forbid we have a movie with a Fat Black chick in it. Good forbid we make a fat black chick look bad. Funny how in the Nutty Professor it was OK to make a movie about a Fat Black Guy. No buddy really screamed when Mike Myers was Fat Bastard in the Austin Powers movies........and believe me the depiction of Fat Bastard was a lot worse than Rasputa was in this movie.This movie was flat out hilarious. And it was a very cute and touching movie too. I can tell you what is getting these negative reviews. Eddie Murphy plays a Dark Fat Black women. Eddie Murphy plays a nerdy sympathetic black guy....Norbit. Norbit prefers the Skinny Light Black women. That is it....that is why this movie is getting scorned.If you can get past that and say I can live with that.....then go see the movie. Honestly it is the funniest movie I have seen a LONG LONG TIME!",

Nowadays, it's not acceptable to make fun of unattractive, overweight women, but back in 2007 it was still alright to make ugly, fat jokes. And it was still alright for Eddie Murphy to dress up as a woman and make the audience laugh. I thought this movie was hilarious, but I'm including a little disclaimer for the modern feminists out there.Those of you who still like to laugh at politically incorrect jokes will want to rent Norbit after a hard week at work. It's very silly and pure escapism. Eddie Murphy plays three parts: the nerdy, meek title character, his adoptive Chinese father, and his overweight, overbearing wife. The entire movie of just the unhappily married couple would have been funny enough, but adding in a love triangle amps up the motivation of Norbit's wife to get even more aggressive - which in turn, becomes even funnier! Thandiwe Newton plays Norbit's childhood sweetheart, but good luck getting a divorce! Can two sweet souls find happiness, or is there bound to be a large, obnoxious, hilarious fly in the ointment? Rent Norbit for a very silly and fun evening.",

This is not meant to make one think, it exists because it must have been entertaining to make and it is funny. This is no Little Miss Sunshine, and it serves its purpose, I spent one hour and forty-two minutes without a decent thought in my head.

This is an Eddie Murphy movie in which he portrays three characters-each one with their own characterizations and attitudes. It is a cartoonish depiction of the world of the nerdy lead character and shouldn't be mistaken for any kind of reality. It's only purpose is to make audiences laugh and to me it has very much succeeded. Now while there are some unbelievable slapstick moments that can make you say \"oh, brother\", I was willing to buy the romance between Norbit and his orphanage girlfriend Kate. One of the sweetest and funniest scenes was when Kate taught Norbit to ride a bike for the first time and subsequent improvements. Also loved many of the scenes with Mr. Wong. And, yes, Rasputia can be very much over-the-top with her fatness but while we are laughing at her character, we are also marveling at how strong willed she can be. So, in summation, to anyone who loves Eddie Murphy in almost everything he does, you have nothing to be ashamed of here. And to everyone else-please, lighten up!",

I gave it a high rating in comparison to other Murphy films he has done recently (excluding Dream girls of-course). It has been a while since I last saw Murphy up to his usual antics and I don't much appreciate the fact many are willing to watch offensive black comedy shows such as the Chappelle show (you cannot seriously tell me that show is devoid of any racial/ offensive humor, not with a straight face at lest) but are ready to drop a movie that incorporates the same style (it had most of the familiar cast from Chappelle show too). As i stands this was one of the most genuinely funny movie and just because a film cracks fat jokes and mild racial remarks (which is a base trademark of black humor). I mean we are ready to watch toilet crap such as Mr. Deeds and other overly childish and brain dead level of Adam Sandler movies (Mr. Deeds, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo to name a few). This movie is certainly not an excellent movie but in terms of Eddie Murphy's current stream of movies this is a much welcomed addition. It reminded me of Bowfinger mixed with Nutty Professor which was pretty humorous. It is stupid yes I will grant it that but its lot more watchable than the toilet flushed material we seem to be watching everyday of our lives like Adam Sandlers antics (Bill Madison ugh...) that is even lesser challenging to a mentally handicapped person. People need to lighten up about looks appearances as well. I am definitely on the heavy side and I find the movie mildly entertaining. If you really want to make issue about racism to its extreme how about using something like Borat.",

This movie is pretty much exactly what you're expecting (\"what were you expecting?\" was my original heading) but it pulls no punches and tries to placate no-one. If, like me, you have a fetishist obsession with the crude and offensive, so long as it's done in a creative way, this holds the attention though you might want to watch it in two sittings.You know, I just watched that Tyler Perry character for the first time, Media. I mean....golly...aren't they kind of racist stereotypes? Because I don't know!This is sort of like a parody of that though it doesn't have far to go... a kaleidoscope of black stereotypes both positive and negative can be kind of overwhelming...but I cannot not be kind of fascinated both by this funhouse mirror vision of blackness and the lowest bar of humanity.Of course there are some good black people in our main two characters and admirably the ex-pimps have a sympathetic portrayal though I still have mixed feelings and pimps but really just because they are employers...The make up and multi-acting on Murphy's part deserves a good bit of praise. Sometimes he flips from Norbit to his usually voice but it's cool.Acknowledging any issues with the story would be superfluous because no one expects this to be smartly written. It did irk me that young Rasputia wasn't half bad as she stuck up for Norbit with no apparent secret agenda.The plot is simple and familiar but I liked rooting for this little guy, adrift in a world where people hate orphans so much they would rather they were raised by this balenocidal madman than liberalize adoption laws. The conflict as Norbit learns to stand up for himself and some other various twists and turns leave the jokes as the only really dumb things in the movie (and even they are sort of supposed to be dumb).",

Its also hopelessly funny.NORBIT is a relatively unintelligent film that does not even try to say anything special or unique or even logical. The saving grace of the mess is Eddie Murphy (suprise!) playing the role of Norbit, Rasputia and Mr. Wong (in a very problematic but ethically confusing role: a Chinese man with a Japanese accent). To say the man is a jack of all trades would be an understatement, Rasputia is so over the top and outrageous on wonders whether he was trying to outdo the entire cast of The Nutty Professor with this hilarious performance. The character steals every scene she's in and is certainly responsible for most of the laughs. The rest come from her three muscle head brothers led by Terry Crews. The cast is rounded out by Cuba Gooding Jr in a hilariously understated performance and Thandie Newton as the love interest. Side bar: Thandie Newton is ridiculously skinny in this film, even the characters point this out, whether this is intentional to contract her with Rasputia (Lord knows why it would be necessary) is unknown however its really distracting. Eddie's performance as Norbit is a bit less entertaining, more cringey. The entire character is one big joke with Eddie Murphy snarling throughout the entire performance like someone farted in his face. That his scenes are unpleasant/unfunny would be an understatement but its a comedy so some jokes won't land even if the joke is an entire character. The plot doesn't really matter ultimately, Rasputia and her brothers are up to no good and Norbit has to save the day (or clean up his messes depending on how you choose to look at it).The film offers you exactly what it shows you in its trailers and posters, Eddie Murphy impersonating an obnoxious big fat black woman while playing a number of other characters, its aggressively gross and doesn't care. This film obviously hasn't aged well by today's woke standards and if you go into it expecting safe humour then you are watching the wrong film. This is mid-2000 comedy at its worst. The only thing missing here is a joke about transgender people and it would be banned from Netflix. Dumb, hilarious and knows what it is. A great watch 8/10.",

Still, most of the responsibility belongs with me.Misinformed by the promising cast of \"Norbit\" - Eddie Murphy, Thandie Newton, Clifton Powell, Cuba Gooding Jr. - a whole bunch of talented folk. My fault: not connecting the title with those horrid advertising snippets where an 800-pound female Murphy squashes a sort of male Murphy like a bug, with an unbelievably stereotyped bucktooth \"Chinese\" Murphy doing unspeakable things.Honestly, I did not make the connection, and perhaps if I did, I might have thought those preview shots don't tell the whole story. Well, in fact, Murphy-squashing-Murphy is not the worse thing in \"Norbit,\" although it's repeated many times.The worse thing in \"Norbit\" is the whole of it: a nonstop, unrelieved, offensive, unfunny gross-out of unprecedented juvenile vulgarity. Think of Stephen Chow at his recent worst, multiplied by several degrees of all-around indignities.Take it from an incorrigible movie fan who enjoyed half (the first half, specifically) of \"Ishtar\" (supposedly the \"worst movie ever\") and, more recently, found the cinematography of several otherwise terminally vapid movies \"interesting\" - there is nothing worthwhile in \"Norbit\" whatsoever, not even watching the beautiful Newton behaving like a fig here.Brian Robbins, a TV producer in real life, is maligned here as the director, Jay Scherick and David Ronn (co-writers of the Martin Lawrence-botched \"National Security\") came up with a story of gore, body-function accidents, relentless pummeling of men, women and children of all races, although with more venom and contempt for blacks and Asians than the few token whites suffer.What is the plot, beyond skinny Murphy being married to, and squashed by, elephantine Murphy? I don't want to spoil it, but basically that's what the story is.\"Norbit\" sets a new standard for the worst Hollywood can conceivably produce.",

            "content": "How many motion pictures can one see where Oscar nominee (and odds-on favorite) Eddie Murpy gets to make love to himself? Well, in another example of the former SNL star's propensity to play multiple roles (see \"Coming To America\"), here comes the Columbia release of \"Norbit,\" in which not only does Murphy bend the gender; he snaps it in half.Okay, I didn't go into the theater expecting Shakespeare, so one cannot judge the newest Eddie Murphy film (co-written by him and his bro, Charlie - of the \"Dave Chappelle Show\" - and directed by Brian Robbins - \"The Perfect Score,\" \"The Shaggy Dog\") by those standards.In fact, the only thing I can judge a movie like this by is whether or not it made me laugh. If I laugh enough, a comedy has done its job. There's nothing really deep or psychological about it.In this case, \"Norbit,\" the story of a skinny, sad-sack loser (Murphy) who loses his true love at the age of seven and is \"captured\" by a fat, foul-mouthed, spoiled girl monster, Rasputia (Murphy, in a dual role performance not seen since \"The Patty Duke Show\"), made me giggle enough to give this film a thumbs up.Not an enthusiastic one, of course, since there's is a lot of misogyny going on, and the message one could get is that fat, unattractive people are evil; while thin, good-looking people are the only ones who deserve love and happiness ...For example, his object of desire is Kate (Thandie Newton, coming off dramatic turns in \"Crash\" and \"Pursuit of Happiness\"), who is extremely fair of face, but has a body like a Death Camp survivor.I can forgive those obvious flaws, however, because I did laugh; not so much at Norbit (he was so spineless and goofy, I found it difficult to feet sorry for him after a while, plus his accent reminded me of Damen Wayans as the \"Handy Man\" character in \"In Living Color\"), or Rasputia (yeah, she was fat and all, but there was an unnecessary evil attached to her character - she beats her husband, she tries to run over a dog and throws an old lady through a window).She is also depicted eating a lot of food, you see because she's fat and it's funny to see a fat person eat a lot of food. Right? Most of he amusement came from the supporting characters, mainly Murphy's Mr. Wong (who, along with his old Jewish guy in \"America\" proves he does a pretty good crusty white guy); Pope Sweet Jesus (Eddie Griffin, so bad in the \"Deuce Bigalow\" films, but hilarious here as a low rent pimp and rib shack owner) and his companion, Lord Have Mercy (Kat Taylor - \"Epic Movie\" - who looks like a cross between Prince and Snoop Dog); and Buster (Marlon Wayans), the bi-sexual local hip-hop Afro-funk dance instructor.Simple plot has Norbit being trapped in a loveless (and painful) marriage because he's afraid to say no to her and her three psychotic gangster brothers (Terry Crews, Clifton Powell and Lester Speight). When his childhood sweetheart, Kate, returns with her boyfriend (Oscar winner Cuba Godding, Jr.) with plans to buy an orphanage, Norbit schemes to spend time with her.Later, he is played for a foil and the orphanage is in danger of being turned into a strip club. Of course, complications arise and things turn ugly. Will it all work out? How many romantic comedies have you seen in your life?Still, on the Laugh-Meter, you have to give this one its props. Funniest scenes include Norbit's profanity-ridden puppet show; Pope and Lord's interruption of the wedding and the water park sequence.Nowhere near a perfect film, but enough yucks in its one hour, 45-miunte running time to temporarily take one's mind off Iraq, global warming, high energy costs, the freezing Midwest, terrorism, the Chicago Bears, the presidential primaries, the bird flu, etc., etc., etc.",

            "content": "First of all, I must say that after seeing a lot of bad movies this past year starring traditionally top grossing comedians (Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler), I thought Eddie Murphy would follow the same route here. However, there were some parts of this movie that I laughed out loud to, and the comic tone was kept the same all throughout the movie. In other words, the movie didn't suddenly switch from very funny to very sad, like other movies did (i.e. Click, which was the most disappointing movie I have EVER seen).Probably the best thing about this movie was Eddie Murphy playing multiple characters. Just like in \"Coming To America\" and both \"Nutty Professor\" movies, Murphy proves himself to be the black Peter Sellers with a great make-up team. I'm willing to bet that next year, just like with the first Nutty Professor movie, this movie will receive an Oscar nomination for best make-up.With that said, the biggest problem I had with this movie was the character of Rasputia. Rasputia is obviously a cartoonish figure who literally embodies all seven deadly sins, and she's a character you're supposed to hate. She's mean to Norbit, lazy, selfish, and demeaning. But as I was watching this movie, I thought to myself, \"Is this movie making you hate Rasputia because she's mean, or because she's fat?\" Or, is this movie saying that all fat people are generally mean? If the movie doesn't come out and say it, the movie certainly implies the idea. As I was watching it, Rasputia certainly reminded of one of the Klumps from the Nutty Professor movies, and, around the time both Nutty Professor movies came out, there were Fat Acceptance groups coming out and saying those movies were offensive; that they stereotyped fat people. However, to the Nutty Professor's credit, Sherman Klump was portrayed as very smart, lovable, and redeemable character, as opposed to his alter ego Buddy Love. If these Fat Acceptance Societies wish to file a complaint about negative stereotypes, this is the movie to complain about.Fat people in movies has been a controversial subject for years, especially during the 1990's and this decade. There was the case of Ursula the Sea Witch from \"The Little Mermaid\". However, to Disney's credit, Ursula remains Disney's only overweight villain. There's also the case of other actors dawning fat suits, such as Julia Roberts (in \"America's Sweethearts\"), Martin Short (in TV's \"Primetime Glick\", and \"Jiminy Glick In La La Wood\"), and Gwenneth Paltrow (in \"Shallow Hal\"). But despite the controversy surrounding these actors' roles, their fat suit-wearing roles weren't intended to upset anyone or negatively stereotype a group of people.In conclusion, my advice would be to take the character of Rasputia with a grain of salt. The movie itself is very funny, but the character of Rasputia can be (and probably is) very offensive to a large group of people. I think the movie would have been just as funny, perhaps even funnier, if Rasputia didn't happen to be fat. I could be wrong, though.",

When I saw the rating on IMDb, I thought maybe there was a chance people just took the movie too seriously, I wanted to check it out for myself. I don't mind fat jokes here and there, I liked the movie Shallow Hal, I also used to be heavy and lost all the weight, so I know what it's like to feel isolated in a society that praises thin people. But I never took it personally, I make fat jokes still for fun. But Norbit took it not only to a very racist level, but to a level where it makes it look like big people are hideous and mean monsters and that it's alright to ridicule them. The funny thing is, I wasn't intending on taking this movie seriously, until I saw it and did not laugh once.Norbit is a little whiny guy who has been pushed around his whole life. He was raised in an orphanage by Asian parents, when he is getting bullied one day, a plump black girl saves his butt, and offers to be his girlfriend, well, she kinda forces him to be. She takes him into her family where the men are a bit violent and have taken over the town. Norbit gets married to Rebestia, the little black girl that saved him, and they have a miserable life together. But he sees an old friend who is an attractive thin woman, and she wants to buy the orphanage and have Norbit help her with it, but it's hard when his obnoxious overweight wife won't let him.I don't know if Eddie read this script and actually thought it was funny, because it went onto a \"Steve Urkel\" level where Rebestia wasn't so funny as just more obnoxious. To be honest, none of the characters were funny or sympathetic at all. This was a very sad movie and should have never been made, I don't know what these actors were thinking, but this was not a funny comedy. Stay away from it, this is the point where Eddie Murphy is just loosing it in his career.1/10",

So it was a no brainer that I decided to spend 5 bucks to check out Eddie Murphy's latest. Eddie plays three characters, Rasputia, Norbit and Mr. Wong. All great characters in their own right. You got the gigantic, attitude-ridden Rasputia, the black Woody Allen type Norbit and the racist Mr. Wong, who probably had the funniest lines in the movie. The movie was damn fun, it was unfortunately a little too long at 102 mins, but it moved at a pretty fast clip. It plays like any other Eddie Murphy comedy where he's putting on tons of make-up, jokes non-stop, and sentimental moments towards the finale. It's what you come to expect from Eddie, and if you're not setting standards too high you'll have a good time. The supporting cast is also pretty good, with T-Money from Battledome (one of my all-time favorite shows), who you'd most likely recognize as the father from \"Everybody Hates Chris\" or the big muscley dude from \"White Chicks\". And once again, he steals every scene he's in. You also have Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a pretty comical part as Norbit's love interests' fianc\u00e9e. Like I said before, the movie plays like any typical Eddie Murphy movie, so if you like his sense of humor, there's no real reason to dislike this one. It's a fun time....but not as fun as The Nutty Professor. One other thing that disappointed me was the outtakes, usually he has them during the credits....nope.

He gets married to a rude, chubby lady named Rasputia, who has 3 older brothers. Before Norbit gets married to Rasputia or even married her in the first place, he becomes friend with a nicer girl named Kate. Throughout the movie, we see Rasputia cheat on and pick on Norbit. She cheats on Nor it by having s*x with her dancing instructor in her dance class. Rasputia sometimes yells at Norbit and sometimes hits him. Towards the end of the movie, we realize that Kate's fianc\u00e9 only wants to marry her for her money and that Rasputia's brothers wanted the money also. Also, Norbit and Kate get married and Rasputia and her brothers run off to Mexico. The End! Sure, the characters sound like a**holes, but their still funny.8/10",

You might have noticed that mobs of zealous leftists have hurled more hatred at this movie than Elmer Fudd slung towards Bugs Bunny. And their characterizations are just as clown-like, fit for Looney Tunes. They decry Eddie Murphy's \"racism, misogyny, fat shaming\" and fascism. I kid you not. Their most amusing item of derangement is accusing him of a \"paycheck grab.\" If it's such a platitudinous grab for cash, why did he make these mobs of programmed democrat drones so unhinged? Sell-out comedy is what they stuff into their eyes 24/7 on network comedy shows like Bob's Burgers, Modern Family, or John Oliver. They get their visions, values, and stereotypes reinforced, and their sell-out celebrities get their mansions. Their shows have positive reactions. Norbit gets a medieval witch-hunt reaction by the urban throngs.On the contrary, this movie is a spectacular work of comedy, and courageous at that. I'm not aware of any other work that had the bravery to take on the nasty obese black woman. Eddie Murphy wrote and performed the role so well that it feels like he took it straight from his encounters in life. It's got excellent stereotype humor, slapstick, irony, one-liners, shock/disgust jests, satire, and blaxsploitation. The haters are perfectly fine with all of their comedy that mocks old white men, rural white people, Germans, Italians, British, French, Russian, skinny people, intelligent people i.e. \"nerds,\" traditional people, traditional Christians, Catholics, conservatives, and a dozen other identities. But the minute a genius like Eddie Murphy captures gut-busting stereotypes of angry fat women, black women, or Asians, the \"progressive\" hypocrites writhe in their seats like medieval witch hunters in the presence of blasphemy.My mother was unhappily overweight. But she died laughing at the fat jokes in this movie, because unlike these miserable democrat hypocrites, she wasn't incurably insecure and egotistical. Being fat is not an ok thing. It causes a lot of pain, diseases, suffering, and expenses for everyone involved. Laughing about it in satire is both helpful to remind us that it's not ok, and that for those who struggle with it, it's ok to laugh about it as they try their best to fix their weight problems. A normal person sees the stereotype and says, \"yeah I've seen that white/Italian/German guy, and I don't aim to be like him.\" Amazing that these mobs of mindless democrat drones have such glaring double standards about particular identities. In reality, anyone who hasn't come across Rasputia types in their city has been hiding under a rock. Thanks to Eddie Murphy for having the courage to speak truth through comedy punch lines, even though this movie earned his permanent ostracism from the unintelligent, hypocritical Hollywood purveyors of \"progressive\" orthodoxy.Here's to a day when comedy can be so honest and liberated again. If we don't let them bury Mel Brooks, Eddie Murphy, Larry David, Bill Murray, Steve Carell, and the rest of the greats, we might see that day again some time soon.",

His caricatures are great as Norbit, his adopted father and of course as his \"little\" woman Rasputious. She may be his most in your face and loathsome character to date. She has absolutely no redeeming factors and that makes her that much more fun to root against. Terry Crews once again lends his talents to the \"heavy\" character that he has come known for. Thandie Newton is convincing as Kate. The real star is Murphy in all his finest, deftly moving from humble Norbit to outlandish Rasputious. Does this stack up against say Nutty Professor? No, it doesn't. But it is as much fun, though maybe not as profound. The film is mean in spirit, but that is the intent here. It isn't meant to make a statement.

The stereotypes are so blatant and obvious that they are funny. When Mr. Wong (Murphy) said, \"Of course I am racist!\" he had a point. In a way, we are all prejudiced; we just don't want to admit to it.Judging from the reaction of a packed theater on a Sunday night (blacks, whites, Asians, men, women, thin people, overweight people), I think people can have a good time with this one if they put aside their political correctness.

            "content": "First let me say ... I am an Eddie Murphy fan. I think he's a comic genius. And that's why I was so surprised to see him star in and even write such a low level and offensive comedy.The first few minutes of the film started out with a little promise, but it didn't take long for the film to fall to such a low level that I cringed from early in until the movie was over. And even though I watched to nearly the end, I demanded my money back. It's only the second time I've ever done that, and I'm an avid film goer.What was so offensive? I don't know where to begin. Most obviously, every \"fat\" gag in the book was used. Eddie Murphy plays an overweight woman who is ugly and evil, and every nasty thing you can think to say about her is said. To make it worse, the leading lady is Thandie Newton who is extremely thin, which only goes to further emphasize the other extreme.Maybe Eddie Murphy thought he could get away with this because he shows, in The Nutty Professor, how an overweight man can \"get the girl\". But, really, that just shows the extreme double standard that remains when it comes to overweight men versus women.Now, I'm a realist, and I know that the double standard is not Eddie Murphy's fault. Still, he plays on it here in such a nasty way that it offended me, an open minded, in-shape male. And for those who argue that it's the character's attitude and not her weight that made her \"the bad guy\", then why make her fat in the first place. And why have so many nasty fat jokes.The movie was offensive on other levels too. The racial humor wasn't funny. There are some lines with attempts at humor that really go too far. Many of you who have seen it will understand what I mean. And those who haven't, I hope you don't support this film out of curiosity. Please, wait for cable. There is nothing in this that you can't wait to see.I heard that it was Eddie Murphy's brother who came up with this idea. If EM did this as a favor to his brother, he could have done his brother, and himself a bigger favor by bringing Charlie in on a better project and tossing this script.On the one positive note: Eddie Murphy does put his all into these characters as always. His job as Norbit gets lost in the low class, low level \"comedy\". Even though I just saw the film, I had to really remember that his performance as Norbit was decent. All I can think about is how offended I was, and how thoroughly depressed an overweight woman sitting at the end of my row looked throughout most of the film (she left before I did).",

Norbit has it all: loads of fat jokes, gross-out gags, and it's drop-dead funny to boot. In fact, I've never laughed so hard in one movie in my entire life. The only other flick that comes close is the amazing Borat, but that's another subject altogether.The film tells the touching story of Norbit (Murphy), abandoned as a child and left with the racist Asian Mr. Wong (Murphy), who raises Norbit in an orphanage where he falls for Kate (Thandie Newton). Kate gets adopted and all of the kids pick on Norbit until Rasputia (Murphy) comes along. The huge woman gives Norbit a family, and when they get older, the two marry. Rasputia is a horrible, vile woman and her three brothers are not much better. Kate comes back in town one day and Norbit finds himself drawn toward her. Kate, however, already has a feeble-minded fianc\u00e9, Deion (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is plotting with Rasputia's brothers to turn the orphanage into a strip joint. Eddie Murphy is at the top of his game here playing three diverse and different characters. He brings a monster to the screen with Rasputia, one sight gag after another. The huge woman will make you laugh despite yourself. The funniest parts come from Rasputia, whether it be at a fair, a water park, a wedding, or in a car. She is certainly a new classic character in the vein of Murphy's Nutty Professor. Mr. Wong is damn funny as well, but he doesn't appear as much as he should have. Some of the films' funniest lines come from him. Norbit is goofy in every sense of the word, and his voice is hilarious. Kate is pretty good as the romantic lead, but her sometimes squeaky voice often draws away from the character. Deion is so-so; he isn't much other than a vile fianc\u00e9. Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams are perfectly cast as two pimps, and they deliver some of the funniest lines. Rasputia's brothers are pretty funny as well. Marlon Wayans has a funny appearance, but his character doesn't do much.While the plot of Norbit is nothing we haven't seen before, Rasputia makes things very interesting. The result is one strange romance triangle between Kate, Norbit, and Rasputia that has hilarious results. Murphy is back doing what he does best\u0097making a hysterically funny movie that is a new Murphy classic, right up there next to The Nutty Professor. Overall, Norbit was hysterically funny and filled to the brim with a diverse array of characters and actors. It accomplished exactly what I was expecting and loads more. If you have the chance, don't miss out on Norbit\u0097you won't be disappointed.",

Eddie Murphy does a great job with his three big roles in the movie and the majority of the film kept a smile on my face.

            "content": "It's too bad that the daggers have come flying against Eddie Murphy for this 2007 farce because he is masterfully funny in no less than three roles here. Resuscitating an even dimmer variation of the good-natured goofus he played in 1999's clever \"Bowfinger\", Murphy plays the title character, a compliant loser left as a baby on the doorstep of a roadside Chinese restaurant owned by a curmudgeon named Mr. Chow, also played by Murphy with more of a pan-Asian accent under a convincing veneer of latex.As a child, he falls in love with fellow orphan Kate, but she gets adopted and moves away. That's when Rasputia enters the picture. A mean-spirited overweight girl, she bullies Norbit to go steady with her, and he ends up miserably marrying her when they both grow up. And if you don't know already, Murphy, under a humungous fat latex suit, also plays Rasputia. Kate comes back to town as a comely woman with the idea of buying Mr. Chow's restaurant and turning it into an orphanage. The inevitable romantic complications occur, as well as a silly, threadbare plot involving Rasputia's brothers, Kate's smooth-talking fianc\u00e9 Deion and turning Mr.Chow's place into a strip club.None of the plot contrivances really interfere with the parade of sight gags, mostly at the expense of Rasputia, whether she accuses Norbit of adjusting her car seat forward or wears a disappearing bikini at the water park. Based on a YouTube video they saw where a large woman beats down her smaller-sized husband in front of the neighbors, Murphy with his brother Charles developed a story fleshed out by comedy screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronn, and the resulting script meanders quite a bit, especially with the strip club subplot and the various ensuing love triangles. Much of it is vulgar and tasteless, but when the story focuses on Murphy's antics and one-liners, it's often hilarious and surprisingly self-aware of its own insensitivities. What's left of the plot goes into incredulous overdrive at the end, but it certainly doesn't lose its spirit.With the childhood vignettes at the beginning, I was expecting a Forrest Gump-like epic of a savant, but it quickly turns formulaic and situation-driven, which is what ultimately prevents the film from being great. Brian Robbins' direction is pedestrian at best, but his sitcom-based sensibilities seem to work within the dimensions of Murphy's broad style. A dewy-eyed Thandie Newton is engaging as Kate, but Cuba Gooding Jr. is wasted as Deion since he is developed as a mere plot device. Eddie Griffin and Kat Williams manage some funny moments as a couple of pimps-turned-rib joint owners, especially in the finale, and Marlon Wayans turns up as a flamboyant tap dance instructor manipulating Rasputia for her money. A lot of credit needs to be given to Rick Baker for his impressive make-up work on Murphy since he convincingly crosses genders and races here. But the lion's share of praise belongs to Murphy, who combines Jerry Lewis' manic comic energy with his own stand-up ribaldry. The result will likely offend non-fans.",

They were still saying \"How YOU doing??\" In the voice of Rasputia as I wrote this.A lot of the jokes are recycled as we watch Rasputia break bed after bed, whilst jumping on Norbit for sex!! We see her repeatedly fart and honk the car horn with her boobs!! All of which had the kids laughing. I have to say, watching the kids laughing, does make me warm to a movie. I will say this Thandie Newton has never looked hotter in a movie. Norbit was a hit, grossing $95 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 30th highest grossing movie of the year.

It would be honestly hard to say anything in this film is worth seeing, aside from the few momentary chuckles provided by Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams as stereotypical pimps (a consistently typecast role both have fallen into).As it can be best surmised, Eddy Murphy has inadvertently passed the torch, from his hysterically funny prime in stand up comedy (see: Eddy Murphy - RAW) and the Beverly Hills Cops franchise, to the mainstream Hollywood \"everything is predictable\" yawn-fest which is NORBIT. The script is nothing more than the recycled remains of every romantic comedy stir fried with an inexcusable amount of fat jokes and simmered over an unbelievably whipped pathetic excuse for a main character by the utterly incomprehensible name of Norbit.Simply stated, if you are over the age of 10, you will not enjoy a single second of this movie.

I'm talking running over dogs, threatening to burn Thandie newton's face off repulsive and so in the style of \"The Nutty Professor\" Eddie Murphey strikes up the band once again with his hilarious multi roles. He was also very funny as the barmy orphanage owner Mr.Wong.You know from the very start if you're going to enjoy \"Norbit\". The main character narrates whilst a car drives up a road, the sweet-natured character goes on to say how he likes to think that his parents spent lots of time trying to search for the perfect orphanage and as the car drives past one we see a baby being rolled out onto the orphanage steps. If you son't find that funny then A. Get some humour and B. Don't watch because it's only going to get worse! \"Norbit\" does actually have some intelligent moments and isn't just a fat-joke fest, although it is essentially a fat woman running into things, what is there not to like? I was howling with laughter throughout and almost cried when Rasputia makes her way down a water chute! There is a plot in \"Norbit\" although thin, and it does have brilliant characters that just set out to make you laugh.Although, not as good as \"The Nutty Professor\" it is just as funny and does exactly what it sets out to do. Make you LAUGH! So don't be frightened just go ahead and laugh, laugh and it might make you live longer.",

While seeing trailers in the theater i envisioned another meet the Klumps but Eddie solidified this movie by casting some great supporting roles, ala terry crew(longest yard, click) Cuba Gooding Jr(for once not playing a sweet and innocent character), Kat Williams, Eddie Griffen(undercover brother). Im sure I'm forgetting some but these supporting roles help solidify Norbit. Norbit not only has a good cast of black actors, but the story line is Definitely Original and funny. Norbit had me laughing so loud that i actually missed some lines in the movie. Eddie's character Mr.Wong steals the show, just wish there was a little more from Charlie Murphy. Don't know many actors that can pull off multiple characters in one movie, that is definitely Eddies talent.",

Norbit(Murphy) is adopted by Mr. Wong(Murphy) and raised at the orphanage. Rasputia is an over-sized girl who beats up the bullies after him. So, Norbit becomes her boyfriend. Fast forward 20 years and the two are now married. Rasputia has turned into a plus size mean spirited, bully of a wife. Norbit does her command and even doesn't care when he catches her cheating. Kate comes back to town to buy the orphanage. She was the girl Norbit liked as a kid. Only problem is she brings a fianc\u00e9 in tow. Norbit and Kate hang out which makes Rasputia jealous. She hunts them down and tags along in a bikini to a water park with them. I thought it was quite funny. It's up to Norbit to stop Kate's fianc\u00e9 and Rasputia's brothers from turning the orphanage into a gentleman's club.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was entertaining and funny enough.

But then he made some horrible films as well, Norbit unfortunately scraping the bottom of the barrel. While not the best and most original story, I liked the idea for Norbit. So what ruined it? Eddie Murphy is good when given good material and doing numerous roles seemed great at first, it worked in The Nutty Professor. However, the characters he plays especially Rasputia are really clich\u00e9d and stereotypical. The film looks cheap too, and the direction does nothing to showcase Murphy's talents. The worst part were the jokes, none of them were funny, in fact some of them were pretty offensive especially the ones at the expense of Rasputia's obesity, and any film involving gags about oral sex, bikini-line waxing or plans of turning the orphanage into a titty bar makes me wonder why the certificate isn't higher. Thandie Newton looks beautiful and does try, but in the end it is yet another case of wasted talent. The only redeeming quality was the make-up, that was actually quite impressive, but with such a poor film with a script and jokes as diabolical as they are and stereotypes as long as your arm that seems like faint praise. Best avoided. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I was left pondering the question why are people still making dreck like this and flogging it to the masses.All this movie does is sell the same old stereotypes in the same old package; I found some other reviews on here rather poignant when they describe the movie as misogynistic and anti-fat because the reality is it's also anti black.It's hard to tell which parts are deliberate and which aren't but is there any doubting that the least vile and offensive characters are the least \"black\" or at least what this movie tries to indicate as black. Mainly you have a light skinned Thandie Newton who's dodges all stereotypes and effectively is the films protagonist.Then you get on to the cringe worthy elements such as Rasputia who is possibly the most horrid representation of a black woman you'll ever see fat, lazy, aggressive and just plain stupid. Added to this you have horribly over used stereotypes where you almost could imagine the writers deliberating over shall we have the food theme as BBQ Ribs or fried chicken just pathetic. The conclusion at the end with the pimps (Eddie Griffin) in church is just horrendous as well. Whilst the final insult is the unveiling of Cuba Gooding Jr's character to have a string of children to different mothers.The worst thing is Eddie Murphy has made a living out of the promoting the black stereotypes obesity, promiscuity, and criminality you name it yet producers will still allow him to make this trash as the ill informed will always just see this garbage for all the wrong reasons.I am still waiting for a Black American Beauty something that is sharp, witty and mildly challenging, Eddie Murphy needs to realise that this stuff was just about acceptable 10-15 years ago, now its nothing short of banal.",

There's not much else to be said about the film.I would expect this type of buffoonery from the Wayans brothers (it was no shock that Marlon was a character in this). And Katt Williams has made his whole career as a comedian by playing on a racial stereotype and performing self hating and degrading comedy. But I figured Eddie Murphy for much more class than this.My sister has pointed out to me on a number of occasions that Eddie Murphy has a dark skin complexion complex. She has noticed his choices of leading women, and even his tendency to make darker skinned women the \"bad guy\" in his films while lighter skinned women are the desirable women of the main character's dreams. I'd argue with her, but I was never convinced of my own stance. Today I say she's right. (And I tell you, I feel terrible for that girl who played Young Rasputia.) ...I found this film to be every bit as offensive as Soul Plane, and likely more damaging. Soul Plane was nothing more than a 90 minute skit based on stereotypes. The people in that film didn't have a lot of choices as far as their film careers go, so they did that piece of crap. But Norbit is a film that is legitimized by the presence of a true star with choices. And though I found it to be very offensive as a black man, I thought that it was much more abusive to overweight people and to people who don't fit a certain ideal of beauty.The film is sickening.",

Some people have made comments that the film is distasteful, horrible and unfunny while others disagreed and have enjoyed it's comical moments and heartwarming love.Murphy plays multiple roles as done in his previous films such as Coming To America, The Nutty Professor & Bowfinger, Thandie Newton who plays his love interest displays some good acting skills and Cuba Gooding Jr. is both charming and crafty as the lying fianc\u00e9.Norbit Albert Rice, (Murphy) hasn't had what some would call it an easy life as a baby he was abandoned and raised at The Golden Wonton Restaurant & Orphanage by Mr. Wong (Murphy). As a child he had a crush on his friend Kate but when she's adopted and moves away Norbit is sad and doesn't hear from her again, as time passes by he meets Rasputia Latimore a mean spirited overweight child who forces him into a relationship. When they get married her three brothers Big Black Jack (Crews), Earl (Powell) & Blue (Rasa) threaten the groom by saying that if he hurts her they will ruin his life so he has no choice but to stay with her. Years later Norbit is still married and working for the Latimore construction company, everything begins to change for him after being reunited with Kate Thomas (Newton), his former childhood sweetheart.But there's a problem she's engaged to Deion Hughes (Gooding Jr.) a man with multiple pasts, Rasputia's brothers are trying to buy The Golden Wonton and turn it into a strip club, however Kate has plans to buy it and run the orphanage. Norbit schemes to spend time with her and soon realizes he's in love, however his blossoming feelings threaten the Latimores plans and Rasputia is filled with anger and wants him all to herself. After receiving a background check on Kate's fianc\u00e9 Norbit rushes to the church to stop the wedding and get the girl.The ending was funny because all of his friends rally to help out and get rid of the nasty Latimores once & for all then Norbit & Kate get married under the tree they pretended to wed as children.Norbit made me laugh from beginning to end and for an hour & 37 minutes it was good entertainment.",

            "content": "This is a rather uneven comedy but it definitely has its funny moments. \"How You Doin?\" was Rasputia's (Norbit's dreadful, fat, psychotic wife) signature line throughout the movie. The movie really stretched the limits of believability because there was really no reason for Norbit to marry such a grotesque bully (except the possibility that he was afraid to say no).This movie actually made me uncomfortable - even though I tried to \"lighten up\" and remember that it was just a silly comedy, I couldn't escape the fact that Eddie Murphy's character was totally abused by his wife physically, mentally and emotionally. His life was a living nightmare. I won't spoil it by telling you the outcome, but I kept thinking that by the end of the movie Norbit would have evolved into a more self-confident, and smartly dressed character. He was such a punkish victim throughout the movie that it was hard to remain sorry for him. He made you want to slap him (although he had his share of that already) and tell him to be a man and stand up for himself. It was hard to believe that a beautiful woman like Kate would be attracted to such a weak, sniveling coward no matter what he looked like - and Norbit was not attractive at all.\"Rasputia\" was like an evil comic book villain - nobody could be that vile. She never seemed like a real individual just a fusion of shallow stereotypes.Eddie Griffin is hilarious as an ex-pimp and his lines are the funniest thing about this movie.Can Terry Crews play anything other than a hulking, sadistic thug? The only time he played against type was in the movie White Girls. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was wasted in this movie as was Thandie Newton (although she hasn't shown much in the way of actual talent in any movie she's appeared. She is beautiful but that is about it). Neither part called for any particular acting or comedic ability. They were just foils for Eddie Murphy's character.Clifton Powell is becoming a stereotype too. I thought he had possibilities when he played Morris Chestnut's father in The Brothers, but his roles have gone downhill since then.This wasn't a good movie and as I stated, only had funny moments. I don't know why this movie was made because there was no real point to it - just a chance for Eddie Murphy to once again, play 2 or 3 characters.",

Even in these days, Obese women on the screen are not portrayed as beautiful and confident women who feel sexy inside and out. At least the character of Rasputia attempted to do so, and I think Murphy did a pretty good job becoming this great woman (Rasputia).

            "content": "Norbit reviewed by Sam OsbornNorbit plays the same as any other multi-role vehicle that Eddie Murphy hauls into theatres every few years. Its general mediocrity is its charm; never asking anything of us as long as we don't ask much from it. Occasionally the movie will surprise us, mounting a particularly outlandish feat of slapstick antics or maybe opening the throttle on its villain to hurl repulsive hilarity at the sad protagonist. But mostly Norbit isn't more than a happy distraction. We give Mr. Murphy ten dollars and he'll dress up in silly costumes and play silly characters for ninety minutes. It's a fine deal; one that isn't especially satisfying, but not especially offensive either. The set-up is simple enough: awkward, skinny Norbit (Eddie Murphy) loves his childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton), but is tied by the wedding band to the mountainously large revulsion-cum-wife Rasputia (also played by Murphy). The set-up, however, gets muddied by impatient screen writing, throwing in a complicated con-game to trip up the characters when it's least necessary. This involves Cuba Gooding Jr. as Kate's two-faced fianc\u00e9e and Rasputia's head-busting brothers led by Terry Crews. Simple, high-concept premises work when they're kept to their own quaint devices. Norbit doesn't need a half-baked struggle to gain ownership of an orphanage. Such contrivances are included because of the screenwriters' distrust in their principle characters. The thinking follows that if a screenwriter makes more characters and complicates the plot further than absolute necessity, the complexity will translate into quality. But they forget that beauty is often simple, and that Norbit, Kate, and Rasputia are all entertaining and dimensional enough to fill the frame themselves. But Murphy of course is there to entertain us throughout. And he certainly gives it his all. Norbit's servile goodness is awkwardly lovable, and his wife, Rasputia, succeeds in becoming the most repugnant object since vomit. And as in any comedy, extreme versions of stereotypes work best when there's a sad truth behind them. We've seen lesser versions of Norbits and Rasputias in every one of our neighborhoods. And Director Brian Robbins plays on this truthfulness by making Norbit's town a place of sunny neutrality. There's no title or season to it; just sun, green grass, the town and the suburbs. We laugh at Rasputia because it's mean to laugh at the real-life versions of her walking their dogs past our mailboxes. And when it comes to slapstick, she works like a tube of lit dynamite. When she barrels into a picnic table, it explodes into a shower of splinters. At one point she plows through the mailman. He returns several scenes later with a broken arm, a concussion and a bruised stomach. In Iraq, Rasputia would be called a weapon of mass destruction.She's a villain that's fun to hate and Thandie Newton is an easy figure to love. Norbit delights as the bumbling fulcrum that pivots the two back and forth. The film works fine this way, despite its thick contrivances, and succeeds in its own blandly outrageous decency.Sam Osborn",

Makeup was brilliant wouldn't even recognise some of the characters as Eddie. Deserves higher than a 3.7 by far, have seen much worse unfunny movies, this one had me in stitches.

            "content": "Eddie Murphy is a very talented man. Back in the 1980s, Murphy did a wonderfully funny skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" where he impersonated a white man...and infiltrated the white world. He was wonderful in such an outrageous skit and I am sure this led to his later doing some insanely good but grating characterizations in films like \"The Nutty Professor\" and \"Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps\". These films showed that Murphy could do so many wonderful impersonations...but it also showed that a little of this went a long, long way. I enjoyed this first film (despite the Klump family) but couldn't imagine watching 106 minutes of these grotesque Klumps. The public hated it...and the second film has a miserable 4.4 rating. Inexplicably, despite so many people hating these Klumps, Murphy and his brother wrote the script for \"Norbit\"...which was more of the same but much more mean spirited. Not surprisingly, it has a dreadful overall rating of 4.0....placing it on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list.\nNorbit (Murphy) is an orphan who is extremely meek and dorky. Despite her being a gross, nasty, ugly and horrid person, Rasputia (Murphy in a fat suit) has fallen for him and essentially bullies him into marrying her. Their marriage is filled with her treating him like garbage and Norbit just putting up with it. Eventually, an old childhood sweetie arrives in town and Norbit is very interested in her...but he's saddled with the violent and hellish Rasputia. And, she's planning on marrying a real jerk. The ending and how all this is settled is a complete mess...shockingly dumb and a total mess.From the moment I began watching \"Norbit\" I was filled with marvel and anger. I marveled at Murphy as he played Norbit, his SUPER-disgusting wife, Rasputia, as well as the Asian man, Mr. Wong...it takes talent to do such diverse impersonations. However, and this is important, the characters of Wong and, especially Rasputia, were just mean-spirited and cruel. Wong was nasty and mean. Rasputia was nasty, mean, disgusting and a horrible way to portray morbidly obese people. I pity anyone with such a severe weight problem...here, however, she's simply gross and awful and there are tons of fat jokes. Apparently these days it's not right to make fun of minorities....except fat people. I thought this was sad and Murphy clearly was taking the low road to comedy....plus it just wasn't funny. And, I was sick of all this about 10 minutes into the film!! I cannot believe I actually finished this horrid movie.Fortunately, I am not the only one who felt mad about this film. The public most likely was disgusted and also hated the notion of seeing an entire film of this unfunny crap....its IMDB rating is just horrid.The bottom line is that Eddie Murphy is super talented. However, based on this an MANY of his recent films, he seems to have zero sense for what projects to pick. For every \"Dreamgirls\", \"Shrek\" or \"Bowfinger\" (three magnificent films), he's appeared in pictures that seem beneath his talents (or even Pauley Shore's), such as \"The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps\", \"Meet Dave\" or \"Daddy Daycare\". He needs an agent to keep him from making these mistakes...and he needs to be willing to listen to them.",

Not in \"Norbit.\"I caught this one at an early screening and everyone in the audience walked away mumbling the same word: \"poop.\" One rather professional looking man glared at me and said, \"That's a steaming pile of poop\" (censorship his, not mine). What could I say? I just ate my Milkturd bar and shut the hell up. I mean really, who am I?You've got to give Eddie Murphy a lot of credit. The man tries harder than Perry Brasch making homemade jerky in his basement. But in \"Norbit,\" it just don't add up, you pantysniffer.

            "content": "When looking at Norbit as a theatrical release, anyone with a functioning brain and some idea of who Eddie Murphy is has to give credit where credit is due...to Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams for providing most of the redeeming value of this film. Props also go to Cuba Gooding, Jr. for ditching his usual role of the likable good guy character to play the equally likable snake-in-the-grass of this film.As for Murphy in his usual trio of roles...I gotta say that I'm actually getting tired of it. Sure, in \"Coming to America\" he was damn funny, but he shared the credit with Arsenio Hall, who also had four roles in the film. By the time Nutty Professor II came out, Murphy's multiple roles had already become tiresome. It seems more like egocentrism and the need for a bigger paycheck (probably to keep up on the alimony and child-support.) Murphy has proved his chops as a fine actor, and earned an Oscar nom to back it up. It only demeans his own talent when he picks up on three one-dimensional characters in a poorly-made comedy just to grab a few laughs. He may as well just hang a sign around his neck that says \"Hey, remember when I was funny?!\"As for Thandie Newton...as accomplished of an actress as she is - and she is, make no mistake - I can't help but see her in any film and completely agree with Murphy's character Rasputia: that girl needs to eat something! Newton has always looked way too anorexic! And this factor always diverts my attention away from her finer talents. My ability to focus on her performance rather than her appearance requires way more effort than should be expected for less than ten dollars.Then there is director Brian Robbins...and I struggle to actually attach the word \"director\" to his name, when \"unimaginative tool\" seems so much more appropriate (you may also substitute any of the following for the word \"unimaginative\": phony, lackluster, humorless, talent-less, useless, boring, etc.) Sadly, I am trying to understand why Murphy went ahead and did a second film with Robbins (see \"Starship Dave\" at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765476/ for more info). With a slew of bad films under his belt (The Shaggy Dog, Ready to Rumble, Good Burger, need I say more?), I am beginning to believe that Robbins actually sold his soul to the same satanic underling that contracted with the likes of Uwe Boll, Renny Harlin, Rob Bowman, and Michael Bay. (To his credit, though, Bay earned a large measure of redemption with Transformers. It was almost enough to make up for Pearl Harbor.)All in all, the best aspects of this film came down to three performances: Eddie Griffin as Pope Sweet Jesus and Katt Williams as Lord Have Mercy, the best Pimp & Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 duo since Mike Epps and Scruncho played Baby Powder and Baby Wipe in \"How High;\" and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the gold-digging, fraudulent boyfriend of Newton's 'Kate' character. Those three actors, especially Griffin and Williams, made the movie funny, and, if not truly enjoyable, at least tolerable. For them alone did I rate the film as high as I did.",

Another thing which kept me from a ten (other than the language) was the storyline. It kinda got predictable, but then sometimes took you to another route. Mostly the fat jokes are predictable a bit.

It was seamless. And they can make fat suits nowadays that look COMPLETELY (disgustingly) real.Save your money. Unless you want your kids to grow up despising women who are overweight and seeing them only as objects of ridicule. Sure, the character is a bully -- but the main source of humor in this movie is close-up examinations of this character's fatitude.Also annoying was the love interest. Little Thandie Newton who looks frail as a matchstick and is cloyingly little girlie cutesy. Head tilts and shoulder shrugs. And why would a rich lovely woman like this fall in love with a spineless homely dweeb like Norbit? (Oh right -- it's just casting.

So what the hell, here I am after watching a week ago only about half hour of this disgusting picture. I recently watched a SOUTH PARK episode in which they basically say Tyler Perry is a threat to the world as huge as Osama Bin Laden was! I still haven't watch anything made by Tyler Perry but I understand what he is all about. Frankly, I thought NORBIT was a Perry movie and well, what the SOUTH PARK guys said about Terry can be use as well for Eddie Murphy. And I was sort of concern since I watched part of this movie on the kids' channel of national TV\u0085 this is what Mexican kids get to see during a regular Sunday afternoon? That's simply wrong in many ways. For instance, there's a part that shows Murphy as the fat woman (yes, that's as crappy as it sounds) about to have sex with the title character Norbit. And she dresses herself with \"sexy\" clothes and jumps to the bed to Norbid's misfortune. That's simply not for kids and certainly not funny, AT ALL!

Contrary to popular belief, Eddie does read the screenplays to every bad movie he starred in. He read the script to Beverly Hills Cop III and said it was awful and that they needed to rewrite it. But after being offered an obscene amount of cash to star in it, Eddie Murphy caved in.Now for Norbit: This is easily the worst movie that Eddie Murphy has starred in point blank period. The story details Norbit(Eddie Murphy), a bullied wimp of a man whose girlfriend Rasputia(Eddie Murphy) mistreats him and takes him for granted. One day he meets Kate Thomas(Thandie Newton) and falls in love with her. Rasputia finds out and plans to destroy their union.Eddie Murphy mastered playing the different characters starting with Coming To America. It was funny there and it was funny with the first Nutty Professor film. Its just painful here. The whole movie is one unfunny fat joke, after fat joke, after fat joke. Plus the story of a tortured milksop that finds true love is corny and formulaic to a fault. Eddie Murphy was funny at a time(his early years). Stick with those times and forget this chittlin circuit disasterpiece ever existed.",

I love the gags and the hilarity of the whole situation. My opinion of the movie is that it's a spin off from Bowfinger and the character Murphy played in it. The actors were superb and the flow of the story went well. I know making fun of overweight people went out when John Candy passed away but the attitude of the over-sized leading lady made us think of some women we personally know with the same sized attitude. The fun the characters had in developing the town of interesting people made me laugh. It was a type of Mayberry. I don't know what others were looking for when they saw this movie, but I was just trying to laugh. Murphy was successful in making that happen. Norbit's resolve to make a bad situation good was the way many of us felt at times at our jobs or with family. A comedy is comprised of situations which hit home with the target audience and this one made a bullseye. Terry Cruze was great as one of her brothers. Murphy also allowed other comedians to join in on the fun like Eddie Griffin and Cat Williams. The music score was great as well. Get your popcorn ready and laugh tonight. Life is too serious.",

How anyone could have agreed to act in this movie--Thandie Newton of all people--is beyond me. But I guess it all comes down to money. Pay someone enough dollars (except Dave Chapelle) and they'll swallow integrity, principles, everything. Thirty three million plus dollars is enough money to change behavior--witness the circus around Anna Nicole Smith for proof.The plot doesn't even matter in this movie; in fact, its overwhelmed by the grotesque images of Rasputia--the monster mammy of the 21st century. She's liberated--no head scarves and long skirts for her. She's blown up into repulsive rolls and cellulite wearing the kind of clothes reserved for video ho's. Every time she appears on screen, the audience roars--who can hear the dialogue? Who cares about it? This movie is a freak show, plain and simple. Even the producers must have had some reservations about this movie or else they would not have \"airbrushed\" Rasputia for the movie poster--a vain attempt to make her look cute and chubby.I've long admired Eddie Murphy, and I was thrilled that he got a chance to put his talent to work in Dreamgirls. But if this is really representative of his imagination, then he's been fooling a lot of people for a long time. Why perpetuate this stereotype and remodel her into a Monster Mammy? If Michael Richards had come up with this movie, he would be living the rest of his life in rehab.",

Well NORBIT, like LITTLE MAN is proof enough that it is there... My two questions are: Did Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jnr actually read this script before agreeing to appear in this film? and.... have you ever seen a 'Dreamworks' film that was not actually a nightmare? maybe that's why Paramount bought them out; to stop them making more films like NORBIT At the cinema session I attended today in Bondi Sydney Australia, there was 8 people. Nobody laughed once. There was a lot of gasping, in fact at one point we all shrieked in disgust in such unison that we made ourselves laugh. That was the high point of the screening. At the end I saw one couple storm the ticket-box and demand that the manager not only refund their admission price but add $50 each as compensation fee for the pain endured. Such is NORBIT.

In \"Norbit,\" Murphy appears as three characters: Norbit, the nerdy orphan who's never learned to stand up for himself; Rasputia, the obese shrew who ropes Norbit into marrying her; and Mr. Wong, the owner of the orphanage, who raised Norbit after he was unceremoniously dropped off there by his parents one fateful night in the late 1960's. Norbit is all grown up now and living in a squeaky-clean, candy-colored, studio backlot small town inexplicably inhabited by both white-bread types straight out of Middle America and stripe-suited, Cadillac-driving street pimps fresh from the 'hood.There's no point in denying Murphy's skill at mimicry and impersonation, since the evidence is there in spades for all to see in \"The Nutty Professor.\" But then \"The Nutty Professor\" gave Murphy an actual, honest-to-God screenplay off of which he could build his routines. In the case of \"Norbit,\" if the studio had spent even a tenth of the time and effort on coming up with a good script as it did on designing fat suits and CGI-enhanced prosthetics, this might have been a decent comedy. As it is, it's just loud, obnoxious and offensive and wastes the talents of Thandie Newton, Cuba Gooding Jr., Marlon Wayans and Eddie Griffin into the bargain. Of course, as co-writer of the screenplay, Murphy has really no one but himself to blame for his being trapped in this fiasco.When the only source of humor is making fun of fat people, and when that one note is played over and over and over again to ever diminishing results, you know it's time to cash in your chips and move on. The problem for \"Norbit\" is that a bad joke remains a bad joke - no matter how many times you tell it.",

Keeping count of those couple of people who just burned 8.75 each, was definitely more interesting than this movie.First, I don't know if this movie was more offensive to overweight women, black women, white women, black men such as myself, Chinese men, or mankind in general. The opening scene begins with Eddie Murphy, in character as a Chinese man, who discusses how know one wants to adopt an ugly black baby. Of course no one in the theater laughs and this scene contains for a couple more moments.Aside from the Chinese bashing, this movie contains the overweight women who uses her size to abuse other people, it contains the classic black male as a buffoon, pimp, and hustler and it cracks 1990's style jokes that are derived from nutty professor fame. It also contains a wayans brother, and a few white women who are proud to serve for the pimps in the film.If you view this film, you will enjoy a few laughs. Depending on who you are you could definitely be offended and leave the theater or sit in agony as some idiot laughs at the fact that there are people swearing in church and in front of children. You could also think that there is nothing wrong with this film and find it a laugh riot, similar to the wayans brothers production, Little man.I stayed simply because I wasn't going to flush away my money.

It's the movie definition of having a good time.The introduction was perfect! Super creative and fun! The dialogs and structure of the story were awesome!Eddie Murphy always had a provocative style. Fans are used to his genius writing and acting. Once again we have a lot of physical comedy, and Eddie moves the chess pieces using some social prejudice, we know. But the richness of a comedy is there. And we have the clich\u00e9 that always functions in characters, like the pimps and even an old lady. Not to mention the Italian-Americans, the Asian-Americans, the African-Americans, are all represented communities. The multicultural soup, with some serious comedy - all these ingredients added to the mix and we have an amazingly fun movie to watch, that will make us laugh and forget the harsh daily reality for some time, for some moments. That's the aim of good cinema!The comic old church song and Eddie's narrator voice at the beginning is hilarious. On the same recipe of \"The Nutty Professor\", Murphy morphs into these three diverse characters, from Mr. Wong to Rasputia. Such good make-up and effects work, that make a huge impact on the viewer who only finds that afterwards!The wedding scene, the dance class, the dynamic of the town with the Pimps and the Latimore's, are the fresh, sometimes crude, but always funny comedy that I am looking for as a viewer.The Pimps - Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy - , for me, were the best characters in the whole movie. Even better than the laughable Rasputia. Eddie Griffin did a terrific effortless job, as did Katt Williams. Two comedy geniuses in the same movie as the master Murphy - was a perfect strategy! Only for the cast I already knew that I would have a good time.The amusement park scene was beyond creative and hilarious. The dates between Norbit and Kate, that the pimps confirmed that were dates in another funny scene, contributed to amazing laughs.The pizza scene where one of Rasputia's brothers brings to her the boxes of pizza and then, he tells her that Norbit is on a date with Kate. Their reaction along with the background music contributed to make a priceless iconic comedy moment!The lovely Loyd has a good intervention too, but the Pimps explode in the wedding scene.The whole writing about how the Latimore's would take over Mr. Wong orphanage, in order to transform it into a strip club named Nipplopolis, was beyond well constructed.Above all, Rasputia's sense of self-esteem, self-confidence and self-worth gave dynamic to this movie, and therefore are the nucleus of this piece. Everyone in town is afraid of Larimore's, and, even more funny, her own brother's are afraid of her, even though they are muscular, tall and well built. That feature helps immensely when, before the wedding scene, we see her brother Blue dancing to that fitness video - beyond hilarious!Overall it was a hilarious, creative, innovative experience from the beginning until the very end. And the pimps deserve their own movie. I can't express in words how good and well made this movie is. The plot is funny and it was very well directed.This is one of the few movies that I saw more than five times and always makes me feel better, like a medicine produced by a good actor and writer. Not to mention that this piece is the only one with a review full of spoilers, because I couldn't remain silent about the funny details. So, I will give this movie 10 out of 10 stars - \"How u' doin'?!\"",

Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy), a kind and caring person, brought the baby into his orphanage. As children, Norbit met Kate (Thandie Newton), another orphan, and they became best of friends and were always together until Kate was adopted. Norbit was now alone until Rasputia (Eddie Murphy) rescues him from three school bullies on the school playground. The huge Rasputia makes Norbit her boyfriend. When they become adults, Norbit is intimidated into marrying the gigantic Rasputia, and they don't live happily ever after. Norbit was compelled to work for Raspitia's three brothers at the Latimore Construction Company. The whole town lives in fear of the three brothers and Raspitia. A new day comes for Norbit when Kate returns from Atlanta to buy the orphanage from Mr. Wong. However, the Larimores want to buy the orphanage and turn it into a strip club, \"The Nipplopolis\".(My Comment) This is literally a gross comedy that will repulse you at times and make you feel sorry for the unattractive and weak minded Norbit, and it will also make you bust a gut laughing. The poorly written script was a hodgepodge of slap stick comedy with no meaning. The part that the talented Cuba Gooding Jr. played was wasted in this movie. I don't know why they wrote the scene about the three brothers extorting money from businesses, if they were making money with the only construction company in town. Also, it was unbelievable that a beautiful woman like Kate would even look at a weakling like Norbit, even if she loved him as a child. The makeup special effects were great, because it was hard to know that Eddie Murphy was playing the three main parts of Norbit, Rasputia, and Mr. Wong. The fat suit Eddie wore as Rasputia was disgusting, especially, the scene where Rasputia was wearing a bikini at the water park. Even for a comedy, I think this movie went a little too far to put people down for a laugh. This movie is a good example of mental, physical, and emotional husband abuse. Just a note: This is not a good movie to come out during Black History Month. (Paramount Pictures, Run time 1:42, Rated PG-13)(4/10)",

Think again.One luminous, glowing spot in this cinematic implosion is Thandie Newton, who, after her acclaimed performance in \"Crash,\" will probably want to forget the makers of \"Norbit\" ever approached her with script in hand. I don't think you'll be seeing this one listed on her resume. It's also good that Eddie's landed a few accolades for \"Dreamgirls\" before \"Norbit\" opened in theaters ... because I have a terrible feeling that this bad, bad film may have derailed his \"Dreamgirls\" Oscar express.",

            "content": "How YOU doin? By the time this film is over you'll be saying that to everyone and chuckling because Eddie Murphy has created his best character in a very, very, very long time and it's well deserving. Murphy is hilarious, he always has been but with the exception of the Shrek films Murphy has fallen on a bit of a rut as of late and I do classify the 'stupid and overblown' Klumps movie which I thought was ridiculous. Norbit is more of the Eddie Murphy style that he has come to be known for as of late. He plays multiple characters that are complete opposites and with very distinct possibilities. The fortunate part of Norbit is that the comedy actually works, and works well and Murphy and his brother co-wrote a script that is funny, cute, well performed and just very watchable. No one will tell you that Norbit is a classic of comedy and it should walk away with any awards but the important thing is it's not stupid, it's not dumb comedy and although some IMDb critics seem to take the subject matter very seriously, it isn't meant to be. Also director Brian Robbins has a knack of actually taking possibly brainless ideas and making a nice story out of it ex: The Perfect Score, Varsity Blues, and even Hardball.Eddie Murphy is really the focus of Norbit because he plays the two main characters and does an incredible job. As Norbit he is shy, self conscious, often feels alone and a little geeky but a heart of gold and longs to be himself. Consider him Napoleon Dynamite with a brain. As Rasputia, the very large, outspoken, verbally and physically abusive wife of Norbit he is barely recognizable but still has that Murphy flare. He also plays the Chinese Restaurant owner/Orphanage caretaker Mr. Wong which I didn't even realize until nearly the end of the film. In all three roles Murphy shows why he loves comedy and how easily he can pull it off. He completely embodies these characters and makes them distinctive, lovable or villainous all in the same breath. Thandie Newton (who I have never particularly liked) is actually quite good as the sudden love interest of Norbit who resurfaces years later. She is sweet and likable and somehow a worthy adversary to Rasputia. Cuba Gooding Jr.(where the heck has this guy been) plays sleazy salesman and fianc\u00e9 to Newton's character Deion Hughes. Gooding Jr. is such a versatile actor and it shows in this small performance where you just find him completely distasteful and root for Norbit around every corner. Add in the comedy talent of supporting actors including Eddie Griffin, Terry Crews, Clifton Powell, and Mighty Rasta and you've got yourself a silly comedy that actually works.ANYONE who calls this film offensive is first and foremost WAY over sensitive. I am myself a tad bit overweight and I didn't find a single thing about Murphy's performance 'offensive.' I don't hear anyone talking about Thandie Newton's performance being offensive to skinny people?? I don't hear anyone saying Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance was offensive to sales people?? It's ridiculous. The performances were meant to be over the top, ridiculous stereo types and that's what makes it funny. If a stand up comedian performed these characters on stage you'd be in hysterics but because it's in a movie it's offensive. If it offends you don't watch it and quite being so sensitive because there is far worse in the world then something like this. I can promise you this was not done out of distaste but simply to make a person laugh and it succeeds at that. Rasputia is hilarious and in her own way very likable too despite her constant torture on Norbit. It's not the best movie ever made, it's not even the best comedy to date but it's fun and you'll enjoy it if you get let yourself enjoy it. Get something serious to watch after it or before and you'll find the stress free, unintellectual laughter of Norbit soothing. 7/10",

Then when he was bullied, a giant, mean girl named Rasputia (Eddie Murphy) stood up for him and she made him love her and marry her. When Norbit sees Kate again, he's so happy. Yet, he's jealous she's engaged to another man. He still secretly likes her, but Rasputia threatened to kill him if they fall in love again. So if you need a comedy, rent this, watch it, laugh as hard as possible and if you like it, buy it. now, in my perspective, to buy or not to buy? your choice if you want 2 buy it!!!",

Yes, I laughed my ass off -- and then put it back on my shoulders, and laughed some more. Rasputia joins the ranks of the great screen monsters: Godzilla, the Stay-Puff marshmallow man, and that T-Rex in Jurassic Park. And there are some classic screen gems: Rasputia's ride down the water-slide is worth the price of the movie itself. The film is also to be commended for the great make-up work. If you didn't know, believe me, you wouldn't know.Are there stereotypes here? You bet. Here's the horrendous, earth-shaking, truth: a stereotype is a categorization of a group of people that contains an element of truth. Sorry, but it is not the job of comedy to be kind. It is the job of comedy to find humor and hope amidst the wreckage. \"Norbit\" does that. There is a lot of sweetness in the movie.Will I burn in hell for enjoying this movie as much as I did?

I just cracked up laughing so much when watching this film and the film was enjoyable and entertaining to watch. This film was his most funniest film and I loved it very much and also have it on DVD. Eddie Murphy was absolutely hilarious as Norbit, Rasputia and Mr Wong and I cracked up laughing so much at all 3 of the characters he played because they all were absolutely hilarious. The other characters such as the Latimore brothers were also absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey is a hilarious comedy actor but I prefer Eddie Murphy and think Eddie Murphy is much better. Eddie Murphy is an extremely talented and amazing actor who played 3 Characters in this film! And it was done extremely well.

Yet Cary Ewles just impersonated a Scottish character in a recent Christmas film, putting on the most godawful Scottish accent you have ever heard. Groundskeeper Willie from the Simpsons is literally the stereo type of a Scottish man but as a Scot myself was I offended by either portrayal? Absolutely not, because there is literally nothing to be offended by, and I certainly don't \"choose\" to be offended just because the rest of society is telling me I should.Norbit is by no way as bad as the score indicates. I've read people say, vulgar, crude, disgusting, racist, gross, unpleasant etc etc which is a load of b*****ks. The type of humour might not be to everyone's liking which applies to any type of comedy, but it certainly doesn't make it a bad film. As Ricky Gervais once said, \"just because you are offended, doesn't mean you are right\".Norbit has some has some very very funny parts which makes it a worthwhile watch, even if the plot is lacking.

Thus, with all that being said, we have to watch Norbit for what it is \u2013 a comedy with slapstick overtones.

What Norbit proves is that lightning doesn't necessarily strike twice. Murphy plays Norbit who was abandoned at a Chinese orphanage where he grows up to be the target of bullying. Saved one day by the massive Rasputa he is forced into marriage. Director Brian Robbins improves yet story is still simplistic formula with an ending lacking real feeling. Robbins is a director whose career is subdued with a long list of junk such as Good Burger, Ready to Rumble and Hardball. Eddie Murphy plays the humble Norbit as well as his overweight dominating wife and neither role evokes feeling. Thandie Newton is flat as a childhood love. The role is standard fare making it a complete waste of her time and talent. Eddie Griffin plays a pimp and Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Newton's scheming fianc\u00e9e. Terry Crews is cast as Rasputa's older brother and that cannot be any less than embarrassing for his resume. There is a theme regarding facing adversaries but it is buried underneath Murphy's makeup job. This film is a failure on all accounts and if the script had as much time spent on it as Rasputa's humongous bulk then perhaps Norbit might have reason to smile. Score: 4 / 10",

Norbit is a sporadically funny, unevenly paced, and weirdly mean-spirited comedy.To give credit where credit is due, the acting is surprisingly good, especially from Murphy, who's unrecognizable as Rasputia and Mr. Wong, no doubt in part to the Oscar-nominated make up, which is jaw-droppingly convincing. Terry Crews, Kat Williams, and the rest of the cast are a million flavors of fun, except for the actress who plays Kate, who's just going through the motions of the stereotypical undeveloped love interest.The first 20 minutes or so are good, with a good pace and consistently funny jokes, but it quickly peters out and doesn't really gain momentum again until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we go from location to location, seeing Norbit try to woo Kate despite Rasputia's terrorism. There's a laugh here and there, mostly from sex jokes, race stereotypes and Rasputia's comical, almost superhuman displays of strength, but the majority of the film instead focuses on Rasputia verbally and physically abusing her husband. Since the minute they met, she's felt the need to control Norbit. He may have had some connection in the beginning, but the more time he spends with her, the more shallow and selfish she reveals herself to be. He tries to leave her after she cheats on him without remorse, but lies about being pregnant to get him to stay. Despite cheating herself, she cannot stand the thought of Norbit with another woman, one who happens to bring him genuine joy.I can see what the filmmakers were trying to do here; they wanted to make a comedy with heart that also came from a genuine place and showed a real struggle all too many people face. It could've worked really well, but the end result is too inconsistent, dumbed down, padded out, and above all, ugly. Ugly on the eyes (Murphy's characters) and ugly at heart. The end result is more depressing than funny, and there just isn't enough meat to grab onto (besides Rasputia lol fat jokes) to make it anything worthwhile.I think a 4/10 is fair.",

If I saw someone laughing at a black or fat person for real, I'd be pretty upset.Memorable \"Norbit\" quotes: Rasputia-\"How you doin'?\" \"You do it!\" \"Don't adjust my seat!\" \"Sounds like it's raining outside.\" \"Say Tuesday again, and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!\" Norbit- \"Chocolate drop, I'm home!\" \"Halt!\" \"Happy Presidents Day!\" Mr. Wong- \"Bingo! Right on the blowhole!\" \"Norbit! Why you run off like little b***h?\" \"It is long time in h**l before Wong suck poison out of another man's a*s!\"Overall, this is a great and funny film, and if you love comedy and/or Eddie Murphy, then this movie is for you! Go out now and rent or buy it!",

His talent as an actor and comedian are at full force here than unlike the horrendously boring and overly praised \"Dreamgirls.\" The lead character tells an underdog story with clever twists never before attempted. Murphy performs three different characters and to the point where you can't tell. The co-stars are all top drawer talent who everyone will recognize.

I think Eddie Murphy played the character of Respucia brilliantly, and it came across to me how it s]it was meant to come across to everyone else.

            "content": "I will admit the make-up is good, but it is placed in an awful film with an actor who hasn't had a good success since The Nutty Professor (apart from the Shrek films). Basically Norbit is the orphan who grew up in the orphanage owned by Mr. Wong (triple Razzie winning Eddie Murphy), and became friends with fellow orphan Kate Thomas, and it is ended when she is adopted. In her absence, lonely young Norbit meets fat and big Rasputia, and grown up they marry each other, so older Norbit (Murphy again) has a family with older Rasputia (also Murphy). Unfortunately the marriage is false and not true love, and it is not just Norbit suffering, the whole town is in fear of Rasputia and her gangster brothers Big Jack Latimore (Terry Crews), Earl (Clifton Powell) and Blue (Mighty Rasta, or Lester 'Rasta' Speight). When older and engaged Kate (Thandie Newton) returns to town, Norbit's feelings for her are reignited, but Rasputia is being a complete bitch to make sure he doesn't get her. Meanwhile, Kate's fianc\u00e9e Deion Hughes (Razzie nominated Cuba Gooding Jr.) is conceiving with the brothers to turn Mr. Wong's orphanage into a strip club. Norbit in the end finally gains courage to stand up to his gigantic and horrible wife and get to the wedding to stop his true love marrying the wrong man, and Rasputia and the brothers are driven away to never be heard from again. Also starring Eddie Griffin as Pope Sweet Jesus, Katt Williams as Lord Have Mercy, Marlon Wayans as Buster, Floyd Levine as Abe the Tailor and Anthony Russell as Giovanni. With offensive gags about oral sex, bikini-line waxing and an orphanage being turned into a \"titty bar\" called Nipplopolis, you probably wouldn't want your kids watching, even being available to them, well, I don't think anyone's going to want to watch this abysmal comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it won the Razzies for Worst Director for Brian Robbins, Worst Screen Couple for Murphy as Norbit and him as either Mr. Wong or Rasputia, Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture.

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer for Norbit, I have to admit I was tickled, more so by the familiar antics that poke fun at weight and size. Apologies though that I'm laughing at the expense of plus sized people, and it dawns upon you if there's any valid reason why they should be constant punching bags for gags. From Shallow Hal to The Nutty Professor, it seemed that Eddie Murphy is revisiting familiar territory with prosthetics all over again, and can't get enough of piling on fake weight on himself.Murphy again takes on multiple characters, in Norbit, Rasputia and The Golden Wanton Orphanage owner Mr Wong, I thought his politically incorrect Mr Wong was the most enjoyable amongst the three, as he had some of the best lines in the movie, especially during his toast in a wedding scene. Norbit is as plain as the character is designed to be, a meek, mild-mannered hen-pecked man, while Rasputia his wife, probably the most revolting, demeaning and vile woman you've ever come across on screen, who changes hairstyles in almost every other scene.As the story goes, Norbit the orphan grows up to be an unassuming man, only to be taken advantage of by his wife Rasputia, who rescued him from bullies when he was a teenager. Being a significant (pun intended) other in his life, and as marriages go, that's when the real nightmare starts. When Norbit's childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton) returns to town, it's time for him to decide whether to put up with the nonsense, or try to seek out a life which should have been.Somehow, most of the \"fat\" jokes were already included in the trailer, so don't expect anything more. Rather, the focus for the most parts tended to be on the romantic tangle between Norbit, Kate and Rasputia, on the premise of a grand scheme by Rasputia's brothers to gain control over the orphanage to turn it into a strip joint known as Nippleopolis. Like I mentioned about my criteria for laughs, if my tears ain't rolling, it ain't so good, and nope, while some bits were funny, they were rare occurrences. The pacing of the movie was uneven as well, with plain dramatic moments and plain, expected sub plot development.Thandie Newton makes a comeback to the big screen after her outing in Crash, and has another role in a soon to be released movie (in Singapore) The Pursuit of Happiness starring Will Smith. I'm surprised that Cuba Gooding Jr lends his presence as the Kate's shady fianc\u00e9 Deion Hughes, and Marlon Wayans has a role that seemed pretty out of place as a pimp daddy.For those who want to see Murphy tackling newer ground, head over to Dreamgirls to watch him sing and dance in a musical drama. Otherwise if you're up for some low brow nostalgia, then Norbit is the movie for you. And a pity though that the version shown here is censored at one point.",

As in previous Eddie Murphy films, multiple roles are played by Murphy. The title-character Norbit, a meek man who gets more than he bargained for when at age 10 he is rescued from bullies by 10 year old Rasputia, and Mr. Wong, Norbit's \"father\" at the adoption centre.After giving a quick and often funny insight to Norbit's young life, the film kicks off with Norbit and Rasputia's wedding ceremony, then delves into the complications that arise in their lives as Norbit's childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton) moves back into the neighbourhood to by the orphanage - which is also what Rasputia's powerful brothers want to do. Norbit also disapproves of Kate's fianc\u00e9e Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr).While Norbit is an enjoyable thing, there is an awful lot going on, which is not a bad thing, just a tad distracting at times. The acting is pretty good all-round, especially from Murphy, in all three of his roles. Eddie Griffin is hilarious as Pope Sweet Jesus. Pat Crawford Brown (from \"Depserate Housewives\") has a small but memorable role, and Laura Ortiz (from the Hilsl Have Eyes remake) has a blink and you'll miss her part.There may be some who may get offended at \"Norbit\", perhaps thinking that it makes fun of fat people, but really, Rasputia's weight is hardly made fun at. Rasputia is incredibly funny in a trailer-trash kind of way. Most of the laughs I got came from her, however some of the comedy in \"Norbit\" is not that funny, but it's still an enjoyable film.",

The one funny bit in the movie, which was Rasputa on the water slide (which incidentally raised little more than a smile) was shown in the trailer, making even this essentially redundant in the grand scheme of things.People have told me I just don't get it because it appeals to an American sense of humour, but I hope to God they're wrong because I'm genuinely appalled by the thought there could be a whole nation of people who actually enjoyed this piece of crap.It's a pity there's no rating less that 1.",

Nothing happened and the plot continued on with the same humor and the plot didn't seem to progress beyond Rasputia beating up Norbit. While I was not going in expecting much, I was hoping to be impressed, but I set my morals pretty low and I still wasn't. It began to become repetitive and the jokes were growing staler and staler relying on stereotypes. While I give kudos to the make-up designer and Murphy's dedication to the characters (even though they were sometimes annoying) I will say this movie is god awful. It is a typical movie with a typical plot line that only got resolved with a harpoon. So yes, Murphy did do a convincing job, but I wish he would have given the story more of a heart than he did. I was hoping Rasputia wasn't going to be such a bitch through the whole movie and that Norbit (most possibly the best character, who probably would've been a better movie minus Rasputia) would solve his own problem. I feel disappointed that a legend like Murphy would make such a movie like this. He's sunk so low since his early days. I mean, he was good dressing up as multiple characters in movies like \"The Nutty Professor\", but this is far below it. I can only hope his reprise in Shrek the Third will restore some hope.As they said on Saturday Night Live: \"A star is falling. Quick, kids... make a wish\"",

On too many occasions watching Norbit I simply cringed, in only one scene, did I laugh \u2013 when a big fat black momma takes a water chute and flies off the end.Thandi Newton plays Norbit's out of reach love interest, and is stranded, beautiful and engaging around the dross which laps all around her. Thirteen year olds, struggling to keep up at school, and behind with their reading, will enjoy the base humour and limited horizons which this film offers. For the rest, there will be much else to amuse. Norbit, played by Murphy, is squashed by the whale like Rasputia, played by Murphyhaving been taken in by the wacky Mr Wong played by Murphy and thats it, You have to endure another 101 minutes of purgatory.Director Brian Robbins forte is in American comedy series for TV, where an episode may last only 21 minutes and one joke can be stretched out, but he wholly fails to produce a feature film worth of comedy.

The film is about a mild-mannered man who is in love with his childhood sweetheart and as she left the orphanage as she found a new family Norbit meanwhile is now married to a fat woman named Rasputia(Murphy donning a prosthetic suit and mask thanks to the special makeup effect's man Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon in Enchanted as the old hag).But when Norbit's childhood sweetheart returns with a new man(Cuba Gooding Jr from Rat Race) he is heartbroken but her new man is after her money to open a strip club.Some parts were funny like the one where Rasputia is getting in the car and her boobs are in the way and when she is on the slide and she goes straight threw the wall and into the kids swimming pool but the rest was so stupid,I mean come on Eddie Murphy has been doing this prostheitc crap for long enough he did it in Nutty Professor and portrayed 6 charcther's and he did a bit in Dreamgirls but seriously I think Murphy is trying to quit Hollwood if you ask me cause his just not the same funnyman as he was back in the 90s or when he was doing Donkey in Shrek.The film I think won a raspberry award for worst movie and I can see why.The only thing I give credit to is to Rick Baker who did the prosthetics for Murphy and when I saw him as the Chinese man I was like is that Jackie Chan or is it just some other actor and when I found out it was Murphy I was like wow that Baker dude is awesome.Anyway i'll give this a 3/10 and once is enough to see it as it is awful.",

            "content": "Tending to the books of a construction company for his monstrous, repulsive, ugly-mouthed, incredibly large wife, Rasputia's (Eddie Murphy) muscled, appallingly-bullying brothers (Terry Crews, Lester Speight, and Clifton Powell), Norbit (also Murphy) is stuck in a dead-end job and rotten marriage, the constant object of ridicule and mistreatment. Raised in an orphanage with childhood sweetheart, Kate (Thandie Newton, quite cute), who was fortunately adopted while he wasn't, Norbit falls head over heels for her on her return. Kate plans to marry a douche named Deion (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a crook who marries women and divorces them for profit, in cahoots with Rasputia's Latimore brothers in the orchestration of gaining Mr. Wong's (also Murphy) orphanage so they can turn into a titty bar.I think Eddie Murphy is one of the finest comics of my generation but Norbit (2007), although a hit, is a major comic tragedy. Loaded in makeup as the horrible, gargantuan Rasputia, Murphy plays her as a fat caricature, and I often cringed at the sight of her. I didn't find her funny as much as tiresome. Then there's the henpecked, nerdy weakling Norbit, right out of Revenge of the Nerds (1984), who remains a victim all the way until the end when he is finally rescued by the locals when it appears Rasputia is about to hit him with a shovel (a spike into her butthole stops her in her tracks!) by Wong. His mistreatment is rather exhausting instead of humorous. Clearly wanting to go the Nutty Professor route for gags (echoes of Coming to America (1988) also come to the forefront), Rasputia isn't the same kind of hilarious character you see with the Klumps or the barbers. She's just a grossout. The constant belittling and dehumanization of Norbit doesn't produce laugh out loud belly giggles, but elicits pity. The desperate need for audience amusement is there, but this film is just a failure. Murphy deserves better than this misfire. Newton is a sweetheart, though, but her ignorance to how obviously corrupt Gooding is kind of paints her as na\u00efve and easily duped\u0085and that she signs papers given to her by Norbit without even reading them doesn't help her cause, either. Wong, a Chinese orphanage operator with racism to blacks and Jews (he admits this to Norbit in an oddball night scene that is more headscratching than funny) who actually wanted to run a laundry instead, never once made me even smile. I just found him lame. When Murphy's at his best, he can't be beat, but there's no mistaking he's made the occasional bomb or two (think Pluto Nash). He's human after all.",

It is all in funny taste but it does go overboard at times.The movie is about Norbit( eddie murphy) who is raised in an orphanage by a Chinese guy (eddie murphy again) , the girl of his dreams gets adopted from the orphanage and they get separated, enter Rasputia ( Eddie Murphy again n really big this time) who protects and dominates norbit with equal measure, they get married eventually and what follows is a no brain plot designed to arouse laughter in every scene.I must say i did find the movie funny in parts but this movie is no way close to Nutty professor or Beverly hills cop.

That would be fine if the dialog was actually witty and funny. The humor it does have is rude and offensive, even to the most open-minded of people. It consists completely of fat jokes and a few ill-hidden racial jokes, that are nothing more than annoying and needlessly insolent.Don't get me wrong, I do like fat and racial jokes; I pretty much like any type of joke, even the ones that are often considered highly offending--as long as they aren't ignorant or predictable--but the ones that *weren't* insulting in 'Norbit' were just that. Dull, typical, the same fat jokes that have been done at least one hundred times in every other comedy out there.I had maybe two or three chuckles that weren't forced throughout the entire film, which is saying a lot since I'm generally amused easily.

Here is a little preview: Nerdy Norbit gets saved from bullies by a big girl who feels that this good deed entitles her to a lifetime of servitude and unquestioning devotion from him. Timid, and without his own compass, Norbit goes along with the program until a hottie shows up in the form of his childhood sweetheart.Now he's conflicted: On one hand, he wants to be faithful to his big fat dominatrix of a girlfriend; partly out of loyalty and partly out of fear (Norbit is a big scaredy-cat). On the other hand, he enjoys the company of his childhood friend and is in love with her.What to do? The \"cowardly\" thing, of course! Ergo, contrive ways to sneak dates with his sweetheart and pray to god lardzilla doesn't find out. I give this movie 6 stars out of 10 which means that FOR ME it was entertaining and worth seeing. I know that by saying this I'm probably parting company from most of the IMDb family (based on many of the comments I've seen) who have all kinds of reasons for panning this movie.They're passionate too, from the lengthy paragraphs some have devoted to their ire.Finally,I concede that if I were obese I might not have liked this movie, but I'm not and it was funny (I'm terrible, I know).

            "content": "So\u0085on February 25, at the historic Academy Awards, Eddie Murphy has a very good chance of winning the Oscar of 'Best Supporting Actor' for his role as James \"Thunder\" Early in Dreamgirls. Too bad for Raspuita, Norbit Rice, and Mr. Wong. All three of them (played brilliantly by Eddie Murphy in Norbit) could put pressure on Murphy's role in Dreamgirls. The thing is, when it comes to the Academy Awards, entertaining movies don't win\u0085the movies with good morals and uplifting feelings win.Certainly, a person doesn't venture into a auditorium expecting to learn a lifelong lesson or have their spirits uplifted by Norbit. There is one lesson you may learn, and that is if you eat as much as Rasputia (the mean, junk-food chugging queen), you will be the butt of a lot of jokes. But for us, that's a good thing. Raspuita is the highlight of the movie, making great (albeit disturbing) use of her body to make you laugh.Speaking of Rasputia, the whole cast of the movie is chalk-full of bright, not-so-fresh characters. Mr. Wong (Murphy) is an elderly racist (but kindhearted) Chinese man who runs an orphanage. When Norbit (Murphy) is abandoned at the orphanage as a infant, Mr. Wong takes him in to care for him. Soon, a young Norbit meets a girl named Kate (Thandie Newton) at the orphanage to whom he falls in love with. In a shocking turn of events, she is adopted and is gone, presumably, forever. Our geeky hero's life from then on consists of being picked on and made fun of. One day, Rasputia sees Norbit being picked on and destroys the bullies. Fast forward 20 years, and Norbit and Raspuita are married. Mr. Wong is planning to retire, thus leaving his orphanage up in the air. Raspuita's three ridiculously stereotyped \"brothas\" want to turn it into a strip club. In the meantime, Norbit and Kate see each other again after 20 years or so. To Norbit's surprise, Kate is dating Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a man who is secretly agreeing to turn Mr. Wong's orphanage into a strip club along with Rasputia's three brothers. All this leads to a happy ending for one misfit and one smoking girl (and I mean that)! Cue the wolf-whistle.What many critics are bashing this movie for is its uncreative humor. Sure, fat-person humor is nothing new (and not really creative), but it will land with a huge thud is the characters don't act well. Part of what makes Rasputia so hilarious is the little things she does: the finger pointing, the long nails, the ego-centric way she presents herself, and her facial expressions. This can certainly be credited to Murphy, who has never had a role in a movie that I haven't enjoyed. Same goes for Mr. Wong and Norbit (being well-acted characters), but Raspuita is clearly the character who Murphy put most attention and dedication into while acting.As you can see, there is a fairly complicated storyline going on here, but the main focus of Norbit is laughter. After all, it is a comedy, and at that, it succeeds. I haven't laughed this hard since Borat. And what a surprise, but I may of just laughed harder at this. Yes, Borat was the better all-around movie, but I'll admit it: I laughed harder at Norbit. I don't care if all my credibility just went out the window, because I'm being honest with my opinions.Good) Mix of characters, over-the-top humor, no slowdownBad) My jaw hurts from laughing...",

This film had its threads traced from the early teens of all the protagonists, except for Rasputia - why did she have this fascination with Norbit? Was it a crush unadmitted? All of the other plot threads were so neatly tied from the start, in the adult version of these characters, there was none of that twisted fascination she held for Norbit - it seemed that fascination slipped over to Buster, the exercise instructor, who was carried out by Marlon Wayans with a stupid set of false teeth that did not disguise his appearance in the least! This whole picture was a mistake of CATACLYSMIC proportions, thanks to this dreck, I am SICK & TIRED of Eddie Murphy's multiple roles... So what?

There also an somewhat all-star supporting cast like Terry Crews,Marlon Wayans,Katt Williams,Clifton Powell,Cuba Gooding Jr,and Eddie Griffin.

Thandie Newton also starred in the movie as Kate the childhood friend of Norbit of whom they both grew in love with each other.

            "content": "Fresh from his promising turn from \"Dreamgirls,\" Eddie Murphy, after so many years of unfunny bad movies, proved that he could be a dramatic actor and could very well have a much wider range of acting roles than his subsequent bomb, \"Norbit.\" We thought we could count on Murphy coming a long, long way and start a brand new acting life from a buffoon to a real actor.But no. Weeks before Oscartime, and before Alan Arkin snatched away that trophy from Murphy, came \"Norbit,\" a vulgar, crass, mean-spirited would-be-comedy. Yes, Murphy sure gets to have range here, in three count-'em roles, where his face is unrecognizable in each role. He plays the title loser who never gets any breaks in life; Rasputia (Murphy overacts and acts up the part in the obvious fatsuit), the foul, enormously obese wife of Norbit bent on making her husband's life miserable; and the most unrecognizable role of role, Mr. Wong, the headmaster of the orphanage where he raised Norbit and his sweet-tempered childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton, in a thankless role). Only with the title character do we hear his real voice.There are no decent laughs. How funny is it to have your real father throw you as a baby out of the car onto the gutter where the orphanage is? Luckily Mr. Wong raises Baby Norbit as his own. Five minutes after into the movie, we see young Rasputia (played by a real child actress) beating up kids who beat up 9-year-old Norbit. Then we see that Rasputia and that Norbit at the dinner table with Rasputia's three pimplike brothers who all through the movie look like 1970's blaxploitation characters (listen to the '70's soul music playing in the background that seem to come from \"Shaft\" or \"Superfly\"). In the 1980s, Rasputia and Norbit marry, and we get to hear Rick James music. And from then on, everything goes downhill for Norbit. Rasputia beats up Norbit and her three brothers also abuse him. Rasputia yells, screams, cries, cusses, and with all that, Murphy appears to make Rasputia the star of the movie, upstaging Norbit. Therefore, the movie should have been titled \"Rasputia\" and for sure with such an exaggeratedly misbehaved character, who would want to waste their precious time and money seeing that?Now we go into the the present day. The adult Kate meets Norbit and Norbit wants desperately to go back to her. They drifted apart as kids because Kate was adopted first. It is easy to see Kate as a contrasting foil to Rasputia because Kate is calm, low-key, thin, and well-mannered. But the character of Kate doesn't get funny material to go with that goody-goody personality. However, Kate is engaged to the double-dealing Deion (Cuba Gooding, Jr., an Academy Award Winner who obviously wants a paycheck and acts like \"What the Hell am I doing here?\"). Kate and Deion are about to marry, but Norbit reveals Dion's crimes (while Kate wants to buy the orphanage from Mr. Wong to make it into a better place, Deion, along with Rasputia's brothers want to turn it into a strip club), so Kate breaks off with Deion, and eventually marries Norbit, Norbit finally leaves behind Rasputia, who gets an arrow in her rear end by a witness, causing her to scream her head off.There is no real message to this junk. All there is nastiness. Murphy abuses fat people saying they are loud and nasty, makes skinny women with sweet and soft temperaments wholesome but boring, makes the men either pimplike or pushovers. He even mistreats animals in a scene where Rasputia runs over a dog, causing it to lose its legs, but the dog speaks and says \"Kill the B----!\" In real life, Murphy is no saint. He divorced Nicole Mitchell, the mother to their five children, and had an affair with Spice Girl Melanie Brown and passed the paternity test, making him the father of her child. And Murphy abuses himself where his own two characters Rasputia and Norbit hurt and insult each other. You may have only a laugh or two, but you may find yourself laughing in ridicule at Rasputia, which I did.",

I like the part where Rasputia was looking for Norbit and she went into the Italian Restaurant and she said \"where's Norbit?\" And the Italian said \"I don't know!\" And then Rasputia said \"we'll then who's been eating the turkey a$$?!\" This movie might be rated PG-13 but I was 7 when I saw this and I understood everything and I laugh the whole time I never got bored and I never got tired as a matter of fact I watched it 3 times in a row and it was really late when we finished the movie the first time so you can tell the movie is amazing and this is being reviewed by a teen saying this!",

The expected humor was again found in this film and this also includes Eddie Murphy's expected and unexpected versions of humor. This certainly isn't the first of its kind! We all have our opinions about each one of Eddie Murphy's movies. He has done so many roles with similar characters. It would be really great to see this man move on to role, a new script. Eddie is known to cross the line with his endless humor and we all can only expect this kind of humor from a guy like Eddie! In this movie Eddie trots over that fine line, over & over again. It seems there are many individuals getting a bit upset with Eddie over this film. I just hope he will find new material and do this soon. He is a very funny man by nature and enjoys making others laugh. Now is the right time to move on and get into a brand new role, but still staying his humorous self and still very much Eddie Murphy. Sorry, but this time Eddie has worn out his over worked role as the big Mama. I am giving \"Norbit\" a weak #3...because it's high time to give up this idea and move on Eddie!~Angel~",

Most of his leading women are gorgeous no matter the complexion (Marsha Tomason, Regina King, Janet Jackson, Carmen Ejogo, Angela Basset) to name a few.

I suggest you wait for the DVD to see this movie, that is unless you are a huge Eddie Murphy fan, and you want to see him do extra roles. Including the utterly useless Mr Wong who should have been played by a real Asian. The only funny thing funny about his character was when he said he didn't like black people and we know that its really Eddie. If there was a moral lesson, to be gained from this movie, it would have to be that no matter what its best to develop a backbone. That way you are never stuck in a terrible situation with a terrible girl. This was very much the dominant big girl dates the spineless gay guy, who is afraid of coming out or afraid to say no. Only in this case he was a straight guy who had real issues sticking up for himself, and that was truly painful to watch.It did have a bit of a romantic interlude where Eddie Murphy (Norbit) had a crush on his elementary school and orphanage playmate Thandie Newton (Kate)Again there are some funny scenes, but overall this movie was a real sleeper.",

Seeing a fat person jiggle around of screen for an hour and 30 minutes is not funny, sorry.The movie starts off with a baby being adopted by a Chinese man. The Chinese guy in this film was extremely annoying and repetitive. Back to the movie, he adopts the kid and raises him as if he is his own son. The baby grows into a boy who gets bullied and beaten by some two boys. To the rescue comes a HUGE girl named \"Resputia\". She fight them off, Norbit and her become a couple. They later get married and all is right with the world, right ? Nah, Resputia is a controlling woman who would stop at nothing to keep Norbit in a strangle hold in their relationship. Then into Norbit's life walks a beautiful woman, this woman was good friends with Norbit in the daycare. They even got married(fake). The thing I hate about this movie is the constant fat jokes. It seemed that was the only material they had. No one else in this movie was funny at all. The movie was very predictable even for a comedy. The jokes were also very crude and racial to the point where it just wasn't funny. The only thing I can say that was half funny was the \"How you doing ?\" by Resputia. It was just the way she said it that made me chuckle. Unfortunately, one quote can't save a movie.Eddie Murphy, what the hell is wrong with you, man ? You put on a good performance with Dreamgirls and turn around to make a lame movie like this. That's too bad because this movie might have screwed up his Oscar chances. I warn you all to please stay away from this film. Get Netflix, rent a movie, watch porn, babysit your little cousin. Do anything but watch this trash movie.

            "content": "As a child Norbit is abandoned by his parents at the orphanage of Mr Wong. He grows up a mild-manner but very put-upon man who finds himself in a relationship with the monstrous, fat and bullying Rasputia, mainly because she fought off other bullies down the years. As an adult he is married to her and seems to have given up any hope of ever being happy or even just not being terrified on a daily basis. All that could change though when a former childhood sweetheart from the orphanage (the unfeasibly gorgeous Kate Thomas) turns up back in town with plans to buy the orphanage from Mr Wong and improve it.Of course I knew that this film was going to be terrible before I watched it, it is the accepted wisdom that this is vile and repulsive and the film that cost Eddie Murphy his Oscar for Dreamgirls. However when such condemnation is delivered I often wonder if it can be so deserved and, given that Norbit was greeted less kindly that a paedophile arriving at court, I decided to check it out. What I found does not match with the savage comments I have read and heard because to my mind this is no worse than many other base and childish comedies put out for a target audience of, presumably, unevolved slime. However do not get me wrong and mistake this very slight defence for anything approaching praise \u0096 because it is most certainly not. Norbit is a bad film. It seems to rely solely on physical gags that are uninspired, unimaginative and unfunny. While you sit in a laughless sea of silence, the viewer has to then try and care about the characters to make the story work \u0096 which it doesn't because you never do.I can see what attracted Murphy because it is a bit like Nutty Professor, which was a hit. In his defence he does do a reasonable job with what is given to him \u0096 just that what he is given to do stinks, really stinks. As an actor Norbit calls me to question his judgement, but not his talent. Of course the fact that he is also credited as a writer does mean that what little sympathy I have for him dries up pretty quickly once I press play. Newton clearly took this for the money and she seems half-asleep throughout and cannot even muster a bit of chemistry with Murphy's Norbit. Again though I would say that the actors are left high and dry by the material and the only thing I judge them on is why they did this in the first place. Conversely the only, rare, moments of amusement (and it is no more than that but does feel like ice water in a desert) are from the smaller characters played by Crews, Mighty Rasta and Powell but more importantly, two clich\u00e9d but funny \"pimps\" from Griffin and Williams \u0096 hardly impressive turns but at least quite funny. Gooding Jr is in it but I do wonder why that doesn't surprise me at all.Norbit is not the spawn of Satan or the worst film you will ever see \u0096 it is just very poor. I did not find it offensive, I just found it roundly lazy and unlikable, with little or no comedy, characters or story to hold my interest. The very odd funny moment is lost in the sea of pathetic writing and delivery. The only footnote to add is that it did deserve the Academy's nod for make-up because the prosthetics and make-up is fantastic and those involved from this side should be the only ones to really have even a bit of pride in this film.",

For instance people can make fun out of everything even from theirselves. I read the comments here and a lot of them were preety puritan.

Murphy co-stars with himself again in this story of a nice guy raised by an old man and forced to marry a monster of a woman but who pines for his childhood love. Digital technology has eliminated the door frames and lampposts that were once a staple of dual role performances, but no one has invented a way to curb the ego of an actor whose idea of shaping a scene is to start loud and get louder. Again if Eddie wants to restart his career and take it to the next level he will have to be strong and stay away from hapless comedies like this and stick to the real. Eddie you can do it, the previous movies that were done, acting in multiple roles were good. This movie, however does not match up to those films.

What appears to be a light-hearted everyman's comedy dives into lowbrow trash as fast as Rasputia's fat ass flies down a water slide. \"Norbit\" amazingly manages to blatantly offend a gamut of groups, including Fat and Skinny, Men and Women, Blacks, Whites, Chinese, Italians, Jews, Mexicans, even the Elderly and the Young. It's like Eddie Murphy and his brother wrote this in one night over a case of warm Colt 45's. The most interesting part of the movie was actually the reactions of the audience who was really only comfortable laughing at the ridiculous physical antics, like the spear-in-the-asshole gag. The one redeeming quality is Murphy's insatiable talent as the massively obese and overbearing Rasputia. But what does that say anyway?www.manwithavan.blogspot.com",

The tragedy though is that they tarnished the cake with mud!I recalled the 1980s; maybe for the simplicity, or the bright colors. And the 1950s as well; in terms of (Jerry Lewis)'s comedy, the defeated lead, and the small city for that matter. But the 2000s was overwhelming, in a bad scene. Look at the free filthy ALL UNFUNNY jokes, the farts, the profanity, the crude humor, and the (Rasputia)!(Eddie Murphy) does what's hard so easy. I think he'd be rated fairly, for his efforts here, later. Giving 3 Razzie Awards for his 3 characters was harsh. He made a memorable (Mr. Wong), and a poor (Norbit) with constant weeping expression. On the contrary, he made (Rasputia) obnoxious to freaky extent. They went SO FAR with that character, and on all the levels; writing, modeling its shape, performing,...etc. For 90 % of her time on screen, I had such a disgust grin, which is something a comedy doesn't aspire to. Her supposed-to-be-comic moments were truly emetic!The special effects were almost perfect, but so forgotten among the violent slapstick and the loose ugliness. Review an important moment like when the lead must catch up with the heroine before getting married to the wrong guy; he has a chase to win, while using 2 friends to delay the priest in the same time; OK, this is a classic situation that had been done in numerous cinemas with guaranteed fun, but not in here, because the sermon of the 2 pimps in the church was beyond obscene, being too blasphemous to stand.As you see, every nice element is haunted by something nasty, as if it's a lovely melody yet with loud lyrics, so the final song is between Nat King Cole and Flavor Flav!..And I just watched the censored version!",

            "content": "This gigantic mess of a movie is an atrocious disappointment concerning not just Eddie Murphy but also film in general. It's really hard to imagine how after \"Dreamgirls,\" Murphy can have proceeded to this so incongruously bad project that had so many jokes plodding heavily and flopping pitifully that it has become one of the worst films I've ever seen. Murphy's talent and charm are utterly wasted.He plays Norbit, a geeky guy from the orphanage run by Mr. Wong (Murphy, too) who grew up to marry Rasputia (Murphy... again), a 300-pound whale of a woman with all the vulgarity and none of the manners. He soon meets Kate (Thandie Newton), his best friend in the orphanage from way back, soon to marry Deion (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and planning to buy the orphanage from Mr. Wong. But all is not well, because Rasputia's three brothers are keen on acquiring the orphanage and turning it into a strip club and they are planning to use Norbit as a bait to make Kate sign the required papers.While I admit one or two scenes managed to make me put up a weak smile, \"Norbit\" is a comedy directed by Brian Robbins that runs the proceedings offering virtually no funny moment. (If you think Murphy-in-a-fat-suit wearing a hooker costume leaping to a skinny Murphy wearing a cop costume is funny, you might fare better.) This might not be the case if this were a ten-minute sketch as Murphy's portrayals of his characters here are apparently a whole lot easier to take in small doses. An hour and a half of him fighting his way through an awful script becomes as painful as it is exhausting to watch. And the egregious vulgarity that fills the whole film just adds insult to injury, so to speak.In the end, \"Norbit\" is a mind-numbing collection of conspicuous crassness that is neither endearing nor funny, and squanders Murphy as an actor.",

He has played 3 roles in this movie, Norbit the nerdy afro guy, Resputia the fat lady, and Mr. Wong the little Chinese guy with the ROD! It doesn't matter who you are!

That'll be funny, right? You can judge for yourself, but this Eddie Murphy comedy is more dumb than funny, though it does have it's moments. At some points you may find yourself laughing, and at the next moment you'll be cringing and hoping this movie ends. Norbit is certainly not as terrible as some have made it out to be, but it's still pretty darn bad!Norbit (Eddie Murphy) is a nerdy guy who met his future wife Rasputia (Eddie Murphy) after being picked on by some bullies. She stood up for him, but now as adults, she picks on him as much as she can. Norbit grew up in an orphanage run by nice, but racist old Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy). Norbit was previously in love with Kate (Thandie Newton...thank goodness she's not played by Eddie Murphy), a girl at the orphanage with him, but she was adopted, and it's not until after his marriage to Rasputia that he sees her again, only to fall back in love with her. She's engaged to Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who secretly wants to tear the old orphanage down and make it into a strip club. Will Norbit and Kate fall in love? Will Deion's devious plan work? Will Eddie Murphy ever make another good live action comedy? The answer to all these questions are quite obvious.I'll start with the positives. The make up on Eddie Murphy to make Rasputia is fantastically realistic. It deserved the Academy Award it was up for. She's disgusting to look at, and many of the jokes catch you by surprise with shock value. A few of the crude jokes are too dumb not to laugh at (sounds weird I know), and occasionally this movie produces some laughs. The direction is bright and vibrant and looks pretty good.Now the negatives. The plot is horrible, and the romance between Norbit and Kate is cringe worthy. It's just an awful hollow romance. The laughs are there, but they are way too infrequent. Between each laugh is an awkward silence due to bad jokes, stupid acting and strange plotting. Worst of all, is the climax of the movie. This has to be one of the worst climaxes ever written. Let's just say it takes place in a church, and outside of the church, and it is so dumb, and unfunny it was painful to watch. The climax alone brings the already floundering film down a notch in my book.Overall, this is movie has some laughs, a heart near the right place, and some outstanding makeups effects, but with a script like this, almost nothing was salvaged.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for language and crude/sexual humor.",

Yet, there are some entertaining moments in this film, moments of such wild hilarity that make you wonder what could have happened if they had taken more time to work on a decent script.I have to admit that I didn't feel like walking out of the theatre, a feeling that kept recurring in the overlong musical that has been lauded by the critics but that kept on dragging forever.The \"Raging Waters\" scenes are hilarious, and the wedding scene is funnier than most of the movie.

Some of the most egregiously awful jokes fail so badly the first time (broken bed sex, Rasputia crammed into her compact car) that they're brought back for encores.

It's just too bad that this time the result is far from funny, in fact it is down right mind numbing. I can't believe how bad this film actually is. I did hear all the negative response but chalked it up to another dumb comedy that I could find somewhat funny. Boy, was I wrong.Aside from the make-up, which earned an Oscar nomination, Norbit is a car wreck from start to finish. Murphy is grabbing at straws with his characters here, especially in Rasputia, who is a foul mouth, overweight bi-yatch who talks down to Norbit every chance she gets. This character is basically a female bizarro counter-part to Sherman Klump. Norbit himself is a mild mannered 'geek' who looks like he can break in half if the wind blew to hard. The rest of the supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr. in a role that is as memorable as what you had for breakfast 3 years ago. Terry Crews, who plays the same character he's played before and Thandie Newton as the clich\u00e9d, generic female character that we always see in these films.There are numerous fat jokes that aren't funny the first or one hundredth time you hear it. Murphy, who was once king of the box office and the biggest movie star to come out of SNL, has seemed to go backwards and if he continues this trend could end up on the next has-been reality celebrity show.Skip this yawn fest.

            "content": "I've certainly seen much, much worse comedies than \"Norbit\" in recent years, and I give the film points for containing a significantly lower quotient of crude jokes than I expected, but at the same time this is certainly no gem like \"Beverly Hills Cop\" or \"Coming to America.\" Eddie Murphy is certainly capable of much more, but at least \"Norbit\" is several notches above his latest clunkers like \"I Spy\" and \"Showtime.\" As you can probably tell, my feelings about the film are mixed. It is altogether decent and there were moments in the film that simply struck the comic bull's eye....but there were other moments that didn't even come close. I think the funniest character in the flick is Chinese owner of an orphanage (A.K.A. Norbit's foster father). The character is also played by Murphy and he steals the show in every scene. Sure, he's not much more than a walking Chinese stereotype, but for comedy sometimes you have to abandon political correctness. Still, Murphy's portrayal didn't feel in any way mean-spirited towards the Chinese people. Of course, I'm not Chinese, so maybe I'm not the best spokesperson. Unfortunately, his character receives the least screen time, out of the three he portrays. One of the film's flaws is the character of Norbit's obese girlfriend. In case some of you are wondering--yes, some of the best jokes were given away in the trailer. Besides, she's pretty much a one-joke character. The one joke? She's fat! OK, that's sort of funny, but what else am I supposed to laugh at? Not to mention her character is completely mean-spirited and not lovable, like Sherman Klump in \"The Nutty Professor.\" Another flaw? The supporting cast. Eddie Griffin, Katt Williams, Terry Crews and Marlon Wayans are all potentially funny people, but since they're all such in-your-face comic actors and given minimal screen time, they chew up the scenery at any chance they get. I didn't find the running gag of Griffin and Williams being retired pimps in any way funny. And this is yet another movie where we have black characters who speak like they only have a third-grade education. Sure, not all the black characters are portrayed that way. \"Norbit\" is far from a minstrel show, but I just wish there would be more black movies where the characters speak in correct English. I know plenty of black people who don't say \"Y'know wut I'm sayn\" in every sentence. I think what makes this film altogether watchable is that it does have heart, and I did feel for Norbit's love for Thandie Newton's character (it doesn't hurt that she's extremely gorgeous). Maybe if the film was given a sharper rewrite, it would've been a solid comedy. There were some terribly low-brow gags where I thought to myself, \"Is this even an attempt at comedy?\" There's one gag involving Norbit being forced to eat a turkey's behind. Not exactly vomit-inducing, but it's such a cheap joke it's almost pathetic.",

            "content": "It's going' down, well at least in theaters this weekend. In the comedy 'Norbit', Eddie Murphy is once again wearing a fat-suit, this time playing the over-sized, self-indulgent, fury-filled Rasputia. That is actually the only purpose of this film sadly; giving Murphy the excuse to parade around in a fat-suit for another go around. Other than that, 'Norbit' is pointless.For a film with the main character's name in the title, Norbit himself isn't all that interesting. Eddie Murphy fails to add any real liveliness or hilarity to him which is disappointing. From the half-baked lisp to the whiny persona created, he's almost a chore to watch. However, upon viewing the trailer we already know that his wife Rasputia, also played by Murphy, is the real star of the film. So how was she? Well, a little better than Norbit. A lot more fun to watch anyways. If this weren't a comedy though, it'd be almost impossible not to hate her completely. She's pretty much the ultimate bitch as she is overt aggression and extreme arrogance. The worst part about her is the catchphrase she coins and uses over and over in the film: \"How you doin'?\". It wasn't funny the first time it was said, and it wasn't funny any of the thirty-five times after.I must admit that even with the predictability in the usage of that line, there were a couple of things that did shock me a tad. The first being, Norbit and Rasputia have an old woman as a neighbor who owns a little pug named Lloyd. (No, that's not the shocking part.) There's an instance in the film where Norbit is thrown out of a window and is laying in the front yard. The pug who has been injured purposely by Rasputia and is now sporting one of those wheely-deals that help dogs legs heal goes over to Norbit and proceeds to lick his face. Norbit soon after asks Lloyd what is he going to do about Rasputia. Then it happens, Lloyd replies with, \"Kill the bitch.\" Totally out of left field there. Maybe it was some odd homage to 'Dr. Dolittle', I'm really not sure.The other notable shocker was the score of the film. Now this isn't something most people even going to pay attention to while watching a film, but I do. David Newman whose previous work includes the scores for 'Ice Age' and 'Serenity' is the guy who composed the music for 'Norbit'. I was so impressed with his work here, I ended up going to Borders after I left theater to buy the soundtrack that includes his compositions as well as the songs featured in the film. I have to say 'Norbit Sneaks Out' and 'Norbit and Kate' are the best.Another one of the very few highlights of 'Norbit' is the presence of Eddie Griffin and the performance he gives as the pimp Pope Sweet Jesus. Yes, you may be scratching your heads at the thought of such a character being mentioned as such. It's true though and the charisma Griffin has is what makes him a pleasure to watch. He's smooth, relaxed, & on point at all times while delivering his lines that are surprisingly not over the top in this otherwise showcase for jokes of that type.Those over the top jokes and gags are unfortunately what will be bringing all the people to the theaters this weekend as Rasputia crushes young Hannibal Lecter at the box office. Be warned, 'Norbit' may have the glasses and Mr. Nice Guy likeness, but he is no 'Nutty Professor' by any",

Norbit isn't going to lay this to rest, whilst he tries to survive life with Rasputia, and it looks like Deion also has something he would like to keep secret.Have you ever made a really big mistake? I know I just did after watching the movie. The trailer might be funny, because it is. Those are the only funny parts in the movie, except for some scenes. Sure, I chuckled here and there but this wasn't that funny of a movie.Come on. Here is Eddie Murphy and Thandie Newton, two really great actor and actress. What are they doing here?! It was a waste of talent. This movie plays like a movie for kids. It's gross, disheartening, mean spirited, offensive, and just plain unfunny.There are some good things though. The make up effects were terrific, although that doesn't make up how bad the movie is. Also, the cinematography was great, rare for a comedy movie. There are two types of movies in this: The first one is the clich\u00e9d romantic comedy, which I wish I could've seen more of and the other is the unfunny scenes with Rasputia.I would rather like to see a clich\u00e9d romantic comedy than any scenes with Rasputia in it. There are some scenes in the movie that has that, which I really like and wish could've had more of. This also could've been a great movie if it weren't have the Rasputia character in it. Oh well.

His true love, a veritable angel of a girl named Kate(Thandie Newton),then one day re-appears in his life, thus creating the predictable complications.Much was made over the ethnic stereotypes that are put on display here--besides the cartoonish,subject-of-jokes fat black lady that is Norbit's girlfriend/wife Rasputia--and there's certainly grounds to feel that Murphy and his brother(longtime collaborator and former \"Chappelle Show\" partner-in-crime Charles Q.Murphy) conceived and co-wrote a fairly insulting,gleefully politically incorrect script and story here. Also,the way the story plays out suggests a script that could've used a some tightening. But there is JUST enough here to--at least in my humble opinion--be funny and entertaining. The supporting cast, save Eddie Griffin and KAtt Williams as well-meaning pimps(!),seem to be there mainly as foils or plot support. This is pretty much exclusively Eddie Murphy's movie(big surprise)and as such,his florid talent,added to the great make-up by BAker(as mentioned earlier),are pretty much the entirety of what holds this movie up.",

But this wasn't all funny - a few chuckles, if that.I find fault in the development and casting of the characters and script. I would have loved Eddie as Rasputa only. And then Rasputa should have had as a husband - someone else. Her brother should have been Kat Williams, and he should have had an hired entourage as his \"hit men\".Then there is Kate...well...another actress should have stepped in altogether, this was not the role for the lovely Thandie Newton. And Norbit...not Eddie Murphy - another comedic actor. Kate and Norbit needed that 'very cute' chemistry against Eddie's Rasputa who would have stole every scene. The funny thing is: I thought Cuba Gooding Jr. as the two timing player was the best casting out of the bunch.And the script...Rasputa could have been as scheming and dirty-dealing as anyone...and funny...even with the extra girth, this character did not have to be obnoxious to be noticed or funny.

It's nowhere near as funny as \"Nutty Professor,\" but doesn't really aspire to be, it seems. There's a quieter, less manic quality than in the 1996 blockbuster.Murphy, in real life a father of 10 who lost his father when he was eight years old and spent some time in foster care, is credited as the co-writer here. The script succeeds at times, but too much attention is devoted to fat-and-heavy jokes at Rasputia's expense, as well as bullying sketches involving her beefy older brothers. I did laugh at times (i.e., when Norbit dares not tell Rasputia she can't fit behind the driving wheel because she eats too much and allows that maybe the car has shrunk, and when the ticket guy at a water park -- \"just like an amusement park 'cept you don't have to get off the ride to go to the bathroom\" -- asks bikini-clad Rasputia whether she's \"wearing bottoms.\")I didn't mind this movie's fairy-tale ending that love conquers all. Yes, it does turn out that Norbit's lifelong love, Kate (Thandie Newton), was hoping he'd kiss her all along.No big surprises here, but sometimes that's OK.",

Jokes are awful and they rely solely on racism towards other cultures, body shaming and prejudices. I am pretty sure that would be hard to find a mainstream distributor that would buy it today. I am against to the politically correct and I appreciate edgy comedy, but it needs to be smartly done, this is just a lazy and uninspired script. I was not expecting for sure a groundbreaking movie, but not either a garbage like this one.I usually like Mr. Murphy and I genuinely think that he bringed a lot to comedies throughout decades, but this is just bad, and I don't understand how someone can find this funny in any way.

Eddie does work hard here, playing three separate roles in this broad romantic comedy that ineffectively tries to balance slapstick with genuine characters. Murphy plays Norbit, a small-town nerd trapped in a marriage to an overweight, overbearing shrew named Rasputia (also Murphy)whose unexpected reunion with his childhood sweetheart (Thandie Newton)who has moved back to town,[ thrusts him in the middle of a convoluted love triangle. Murphy is also unrecognizable as Mr.Wong,the owner of the orphanage where Norbit grew up. There are scattered laughs here and there, but the film does have problems like a really lame screenplay that could have used some tightening (the film is about 20 minutes too long) and the fact that the character of Rasputia has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and a good comic villain(ness)needs some element of sympathy and Rasputia has none. On the plus side, Murphy is adorable as Norbit, the sweetest character Murphy has done since Sherman Klump and Newton is a lovely leading lady. There are also a pair of scene stealing supporting turns from Eddie Griffin and Kat Williams as a pair of pimps turned rib shack owners and Cuba Gooding Jr. is seen to good advantage in his best role since winning an Oscar for JERRY MAGUIRE, but the story is so silly and the character of Rasputia is so repulsive that it's difficult to commit to the story, but Eddie definitely gets an \"A\" for effort.",

Norbit, the nerdy character, is married to Rasputia, the loud and large, uneducated black woman who runs Norbit ragged.

Her character is awful, over the top the whole time and not really providing anything to the viewer to find she succeeds as a character as.Eddie Murphy has tried one too many times to do this same character and I am sick of it. His career is about 55% now but it could get a lot lower if he still does this type of movie it will go below 5. I just hope he can make 1 or 2 good movies in the next couple of movies.Overall, this film is not really worth a watch, the film is quite boring and predictable and only funny a few times. I rate it 52%.Edit: 2008: Eddie has made a good movie in Meet Dave, he has successfully save his career for now, his next one does not sound to bad either, his career is now about 60%.",

She is not offensive she is meant to be funny. A NORMAL FAT WOMAN WOULD NEVER JUMP FROM RAGING WATERS ANDTRY TO KILL HERSELF. Therefore i think this movie is funny and thats how it should be taken.

Just plain ridiculous. The jokes...just weren't funny. I'm not saying that because I found them offensive, I'm saying that because they simply weren't funny AT ALL.

If you looked at the movie poster or watched the trailers you'd know that this movie is what it is. It certainly wasn't the best film, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I think the one stars people are throwing around are because they are easily offended people with thin skin who don't know what's beyond the city limits they live in.

Contains spoilers!: In case you can't recall (or haven't been an adult long enough), Eddie Murphy has made a career getting the most mileage from ethnic, fat, and and fart jokes. Why would anyone expect this movie be any different? Duly noted, \"Norbit\" will not win any academy awards this year, yet while inconceivably ridiculous at times, there are more than enough Kodak moments to keep everyone laughing their ass off! Here are key examples of Eddie Murphy's shameless forte: 1. When Rasputia rides down the water slide and breaks through the barrier to buttocks flop her big fat ass in the kiddie pool, just one Twinkie shy of crushing the little girl huddling terrorized in a fetal position nearby, the seamless transition to the Pug (dog) pedaling his hind quarters in a wheel chair is pure eloquence, effortlessly crossing the line between progressively crass hyperboles. Since you are still laughing at Rasputia's big ass splash, you can't help but laugh at the poor little dog too, even when you don't want to. The joke is on you!2. Eddie Murphy is the only African American I know of who can satirize oriental characters on point, which makes his obtuse theatre even funnier! Murphy's mannerisms are not one chin short of Charlie Chan! Even Pat Morita would be proud! The bottom line is that Eddie Murphy hasn't changed (and why should he?!), the times have. 20 years ago, everyone would have praised how outrageous this comedy is. Now, it is simply an outrage. So for all the overly sensitive, politically correct yin-yangs out there, always remember this - stereotypes and amusing taboos are funny because they demonstrate an ironic consistency about them that our farcical society fails to acknowledge! Since when is 350 lbs. of giggling cellulite not funny?! So as Rasputia would say, \"Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?!\" You go girl! It ain't over until the fat lady sings, and if you don't like it, you can kiss Eddie Murphy's black ass! And how you doin'?!",

            "content": "Eddie Murphy movies are an odd creature nowadays, while in the past his movies were funny, witty and inventive nowadays the term \"starring Eddie Murphy\" can mean one of two things, either Shrek god knows what number has just come out, or he's starring in another lame attempt at a comedy. However earlier this year Murphy dared to try something new, he starred in the brilliant Dreamgirls and against all the odds he ended up delivering one of the best performances in his entire career! Soon after came all of the award nominations including an Oscar nomination. Alas, he unfortunately was cruelly robbed of the award by Alan Arkin despite him being the front runner to get the award. After delivering one of his best performances he decides to undermine the whole thing with this movie. Norbit is a prime example of one of his lame attempts to create a comedy. Its basically putting Murphy back at what he does best, multiple roles and of course wearing fat suits. A shame then that this movie never feels anymore than a half hearted attempt at laughing at fat people. The movie unfortunately is a one joke wonder, and that joke is that all fat people are disgusting. So we get inevitable jokes about Rasputia (Eddie Murphy in a fat suit) not being able to see her swimsuit as she's so fat, about her getting stuck in a turnstile, her getting stuck in her car, her farting as much as possible, her washing a car in slow motion to \"Dontcha\". While some of these fat jokes work occasionally, the rest actually feel kind of cruel. In fact this movie sort of feels like your a school bully pointing and laughing at the fat kid. The prime example of this is when Rasputia gets stuck in the turnstile, I couldn't find that scene fun. Sure she's a heartless cow, but I felt more sorry for her than anything else during that scene. A shame the movies so one dimensional that it clearly wasn't trying to get that reaction from the audience.So lets get through the positives of Norbit first. Well admittedly the movie does deliver a few half decent laughs, and if I'm honest at times this is quite a entertaining movie. The scene at the water park where Rasputia literally crushes a child when landing on her is quite funny, the bathing suit joke is also quite funny. The movie also at times gets a great dark streak such as where Rasputia run over the dog of a neighbour she dislikes. Its a dark scene and a moments where my jaw hit the floor, its just so nasty its unexpected, but its also quite funny. To say Eddie Murphy as well is not entertaining at all would be a complete line. If Murphy does anything good its doing his fast talk in a fat suit. And with Rasputia he manages to pull that off almost perfectly. The character of Rasputia isn't brilliant, but she's bearable and quite amusing at times. Murphy gives his all in that role, and also does quite a good, if slightly racist performance, as Mr Wong. Unfortunately I was very against the role of Mr Wong due to the racism in his scenes.So where does Norbit go wrong? Well while the jokes manage to be alright, the main romance and actual storyline is as dull as hell. Whenever Rasputia is off screen you really could not give a damn about the rest of the movie. Matters are not even remotely helped by the fact that Norbit is an extremely boring and irritating character. His relationship with Thandie Newton's Kate is just boring. It tries to aim at touching but it seems so unrealistic and forced it feels more ludicrous than touching. The movies biggest mistake is when it decides to focus purely on their relationship with Rasputia popping in for brief periods of times. This is the middle section, and the movie is dragged down to almost rock bottom. The middle section is dangerously boring, its in that moment my eyes wandered from the screen on many occasions. Thankfully the story picks up slightly before the end, but the movie had already bored me long before the ending.The supporting cast of the movie cannot help matters either, Thandie Newton is pretty bland. A shame as she's by no means a bad actress and I think with a better script and perhaps a role that demanded more than existing she might have done well. However she has nothing to work with and seems more bored by the whole thing. Cuba Gooding Jr does what he always does, a bland and attempts to be funny performance that just goes alongside his other hideously bad recent performances. The three brothers of Rasputia are all as bad as each other, they're meant to be the main villains, yet they're just too forgettable. In fact if you take out Eddie Murphy as Rasputia this movie suffers terribly, if Murphy hadn't have played her this movie might have even struggled a bottom rating, with her the movie does sort of redeem itself.Overall Norbit is an occasionally fun, but all too boring and forgettable experience. Eddie Murphy does a good performance as Rasputia, but the rest of the cast are floundering around him. It could have been a movie to rival The Nutty Professor, but a half hearted script and an extremely dull romance make the movie just another cheap attempt at a comedy. Do yourself a favour go see Hot Fuzz if you want a laugh, this offers all too few.",

Poor Norbit meets Rasputia who protects Norbit from his bullies with her use of force. Norbit ends up marrying mean Rasputia who becomes more meaner and a lot heavier in time... Then suddenly Kate returns to town... But how geeky Norbit could get rid of a tyrannic wife? The film is partly funny, Eddie Murphy is in his own field but the jokes are old and sometimes the film-makers jump over the shark way too far. After an hour Rasputia becomes so irritable that I was considering to quit watching the film. The angry big black woman thing has it own funny features but when it continues to roll with very poor story it is excruciating to watch. Eddie Murphy is a funny comedian but it is sad to see that his star is starting to fade. He should get more roles like Jimmy Thunder in \"Dreamgirls\".

Don't get this if you want comedy, but if you want a bad movie, this is for you!",

It's about power of love and what love makes with you. And for that it's very important for it to has a happy ending. Some people would say it's very offensive, racist, a crap. Some other guys will say it has funny moments and is worth watching (but with your heart, not with your moral, censor brain - that's from me). And I'm now saying this one is of greatest kind of comedies where besides the splendid funny, entertainment part, there is a real love story. An inspiring one. You need no relaxation techniques or meditation, but just this movie to feel how much love you have inside. Thank you so so much, Eddie. You're the man that I'm in love tonight.",

Every year they bring out a movie that could've easily fit in the summer scene but the studios knew that the movie wasn't all that great. Last year was \"The Pink Panther\", this year it's \"Norbit\". What amazes me about this film is that it actually does have some very funny moments, most not shown in the trailer. The problem with this film is that it is clich\u00e9 and the realistic sense that this story could actually happen is not very strong.Regardless of all the flaws this film has, this is so far the best comedy out since \"Night at the Muesuem\". Of course, \"Norbit\" comes no where NEAR \"Night\", but that doesn't mean you're gonna see this movie with no one single laugh. Remember that this Oscar season, and you're lucky to any decent comedies out this time of year. What would've been funny is how this movie would've been blasted out of the waters had it comes out in the middle of July, trying to compete with the blockbusters. Instead, it's biggest competition is \"Hannibla Rising\". My suggestion, skip the never ending horror movies being made and try to laugh for a bit.",

But these elitist reviewers have not taken into account that many people are tired of all the senseless violence, bloodshed, car chases, political statements, drug use, homosexuality and complete negativity that Hollywood movies all seem to promote these days. While Norbit is a very flawed film and one that has juvenile fat jokes, racial stereotypes, cock-eyed characters, and scenes that we've all seen too many times before in Murphy movies..it is harmless and it is funny. And for once, I didn't get sick from all the bloodshed or angry with our political leaders or our capitalistic society. Not all movies have to make a statement or put you on the edge of your seat. There are times when you just want to have a few laughs..even if that means laughing at Blacks, Chinese, fat people, pimps, or anybody else that YOU would say it's NOT correct to laugh at.SO I applaud Eddie Murphy and his attempt at low based slapstick entertainment. He's a well needed break from the current crop of Hollywood \"geniuses\" like Mel Gibson and Michael Moore.",

Yes, there have been some strange movie choices by the man in recent years. But you should bear in mind, that many of the recent roles, have been targeted at a family audience.So the wise cracking, foul language spewing - Eddie from RAW, Delirious, 48 hours, Trading Places and Beverly Hills cop cannot surface. In effect, the humour, then has to be diluted, but I think that Norbit still packs more laughs, than most movies.I was actually laughing out loud for most of the movie and so were many others in the theatre. Before the PC brigade starts asking, which parts I laughed at, it was not at Rasputia's appearance.With many of Eddie's films, the humour is not in the physical appearance of the characters (although people assume that's the funny part), its more the delivery, wording and responses of the characters, that make the funniest moments.I agree that Rasputia's catchphrase of 'how you doing' was not funny, thats why i rated it as just a 9, but don't let the negative comments, about obese humour, put you off the film. It is actually Rasputia's character that does the majority of the bullying.Everyone and everything in the film, is made fun of from: pug dogs, old Mr Wong, pimps, geeks, skinny people, large people, even turkeys! So enjoy the film for what it is - a Comedy. It is not a conspiracy to attack the obese, it attacks the appearance and traits of everybody, so deal with it.Instead of the focus on one subject, people should ask themselves one question? how many people have I made fun of today for whatever reason? (I have yet to meet a person, who has never, ever made fun of anyone!)To all Eddie Murphy fans, this is the funniest movie, since Life was released.To all the Eddie haters - go watch something which shows REAL problems e.g a news channel!",

I love the fact that Eddie has wonderfully creative eyes and expresses his deepest emotions thru them. Like the eyes are the windows to the soul, his are so expressive and he really is an incredibly sensitive man. We loved him in Daddy Daycare, Dreamgirls, Nutty Professor when he was on Saturday Night Live, I know I am straying here from this particular movie, we loved the rest of the cast as well BRAVO!! The chemistry of the other fellow actors was what made the success of this movie. We especially liked his female counterpart the child playmate he fell in love with and Terry Crews is one of our favorites we loved him in White Chicks, he is fantastic!

Norbit takes the idea behind The Nutty Professor 2 - that Eddie Murphy can play just about every character in the movie - and strips it of all charm and humor. This movie belongs to the much-loved sub-genre of comedies called \"unfunny.\" It's crass, cruel, and borderline offensive, but the laughs that could redeem all of that are missing. Material as bad as the tripe that comprises Norbit can be endured only if there's a payoff. In this case, the point seems to be that some actors will do anything for a buck. Murphy doesn't do any acting in Norbit. This is all shtick - the kind of stuff that might work in a five-minute skit on Saturday Night Live. Norbit is a supersized version of Steve Urkel. Norbit operates on the principle that vulgarity is automatically funny. Crassness doesn't need a joke attached because it is (in and of itself) the height of hilarity.",

He's a brilliant actor.And maybe he was picked on by some terrible, controlling, domineering, bossy-ass black woman when he was a kid. Who knows? Fat black women aren't all crazy and violent like Rasputia but I doubt that there's a shortage of them. Eddy is taking a jab at them. Maybe it's revenge. Maybe it's social commentary.Eddy Griffin was perfect in this film as Pope Sweet Jesus. He moved well and he was funny.I first saw Terry Crews in \"Balls Of Fury\" and I thought he was brilliant. He's all over the place now but he plays a great comic bully.Is it a racist film if you're criticizing your own race? Doesn't that come under \"social commentary\"? What I liked about this film is that it was \"good\" v. \"evil\" not black v. white. I like to see Mr. Wong, a Chinese guy, liking these black people and not liking those black people. It takes race out of the picture and makes it about what kind of a person you are. We don't hate Rasputia because she's fat, we hate her because she's detestable and violent.I don't know where EM gets all his energy but his characterization of Norbit was great, the voice was excellent. Mr. Wong as the Chinese guy who doesn't like black people and is defending black people from black people is nicely done down to his excess nosehair. Rasputia was nasty and horribly true to life.The funniest line in the film for me was when Rasputia ripped one out and said \"Twins!\" with an almost straight face. This is a funny, cute film and it rises above racism and showcases Eddy Murphy's huge talent and energy.What is it about Saturday Night Live that it produced so many stars who basically make comic morality plays? Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, David Spade, Chris Farley, Belushi and Akroyd and Eddy Murphy all make comic parables with an edge.Good for them.",

Pirates of the Caribbean, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are the most obvious examples, but Eddie Murphy's latest entry into the self-loathing minstrel show genre, Norbit is little more than a product itself.Norbit tells the story of the eponymous slightly mentally challenged and speech impediment afflicted young orphan who is put through the ringer by his Wife of Bath-esquire bride (both played by Murphy) and her criminally inclined family (not played by Murphy). Norbit seems content with this life until his childhood sweetheart (the unfortunately cast Thandie Newton in a role that should have been played by Murphy too) turns up on the scene. From there, the film spirals into an anti-romantic comedy with Norbit's wife Rasputia trying to kill Norbit and his chances at happiness.There is a lot going on in Norbit. It's an angrier movie than Murphy has made in years. There is a great deal of anguish, deep seeded self loathing, racial self hatred and disgust boiling just below the surface at any given moment. Beyond the obvious ego-tripping (at the gates of dawn) of Murphy, playing 3 of the principal characters there is something more to it. Under the pretense of playing multiple characters Murphy has rough sex with himself, slaps himself around, tells himself he is worthless, calls himself \"hideous\" and tries to kill himself.Then there is the fact that this film, like Martin Lawrence's Big Momma's House and the \"Madea\" franchise of allegedly uplifting and positive plays/movies/reinforcements of reductive stereotypes, is predicated upon the Aunt Jemima image of a black slave woman. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but I find the whole minstrel show, black face motif to be unnerving to say the least.But then, maybe I'm not smart enough for this movie.There are things going on, hatred of the dark skinned characters, who are almost universally villainous, while expounding upon the inherent goodness of the lighter skinned characters. Murphy's bizarre (though admittedly often hilarious) turn as an Asian American that lead to much deeper insight into race relations than Crash ever could. Maybe Spike Lee should write a book on this film.The movie itself is messy. Plot lines go nowhere; characters enter and exit for no reason, endless strings of tired, racist stereotypes that are repeated as straight forward jokes. That said, the effects work by Rick Baker is Oscar worthy, the direction is adequate bringing a little grace to the proceedings and the music is quiet good. None of that can save this film however.There are only 2 reasons to see this movie.A: If you are a sociology major looking into the troubles of modern day African Americans adapting to a world run by white men.B: If you are as big a fan of make up effects as is humanly possible.Also, the Asian grandfather character is pretty funny, even if he does rank higher than Amos & Andy levels on the bigotry scale\u0085Chinese exclusion act, wha?

I think is getting harder to make comedies these days, because most of the really good stuff has been used.Granted, there a few moments in which the movie is funny, but they are far off and not very frequent. Most of the time, the movie recycles the running gag that there's a morbidly obese woman who happens to be need of some heavy anger management. Fat jokes may be funny, but not if you use it so much that it makes me want to scream out loud for a new joke(people in the theater started to stare at me after I did this).The story is probably what you expect of a comedy these days. Little skinny guy with no backbone marries massive angry blob thats supposed to be a woman. But wait, skinny guy's old friend comes back to town, and he realizes he loves her more than his wife with folds! Thats about it. The plot is the average \"guys gets girl\" with a twist from a fat lady. There's even a \"I'll pretend to hate you so you will leave me alone and not get hurt\" part. In the movie's defense, a comedy is more about wild laughter than a epic story, so I'll stop pushing it.Some of the acting really started to eat away at my patience in this flick. The way Norbit talks makes me want to punch him, it's that annoying. I don't know how Eddie Murphey could act like that. I also can't grasp why Cuba Gooding Jr. was part of the movie too. The rest is as bloated and lifeless as a fat woman's many folds.Norbit is a movie where some will like it, but others will quickly grow bored or it.

You are, and you, oh and you too. So quite complaining and enjoy the comedy. People these days are either too serious or not serious enough. In this case lots of people aren't being serious enough.

            "content": "Mick LaSalle, of the SF Chronicle, said this about the movie: 'The Motion Picture Academy only seems to notice comedians when they turn somber, but if Eddie Murphy wins an Oscar for \"Dreamgirls,\" it might really be in response to his tour de force here, in which he plays three distinct characters, including an elderly Asian man and a 300-pound woman.' This was enough to convince me that the movie might be a fun flick to catch on a matin\u00e9e. Tour de force? That sounded good.About halfway through the movie, I found myself change from hopefully amused to bored. Some people left. I heard audible groans. People laughed as well, but it was sparse and there were long stretches of silence.It wasn't a tour de force. Norbit, the main character, wasn't interesting and verged on idiotic (when he is to go on a date on 'tuesday' he does nothing all week but repeat the word tuesday over and over -- not like a nerd but like a retard). The elderly Asian man was amusing, but the movie didn't spend most of the time on him. It spent most of the time on Rasputina, who was just not funny, not written or acted or filmed well.The story had one of the worst and most formulaic endings in Hollywood, a wedding between two people who are not right for each other, being interrupted by the lead after a small adventure, with the help of his friends. People were twisting in their seats as Thandi and Eddie moaned on about how they really loved each other.OK this isn't worth a big comment i saw a movie afterwards to wipe it from my mind.rasputina does slapstick things for no reason. norbit comes to visit her at the construction site, and there she is, getting wet and washing a car with her breasts. why? - the 'passionate' sex scenes had rasputina jump on norbit, break the bed, and just lay on him, unmoving, like a dead animal. why? it's not passionate when you just lay there. it wasn't funny, it was just an excuse for a fat woman to fall on a skinny man.rasputina runs over a dog at one point in the story. why? 'why did she do that?' asked the woman next to me. just cause.rasputina was like one of those really irritating large black women it parodies, except wrapped up in padding and plastic. her moves were awkward and when she spoke often it seemed like she was just mumbling. it was a weak personality parody, so they covered it up with tons of fat jokes.when the thandi's wedding was interrupted, she just smiles, watching on the side while people start dancing and fooling around. then she starts dancing. her wedding was interrupted? doesn't anything mean anything in the film? - How did norbit's childhood black girlfriend turn into a mixed-race pointy-faced woman? Or is it a fantasy that little black girls grow up to to be white? the movie did go different places, just to catch the reactions of audience members. a fetish slave and abraham lincoln outfit? so to sum the story was formulaic, broken in half by bad acting, poor dialog and meaningless slapstick, and the only person who should receive the award is the guy who made the fat suit.",

It just is not the same when he's foiling himself. Too one-dimensional.Not to say the film had no funny spots. It did. But a day later I cannot remember one of them.

What makes it great is that is represents a mild backlash against all things PC and that HAS to be good news.In Britain, movie critic Johnathon-(Im so PC when I Wake in the morning I hear the windoze theme tune) Ross hated this movie with savage venom. He slammed it. That, in my book, makes the movie great. Anything that sets out to poke fun at the lefty, \"everyone's a poor victim\" mentality that sits on all of our heads nagging at our brains like a psychic and psychotic woodpecker, has got to be great.When the British Channel four version of Big Brother recently had a woman on it that took the michael out of a Pakistani woman's accent, they received 44,000 complaints. Yet I watched \"Training Day\" today and listened as a Denzel Washington's Character called his white buddy a \"nigger\" over and over again and I am willing to bet, not one complaint was ever lodged. Racism is wrong! Period. But, on the other hand, enforced sensitivity and double standards are wrong also and that is another thing that makes \"Norbit\" worth watching. It taps into all of the fake taboos and exposes them for the nonsense they are and rubs our faces in them.Johnathon Ross called the movie, \"misogynist.\" Presumably because a huge, ugly black woman (Murphy in costume) was portrayed abusing a male. From where I was sitting, that would be misandry in display, not misogyny and therein lies the rub. PC brainwashes people to the point where they can no longer see the truth because their thinking has been messed with by the lefty \"we hate everyone\" brigade.Watch it. You may not laugh but if you have any part of brain not fried yet in PC oil, you may also rethink a few things. If you find it \"offensive\" it is probably too late for you.",

It is horrendously unfunny and terribly boring, I believe that the rating for Norbit on here is generous. Adam Sandler followed in the footsteps of Murphy by playing 2 characters in Jack and Jill recently with as much success as Murphy as far as I can tell.

I thought \"man, that movie looks horrendously unfunny\". I was never the biggest Eddie Murphy fan. Not for any reason, I had just never been really exposed to his work growing up besides his films for kids like \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Dr. Dolittle,\" and \"Haunted Mansion\". Even as a kid, I didn't like or care for any of those movies. So naturally when I saw the previews back in 2007, I had zero interest in the movie on any level.I say the things above for a good reason. I have no inclination to give this movie a good review (or a better review) because I love Eddie Murphy or anything. It's an honest reaction to the film.This movie isn't very good. Nor is it particular funny or memorable in any way. HOWEVER, this film could have been an abomination of epic proportions. I was expecting it to be so much worse like Adam Sandler's \"Jack and Jill\" (Jack and Jill was released a few years after Norbit, but I have seen Jack And Jill and that's what I expected Norbit to be as I prepared to watch it).To sum up: Not very good. But not as atrocious or rotten as the majority of people say.",

This has been one of the worst comedy movies that I have ever seen. Go watch a romantic comedy, a frat pack movie, or even The Nutty Professor but I urge you to avoid seeing this movie at all costs. I understand that people may have different tastes but believe me; a 3.6/10 rating sounds too high for such lame film.I am happy to know that this movie was awarded several Golden Raspberry (Razzies) awards...If you still insist to watch this movie despite all the bad reviews and low ratings, then I recommend that you go and visit a doctor.",

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us.Especially our friend Marco. I really care about his opinion...a lot. His Sal Mineo eyes tell the truth about every movie. My wife hates him, but we don't even care! We ditched that dirty girl and make our own movies ;). Well enough about that.Consider Norbit Blitizen Blane! This moovie was aaaaawesome! Eddie Murphy is so funny, and he tells the truth about people of his own race.

I mean, I really didn't find this movie racist in the least and maybe I'm naive (but I doubt that's why) but i'm saying this as a young black woman nor did my mother who is a larger black women. She thought it was funny as well. I also can't believe that people are saying that this movie is playing to a double standard when actresses have done movies where they break out of that such as \"The Last Holiday\" where she and LL Cool J are interested in each other or in \"Phat Girls\" where Monique is chosen over a skinny women by an attractive male doctor. Ya, those movies weren't great in themselves but it shows that not all movies play off of this mentality. Also it is a good movie, it makes you laugh, it does its job because that's what comedy are supposed to do. You can't compare it to Dreamgirls, which was in a different genre, and Eddie Murphy plays a different character. That is the point of acting, to not bring the same character every time. If that's what actors did, would we see their movies?? I know for a fact that I wouldn't. So stop complaining, rent the movie and enjoy yourself... it's really not that hard.

Also sad to see a movie with quite good acting all and all not making it. Not sure how this movie got received in the US. But here in Sweden it left the big screen quite fast.

We admit as adults my wife and I where sold by the previews, it is our fault for not reviewing the statements or at the least checking the people who miss the mark the most, the critics, for once they got it right. Now that we saw it, we can only say there are other movies worth your time. Eddie is great playing multiple roles, just not as cleaver as when he created \"Coming to America\". We have seen these tricks before, we thought as an actor he did a great job pulling multiple historical Motown personalities into one role in Dream Girls. In this movie, we think he left most of his acting passion back on stage with the for mentioned movie. Why did Cuba Gooding Jr. get involved with this movie is beyond us, his rating also is effected by such poor role.All the best to you as you hunt for fulfilling entertainment, we where drained by this movie.

There's so much swearing/black stereotyping this movie might be good as as drinking game. Every time they swear, or pretend a black man can only be a pimp or loser, you drink. You'd need medical treatment 10 minutes in.If you've seen the previews, you've seen all the funny parts. The movie otherwise was one cringe after another. Ironically, the two pimps were the smartest and most clever of the entire stereotypically played people, which I found funny. Norbit isn't likable, neither is any of the other people, and even Thandie Newton is there obviously because she's bone skinny, although cute. Her character is so mind-numbingly stupid, missing the obvious setups, it's painful to watch.There are a lot of great actors in this movie, however the story is a poor combo of fat jokes, race jokes, stereotypes, and most of Eddie Murphy's jokes used in the 1990's that no star-power is bright enough to make it shine.",

The trailer on TV states/insinuates: he has found the woman of his dreams, but some monstrosity from his past is after him. The message seems to be that black men should run away and that he should get to know a slim woman denuded from her ethnic characteristics. This is not only a poor stereotype of women in general but a put down to characteristics of a particular race. And more gross is that the woman is played by Murphy himself. Norbit is free to get to know anyone he wishes to but as we all know, in our society we are judged by appearance and people are interested in keeping up with the Joneses. Are the movie makers saying that Norbits of the world should only get to know slim attractive de ethnized women and other who might like to get to know him are stalkers, obese women with crushes? Someone is thin compared to someone else. Someone is fat compared to someone else. There are obese women who need to change their life styles. There are geeky men who needs to change their life style. Yet what is wrong getting to know someone who is different? The message of the movie seemed to be that geeky men should not get attention from plus sized women. And that Norbits of the world could not speak up. This could be the writer's personal experience but, it is OK for a nerdy guy to want a slim model, but a nerdy girl should not dream of a body builder? Is Cigar just a Cigar? but this movie did not turn like Big Momma's House or Medea. (There is a difference, watch all three and see)",

However, not knowing what to do nor where to go last Friday night I joined my friends to go to c this film....This film is by far the greatest crap i've seen in my entire life, it was even worse than I've expected. Honestly, I hardly laughed (smile would be more appropriate expression) any more than 2 seconds during the whole film.It's not that Eddie Murphy's acting was bad, not at all, but the plot is so dull and boring I still cannot believe it. It's all about stereotypes and jokes about fat people (btw i'm not fat, 1.83m male, 76kg). My suggestion: pls don't go to c this movie, better donate the amount of the ticket to the weight-watchers.",

Rasputia and her brothers are terrible people and the town they live in apparently has no police department or Humane Society to protect animals. A man gets punched in the face (in church, no less); Rasputia runs down a neighbor's dog with her car; She threatens to throw acid in Kate's face should Norbit ever see or even think about Kate. Rasputia's brothers are small-time thugs who assault and terrorize local business owners; Rasputia damages property at the water park (she breaks the turnstile after literally squeezing her way into the park. She also disregards the weight limitation on the water slide. She also hurts children. The the list goes on. There are absolutely no consequences to be seen for any of these characters' actions.",

It started off pretty good, it was cut and funny, but then as time progressed, it got boring and sad. I threatened getting up and walking out because it was just so dang pointless. Another thing is that there are many clich\u00e9s used, you know what's going to happen. I mean it's kinda like the Nutty Professor in a way. This was a poor attempt at a comedy.",

Stupid catch phrase said a million times by his fat stalker wife. \"how u doin\" no!! sorry. I like Eddie Murphy like in nutty professor, his classic \"coming to America\", etc but he falls waaaayyyy short in this one. He probably was tired of making good movies so he made this one. This movie was not horrible to watch so I'm giving it two stars but in no ways is it enjoyable one of the worst movies I've seen. I would even say Night At The Museum was two times better than this and that movie was horrible. Good actors in terrible movies. Rather crude too and the crudeness is not even funny like in \"Scary Movie\". Marlon Wayons was in the movie also who played a perverted tap dancer. My advice is save your money and time and do not watch this movie. An hour+ wasted on a garbage movie!",

Honestly, I have to run out of that auditorium and watch another film that was good, because I couldn't take it anymore. When it came to DVD, and guess what? Yep, I have tortured myself through this abomination against humanity! I mean, it... was....... so........flipping....... AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just go back in time and tell EM (Eddie Murphy) not to release this piece of ungodly garbage or better yet, burn it from existence! Because he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar by his very great performance in Dreamgirls, but blew his chances because of this foul mess of a film! Do not recommend this film at all!",

The very sight of Eddie Murphy simultaneously in drag and a fat suit is supposed to cause viewers to explode into paroxysms of laughter, and is topped only by his appearance in yellow-face as old Mr. Wong. Some of the most egregiously awful jokes fail so badly the first time (broken bed sex, Rasputia crammed into her compact car) that they're brought back for encores. In one way, it's surprising that the movie is so consistently unfunny. This is a movie that even Murphy's most die hard fans should avoid, for others a root canal would be a funnier time spent.

This movie belongs to the much-loved sub-genre of comedies called \"unfunny.\" It's crass, cruel, and borderline offensive, but the laughs that could redeem all of that are missing. Material as bad as the tripe that comprises Norbit can be endured only if there's a payoff. In this case, the point seems to be that some actors will do anything for a buck. Murphy doesn't do any acting in Norbit. This is all shtick - the kind of stuff that might work in a five-minute skit on Saturday Night Live. Norbit is a supersized version of Steve Urkel.  Norbit operates on the principle that vulgarity is automatically funny. Crassness doesn't need a joke attached because it is (in and of itself) the height of hilarity.

A legitimate guilty pleasure. One of those types of guilty pleasures that has a lower score than 5.0 on IMDb. I laughed my ass off throughout, the artificial obesity created for Eddie Murphy when pretending to be a fatass woman is quite convincing and much like in Coming to America the filmmakers do a good job of doing the Back to the Future II thing where the same actor plays two characters in the same scene without having to focus the camera on one person at a time and then editing them together. I really believed that a fat woman jumped on her husband to have sex. No sarcasm, there. It doesn't look like awkward green screen. While it is forgettable and occasionally racist, I still think that Norbit will be seen in a more positive light by fans of Eddie Murphy. This may very well be one of the guiltiest pleasures I have had the guilt of being pleasured by...why did that sound a lot funnier in my head than when I actually typed that in?",

The whole film is basically her eating, harassing him, and acting extremely stupid. Somewhere in here, Norbit and his childhood friend try to save the orphanage they grew up in from Terry Crews and his muscle displaying henchmen.\nNorbit is an awful film, and just by its first word, it's bad, because I noticed Eddie's \"nerdy\" voice and hell was unleashed. His new wife is extremely unfunny, as well as all the jokes. Norbit is also extremely boring because its plotline is practically nothing except a \"We've got to save the ___\" clich\u00e9 in a ton of movies.

He's probably the most uninteresting of all since he's been treated like shit and controlled all his life by the people he knows since day one. The only thing I can feel for him is pity. Every other character might as well be either evil or stupid since this movie rarely has a good character or at least one that isn't bland.\n\nI feel dirty of watching this travesty and the film deserved those Golden Raspberry Awards for the things I've mentioned above..

Norbit was one of the top 3 worst films of 2007 along with Good Luck Chuck and Because I Said So. Norbit was the third worst film of 2007 right behind Good Luck Chuck. This is his second worst movie right behind A Thousand Words. Norbit was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The one positive thing I can say about this movie is that Thandie Newton looks absolutely beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, hot, and fine as hell in it and was in her prime.",

It shouldn't have. Say what you This cheerfully overinflated, cheekily offensive comedy will retain a permanent footnote in movie history as The Movie That Cost Eddie Murphy An Oscar (for his spectacular supporting turn in Dreamgirls). It shouldn't have. Say what you will about the movie itself, but you can't deny Murphy's astounding comedic skill in his multiple roles as the nerdy title character, the grotesquely huge woman he marries, and an elderly Asian man who runs the orphanage/ restaurant that Norbit spends his formative years in. (It's even more of a compliment to Murphy's prowess that it took me a solid ten minutes to realize that he was playing this role, too.) Of course, Murphy is aided immeasurably by the phenomenal makeup work of Rick Baker, who performed the same services for Murphy when he played the Klump family in the Nutty Professor pictures...and on a less flashy but equally enjoyable technical level, Clay Griffith's and Richard Greenfield's slightly romanticized small-town sets are a joy to look at. There are several good one-liners; the scene in which gargantuan Rasputia boards a water slide is an effective comic set piece, and the running gag involving her and a car horn killed me. Quite frankly, if you were bothered by the preview, then nothing short of a gun to your head or the kidnapping of your children should've gotten you into the theater, so you really have nothing to complain about. This doesn't mean, however, that Norbit DOESN'T have some substantial problems on a very basic thematic and storytelling level. The Nutty Professor's Sherman Klump, who was almost as exaggeratedly proportioned as Rasputia, was also an extremely kind and decent soul who was thoroughly deserving of a rewarding romantic relationship, and it's clear very early on that Norbit ISN'T going to take that route. (Sherman's closest female counterpart was Gwyneth Paltrow's sweet Rosemary in the Farrelly brothers' best film to date, the endearing Shallow Hal.) In order to sell Norbit's emotional affair with childhood friend Kate (Thandie Newton) the moviemakers have to give Rasputia a thoroughly repellent personality, and they do: she's repulsively bossy, dictatorial, hypocritical and unfaithful to her husband. That's not the problem, but the casting of the other woman is; I can't knock Newton's performance because she's perfectly charming in this role (and does a lot to counteract her unplayable shrew in The Pursuit of Happyness), but consciously or not, Norbit's makers hired an actress who's far skinnier than the norm, and in doing so propounded the thinking that fat women--who, along with blondes, are the last feasible targets of derisive jokes in these politically correct times--are unworthy of being loved. Hiring an actress with curves, such as Queen Latifah, Oprah Winfrey or even Murphy's Dreamgirls costar Jennifer Hudson as the romantic interest would have done a lot to erase this caveat, but the moviemakers' failure to do so indicates that Norbit's central flaw isn't its silliness or its grossness but its inability to think outside the box. Moviegoers who are legitimately bothered by this can at least take comfort in knowing that TV's Ugly Betty (both the character and the actress, America Ferrera) has rapidly become not only a national heroine but a role model...and can count down the time before the show's first-season DVD set comes out.",
