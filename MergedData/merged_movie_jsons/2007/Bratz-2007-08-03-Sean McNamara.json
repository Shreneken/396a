            "content": "Pretty much all the reviews were negative so I'm here to shed some light. This movie was made with a 9-12 year old girl audience in mind. Bratz dolls were my favourite when I was little so of course, I bought this movie when it came out. I re-watched it last summer. I still love it. It has the same kind of ridiculousness you'd find in Mean Girls. It's cheesy but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the tunes really catchy (It's All About Me being my favourite). Many people are complaining but so what if they're all conventionally pretty, and like make-up and clothes? This is just a cute movie about friendship and standing out and being yourself. How could there be anything wrong with that? I agree many parts were unrealistic (adult freshmen and the whole seating chart thing), but with a young audience in mind (and a nostalgic teen audience), this movie is pretty good. There's really nothing much that's problematic in it. It's already a lot more racially diverse than other teen movie casts.",

            "content": "Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.However, no such luck came my way on this night, and I was subjected to one of the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly-acted movies of the year.Or in ANY year, for that matter.\"Bratz, The Movie\" is supposedly based on those slutty-looking dolls with huge eyes, full lips and no noses; figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with an overinflated infatuation with clothes, shoes and make-up. Unfortunately, this movie is live action (but still concentrates on the whole \"appearance is the most important\" thing).And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good-looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions.As if any of this makes any difference, here's the basic plot outline: Four adolescent girls (all beautiful with perfect bodies), Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) enter high school. It's also needless to mention that none of these young women has even the most remote acting talents, whatsoever.In fact, I've seen better acting in a morgue. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of \"Bratz\" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt.But I digress ...Anyway, these four vapid souls enter Carrie A. Nation High School (which is more than appropriate since I wanted to take a hatchet to the projection room during this preview) and immediately clash with uptight beauty queen, Meredith (Chelsea Staub) and her group of \"Heathers\" wannabes.Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers). Why anyone accepts this pigeon-holing is beyond me, but wondering about this isn't worth the time it takes for a synapse to fire, so ...And while it's easy to see the above-mentioned no-names populating this production, it's quite disheartening to watch a veteran actor such as Jon Voight, who plays Meredith's father and school principal. He not only embarrasses himself in the movie, but has put a stamp of incompetence on what was once a stellar career.Oh, there's also a deaf kid, Dylan (Ian Nelson) who somehow has the power to hear Yasmin singing (oh, and he can spin turntables, as well).The picture's witless conclusion consists of a huge birthday bash for Meredith (see enters on an elephant) and a loud and irritating musical number (it's amazing what passes for entertainment in today's world).My little girls liked this film, but then again they are 3 and 7-years old. Unless you fit into this particular gender or age group - or are in a coma - you will see this entire enterprise as shallow as a saucer and empty-headed as Paris Hilton.Truly one of the worst movie-going experiences since \"Are We Done Yet?\"",

            "content": "Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?But for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.Maybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now. Brattitude!!",

            "content": "So, my friends and I were searching on demand forever and couldn't find anything to watch. I see this film on the list, no idea what this movie is, but knowing well of the dolls. Thought it might be an animated movie or something else to keep us entertained. So I say \"F*** it we're watching Bratz.\" and we did. It's a Saturday night and we are juniors in high school - our expectations aren't high.To start off, let me say that I know for a fact that this film was obviously in no way meant to be taken so seriously. I literally made this IMDb account just now simply to write this review for this movie. I see reviews of other members saying things like (a-hem), \"No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz.\", or \"If you really have to put \"OMG\" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career\", or even, \"It makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, \"boss\" figure that runs the whole school\"My God. You people need to relax.We were all laughing hysterically the entire duration of this movie. This is literally one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. But from the intentional overuse of predictable stereotypes of teen behavior/society in general, mixed with a good helping of clich\u00e9 'heartfelt' moments, we couldn't help from being amused.The budget was incredibly high. It is undeniably a very quality-made/high-end film (cinematography-wise). So in that sense its also pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Lot's to look at.In comparison to a movie like Clueless, of course this film doesn't compare. But it is completely different. This is a movie about BRATZ DOLLS we are talking about. Bratz. As in, the child's toy. Expecting a Bratz movie to accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have, is mad.However I do know that this is a film I will never forget.I will always have these fond memories of watching this astonishing film with my friends on a Saturday night. Being blown away by how outlandish it was, but enjoying it thoroughly as a fun movie night with friends.So let's chill out.",

The movie is based on the ugly dolls with the same name with perfect bodies and lots of money - only in the movie, the blond girl doesn't have any money at all. But don't worry, when she really needs it (for a dress), her friends have gift certificates.Sure enough, no one would like to see a movie with a bunch of fat teens running around acting silly but did the movie have to star four slender girls with attitude problems? Because let's face it, these girls think that appearance is the most important thing in the world. They're seriously not much better than their enemy - Meredith. And by the way - how did the word 'brat' become a positive word? For me it's still a very negative word meaning that your parents have spoiled you.Bratz doesn't want to give its core audience (small girls) a good message. It wants them to realize how important fashion and appearance is - and if you have an ugly outfit on - always make sure to keep a fashion emergency kit with you. Ugh.",

(Note to script writers: If you really have to put \"OMG\" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career) After this monstrosity finally ended, I looked to my friend and we looked to her sister, who then informed us that the movie was horrible.

The script is corny, the plot follows a clich\u00e9 formula which appeals to a very specific demographic (5-10 year old girls who play with Bratz dolls). The only redeeming factor in this movie, for me, is the soundtrack, which actually sold a few copies and received many good reviews in contrast to the movie, which was labelled instantly as a shocker.However, I find this movie so bad, the performances so cringe-worthy and the plot so overused that it is actually appealing. The director has directed episodes of a Disney shows like Phil of the Future, That's So Raven and Even Stevens, so it's clear that he is compotent. So bad that it's good.",

The film in itself is about 4 girls who are completely different however, they still have a close bond, but as they go through school they get split apart by the things they like and within two years, they've almost forgotten each other. They vow to change however it's difficult and that's all I'm really gonna say, it's pretty corny but it's not bad once every so often, eh?",

I don't understand why adults are watching this film and commenting badly on it. What were you expecting, an intriguing story, deep, heartfelt emotional scenes, from The Bratz movie??? Come on, you can't judge this like you would a movie for adults. So, for adults who have nothing better to do than watch children's movies and judge them as if they are Ebert, go get a life. For little preschoolers and elementary school girls, this movie rocks. I will give it 8 out of 10 stars. This movie encourages kids to step out and be themselves and to dress how they feel, regardless of what others say AND to set good examples for other people. So, all in all, I'd say this movie succeeded at what it intended to do, be enjoyable for little kids and promote a good message!!! Rock on, Bratz!!!",

As I said a million times, I was shocked, surprised, and flabbergasted by the negative reviews I would see on the web. I thought the film was an excellent comedy.I love the idea of friendship, though many people find it corny, and I love the idea that the girls Yasmin, Sasha, Chloe, and Jade face during their first year of high school. I have liked films and shows that are set in high school ever since I was in the 8th grade. I love it when Meredith shouts \"You Brats!!\" It's like the film's title would spring out of her mouth.

I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.First off...walking through the auditorium doors at any point during this \"movie\" is like being battered repeatedly about the head by a deranged thug wielding a piece of two-by-four. You can literally feel your conscious mind sagging in defeat as the dreadful mindlessness of it washes over you. It really is a palpable thing.At no point that I saw did any of the lead girls display anything remotely like acting ability. They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term \"wooden actor\" at least implies some ability, however dismal.All that this movie offers is the most pitifully superficial gratification for the absolute youngest girls. And all the movie seems to teach is that being superficial and shallow is the best way to \"get on\" in life.And what the heck is John Voight doing in here? At what point was he convinced that doing a teen movie based on a set of ugly, under-dressed and over made-up dolls was a good career move?

Oh, and I think there's some sort of moral thing in there somewhere about being true to yourself, and sticking with your friends. Whatever. On the surface this is entertaining enough - it's as loud and big-mouthed as the lairiest teen at the mall, as brightly coloured and saccharine as a tube of Smarties, and about as deep as a high-heel mark on a piece of tarmac...you see where I'm going with this? OK, but considering it's market aim, this is no bad thing really. On the surface it's entertaining. Sure. It makes sense. It's a 'surface' movie. It's not there to promote debate (all though the way people on the message boards were ranting you'd think it was in the same avant-garde league as Eraserhead!) it's simply there for muddle-headed tween girlies to vicariously live out their make-up smothered, high-heel wearing, uber-fashion ensemble touting fantasies without fear of reprisal. And the moral (however confused it might be) is at least in evidence, even if you do have to dig for it. The main problem I had with the movie was Yasmin's singing, which seemed to have been put through a coda so many times it came out sounding like a 40 year old doing Ashley Simpson at karaoke. Not great. Jade was a pretty poor actress, probably the worst of the bunch, the most sickening moment being her warbling 'Boo yah!' while carelessly slopping caustic chemicals into a beaker that sets off a mini firework display. Oh, yep, she's meant to be the smart one. Chloe was OK, as was Sasha, but the high-kickin' soccer moves and high-spinnin' cheerleader sequences were a bit cringey, especially when it became apparent that Sasha's stunt double was white (so white she glowed, actually). These rooky mistakes really spoilt the film, in my opinion, and without them I think this could've deserved a solid seven, based on its entertainment value.

I haven't cried for any reason since I was 12, and this movie brought me to tears. Not from laughter, not sadness... it was SO bad, I had no emotions that could be connected to this film, and I just started crying because nothing else quite fit. If these people tried to perform like this two thousand years ago, they would have been stoned to death. The acting was so terrible, I think I lost my faith in mankind. The materialism in this movie was so... I can't even think of an adequate adjective to describe it... No wonder there are countries that want to see our way of life crumble... after seeing this movie, I almost agree with them. The MST3K guys would be speechless, watching this. It's so awful, no one could possibly lampoon this movie. It's too terrible to properly mock and satirize. I feel really terrible for the companies that sponsored this. They really lost out on this investment. The attempts at throwing in messages about individualism and inner strength would have worked, if there hadn't been the \"be yourself, but dress fashionably to be accepted\" message splayed across this film like roadkill. It's a good thing I didn't have any forks, or acetylene torches nearby... or I would have tried to stab/burn my brain out.

However, today I'll be talking about their live action theatrical debut simply called Bratz. It's one of the lowest rated movies along with the Emoji movie (I don't hate that movie either) and for some reason I thought it was alright, nothing spectacular or extraordinary but it's fine.The movie starts with our quartet: Yasmin (Nathalie Ramos), Cloe (Skyler Shae), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Jade (Janel Parrish) going to college and being best friends forever! However, one person in particular Meredith (Chelsea Stubb) is a perfectionist daughter of the principal who wants to sort our main girls into clubs, thus separating them.But our main characters will still be together no matter what and that annoys the antagonist so much, that she will do anything to humiliate them.Well, the whole setting reminds me of Disney channel's High school musical, even the villain is too similar to Sharpay by being a spoiled rich girl with a puppy in her purse. However, the whole musical aspect happens in the end with the talent competition. The story is ok, but can be a little weird sometimes. Like in one scene the whole school makes a food fight simply because a puppy pulled Cloe's leg and she dropped her lunch on Jade and then the whole college throws food on each other with classical music on the background.Speaking of songs, they were pretty good, especially \"it's all about me\" and \"Brattiude\". Sure, they are not as good as songs in Bratz Babyz (these songs were awesome), but both singers and composers did try their best and are actually radio-worthy. The actresses were not that bad either, most of them are actually teenagers (with the exception of Skylar Shae, who played Cloe) and they act well. I also noticed that the movie talks about some issues like parental divorce, money issues, deaf students and the decision whether you should stick with your old friends or follow your passion. Sure, they are only briefly shown because of the fact that this is a movie for preteens, but the fact that it included such themes, makes this movie better than it should be. Of course, it's still has fashion and shopping moments like usually in Bratz movies, but it's not really the main focus and it still follows the plot about friendship.Overall, I would recommend this movie to girls of 8-12 years, high school musical fans and people who liked Bratz when they were younger. But it's not for Bratz haters, so if you are one, then it's better to skip this film.",

            "content": "Bratz, based off the wildly popular line of dolls, is actually a much more tolerable film than the one I was expecting to be greeted with. Rather than a shallow, frothy, candy-colored stroll through ditzy women, inappropriate fashion, and immature circumstances, I received a mildly-entertaining, high-energy romp filled with attractive leads, all of whom at least carry their part with some semblance of conviction, acceptable, if scatter-plotted themes and ideas, and a pleasantly fun diversion through the world that sort of mimics our reality but still finds itself wholly trapped in cinema's, family-friendly kind of reality.Make no mistake, Bratz isn't really a good film and it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend your daughters see. However, for a film that concerns three teen girls who are obsessed with fashion and self-expression, we could've been handed a much more harmful piece of cinema. Even as a male child, I always wondered why so much outrage and hate was directed at Barbie, who predicated herself off of being a good-natured sweetheart, was always the subject of vehement feminist controversy while the Bratz doll-line went under the radar, with their skimpy attire, makeup-heavy faces, and distracting artificiality. You want to talk about giving young girls the false sense of beauty and exercising the gender roles? The Bratz essentially were telling them not to leave the house without a tube-top, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.Bratz follows four lifelong best-friends - Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) - as they enter high school with an attitude to keep each other as close as possible. However, they are heavily burdened by the idea that the self-indulgent, wildly narcissistic class president Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Kane) wants to identify every student by what clique they should belong to, forcing nothing but social segregation in the already ominous halls of high school. Of course, Meredith finds the free-spirited girls disgusting and offsetting to her plan, but finds little to worry after two years of high school.Yes, by junior year, the lifelong friends have become nothing but faces in crowded hallways to each other, drifting towards their own sort of cliques, falling victim to Meredith's plan to keep all students part of their own little class of people. Cloe becomes invested in soccer, Sasha becomes a gifted and determined cheerleader, Jade embraces her inner-scientist with the chemistry club, and Yasmin sort of watches it all happen, while quietly participating in journalism. Yet the girls are brought together by four colossal, incredulous misunderstands at lunchtime, which reminds them that they have fallen prey to Meredith's system. Upon reuniting the group to prove that they can still be inseparable and devoted to each other, Meredith sets out to destroy the girls by recreating the party she threw for her sweet sixteen, making it even bigger and better, which she hopes will propel herself to the known voice of the school while the four girls wallow in their shame.I laud Bratz for at least doing what I never thought would be done in one of the most ostensibly shallow teen films of the last decade, which is etch some solid, vital commentary about high school into its material. While many films have addressed the abundance of cliques and groups in high school, Bratz recognizes the problem with it, which is that kids get the idea that they shouldn't be seen with kids of different cliques, which stunts their emotional and mental growth all the more. Yes, Bratz would be better if it didn't make the cliques so overblown and farcical that they tread the line of being part of a high school satire, but its acknowledgment of a real problem in a pleasantly real way is actually heartwarming to say the least.Then there's the abundance of singing, dancing, and just hanging out these girls do, which is surprisingly fun and enjoyable, given how shallow it sounds. These are teen girls being teen girls, minus the sarcastic and childish lingo utilized on contemporary kids shows like iCarly and Victorious, but also without the biting wit and commentary of something like Mean Girls, one of this particular's decades smartest teen films.Bratz essentially wants to be a flashier, more stylistically-potent Mean Girls, but its reliance on scenes that are too goofy and ridiculous to be taken seriously and its repetitive nature are what hinder it from living up to what it could be. The visuals are eye-popping, the music is catchy, if existing from the often forgettable subgenre of bubblegum pop that expires quickly, and the four leads are all charming with their smiley charisma and micro-mini fashionista sense, but the film simply has too much going on to really settle on a focus and it bogged down by scenes that are either not funny or heavy-handed in their moralizing. But the fact that there's moralizing in a film called Bratz, taken from the line of dolls that look the way they do, is surprising enough, giving the film much more leverage and likability than I could've ever imagined.Starring: Skyler Shaye, Nathalia Ramos, Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, and Chelsea Kane. Directed by: Sean McNamara.",

The movie is too fantastic for words.The cast is phenomenal. I would absolutely love to get a window into the personal lives of all of the female actresses; I wonder what techniques they used before each scene? I'm guessing Stanislavski's. How else could they be such excellent role models for young girls around the world? They are all at exciting points in their career right now. They are on the cusp of an astounding revolution. Their talent surpasses that of iconic actresses such as Bette Davis and Audrey Hepburn. Maybe even more talented than Hannah Montana! Their talent as young artists are immeasurable. It can't be measured even with an advanced measuring tool such as a protractor, or a ruler.Everyone who contributed to this masterpiece are all truly artists of our generation. It's times that this movie's fans mobilize to fight for the truth. I can't stand the Bratz bashing. This movie is brilliant.

In fact, I wonder how many of those reviews came from people that were a part of this movie; they almost would have to be to justify this trash.First off, how can I not be offended by the mariachi band in the Latina's kitchen? I've been Puerto Rican all my life and never once have I been that offensively clich\u00e9, but maybe it's just me? The acting was not award winning but the girls otherwise did alright...except for when they had to show any ~real~ emotion other than thoughtless glee; then, they failed. Miserably. The montages got old quickly and the singing, oy...It will be a long time before I wash the taste of this out of my mouth. One thing people should understand is High School is ~not~ like this. It's hard, shallow, and harsh indeed, but people simply don't go around like bubble-headed retards abbreviating half of their sentences. Real High School issues revolve around violence, sexual identity issues, peer pressure, not having a CLUE what you're going to do when you get out, etc., etc. If only H.S. were as easy to cope with as this movie made it same; if only all anyone had to worry about were shallow obnoxious girls.

            "content": "It's been a weird day. My air conditioner went belly up and I sought refuge from the 100+ degree heat at my local mega-multi-plex, buying a ticket to the \"Bourne movie\". After 20 minutes of that movie's self-conscious unsteady-cam filming technique I was feeling a little queasy and bailed. Stopping at \"Bratz\" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.I couldn't find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls (the dolls are all a lot cuter). What strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. The inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video. As already pointed out this is \"the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly- acted movie of this year\", or maybe any year. It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up. They must be serious girly-girls, your soccer and softball playing daughters won't find anything to relate to here. But I'm not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. It revolves around four multi-ethnic BFF teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. Now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. Which is what you expect from the standard pre-sold teen movie. But instead Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. For a while I thought I was watching an episode of \"Animal Planet\". Meredith (Chelsea Staub) was a pleasant exception in this school's bovine to canine parade.They look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? Of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. Which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. The producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make- up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress.Speaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, Jon Voight plays Meredith's father and the school principal. Now I realize that the highlight of Voight's recent career is a \"Seinfeld\" cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of Bela Lugosi working with Ed Wood in the 1950's to support his drug habit.The movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which I suspect was inspired by the success of \"High School Musical\". Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

I am a mother; and let me tell you if I was as straight laced as the mother of (I think her name was) Jade, then I would NOT smile and laugh as a 2 year deception of my daughter dressing like a tart the minute she reached school was revealed to me in an auditorium full of hundreds of people. Grounding until she died and then grounding of her ghost would be more my style.I have to say with hindsight it was so bad it was good if you see what I mean; I laughed most of the way through it - even at bits I don't think I was meant to. The emergency make up and sewing kits, not to mention the baking bit was a scream and I laughed hysterically. They had dress making skills that the likes of Vera Wang would kill for, make up skills that would win them an Oscar (and the only way they're ever likely to see one in this lifetime) and finally cooking skills that would make Gordon Ramsey weep (though I doubt it would be with pride).The overall message ( if there was one, and I'm clutching at straws here to ensure I haven't wasted 2 hours of my life that I won't get back) is that you should stay true to your real friends and not any cliques (although in the end they became their own 'bratz' clique surely?) Still its over - I came out alive and with my brain (relatively) intact, and the sure and certain knowledge that 'bimbo' is a word the four girls playing the main roles should really get used to hearing (particularly after watching an interview with the four 'actresses' - trust me, they were NOT acting in the movie!)

Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough. It had a very simple story that wasn't even told very well and I only understood it by reading it on paper not on screenplay. It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her. Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan. The movie was quite bad throughout but the ending was good & saved it and that's why I'm giving it a 2 out of 10. I can't say that it is the worst movie ever because no film can be worse than Pulp Fiction and Jackass part 1 & 2. The food fight scene was creative at start then was very funny. Most users either gave it a 1 or 9 out of 10, which means that you can either really hate it or love it but 10/10 means perfect, which definitely isn't. Overall I didn't like the film but I absolutely did not hate it as well because it did not bore me to death and I have seen much worse films.",

On top of that, some parents decided to tag along because of the perception that is was good for the entire family... They couldn't have been more WRONG, because it seemed like a dumbed-down version of 'The O-C', written in a day care center. On top of that, girls who DO watch this film will be(or have been) convinced that they must be hip and cool to survive. In its time, the Bratz enterprise has killed more brain cells than a MILLION Coca-Colas. And there's NO upside to this film!

            "content": "Why would a 49 year-old guy watch \"Bratz\"? Well, he could be a totally sick freak (I swear, I am not...though that's what freaks would say also...but I am not!!). But in my case (again, I swear) it's because I have a goal of seeing as many horrible films as possible before I die. I am not talking about run of the mill bad--those films I avoid. I am talking about really, really, REALLY bad movies. So, after seeing all 50 of the films on Harry Medved's amazing book \"The 50 Worst Films of All Time\", I needed a new challenge--IMDb's Bottom 100 list. While I have made a very impressive dent on this list, some films (such as the Turkish ones) are just about impossible to find with subtitles or dubbing AND they keep adding films all the time to the list (such as \"Bratz\" which only recently entered the list despite being released in 2007).I should point out that technically, \"Bratz\" is not a bad film in the traditional sense. The cinematography, sets, costumes (the the girls wear thousands each) and music are all very professional--so I think a score of 1 is unmerited--even if it IS a vacuous film. When I say vacuous, I mean that it is written with no subtlety and is designed for incredibly stupid kids in the 10-14 age bracket. Now if you have a valueless, undemanding and rather clueless kid in this age group and you like them to be this way, then perhaps it IS a film to rent or even buy. After all, while very, very stupid, the film is squeaky clean--as the corporate types behind this mega-marketed film know this would make the film non-threatening and acceptable viewing for this age group.So why is the writing so bad? Wow...this is like shooting fish in a barrel! The characters are all completely one-dimensional and more caricatures than something written by a professional screenwriter. The nasty girl at school is 0% real--but so are the four 'Bratz'. These girls are all PERFECT and represent carefully coiffed images--sort of like junior Spice Girls. One is great at math and science....and hot. One is great at music....and hot. One is brilliant....and hot. And the other is great at sports...and hot. This film is about their fabulous adventures in high school*.Now I must interject something that really bothered me about this film. As I mentioned above, this is just a corporate attempt to further whore off the Bratz name. The Bratz dolls are marketed to young kids--very young kids. And, in a completely cynical attempt to be BOTH non-threatening and pretending to be inclusive, three of the Bratz are ethnic. Now I am NOT talking ethnic is a real manner. Nope. It's a CORPORATE style of ethnicity. The black girl has non-brown eyes, talks EXACTLY like any white kid and is groomed just like a white kid. The Asian kid is vaguely Asian and you only know that she is part Asian at the film's conclusion when you see her mother. And, the Hispanic kid looks 100% non-Hispanic white and speaks with no accent and throws out occasional Spanish words for no discernible reason. As for her family, like the actress they don't look or sound the least bit Hispanic (Lainie Kazan?!). When this girl and her mother sing \"La Cucaracha\", it is pathetic--with no accent AND they don't even know the words! But wait...they at least have a disabled kid, right?! Well, sort of. He's hot, does NOT wear a hearing aid or cochlear implant (they would be SO gross....ewww!!) and yet, inexplicably, speaks perfectly and seems to function 100% normally. In fact, to deafness, he's a lot like what Daredevil is to blindness!! I really think that the corporate-type schmucks responsible for this terrible film just think that REAL blacks, Asians, Hispanics and disabled kids are not stylish enough to be in a Bratz film.A few final quibbles. First, how did Jon Voigt get in this film? Does he need the money THAT badly? If so, I am sure we could all take up a collection to help him avoid similar mistakes in the future. Second, I cannot believe that the film managed to insert classical music into it--making me almost hate the tunes. Third, I know I am thinking too much here, but who would let the bad girl bring a dog to school? I know her dad is supposed to be the principal, but bringing along a dog (obviously a knockoff of \"Legally Blonde\") just shows bad writing (duh...this IS a bad film!!). Overall, I see \"Bratz\" as a vapid, valueless and crappy film with no redeeming merits. And, given its place on the IMDb Bottom 100, I can tell that I'm not alone here!*Oddly, while the characters all appear to be about high school age, I cannot imagine high school-age kids watching this one unless you drug them!",

Dylan is deaf in the movie and very timid yet he is usually known for always going after 'chicks' and loving himself and Cloe wasn't her usual drama queen self, again very timid and not the character she should have been. Yasmin was more the 'main character' and very talkative yet she is usually very quiet.

            "content": "Every year, there are movies that look utterly horrible and actually ARE utterly horrible. But every now and then, a movie comes along that you are expecting to be so bad, so terrible, that you are ready to hate it before you see it\u0097when you do you are strangely surprised that the movie isn't all that bad, and it was actually kind of good. Every year has its surprises. Borat was last year's big surprise, and this year had three big surprises that came out on the same day: Underdog, Hot Rod, and Bratz. Yes, let me get it out of my system now. Bratz, the movie I was going to love hating, really wasn't all that bad. The previews promised torture to the viewers who were unfortunate enough to watch it, and I went to see it because I needed another god-awful film to dethrone Napoleon Dynamite as the worst movie of all time. But Bratz, a fun teen flick with lots of heart, strangely won me over about an hour in. It did the opposite of what I was expecting around almost every bend (although there is still that typical clich\u00e9 ending that everyone will expect from this sort of movie). Bratz features four relatively new actresses in the lead roles; Logan Browning plays Sasha, Janel Parrish plays Jade, Nathalia Ramos plays Yasmin, and Skyler Shaye plays Cloe. John Voight is also in a small role playing the principal of the high school.Sasha, Jade, Yasmin, and Cloe have always been the very best of friends, and they don't expect high school to be any different. Scheming, spoiled, snobby, little-miss-perfect prep girl Meredith, however, thinks otherwise. She is the president of the student body, and she makes her presence more than known\u0097all of the new kids must come to her so that she can sort them in with their associated cliques. No one is allowed to make friends outside of the cliques basically. When the girls arrive, however, Meredith begins to fear that there could be trouble. In their freshmen year, however, the girls blend in with their own assorted cliques; Jade hangs with the science nerds, Yasmin hangs with the cheerleaders, Cloe becomes a preppy jock, and Yasmin is pretty much left by herself. As time goes on, the girls begin to drift farther and farther apart from each other until two years pass, and they are pretty much little more than acquaintances. Through a series of events, they decide that they need to be friends again, and they cannot let the situation with the cliques get in the way of their friendship. Meredith is pretty much appalled as she watched the world she created crumble beneath her, so she sets out to teach the 'Bratz' some lessons.I am actually kind of embarrassed to say that I liked this movie. It did, after all, teach some very good life lessons, it had really good songs, and some of the actors were halfway decent. Clearly the best among the bunch were Janel Parrish and Nathalia Ramos, who play Jade and Yasmin, respectively. They gave their characters life and they had loads of fun with their roles. Chelsea Staub, who played Meredith, seemed like she was having lots of fun, but she wasn't the best actress in the world. Also somewhere in the middle of the acting spectrum was Skyler Shaye, who played Cloe. While she did bring a unique personality to the character, she was very weak at times, but she was mostly tolerable, and I loved her character to death. The very worst by far in terms of acting had to be Logan Browning, who played Sasha. She was absolutely horrendous in nearly all of her scenes, although there were a couple where she showed a bit of promise. Very close behind in terms of the awful acting was the young actor who played Yasmin's little brother. He showed no skill at all, his lines were always forced and never subtle, and he always seemed devoid of any sort of emotion or energy. The supporting cast was all pretty decent, including the parents of all the girls and the all of the boys.As stated previously, the musical numbers were all handled very well. While I couldn't stay during the credits because I had to work, I did love every song and I liked the directing very much. There were so many bright colors and funny moments scattered throughout the movie that I couldn't help but smile. This is another feel-good film the whole family can enjoy.As much as there are positive things to say about Bratz, there were many negatives. Before the 'two years later' sequence occurred, the movie showed no promise at all. I almost got up and walked right out because it was delivering exactly what the preview had promised. The script for the introduction to the characters as well as the opening scene were very poorly written, and basically all of the actresses delivered their lines like robots. For some reason, though, once it hit the half hour point, things got considerably better and it actually seemed as if it was molding itself out into an actual movie as it progressed. By the end, everything was actually coherent and very enjoyable. In many scenes, the acting became a major issue and annoyed me to no end. Still, Bratz definitely had its moments where I actually saw a great movie shining through. It was very clich\u00e9 in some aspects, but in many others it tried something new and most often succeeded.Bratz the Movie was full twists and turn, surprises and songs, good acting and horrendous acting. I liked the characters a lot, and the movie itself actually managed to be halfway decent. I was expecting this to be utterly terrible, but it surprised me in every category. Still, the movie is not without its share of flaws and it is far from perfect. 6/10",

This has to have one of the worst scripts, dumbest premises, and characters who try to teach diversity through stereotypes. Only the very young can enjoy this, and everyone else will just hate it.Sasha (Logan Browning), Jade (Janel Parrish), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos) and Cloe (Skyler Shae) are all best friends and going into their first year of high school together, but at Dimly high school, you need to belong to a clique. Principal Dimly's daughter Meredith (Chelsea Staub) will make sure of this, as she hands out what clique each person will belong to. Eventually, even the four girls (aka the bratz) give in. A few years later, they are no longer friends, but thanks to a bizarre spontaneous schoolwide food fight, they become friends again. Now they must stop the school from separating everyone into groups and they must defeat the uber-popular Meredith.This movie is filmed like a music video mixed with a commercial. There is constant use of slow motion, which grows obnoxious after one use, and the characters constantly stare at the camera up close, which looks like a mouthwash commercial or something. It's annoying.Speaking of annoying...these characters....they are almost intolerable! Meredith, the antagonist is so ridiculously horrible to listen to. She must have no life, as all she ever does in the movie is try to make sure the school stays separated. It's like she has nothing better to do! Her super sweet 16 party is ridiculous, the song she sings is ear bleedingly bad, and her cronies are clich\u00e9d from bad kiddie cartoons. The main four girls are harmless characters, but they have such bad lines they become unlikeable quickly also. They almost act like they're five years old in their purity. Then there's the creeper character, Yasmin's little brother Manny (William May). He's supposed to be in high school, but he keeps hitting on Meredith's eight to ten year old sister. In a couple years this guy'll be asking for it when he gets sent off to prison.The worst part of the movie are the lines. There is not a single interesting thing said by these characters, and almost every line is a horrible and corny line. The fact that a character says \"I've got the passion for fashion.\" is enough to shut this garbage off and throw the tainted TV in the trash. But it doesn't stop there. Most of the conversations here go back to my previously stated commercial comment. These conversations sound like one's from bad deodorant commercials or something.This is just a horrible kids film. It will only appeal to little girls. Anyone else who enjoys it, well more power to them. For me, this is complete and utter rubbish.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 100 mins.",

            "content": "No matter how extremely negative the vast majority of reviews for this film, this movie was great because: 1.It conveys great messages about FRIENDSHIP & LOYALTY 2.High school cliques are true in real life 3.The soundtracks are so amazingly awesome 4.This Movie Is Good For Any Of Ages 5.Full of music, fun & fashion!!!i live in Indonesia n i think Bratz had so much audiences in here than in its domestic place, USA. when i watched it in theater at 19.30, there were about 80-90 watched it and most of them were teenagers. there were a lot of laughs n it lures so many people. i watched it twice in theater n i bought the DVD of it.i can't believe that Bratz would be so much fun! i mean, forget about the horrendously terrible popular teenage movie like \"High School Musical 2\" who copied \"BRATZ\" or some R-Rated horrible movies, this light-hearted \"BRATZ\" is more than just based on top-selling fashion dolls or make-up makeover. the movie itself shows that friendship is more important than anything. Loyalty to your friends n family n always being true to yourself are great role-models. because there are so many people who not being themselves because they're losing themselves to somebody else. Bratz girls are sticking together because they don't want to get kick off by the clique mansions. in all of high school around the world there always be cliques. there are a lot of cliques in my school too. And teen-actress Emma Roberts is also agree with my opinion, here's what she said about Cliques thing: \"It's just so tough because you really can't do anything about it because wherever you go to school there will always be like cliques and always be those girls do you know what I mean? People who say there aren't cliques at their school are lying because there are cliques everywhere you know, but I would just say you just have to find a group of friends and try not to let it bother you and don\ufffdt feed into it. So, that's what I would say.\" i think cliques are okay because u can always stick with your friend, but cliques are also separating you from each other. if you're an soccer player, maybe you have no idea how cool are the musicians. i myself thought that \"Bratz\" brings some real life issue to be solve, especially teenage problems. And based on the fashion dolls? come on, it's a fresh new idea than just makes some story up based on some boring novels. the dolls itself are the mirrors of teenage girls these days who dress funky n fashionable than just follow your prince charming like Barbie does. the fashion things? i myself be a bit fashionable after watched this film because the Bratz girls know how to dress just to express their own personalities. and besides they're good in fashion, they also great in education. Jade with her high-IQ of science and home EC, Cloe with her super power foots in soccer field, Sasha has a beautiful n attractive cheer-leading move & Yasmin has gorgeous voice with her handwriting-articles in journalism. they like shopping to buy new clothes and make-up, but remember, these girls have smart brains to make their parents proud of them. that's what teenage these days should do: do your favorite positive things but still excellent in school education. and the Bratz girls are having they own problems with their parents also, just like all teenagers these days. One of the girls has a single mom with money problems, one has a hard time telling her parents the truth about herself, and one is struggling with a joint custody arrangement. but in the end they can solve their problems with loyalty and yes, being true to themselves. the movie wants to tell everyone that friendship is a big deal because it feels so bad when you have no friends. and how happy are we if we're going out with our friends. all i want to say that people who gave the movie \"1\" or \"F\" are definitely idiots who don't know how important friendship is! here's some positive reviews for the film that are totally true: *Although the film at times seems more a showcase for the trendy clothes specifically tailored for each character's unique personality, it does convey a positive message about loyalty and friendship. *There is a lot for both kids and their parents to like about this film. Its heroines deal with some real-life issues with dignity and resourcefulness. Its portrayal of the pull of cliques and conformity is sweet and smart.*A cut above the usual dramas aimed at teen female audiences, not least because it's about more than shopping and romance. *It's earnest, silly and sweet, with just enough food fights and musical numbers to keep everyone else from gagging on the goo.you see ? the movie was actually great and its just ashame because there are many people who actually like this movie but they feel embarrasses to admit it. that's it, they're not being true to themselves. i mean look, 5000 people gave the movie 9.. why wouldn't they give 10??? and males who gave the movie 1 are totally morons who don't understand at all about friendship.and i knew that \"Bratz\" didn't make much money in USA but it won in the international gross. it finally out of the IMDb bottom and it deserves 10 for the ratings.Overall, \"Bratz was a great movie for any of ages! i just want to tell you all that being such a hater & love hating the movie with no reasons just make your way to the hell more clearer!N.B = It wasn't that girlie because the movie brings the power of friendship all over the film.",

It did have a few plot holes, but overall, it was rather cute. I like that big stars like Sasha Cohen and the mom from \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" were in it, and it was a likable movie.I didn't like that it suddenly made a jump of two years, but the montage of how their friendship unraveled was intriguing. I might be a little biased, but the scenes with Dylan and Yasmine were my favorites.The one thing they could've expanded on was character depth for Dylan. Why was he the way he was? I kept on waiting for him to tell Yas his story, but it never came. That was a little disappointing, but the rest of the movie was superb. This wasn't a run of the mill fluff-ball movie for little kids. Many people, especially high schoolers themselves, can learn a lesson or two.",

            "content": "Despite my indifference towards the Bratz dolls and disliking what they stand for, and disliking just as much the 2005 CGI-animated show, seeing as there are good examples of musical, comedy and high school films so gave 'Bratz' the benefit of the doubt with an open mind. Plus Jon Voigt has shown that he can be good if the material is (i.e. 'Midnight Cowboy').Although expectations were not high to begin with, 'Bratz' managed to not only be exactly what was expected but be worse. It gets points for some nice bright colours which stops it from being one of the all-time worst films, but that is pretty much the only very faint praise. The 2005 show, as very bad as it was, at least tried to incorporate some unoriginal but important morals and relevant relatable issues. This film also does both, but they are not just ones done to death in every kind of visual media in existence but they are delivered also with the subtlety of a sledge-hammer and in no way feel meaningful.They are also further disadvantaged by the stereotyping, it's not just one or two aspects or characters that are stereotypical. Everything is stereotyped to the maximum, seeming like every one in existence, and in a way that make tea party saucers and very shallow water when swimming in the sea look deep in comparison. The un-subtlety is similarly applicable here as it is in the morals/issues 'Bratz' tries to show, the stereotypes are excessive in number, over-exaggerated and a few are not for the easily offended. Not in a while have more shallow and unlikeable characters graced any film by me seen by me recently, they all live up to their names as brats with personalities that never sparkle and instead make one depressed and they serve as unhealthy role models for the primary target audience.Other than the bright colours, there is a real straight-to-video/DVD look to 'Bratz'. It strives for glitz but ends up being pure garish tack with unexceptional at best amateurish at worst filming. The songs written for the film are repetitive and irritate fast, even the worst of the songs heard in the charts today are more tolerable than the songs here. They are also sung with variable sense of pitch, lacklustre energy and nasal, and at times shouty, poorly recorded voices that are far more unpleasant than the worst singing of Disney Channel stars. The choreography is lazy and danced with awkwardness.Calling the script stilted and shallow are insults to those words. It's truly cringe-worthy, forced and vapid, so poorly delivered and has no substance whatsoever. The story is non-existent thin and would strain to sustain even a half an hour television episode let alone a feature length film.And now we come to the acting, have not seen acting this appalling in quite some time. Everyone either looks like they are on autopilot or are so over the top that one feels ashamed for struggling to laugh out loud. There is no discernible chemistry between them either, with the titular characters it is hard to believe that they are friends with the way they interact and believe.Of the performances, Chelsea Staub as Meredith gives perhaps one of the worst performances ever. Similarly, once again (just when you think he couldn't get just as bad as his career-low-point, film and performance, in 'Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2'), Jon Voigt disgraces himself with an bumbling idiot role (that is actually meant to be an authority figure) overacted dreadfully, and no obviously prosthetic/false nose won't give you any dignity sadly Jon no matter how hard you try to hide behind it by looking barely recognisable.In conclusion, lots of brat-itude but no style or substance of any kind. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

They are four females entering high school and going against trends. Eventually the girls split into their interests developing new friendships while their bond fades. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they will get back together and win the talent contest. Sets are colourful and directing by Sean McNamara is fine but acting is a major issue. Nathalia Ramos, Janel Parrish, Skyler Shaye, and Logan Browning are not promising. They dress up in colourful costumes, prance about and give slow motion hair wave shots. Chelsea Staub plays the scheming brat who attempts to place everyone into their different cliques. Similar to Mean Girls but lacking the message and character of that film. Unlike Mean Girls, the characters here are about as enticing as a punch in the face. Its only real drive is its capitalizing on the success of the dolls. This film is purely aimed at young girls who can hopefully know the difference between real personalities and a hunk of plastic. Bratz is not a famous enough product to warrant its own movie let alone deserve one. In the end it is all marketing to the lowest denominator, which unfortunately taps in at young girls. As for adults, the film is about as exciting as a kick to the crotch. Score: 3 / 10",

            "content": "Four lifelong friends Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) are about to start their freshman year at Carry Nation High School. Student Body President, Meredith Baxter Dimley (Chelsea Staub), daughter of Principal Dimley (Jon Voight) maintains order in the school by assigning all incoming students to Cliques. This includes Cloe, Yasmin, Sasha, and Jade who all find their friendship tested by the oppressive social structure.Launched in 2001, the Bratz doll line while slow to start eventually became a major competitor against the de facto monopoly of Barbie capturing nearly 40% of the doll market. The doll line was subject to both criticism and praise with some applauding the ethnic diversity of the line in contrast to Barbie, while others were quick to interpret the attire, attitudes, and other facets of the line as promoting sexualization and promiscuity. Most of the criticism was written off and had no major effect on the line's success, and what hiatuses happened were mostly the result of legal actions by Barbie owner Mattel. In 2006, Avi Arad fresh from his resignation at Marvel Studios before the MCU took off, acquired the rights to Bratz to make a feature film based on the property helmed by low budget children's film director Sean McNamara and produced by Jon Voight and Steven Paul's production company Crystal Sky Pictures best known for production on the Baby Geniuses movies. The film was a massive failure critically and commercially and was even nominated for worst picture at the Golden Raspberry Awards only being beat out by I Know Who Killed Me, the Razzies made a mistake because as bad as I Know Who Killed Me may have been, it at least feels like a movie as opposed to Bratz.From the point the movie opens, the titular \"Bratz\" are pretty much interchangeable in terms of personality and really only distinguished by their wardrobes which are the subject of a number of montage scenes (which makes sense given the movie is based on dolls) and for the most part talk, act, and behave pretty similarly to one another. On occasion you'll get some cringey humor based on antiquated stereotypes such as Yasmin's homelife where it's basically bludgeoned into the audience she's of Hispanic heritage down to not only is her home filled with people, it also has a Mariachi Band in it....you read that correctly, and there's other instances just like this for the other characters. Things aren't much better once we get to Carry Nation High School (because kids love Prohibition/Temperance references?) where the student body is made up of broad caricatures that make up the \"cliques\" with your typical jocks, geeks, loners, and odd ones like \"kids who dress up like dinosaurs\". On occasion there's maybe an inspired gag such as a scene where Principal Dimley is reading a book called \"How to Run a Prison\" but it's so suffocated by the weight of the movie and its lack of subtlety that it barely registers.Then we have the underlying crux of the movie of \"being yourself\", \"don't let the world define you\", and etc. Which is a worthwhile enough message but A) it rings pretty hollow when you're utilizing broad stereotypes and caricatures and B) The movie spends so much time focusing on the titular Bratz \"fashionizing\" and \"accessorizing\" themselves it's comes off like lip service trying to disguise how superficial the whole thing comes off as. The 2004 film Meangirls handled this material much better, but that movie was written by Tina Fey and carried a PG-13 rating which allowed it to tackle the High School experience with more edge and wit. The movie is written by credited writer Susan Estelle Jansen (though initial uncredited work was done by Susie Singer Carter) and while Jansen has a successful history as a producer on the Lizzie McGuire series and even wrote the finale film, the writing of that series skewed younger and focused on Junior High students and a very polished version of Junior High at that. While there have been some movies that take place in High School that are PG, they typically play up the camp value or silliness because it's very difficult to address teenage issues in a \"family friendly manner\", and Bratz seemingly wants to be both a fluff piece and a friendship story and doesn't have the ability to pull off either one.Bratz is a soulless product that looks, feels, and plays like a feature length commercial. From bland interchangeable protagonists, to over the top style and performances, to high school satire that's about as cutting as baby teeth, Bratz is just as plastic and artificial as the products it bases itself upon.",

I honestly don't know what any of these kids were thinking...I though teenagers were a little smarter than that, but come on...brattitude? Passion for fashion? Did any cast-members think that this movie would propel them to instant stardom, or that they'd win a high-achievement award for acting? If they did, then I seriously doubt their competence levels. As for the ending? A spokesperson from MTV walks up to the \"Bratz\" and says, \"You girls are beautiful! Want to be famous?\" This is the very positive message the kids of America are receiving nowadays: be beautiful, and...that's it.And to the mother who bought this DVD for her child: what were you thinking?

While I fully understand that I'm clearly 'like soooo' not in their demographic (sticking out like a sore thumb in the process, flanked by a handful of empty seats) but what is plainly opposable is its toxic value system that prioritises superficiality and pop music over its sledgehammer lessons of friendships and inclusiveness. Sprung from a line of fashion dolls that make Barbie look like an Amish housewife, the film tones down its creepy sexualised tone for quickie moral lessons and puerile considerations of racial identities.These Bratz consist of freshmen high schoolers in Hispanic Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), African-American Sasha (Logan Browning), Caucasian Cloe (Skyler Shaye) and Pan-Asian Jade (Janel Parrish). Preaching individualism through materialism and in a haze of noxiously pandering stereotypes (Yasmin's represented through food and music, Sasha teaches everyone a thing or two about dancing, Cloe's a pretty go-getter at soccer and Jade's a science whiz under all that face-paint!), the thing that's even more egregious is its condescension of young femininity under the guise of appreciating the gender. Considering its impressionable core audience, it commits such a cinematic sin when it is caught attempting to traffic in post-feminism while at the same time, disparaging it completely.Consciously cavalier and ironically insular, its entirely manufactured theme of abolishing cliques and embracing individuality is a tougher merchandise to flog than the titular skanky dolls when all it ends up affirming is the sorry state of materialism that is allowed to pervade even the most tenuous of idealisms. \"Bratz\", while never once approaching the subversion of \"Mean Girls\", would have been a fantastic satire if they had proceeded to cast the chasms of mainstream pop culture like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, that and if it wasn't so hands-over-eyes blind about its consumerist schlock peddling.",

But I'm just going to be one of the optimistic people telling people the good side of the movie.First let's start with my cons. Nathalia(Yasmin) is the singer or the girl who loves singing....welll supposely they would have found someones voice that matches the way she talks more if she cannot sing. Including Skylar(Chloe). But none of them use there real voice except Janel Parrish(Jade). If I made the movie I can easily find people who can sing very well and look great for bratz...Another thing why does it have to take them 2 years until they get back together? It would have took just a month for the better? I mean friendship is awesome but no girl in real life would split up because they are in different cliques,clubs,sports, or interest. Especially it can't take 2 years.Okay let me explain the pros.....The movie is still good, the lesson is understandable....the lesson fits the point of the story, and is just a film that feels like an exciting girly movie. I enjoy this since I was a little girl. Those cons I said on top, I mostly wished it didn't take 2 years for friendship to happen again.It would have been less plus the story would have been written better like....Meridith saw 4 girls having a strong friendship but she becomes friends with one of them and lie about how one another hate or say things about each other and make tricks. Later on they find out and stop her.Lesson would be \"don't be jealous\"Or it would have just been a movie about competting against her in a competition and they try to learn how to work together and make plans to stay strong as a team. \"Lesson would be stay strong, fight to win , or enjoy the competition, if you lost no big deal\"Or another competition against dancing as a team or fashion just because thats what you always see in the animation.The music and the songs is great....no one should not deny that.I found it very funny how at the end Meridith got embarrassed in her sweet 16th or her second one.I can relate to yasmin when she is sad and nervous. But is bad that the evil character easily persuade them to be separated just because she tells you to hang out in a certain group. But in real life no one tells you to hang out with people...that would cause a lot of chaos.",

I know some people would argue that my standards for what a movie can be should have been lowered when I came across this live-action film based on a series of dolls, but aren't little girls people too? Don't they deserve the same kind of respect for their intelligence that everyone else does? None of the characters have any personalities besides whatever accessories their toys come with (so for example, there's a sporty one, a smart sciency one, a cheerleader and if I remember correctly... the last one is just clumsy) and it becomes almost offensive how broad the comedy is.

She doesn't like the independent spirit of the four girls, and plans to destroy their friendship. Jade does well in science club and designs great outfits. Cloe is an ace soccer player, and Sasha is soon recruited as a cheerleader. Yasmin's special talent is to sing; however she has terrible stage fright. She meets Dylan, who is deaf.

And there is this completely unbelievable romantic storyline, where the romance is based of of an encounter where one of the girls insults someone. Also the ppl who made this movie must be aliens because, they have no idea how human behaviour works. When a small dog walks up to you and bumps into you, you don't throw your entire plate of food over your shoulder.....resulting in a cartoon-ish chain reaction were people keep falling and throwing things, with one of the strangest camera angles and editing work I have ever seen.

And when they get to high school, they find other friends, and kind of all split up. OMG! (Oh, and \"OMG\" is an actual line in the movie too). I guess you can't have more than a four friends in school, according to this movie. Oh yeah, and there is this class president bimbo who wants to keep all the girls separated by groups or something. Well, the years pass, and by senior year, the girls suddenly think...why aren't we friends again? Soo...they dump(!) their new friends, and all get back together! WOW! And when one girl doesn't have new clothes for a party, the other magically gets a gift certificate to the mall! And that party is throne by the evil bimbo! WOW! I wish I could pull an FYE gift card out of my butt! And why would you want to go to a party that exploits your friends? And the girls call themselves \"Bratz\" which kind of just sounds like they are insulting themselves.

            "content": "I hate everything about the bratz. Mostly because it gives girls a role model that tells that it is good to be a slutty, brain dead whore who only cares about make-up, fashion and party's. So a movie about the dolls is like one of the lowest levels of hell. Because everyone hated this movie, I had a vision in my head of how bad it was. Now I have finally seen it, I can say that it is one of the worst, if not the worst film I have ever seen (like animated titanic movies level of worst).The film starts with the four main characters (played by Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, Nathalia Ramos and Skyler Shaye) talking about how much clothing thy have too much of it. Then we see that the director finds out how many racist Hispanic stereotypes you can put in one scene (about 7 in total). Than we have a look at the main villain of the movie (played by Chelsea Kane) who is basically a prison warden that defines the school into cliques based of the overused school stereotype thy belong to (Nerds, Jocks, Goth, Preps and Mimes, yes mimes). The rest of the plot is just a talent show, more stereotypes and the kind of logic even a fantasy film would think that it goes too far.The plot is basic and predictable. The logic makes no sense. Example: Everyone on the school are just fine with the fact that one stupid rich girl runs the place like a prison. The moral of the story is. Be a brain dead whore, only cares about fashion and the outside is more important that everything on the inside.The characters are not worth mentioning. Thy are one of two things: Brain dead valley girls or racial/school stereotypes, with no personality. The only actor who try to be good is Jon Voight (from National treasure), but even he fails miserably.Now I will talk about the songs. OH GOD THE SONGS!!!! Take Nicky Minage and Rebeca Black, and you have the songs of this movie. The songs sung by Chelsea Kane (while using auto-tune) are all about one thing: I am the best and you are a bunch of morons who will never survive society. I have to mute these parts of the movie so I can be able to watch this entire thing.I watched this film after I watched My little pony: Equestria Girls, because I want to compare the Bratz with an movie with an equally attended audience. Equestria Girls is a better movie than this piece of sh***t from a non brony standpoint.Just don't waist you time on this film. There are much better movies to watch out there.",

            "content": "I just watched it last night with my little sister, who had watched Bratz before, and swore that it was good. And halfway through the movie, I realized that I was spending an hour and a half of my life that I'm never going to get back. What's worse, I'm 14 years old, and apparently this movie is supposed to be targeted to 'tweens' my age and younger.I have to say, even High School Musical was more bearable than this because, given the fact that it was very Disney in a sense that it was sugarcoated, you somehow still get to sympathize with the characters. In Bratz, I felt NO sympathy for them at all. The drama had no effect on me, whatsoever, and even the montage of them shopping which was supposed to be presented as something fun and cute, was nothing special. And the movie in particular was generally painfully based on stereotypes. The villain, Ms. Popular Meredith? Her character was just written...badly. She was the classic stereotype of a villain whereas her character was written off as pure evil, and plain immature. And even the Bratz themselves were purely stereotypes, especially based on their race.The script was pretty much juvenile. Seriously, there is no high school at all that would act like that in real life! They pretty much resembled middle school, at most. The conflicts were immature at most, and usually high school students won't get involved in those types of petty wars. Plus, there were a lot of plot holes that the writers probably tried so hard to cover. I cringed at every scene, and I wasn't moved at all with any emotion they portrayed. The Bratz, especially lacked comedic timing in the scenes were they were supposed to be throwing punch lines.Just because it is a movie targeted for \"tweens\" does not mean that it doesn't deserve a decent script or more bearable acting. It's still a movie, regardless, and the viewers are expected to see something satisfying at least. I honestly bawled my eyes out at the sight of the movie, and I just wanted to wait for it to end. I can say it was the worst movie I've ever watched.",

My expectation entering the theater was that this was going to be the cheesiest and lamest thing since Josie & the Pussycats. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. Many people are quick to review poorly, but you have to wonder why any self-respecting 20yr old would see this movie without children in tow? This is a children's movie. There is a time and a place for everything, and this movie has a limited target audience; it is aimed specifically at the teeny-bopper age!!I ended up liking it because it brought me back to my childhood and my own experiences with \"mean girls\" and cliques, and it helped me have a wonderful conversation with my daughter afterward. There is some merit to a movie that can touch upon a girls coming of age & self worth. I suspect that many bashers of this film are also on the Anti-Bratz bandwagon, and likely think that Barbie is the queen of dolls. My own opinion about Barbie is; If she \"can do anything\", why does she need her mother to have a baby for her? Maybe my own Barbies were risk-takers, but they loved the GI-Jo's in the neighborhood. Ken was a sappy pretty boy with no personality. I preferred the funner Dawn dolls and their ilk. Plus they were smaller, and more portable.",

            "content": "I have fortunately never been diagnosed with a terminal disease but I would imagine the shock of such an announcement would be on par with watching this movie. First off, the cast has the same racial make up as USA for Africa with a Latino girl hanging out with an Asian girl, a black girl, and what I originally thought was some lost member of the Russian Aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w/ her enormous shoe collection: funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes. Example, the Latino girl lives in a house with 674 people and one car, the Asian girl is good at math, and the black girl's parents are divorced.These girls are ripped apart by some bizarre social system whereby everybody gets placed in a group like it's Red China. This system is created by a girl who never seems to graduate. There is a sequence where the movie fast-forwards by two-years and this girl is still the president of the student body and running the school like the Gestapo. Merideth, the girl in question, is easily the worst character in motion picture history. Steve Buschemi in Airheads is Jimmy Stewart by comparison. Furthermore, unlike most movie that do not make your eyes bleed, this girl who spends 100 minutes raping the soul does not even get her comeuppance. Like if Michael Vick was named chairman of PETA. The characters are, sadly, only part of the problem. Saying the whole portions of this movie are unwatchable is untrue, b/c that would imply that some parts of the movie are. From start to finish, Bratz is a step by step instructional manual on how-to-whore-out-your daughters, but keep them passionate about friendship. Several scenes in particular are horrendous: like a Super Sweet 16 party equipped with an elephant that is so mind-numbingly retarded that I was sent into anaphalectic shock and needed as epi-pen to be revived. Finally, the real atrocity in the Killing Fields that is Bratz is its includence of one Jon Voight. Before I had defined the lengths people would go to pay off gambling debt or meet the daily \"fix\" by referencing Kenneth Branaugh as Dr. Arlis Lovalce in Wild Wild West. No longer. Jon Voight is so ridiculous in this movie that you have to wonder if the producers had kidnapped his wife and blackmailed him. First off, they try to sneak his name in the credits so unless you are paying attention you don't even know its him. Next they disguised him as if he were snitching on the mob, complete with chotch mustache which only ups his creepy factor b/c he is constaly checking out the Benaton Ad that are the main characters. In Brief, theologists have their work cut-out for them since they have to explain how any higher power could have allowed Bratz. Even non-sentient beings will be driven insane. Keep the dog away from chocolate while it's on. Terrorist you have been warned.",

The music is good, particularly the Bratitude number, there is not just inclusion, but appreciation of characters of different races and a first for a preteen movie, a fairly major character with a disability which is addressed in a positive way. Contrary to other reviews, I think this film sends a great message about friendship through adversity, acceptance of peoples differences and even the importance of education (through Jades science club and the scholarship). I recommend, just don't have unrealistically high expectations, remember it is just a feel good movie for young girls. Maybe it's just that I first watched it when I was 6 and grew up with the Bratz franchise, but having recently rewatched it, I might've shed a tear at the finale..",

Well the start, despite these girls having a 'passion for fashion' they didn't half look a state, but the thought was there - I supposed. At times theplot seemed a little trivial and the singing, well lets leave it to the HSM lot next time. Despite this the heart of the film was in the right place. It had a strong message about sticking with your friends and showed the value of friendship. To be fair, this movie could have been Oscar worthy and still been slated, just for having the 'Bratz' tag.

If I was a producer and a written idea for a movie like this was given time on my table, after reading it I won't mind tearing up the papers cause the creator of this movie obviously has nothing new for public out there or he definitely needs to civilize himself about teen and musical movies, cause movies like Bratz are like released each year and I think Disney is a good example for what I mean. For your own good, I'm telling you to stay away from this movie cause you might find out how boring it is and how much time you've wasted with this crap.",

            "content": "Okay. So this movie got a lot of hate and bad reviews the time it was released. Honestly, in my opinion, it wasn't so bad at all. For a kid's movie, it did its work pretty well. Yes, there might have been a lot of plot holes in the movie and I have found myself asking them again when I re-watched it (Yes, I did. Plenty of times), but for a movie targeted for kids, the inconsistencies were barely noticeable. It had the music and the colorful set make up for the poorly written script. If it is made for teens and an older audience, that is another thing entirely though. Although there were a lot of bad actors in this film, some were not bad at all. Personally, my favorite character is Meredith. The artist just delivered perfectly, and I couldn't ask for more. Plus, she's got the greatest numbers in the movie. I replayed just for her second sweet 16 number and her talent show performance. Ah, yes. That's one positive thing about this movie too. It has a nice soundtrack. Which is always a good thing, yes? It made me forget how bad a dancer Cloe is. See their talent show performance and that red carpet show. Just hilarious. If you do want to watch an eye candy movie (referring to the set and props visuals and not the kids. My golly.) without bothering for a perfectly amazing script, then this one is for you. It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either. I quite enjoyed it myself when I watched it 5 years ago. I enjoyed it still when I re-watched it recently. Honestly, I'm questioning why Mean Girls 2 got a 4 rating and this has only 2. It is, in all aspects, a step better than MG2.",

The movie was very colorful, which is a big deal for visual people. 2. And there's the good sense of fashion, present in the movie.Cons:1. The story was very Clich\u00e9. The plot was not planned out. I bet that the film was rushed, i mean come on cliques that don't click? It was like a mix of Van Wilder 2 and other movies that had clique in them.2. The movie was so CORNY. That part after they had the food fight scene, where Jasmine said, \"Stop it!\" And they ended up a friends? Was so Uggh! It made me want to gag!!!3. The actresses' acting, or rather everybody's ACTING was WAY OVER THE TOP. 4. The part were Dylan portrayed that he was deaf. He really didn't portray it. I know that he can lip read but, the way that he did it, he can get what the others are saying like *snap of fingers* that!5. Jasmine's voice was so not good. It's too nasal-y. Meredith's voice was way better than hers. Why the heck was it that the lead in this movie is Jasmine? When the lead is always Chloe. Is there some reason behind this? And Oh yeah! What the heck was that part, where Dylan had his own scene? Where the music teacher helped him and everything? It reminded me of Drumline, you know the movie.",

I give this movie a 1 star rating because it has no substence I could not enjoy it.However, consider that this movie is quite old and aimed at children, there was nothing else to expect. The actors where not given a solid script or plot to work out there full potential. They need to overreact and stay simple without any layers. \nThis movie is supposed to be like this, for kids.

The most notable is jade, who went on to be Mona in pretty little liars, a part she played spectacularly, she was able to capture psychopath so well. And Sasha's actor went on to be one of the leads in the Netflix original dear white people, another great show. Blaming the actors for something they had no control over is extremely unfair, it's not their fault, and unless you've been in acting you don't really know how much of a struggle it can be to get parts, so blaming them for being a part of this movie is really uncalled for. Of course this is no excuse for the script, which is littered with plot holes, but it's not really a movie made for adults, it's just supposed to be entertaining for young children, and when I first saw this as a nine year old, I loved it, and rewatching it as an adult is really nostalgic for me, because I loved the franchise as a child. This doesn't mean it's a great movie by any means, and being content for children isn't an excuse to phone it in on a script, but this is no where near the worst movie I've seen, and anyone who thinks that has obviously never had the displeasure of watching movies like birdemic and food fight. There's too much hate in these reviews for the wrong thing, because the actors aren't the ones who write the script, and it's ignorant to blame them, but who could expect anything else from people in 2007.",

            "content": "Bratz: The Movie follows the lives of four total BFF high school students, Yasmin, Sasha, Chloe, and Jade, as they share their adventures through school. When they first begin their experience as freshmen, they vow to say together forever no matter what. However, their plan is road blocked when, Meridith, the creepy, stalker, spoiled queen of the school splits them up into different cliques. However, the four \"Bratz\" find their friendship (and fashion!) are the true important things in life and therefore decide to stop the evil Meridith's dastardly scheme together.So, normally I would probably never watch a cheap, superficial movie based on a line of anatomical incorrect dolls, but, since the particular child that I was babysitting a few weeks ago loves the movie, I pretty much had to. And now I'm still trying to wash the nasty taste out of my mouth.Really, I don't know if there are any other ways for me to describe this god awful train wreck besides what everyone else has said. And yes it is truly as bad as everyone says. But I feel it is my right to bitch after watching it, so here we go. First off, the acting is terrible. I can't think of one person's performance that wasn't amateurish, stereotypical, stupid, or all three. Even Jon Voight was awful (someone had some bills to pay?). All the characters are one dimensional. Meridith, played by an Ashley Tisdale wannabe, has such a paper thin personality, the wind could split her in half. She does not embody the evil queen bee. Instead, she's just an annoying bitch whose main past time is stalking the four \"totally awesome and cool\" Bratz. And the Bratz are really no better themselves. In fact, from my high school experience, those girls would probably be the annoying girls who stay in their own little clique and ignore everyone else. The plot is typical \"high school\" movie crap, including a party that goes terribly wrong and ending with a talent show that saves the day, giving the Bratz everything they ever need, and making sure that Meridith gets royally screwed. This movie also tires to give heartwarming \"messages.\" What they are, I really don't know. Somehow they try to pass off something about individuality and friendship, but it comes out as muddled B.S. So, according to Bratz, the only way to be successful in life is by continually clinging to the people you've known before we came out of your mother and making sure that you always, ALWAYS, wear what's fashionable, otherwise you're a totalloser.Even though this IS based on a line of dolls, it could have been good. It could have been a satire about four fashion loving girls being almost outsiders in the normalcy of high school. It could have shown how people who are friends grow apart as they grow up (but that might also include showing ACTUAL individualism and something that could happen in the real world rather that a bunch of annoying, clingy girls who would die without each other). But, of course, it only lives of to the expectations of this type of movie: it's going to be crap. Wanna see a movie about being fashionable yet an outsider? Watch Legally Blonde. Want a satirical (and funny) look at cliques? See Mean Girls or better yet, Heathers. Because, why not watch the original movies Bratz enjoys ripping off?",

The girls have a food fight and are sent to detention, where they have a decent convo for the 1st time in 2 years.

Meredith joins the talent show, and to take her down the 4 main characters form Bratz-their girl group. Meredith performs \"It's All About Me\" and exposes the Bratz's secrets, but the Bratz stand up to her and perform \"Bratitude\". The talent show ends in a tie. Meredith wins the trophy, but the Bratz win the scholarship, which is given to Chloe, who ironically was the main character in the cartoon films. MTV then signs Bratz and they perform \"Open Eyes\" on the red carpet while Meredith and her dad spy on them. It's a great film! The Bratz's songs suck, but the other songs either also suck or rock! The best songs are \"Take It To The Maximum\" which is Sasha's cheerleading tryouts song and Meredith's songs \"It's All About Me\" and \"Fabulous\". Great movie, but if you're really criticed with movie reviews I wouldn't reccomend it.",

The plot is 4 vapid teenagers struggling with materialism and narcissism in high school. Oh, did I mention that it includes a deaf boy who can somehow hear his crush singing? Yay for continuity! If you can get past the fact that the movie is completely predictable, it is for 2 year olds after all, you might find yourself able to enjoy the stupidity of the film. Adults will definitely enjoy the predatory 16 year old boy that seems to make advances on an 11 year old every chance he gets. Acting this bad is worthy of prison time for the mental deterioration it causes all its viewers. Unless you want your child to be mentally and emotionally stunted, I would keep them as far away from this film as possible. This film will kill your soul and your brain cells.",

My favorite was Jade, because her character seemed the most genuine and had the greatest depth. My absolute favorite part was the video that played at the end of the credits. Janel Parrish (Jade) performed a beautiful song called Rainy Day, which she wrote herself. It is on the soundtrack, which I plan to download from I-Tunes. I really hope to see a sequel.",

The trailer looked decent enough, and I had expected it to be on the same level as Mean Girls.But boy was I wrong. From the first 5 minutes of the movie I wanted to tear my eyes out from the extreme fakeness of it all. They way they talk and the things they say were so horribly clich\u00e9d and they made it sound so scripted too. And more and more clich\u00e9s were to come: such as the ever popular rich blonde girl with the tiny dog with her two dumb entourage.The worst part was the talent show. I think I died during that scene and then woke up again when it ended. Somehow I wanted to block it all out in fear of it destroying my brain cells.So to sum it up, do not watch Bratz if you have the tiniest bit of self dignity because at the end of the movie, you'd be punching yourself and asking \"Why did I waste 2 hours of my time on this?\" Oh and seriously, letting little kids watch this will not change the way they think about 'life' or 'friendship'.

Also the whole \"stupid cheer leader\" thing isn't exactly realistic in high school, maybe try a few swears and they'd be heading down the right path in a typical high school. If you honestly want to see this just telling you that the obvious lip syncing done by the actress that plays Yasmin is really the cherry on top of a horrible movie.

I think it was adorable how the girls interacted with each other, solving problems, and coming together as a team.The plot is basically as follows: Sasha, Yasmin, Jade and Chloe enter high school. However, the beauty queen of the school, Meredith, has taken over the school, and split everybody up! Cliques have been formed, and nobody wants to hang out with each other! Needless to say, this is a very sad moment :(Obviously, this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated. By the end these wonderful girls take down Meredith, and save the school from tyranny, in a heartwarming tale of friendship and bonding over common interests. This interest being, particularly, fashion, which is a fine interest indeed. No neckbeards allowed here!I'd definitely have to recommend this movie to fans of comedy and the action genre.

I first saw this movie as a class (we voted for a movie on the last day of sixth grade in 2008 and Bratz won, so we saw it) back in elementary school and I must admit that I enjoyed it very much. True, many may question the movie's message, but in many ways I see that it does project a positive message. Throughout the movie, the four Bratz girls (Chloe, Jade, Sasha, and Yasmin) meet events that challenge their friendship. However, they make it through putting their friendship as a priority. This delivers a very important message to young teenagers/tweens that they should always learn to maintain friendships and set how to aside their differences.Another important message the movie delivers is basically how to stand up for yourself. It's very important that children in their pre- teens know this as it is very possible that they will also face similar issues once they head into highschool.Lastly, this movie wasn't intended for adults or the \"general audience\". It was directed towards preteens/young teens in general. Many teenagers at that time (myself included) were very interested on \"what high school is going to be like\".

The unrealistically active and thriving high school with people partying all over campus as if class never starts for them, and kids who care if four girls are sitting together at a table. All of these movies always depict this type of high school activity, yet I've never been to school where one beautiful girl calls the shots for the entire school. The clich\u00e9 of the popular girl trying to bring down the main character because she shows a sign of not giving a damn who she is. The glorification of being materialistic is too much, as this seems to be a trait of every female in the movie. None of these girls are really separable in terms of personality besides the \"villain\".",

When it first came out I took my little sisters and cousins to go see it and they loved it, which is the point. It is a movie made for children and young adolescents. As for the body issues; its a movie based on dolls. The average movie that takes place in a high school has thin, fit main characters. That can create issues but unlike those movies who had the option of choosing whoever they wanted for their main character and setting a tone, Bratz already had images their characters had to be based on. Getting made at them for sticking to the doll images is the same as getting angry at Barbie movies for not making thicker, more realistic cartoons.The lip-syncing was dramatic and not realistic but so what. Like previously stated, this was a children's movie and the majority of children do not notice or even care if they do notice. It was a cute movie with a nice, basic, child targeted message. Quite frankly I don't want to hear grown women talking about how horrible the movie was. I get stuck seeing children movies with the kids in my family all the time, and while I don't enjoy the movie and find them to be utterly ridiculous in a number of ways, I'm not going to write a review from my POV because i am not the audience target.The people who are attacking the dolls and saying they have a \"promiscuous\" image obviously don't understand the impact those dolls had, especially on colored girls. I used to play with those dolls because I loved that fact that they had big lips, I loved that their wardrobe included more than just sparkly tops, dresses, and ugly pink heels.",

Many years later, I decide to cut corners by watching some caustic critics review it because I'd rather not be caught actually watching the film and dealing with some awkward questions and it seems I made the right call all those years ago. From its appearance, it appeared to be a truly shallow film with obnoxious humour, bad performances, questionable messages and a story that doesn't feel like it does a very good job encouraging its demographic to go buy Bratz dolls. One could argue that it actually brought out the worst in teen comedies (albeit a family-oriented one, rather than a pure PG-13 one). Transformers is the definitive victor here for best live-action film of 2007 based off of a toyline (and both had Jon Voight in them as well!).",

The acting by the majority of actors is pretty awful (example, Chloe in the shop admitting she doesn't have money for a new outfit). The story itself is dumbed down to your average teen high school movie but its morals are twisted and confusing. The music is pretty terrible. The worst part, personally, was that all of the fantastic parts of the Bratz, the interesting adventures, the morals that occasionally popped up to teach you about friendship and life, Burdine Maxwell and the Tweevils (who, in all honesty, could have been horrible or amazingly campy in a live action remake). Basically, everything larger than life and interesting about the Bratz was removed and replaced with flimsy, stereotypical backstories and personalities that are impossible to relate to or connect with in most senses.\n\nFor a child or a young teenager who likes Bratz, this is enjoyable. For anyone else, it's pretty awful.",

The casting of the main 4 girls is on point, but everyone else is just in the movie to be filler. My main issue with this movie is its dumbass  villian. Are you serious? A spoiled blonde bitch  named Marilyn who is the daughter of the principal. Give me a break! Why were none of the other females given their brat names it kinda seemed like they just made it up. Also another thing that irritated me was the brat boyz (omg) Dylan isn't black in this movie and they made him deaf how stupid is that and where is kobe and eithan or even motorcycle cade? They really screwed the pooch on the guys in this movie. Overall this movie needed to be about the brat girls in high school getting ready for their senior prom with the also popular brat boyz alongside, and develop their struggles with adulthood, love and friendship as high school draws to a close. I wanted this to be fun, smart and emotional and got neither. This should've been great.",

            "content": "I wonder what it would be like to live day-by-day knowing you had participated in the creation of  the film adaptation of Bratz. You know, those dolls with the freakish lips and faces that dress with lower class than the \"Me so horny!\" Vietnamese hooker from Full Metal Jacket. Yes, those dolls.\n\nOne immediate question this film poses is, \"How does one create a film based on a line of dolls that dress like Vegas strip hookers?\" Or, there's also the questions, \"Who the hell funded this film?\" and \"Who thought this was a wise investment?\" There are many questions, with answers I don't think I'll ever get.\n\nGoing back to my first paragraph, I wonder what it must be like to be in director Sean McNamara's shoes. What could have possibly drawn this man to this project? Even taking into account his extensive directorial credits that include Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network episodes, what could possibly make anyone with such credits for directing programs for children want to take on a project that was destined to fail from the first pitch that there should be a film based on this particular brand of dolls?\n\nI wonder if perhaps it was money being offered. But even so, what sort of monetary offering would be enough to entice anyone to direct something like this? Sure, you have the money, but you have the eternal shame in knowing that you helped birth one of the worst films ever made. But, this theory doesn't really hold water with me through even just a quick browsing of his work - specifically, his films.\n\nA check of his filmography shows a strong leaning towards dramas, including ones with a faith angle and uplifting storylines, too. Though they received \"meh\" reviews from critics, his work with Soul Surfer and Spare Parts seem to be very well received by audiences. Hoovey seems to be decently received. He also directed a drama set during the Civil War which was met with mixed reviews called Field Of Lost Shoes, and even has a fantasy film coming out later this year called The Moon And The Sun which does sound a bit interesting, admittedly, considering its oddball premise. This to me, even though I have not seen his other work, shows signs of a much more ambitious director who has many ideas and lofty goals, complete with some solid fan followings for his works.\n\nPlus, if his website's biography is to be believed, it raises more questions about why he directed this film. From this biography, I learned that the age of 12, during a trip to Ireland, his father bought him a super-8 camera. And as the plane taxied down the runway, he recorded it. This simple moment was apparently enough to inspire him to want to become a film-maker. I also wonder what else made him want to become a film-maker.\n\nEvery film-maker has their ambitions and inspirations, so what were his? Did he want to be the next great American (Maybe even international) director who would influence a new generation of film-makers and have film scholars talking for decades about his work? Did he want to create film classics? Or, was it perhaps something more modest, like being an indie director with creative freedoms and explorations into ideas mainstream films wouldn't allow for, complete with a small but dedicated fanbase? What were his inspirations? Classic American films? European or Asian art house films, perhaps? Or maybe, much like Quentin Tarantino, his inspirations are eclectic, obscure cult films? What were his goals? What were his inspirations?\n\nI'm desperate to find out how and why. How did whatever goals, inspirations, or moments in life all lead to such a tragedy of film-making that had absolutely no hope of being remotely good? What went wrong? What led you to this point, Mr. McNamara? I don't think I've ever had a bad film confound me so much, and seen some major shit. But even with films that I hate more so than this one, they still had loftier goals and ideas that might have had some potential behind them. This is truly one of those rare cases where the idea was utterly hopeless. In fact, I haven't had a film make me ponder so much about its meanings since the Yasujiro Ozu masterpiece, Late Spring. Bratz is the antithesis to a film like Late Spring - it makes you ponder and contemplate for horrified and bewildered reasons, like trying to make sense of a tragic, senseless death.\n\nThe film focuses on 4 racially-stereotyped friends: Cloe, the bland blonde-haired white girl, Yasmin, the girl who's so Mexican there's a mariachi band in the house, her and her mother sing \"La Cucaracha\" at one point in the film, has an annoying brother with a thick Spanish accent, and there's also a Chevy Impala in their driveway (As if to remind you, \"Hey, did you know that they're Mexicans?\"), Jade, the smart Asian, and Sasha, the smart black girl whose parents are divorced.\n\nThe girls have been the best of friends ever since they were little and talk so much that they even skype one another. The girls are also obsessed with fashion and constantly discuss their outfits with one another. The girls are now getting ready to go to high school, where they assume that they'll all still be the best of friends.\n\nBut, as it turns out, that won't be the case, thanks to the principal's daughter, Meredith Baxter, who inexplicably has a dictatorial-style reign over the school and social cliques. Soon, the girls are split into different social cliques: Cloe joins the soccer team and immediately becomes only friends with the soccer team, Sasha becomes a cheerleader and only hangs out with other cheerleaders, Jade thanks to her stereotype, joins the science club and only hangs out with other members of the club, and Yasmin joins journalism, though she is most upset by this change events. It also turns out that Yasmin has singing talent, and with help from a deaf kid who is apparently a musical prodigy himself, she starts to grow in her talent. All the girls also meet attractive boys in their respective clubs.\n\n2 years later in high school, and after being separated from one another, clumsy Yasmin inadvertently starts a food fight that results in all 4 girls being sent to detention after a statue of the principal is damaged during the food fight. After briefly hating one another for ending up in this situation, they become friends again, determined to end the cliques and get everyone to hang out together, resulting in a series of confrontations with the bitchy Meredith and planning a musical number for the upcoming talent show.\n\nThe storyline should have been a light, fluffy, albeit stupid bit of comedic fun. But even at the most basic levels, the story is completely doomed, which is made worse by how badly this film botches its messages about social cliques, self-esteem, and friendship. There is no reason to root for any of the characters as they are all soulless stereotypes which believe that through fashion and musical numbers, people will be brought together. No, Bratz. No they won't. The storyline makes me ponder the mental states of 3 - count 'em - 3 writers of this utter abortion, especially with all the stereotypes, poor messages, questionable role models, and complete lack of anything resembling a modicum of quality. The story is of such low quality that my brain felt like it was shutting down because of how the story will do absolutely nothing to engage it. You know how some people say that they would rather watch paint dry, and throw it around too often when discussing something they hate? Here, that would not be just throwing it around. Watching paint dry would literally be more stimulating than paying attention to this story.\n\nI wonder how desperate an aspiring actor would have to be to agree to be in a film like this. Are you really so desperate to make a name for yourself in Hollywood that you would star in this film? You'd have less shame appearing in hardcore porn or bizarre fetish videos than you would starring in Bratz. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the cast was left with severe PTSD and found themselves locked in the padded room of an insane asylum for the rest of their lives after starring in this film. At a minimum, if I had starred in this film, I would have gone into hiding and never speak to anyone again out of shame.\n\nThe acting is horrible, but very difficult to properly describe. In fact, I will never be able to fully describe it to you. Well, to start off with the actresses, imagine the most irritating depictions of high school or college girls you've ever seen, or even just of prissy, fashion-obsessed girls you've ever seen in films. Now take those irritations you've felt and multiply them at least one hundred fold. Those are the performances given by the actresses in this film. They give performances that are bad beyond any earthly word. I don't even know if the darkest depths of Hell have a proper word for this sort of bad acting.\n\nThe other cast members are hardly any better, and continuing his downward spiral, Jon Voight appears in this film as the principal, and seems to have given up any semblance of respect he once had for acting. He gives one of the most hollow, soulless, dead-behind-the-eyes performances I've ever seen in films.\n\nThe acting is bad past the point of extraordinary, and crosses into the realm of legendary. You won't believe it, and you can't describe it to others. It is something that must be witnessed, but that would be too cruel a task to do.\n\nThere is no entertainment. There is literally nothing of redeeming value to be found. There's hardly a story, there are no likable or living characters, there is no funny humor, every song and dance number is excruciating (And this is coming from someone who gave Xanadu 5/5 stars and Grease 2 4/5 stars), the messages negate themselves, and it's overall an annoying, boring, and soul-sucking experience to endure. Have you ever known what it's felt like to watch a film so bad that it feels like it's sucking out the will to live? That's what Bratz will do to you, I shit you not. I hated the characters and hoped that they would all die, so the film would end faster, or perhaps that I would die and the agony would be over.\n\nThough I would talk about the humor in a longer paragraph, I'm not going to. It is unspeakably bad.\n\nShortly before he died, Roger Ebert released his final list of the 10 best films he had ever seen. One of them was Citizen Kane. In the brief section about Citizen Kane, he talked about he and other film scholars spent several hours studying every single frame of that film. EVERY FRAME. I would never do that, no matter how much I loved a film. But it wouldn't take that kind of examination to tell you that every single frame of Bratz is a complete failure. Just pause the film at any point and try to find something of value in that still frame. You can't. There is nothing.\n\nBratz has now cemented itself as being not only one of the 10 worst comedies, musicals, chick flicks, and family films, it has now gone down as one of the 10 all-time worst films I have ever seen, period. Save your sanity. Save your soul. Save yourself. Once you watch Bratz, you will not come out of it the same person you were before. It is a life-changing, unforgettable bad film that will haunt me for the rest of my days, as I forever try to figure out how something so horrible and misconceived was ever allowed to exist or be pitched to studios in the first place. It is one of the ultimate tragedies of bad film-making. A film so heinous, it could be reclassified as a war crime or at least, an inhumane form of torture by the Geneva Convention.",
