A simple story told in the most interesting and enjoyable manner. The film's first hour is enjoyable, the second is exactly the same. 'Jab We Met' holds your attention from almost start to end, leaving the viewer completely satisfied. The film was a success at the box office, and has remained to be a fan favorite. Thumbs up! Songs: The sound-track is a brownie point. Tum Se Hi and Mauja Hi Mauja are superb songs.Performances: Kareena Kapoor is outstanding. She got all the awards in the best actress category and she, without a doubt deserved them. Shahid Kapur is fantastic. He's natural from start to end. Pawan Malhotra and Dara Singh are good in supporting role. Samuya Tandon looks cute. Tarun Arora is adequate.On the whole, 'Jab We Met' is a pure example of entertaining cinema. As said before, its one the finest romantic films to come out of Indian Cinema in years.",

            "content": "Imtiaz Ali's Jab We Met is one of the most refreshing love stories made in recent times. It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film's mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor's film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks.",

            "content": "Devasted by the news that his recently widowed mother has decided to remarry and that his fianc\u00e9 has chosen another man to wed, a wealthy businessman by the name of \"Aditya D. Kashyap\" (Shahid Kapoor) boards a train in Mumbai to get away from it all. He doesn't know where the train is heading and doesn't really care. He just wants to be left alone and, in his misery, even contemplates suicide while on the train. It's during this time that he happens to meet a young woman by the name of \"Geet Kaur Dhillon\" (Kareena Kapoor) who is not only extremely talkative but also radiates a positive personality as well. To that extent, she even suggests that he travels with her to her small village in order to marry her younger sister \"Roop Kaur Dhillon\" (Saumya Tandon) at the same time she elopes with her secret boyfriend \"Anshuman\" (Pawan Malhotra) so that the two of them can be related by law. Needless to say, Aditya thinks she is completely insane but when the two of them temporarily disembark from the train-and subsequently become stranded in another village--he finds himself becoming more enmeshed in her crazy scheme. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I stumbled upon this film quite by accident and I didn't know whether I would like it or not. To my surprise, I found it to be a really cute romantic-comedy which passed the time extremely well. I especially liked the performances of both Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapooro who played their parts quite well and seemed to enjoy working with one another. That being said, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

I've had the misfortune of watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical Indian touch.This movie had that touch. Kareena proved that she can indeed act without over-acting and the chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.I loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad.

However, there is something different about this movie which sets it apart from the usual stuff. It is fresh and young - something which is missing these days. The songs too keep playing in your head long after you've listened to them. In short, it is not a drag.Both Shahid Kapur and Kareena seem to be at their peak in this movie. I don't know how to compare their roles in this movie to ones in their previous flicks, but I must admit that they make a good pair. Kareena's excessively talkative personality matches very nicely with Shahid's reserved character. There are no villains too. It is a pity that Shahid and Kareena will not be starring together in the foreseeable future...Enjoy! (8/10)",

Tell me if you know any American or European actress who can even start to level with her in terms of style and beauty - and most of all - charm. None! Because of her, this movie is one of the most endearing love stories I have ever seen. It just makes you fall in love - what better can you say about a romance?

            "content": "Remember Hrishida's movies? We laughed with it, loved it, because he created the characters who we could relate. You look around, these characters are in one of your friends. Imtiaz Ali is in the same league. The characters, the shots, the sets, the train, the bus - we have been there! We have lived them.And he creates a gem incorporating these elements. It is humour in pure form! It will brighten you up, no matter how grumpy you may be feeling! I think this is one of the loveliest movie of the year. Pure, unadulterated fun! The strength of the movie is in its script, and in its characters, esp that of Kreena Kpoor (try saying that, you know what I mean) - yeah - Ms Kapoor is in her elements. She plays the role of sikhni convincingly! The lingo, the body language, the attitude, she is 100%! Kareena Kapoor 2.0 (that's what I call post Chameli) rocks! Every movie, she surprises with histrionics, that is very few in current Bollywood can match! And what a transformation from Omkara's Dolly? That's real actress right there! Shahid Kapoor... mmmm, could improve in the acting dept. If I were to choose, I would choose someone like Shreyas Talpade for this role. Shahid has definitely matured as an actor from his chocolate-boy image, but still leaves something to be desired.In my opinion, the comedy is one of the most difficult of the genres. To execute it well without sounding cheap, or going overboard, or cheesy, is not really easy. Imtiaz Ali, in this case does justice to two most important depts, Writing & Direction! A word about music: Pritam brings a fresh set of music, some of it grows on you after listening few times. Definitely I am not talking of the radio-friendly Mauja Hi Mauja, which is tailor-made for music video channels. Songs like Aao Milo Chalo, Tum Se Hi are real nice pop or soft-rockish tunes. Sandesh Shandilya shares the burden on Aaoge Jab Tum, and Rashid Khan does a fine job on the vocals. On Tum Se Hi, watch out for Ustad Sultan Khan's ever soulful crooning.I still give it a 8/10 because Shahid Kapoor's acting has rooms for improvement, the second half has rooms for editing and making it more compact. But the movie is worth watching just for Kareena Kapoor's acting! Way to go Imtiaz Ali!",

Lot of Jab We Met brought back all that even before the week ended.There is so much life in some people we meet, they infuse faith back in it for us with their sheer presence. Geet is happy-go-lucky girl living life on her terms. Aditya is at the lowest ebb of his life. They meet and life changes for both of them.Imtiaz Ali knows how to make small, endearing films. His characters are next door, his settings are small towns or cities and his stories are simple. He did it well with Socha Na Tha and Ahista Ahista. He hits bang on again with Jab We Met.The casting is precise. I was pleasantly surprised to see Shahid mature up to his role and Kareena bring alive the lively Punjabi girl that she plays. Both of them then slipped into their role reversals with equal ease. Rest of the cast is equally good. I'd like to see more of Pawan Malhotra. He is a very talented actor but hardly seen around.The background score sets an intriguing tone within minutes of the film starting. But it does not maintain that high standard throughout and averages out. The music, otherwise, has some romantic and bhangra numbers which won't stay on charts for long.Jab We Met is an entertaining romantic comedy. Go and enjoy it.",

Imtiaz is going on in his improvement to produce every time a better movie. And it should inspire all the directors of his genre. The scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like Chandigarh, Kulu, Manali and Shimla, and this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves a real tour. Again and again seeing daily studio scenes made the eyes wounded and fed up the mind. And thats why it's a nice pick up at nice time. Although the storyline is not that new with the old movies as a boy meets girl and slowly fall in love but the way Imtiaz presented each and every scenes are worth to watch. From the beginning to the end I personally enjoyed the whole movie, and happy to spend some amount of bucks on it. After Shikhar this is second time in which Shahid has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day. But I was damn irritated by Kareena's irritating and annoying much chatty and talkative role. But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story. For Shahid's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!).",

            "content": "In Jab We Met, a heartbroken guy meets a wacky, headstrong girl on a train who upends his life as she drags him into her adventures.Kareena Kapoor is hilarious as the wacky girl. Her endless monologue to the guy is long-winded prattle that is both annoying and charming. She is the equivalent of characters like Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby; a madcap who irritates and fascinates the guy she has swept into her tornado.The movie bounces along effortlessly for the first couple of hours, with scenery, chemistry, and pleasant but generally forgettable musical interludes, but gets a little messy in the final third. Kapoor's actions go a little beyond wacky, a lot of very unlikely things happen, motivations seem arbitrary and it's all a reminder of why American screwball comedies stay well under 2 hours.In spite of a shaky and somewhat peculiar (or just so Indian-specific that a westerner like me doesn't get it?) final hour, overall this is a charming, funny, and romantic movie well worth watching.",

            "content": "Jab We Met is definitely one of the best movies I've seen so far. Everything is very nice about this movie, totally perfect.My Reviews: Kareena Kapoor - She really impressed me with this movie. I love how the way she portrayed the lovable & talkative Geet to the sensitive & sad Geet on the second half. She is the life of the movie, no doubt.Shahid Kapoor - We all know that Shahid is a good actor, but in this movie, we saw something different. We are used to see Shahid in chocolate, college stories, but Jab We Met proved that he can do serious roles without any problems.Music: Mauja Hi Mauja would definitely my favorite. They saved the best for the last. Mauja Hi Mauja is the best song for the film. But for some reason, it reminded me of \"Macarena\" (a popular Spanglish song) and \"Simarik\" (a famous Turkish song).Story: It's really a very predictable story, but I can say it's refreshing. Why? Most Bollywood movies have heroines that are very \"damsel-in-distress\" and have no relevance in the story. Jab We Met, on the other hand, has a female for a lead. You can see a woman's pain when she's heartbroken, which I can say is very realistic and I can totally relate to it.Overall, 9/10 is my rating. Good movie, good actors, good story, good music. Very good. :)",

            "content": "None from my family were that keen about this film. I myself preferred watching a movie directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali instead of this and didn't pay much heed to this film. 'Another love story' I thought because, even though Sanjay's film too are love stories, they have a delightful charm in them which make them stupendous.I was taken aback after the critics gave this film a 4 out of 5 stars and then, my family decided to watch this movie on the big screen. I yet was ambivalent whether it would live up to my expectations, after watching preposterously bad films like Dhol, Muskaan etc.I myself admit that I am harsh as a critic and most of my reviews, whether bollywood or Hollywood, are somewhat criticizing the film in some or the other way. I never go with very high expectations, just as a 'normal person', without any feelings to review my feelings after watching the movie and after I left the theater, I was happy and that meant, that the movie was good.I am afraid that I might give away some important details of the movie deliberately; therefore, I am not going into the story details. I will first mention the points that I liked in the movie:1) The performances of both the lead characters were strong. Shahid as the 'jeevan see hara hua' man and Kareena as the 'sweet, bumbling but annoying chatterbox' are at top notch in this movie and their chemistry is clearly visible. Shahid, thank God, is portraying a much matured role in this film unlike his other movies and Kareena is just Kareena with great acting.2) The humor was good in this film. Karrena has good comedy timing while Shahid's expressions just makes anyone laugh, especially in the first half. I even liked the character who plays Kareena's boy friend as he was really funny and it was humorous to watch him get agitated by you'll know when you watch the movie.3) The first half was really good, witty and humorous as the audience didn't get bored or didn't feel to leave their seats. 4) The songs were a mixture of catchy and melodious. 'Mauja MAuja' and 'Yeh Ishq hai' were really good songs while the others too were decent.Now, in one paragraph, I will explain the flaws in this movie. I coudn't understand Dara Singh's role at all nor was he funny. The camera effects were not amazing and I felt that the editing was somewhat odd and glitchy. I suddenly realized that the characters were in another place. One or two of the scenes looked as if they were taken from another movie and pasted into this movie. Some of the jokes too were childish and a bit loud. The second part was dragging and you felt as if it was monotonous, that is, if you compare it with the first part. Overall, it was a relief to watch this movie as I was relieved from a state of shock after watching the abominable film Dhol. But I didn't feel that I could watch it for the second tome immediately after leaving the theater and even after a few days after watching the film. 7 out of 10.",

Same situation same actors has brought such a new , absolute fresh piece of cinema, which probably would have been another needle in the hack had it been directed by any run of the mill director. The store line is the usual girl meets boy on a journey moving towards their own destinations and eventually fall in love but again the execution is so damn superb and realistic that no situation in the movie looks out of place. The dialogs are sparkling despite being mature. The funny moments are truly funny and emotions look absolute real. U immediately relate to them. Over all the chemistry Imtiaz Ali (who directed soocha na tha) manages to built between the lead characters is stunning, absolute real, natural and believable, I have not seen (and I am sure people would agree) such a sweet and heart warming chemistry in any romantic couple for a loooong time. Music is good as well with 2 absolutely amazing romantic songs........\"Tum he se\" and \"Aaoge jab tum\".

He leaves his Mercedes on the street and wanders about, then jumps on to the first train he sees. A good-looking fast talking Punjabi kudi (Kareena Kapoor) hops on to same train and talks non-stop, even in her sleep, driving the moping hero to brink of insanity. He hops off, she hops off to help him get back on, misses the train, and thus begins a madcap journey from Bombay to Bhatinda. Sound improbable? Hackneyed? Forget all that and go on this most enjoyable journey with Kareena and Shahid. Shahid has a long way to go before he can be an actor of any note, and his chocolate boy looks require much more than a pair of glasses to be toned down, but by the end of it you feel that it was not a bad effort. Kareena has finally come into her own as an actress, first as the very serious Dolly of Omkara, and now as the most frivolous and most convincingly garrulous Geet. She demonstrates her acting skills to the fullest and looks very good in the process.The movie is a modern day Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge with chance meetings, missed trains, shared hotel rooms, partings, families, elopements and is bubbling with a youthful fun feel. Someone told me that in this film one misses the Shahrukh of the 90s! This was a role inspired by the quintessential lover-boy of our times and 10 years ago he would have run with it and turned Jab We Met into an outstanding film! But even so, the film still works \u0096 has fun music, great chemistry between the lead pair and above all has a most real feel to it. And it is funny, \"Akeli Ladki to Khuli Hui Tijori Hoti Hai\"; the boyfriend telling Shahid \u0096 \"Now her brothers want to take me to the sugarcane fields. Why should I go to the sugarcane fields with them? I won't go!' Next shot shows him holding some sugar cane! The settings, the locales, the songs, the trains, automobiles, everything is imparted a never before seen ambiance by sophomore director Imtiaz Ali. The story is not new but the treatment is super fresh like a fresh glass of Nimbupani in baking heat! Jab We Met is one fine entertainer and worth a repeat watch. The film is ruled by Kareena; a new female star emerges, and is able to carry the film on her shoulders.",

Towards the end of 2000s, we were almost inundated with many of these to the point that most viewers were tired of it. So when I saw this one a couple of years ago, my expectations were minimal to zero. I watched it while working on computer, something in the background. I did not care to watch it until it came out on DVDs. However, it turned out to be the best romcom I have seen to date. It works primarily because of these three ingredients: - Genuine storyline, quite realistic without going too OTT - Charming and very likable character played by Kareena - Music by Pritam, the recycling king/Bhappi Lahri of the 2000sToo bad Imitiaz Ali could not follow it up with as good a movie. Love Aaj Kal, while pretty good, does not come close to this. I have watched it 3 times since my first viewing. Highly recommend!",

Its great, a very good mix of business and life (im a business student) and it teaches so much about life. I recommend this movie to everyone. The plot is excellent, a bit predictable just like any Hindi movie , but the way the story goes is great. The humor is great, although some of my friends complained of it being a bit dry, but you need an open mind to enjoy it and look beyond the obvious. The songs are beautiful, has an ending item song which is a great dance mix. Has soft songs (atif aslam style), a punjabi song (bhangra style) and pretty much its a complete movie for everyone. A great Family Movie and A Great Date Movie.",

            "content": "When this movie actually knocked off a few shows of the high profile Saawariya I knew I had to see it, the reviews were very good as well and i must confess i had unnecessarily high expectations from this movie.The first thing that struck me about this movie was Kareena Kapoor, I've never really liked her, but the moment i saw her climb the train i was smitten, the non-bitchy look really works for her, and i must confess my opinion of her after this movie has completely changed, she looked superb and her acting was very good as well, HER LOUD TALKATIVE CHARACTER ENDEARED MOST OF THE TIMES BUT THERE WERE TIMES IT GOT ON THE NERVES AS WELL (may have been intentional).THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS COMPLETELY HER MOVIE, shahid makes very good attempts at making this film his but there is no doubt who will walk away with all the kudos.The movie starts quite well and at a good pace, the hotel decent sequence was particularly brilliant, as were most scenes with the family throughout the movie.The entire cast including does very well with very good casting specially of the family, nobody really had much of a role except shahid and kareena but each and everyone does a good job in their limited roles.The movie really loses out is towards the later part of the second half, the reconciliation scene between the 2, the useless song, and the extra long stretched out sequence before the light dawns on Kareena was particularly excruciating though surprisingly un-melodramatic, still this is clearly the weakest part of the movie and what brings down the ratings.The humour and the 2 main protagonists are clearly the hallmarks of this movie, but what also endears is the lack of melodrama even the climax of the movie which is tailor made for tears had none of them, the kiss was unnecessary considering most of us have scene photos/mms of a much more passionate kiss between the two, hehahaha.The cinematography of this movie was also very good, the filmmakers were equally adept at capturing the small town station, as they were with the haveli, and the mountains.THE LACK OF FOREIGN LOCALES WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD, AND THIS MOVIE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE SCENIC BEAUTY OF India IS MORE THAT ADEQUATE. Indeed the mountains and its people looked brilliant, im sure thats where im going for my next vacation.I am an \"in the closet\" romantic comedy lover (obviously ill deny it later), and although i give it full marks for the lack of melodrama ((which is most undesirable for me), the over stretched ending was still very bad.IF you keep the right expectations unlike me and maybe even pay lesser rates like me than this movie is a clear winner, watch it on TV or DVD and you cant go wrong.-s the end and nothing but the end.+/-s kareena did annoy sometimes.+s Kareena Kapoor, less melodrama, good comedy, nice small movie feel, great acting all around.total 7/'0 (just fell below expectations that may have been too high but don't want to spoil others experience by giving it a higher rating).",

Every scene shines in brilliance as if they were cherry-picked and delivered on the screen. Kareena Kapoor:: The bubbling and bursting with verbal diarrhoea \"Geet\" I am sure you and I have met somebody of the likes at least once. Tailor- made for Kareena Kapoor and she delivers with utmost perfection at ease. It reminds me the Jekyll & Hyde which was earlier attempted in \"Chandni\" and that role did wonders to Sridevi's career. No wonder Kareena catapulted to the big league subsequently.Shahid Kapoor:: Easily manages to don the hats of a heart-broken lover to enthusiastic and a suave technocrat brimming with fresh ideas. The supporting cast is good namely Dara Singh, Pavan Malhotra and Kiran Juneja. You can't help but pity for Tarun Malhotra (such is the characterisation of Anshuman). There is not a single dull moment in the movie. The screenplay sails like a breeze. Every time the movie is aired on telly, I can't resist to watch it. The music had a slow-start but later on went to become a must have in the collection. \"Jab We Met\" turned corners for three people namely Imtiaz Ali, Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor.",

That doesn't mean, there haven't been better movies, or the actors in Jab We Met haven't given better performances elsewhere. It only means, somewhere in those 2.5 hours, Jab We Met metamorphoses into something far more substantial than just a movie. On the surface, its a simple story of a guy and a girl but if u dive deep enough, it is a heartwarming assortment of stories, about losing and finding love, about internal and external journeys, about forgetting and rediscovering oneself, about letting go with a smile and above all about finding hope in despair. I won't go into the details of the plot, screenplay, acting,direction or any such technical aspect. You will find plenty of people telling you about that. I can only tell you how i can speak every single dialog, having repeated them a million times in my head, or how I can hum those songs which cheer me every time I feel alone. One little thing though, I can't articulate is how Aditya and Geet stay in my heart permanently and keep telling me once in a while.... \"Go listen to your heart, everything will be fine then.\"",

But the good thing is that the movie makes the audience tickles. And it's really unfortunate that now when Karina and Shaheed chemistry looking good, they are separated.The movie starts with the character of Aditya Kashyap (Shaheed Kapur) running away from his responsibilities giving away hopes in life. And the in the journey he met with Geet (Kareen Kapur), whose destination is Matinda. Geet is a jolly young girl who leaves in her own dream world, and follows her heart everywhere. The things happen in such a way that Aditya gives company to Geet to her house, and also helps her to run away from her house and to find her true love Anshuman (Tarun Arora). All these situations changes the perception of Aditya to see the world, and he too started to follow his heart and face the challenges rather than avoiding those. He finds out that there is more to see in the world than just meet the eyes. But on other side, Anshuman refuses Geet and Geet gets shattered. Now it is for Aditya to bring back Geet in her life.The second attempt of the director Imtiaz Ali 'Jab we met' in first half hour puts some expectation and at the end succeeds in meeting those. The scenes in first half are impressive, funny and achieve the desired effects. The second half though predictable and not so excite at least put the audience on chair. Even though some scenes are a bit stretched far from reality they do not break the speed of the movie. E.g. the second time Geet miss the train due to her stupidity, makes us think whether the girls are really these stupid? Music without any doubt has scored points in this movie. The songs are not only good to hear and see but also occurs at proper points in the movie, and do not give the feeling that they are bombarded on us. Acting wise, the lead actors Shaheed and Kareena had done a very good and admirable job. Shaheed looks good in serious roles than in jolly roles. And he now days he is improving fast. Kareena I guess by now is enough mature to understand the depth of the characters she does.Over and all 'jab we met' is a good experience. Though the concept and theme is not new, the execution is sweet and cute. You won't regret watching this one.",

There is no doubt that this is Shahid's best performance and he has succeeded in doing justice to his role. Kareena's performance too is sparkling. Music and background score is OK. Direction by Imtiaz Ali is exceptional. The way he narrates the story is impeccable. The editor too needs a special mention. He has made sure that this film is not dragged.

            "content": "Who can resist a good love story and Jab We Met is exactly that \u2013 a warm, fuzzy, and for the most part, original love story. Both passengers on a Delhi-bound train, Shahid Kapur stars as Aditya, a dejected young fellow who's nursing a broken heart when he bumps into Geet, the annoyingly cheerful chatterbox played by Kareena Kapoor. At first exasperated by her over-enthusiastic disposition, Aditya soon warms up to Geet's spontaneity and even embraces her inherent joie de vivre when he's forced to make a long journey with her. Traveling all the way to her home in Bhatinda turns out to be an eventful trip for Aditya and Geet who go their own separate ways after a few days spent with her extended family. It's many months later and under entirely different circumstances that they meet again, and must make another long journey together, but this time with the excess baggage of their confused feelings.Despite the film's severely flawed second half which is too long, too contrived and predictable to the extent of being seriously boring, Jab We Met is still an engaging watch because it sets off on such a fresh note. It's the film's first hour or so that wins you over with its simple charm, its immensely likable characters, and the intrinsic humour in the writing. Making a conscious effort to avoid clich\u00e9, the screenplay rustles up a bunch of pleasant surprises in the form of some unforgettable scenes that stay in your head long after you've left the cinema. Like that one in which Aditya and Geet hire a room for the night in a shady hotel in a small-town, or the one in which a talkative station-master is put in his place by the sharp-tongued Geet, or even that one in which Geet tries to persuade Aditya to elope with her cousin. It's the film's excellent dialogue that ensures there's never a dull moment \u2013 at least until intermission. The real magic of this film lies in the performances of its two main leads who seize your attention from the moment they first appear on screen. Uninhibited and spontaneous, Kareena Kapoor is the soul of this picture, its biggest strength, as she brings alive her character with not just those smart lines, but with the kind of candor actors seldom invest in their work. I can't think of a greater compliment to pay her than to say with full confidence that no actress could play Geet better than Kareena has. Despite the risk of being overshadowed by Kareena, her co-star in the film, Shahid Kapur, leaves an indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature, and indeed the perfect foil to Kareena's boisterousness. Together, they set off such sparks, that the strength of their chemistry alone is enough to make up for several inconsistencies in the screenplay.Fresher than any romantic comedy you've seen this year Jab We Met works because it delivers what it promises \u2013 a snug, heart-warming, relatable love story, indeed a respectable follow-up to director Imtiaz Ali's last film Socha Na Tha. But because much of that freshness is replaced by mundane predictability in the film's second half, Jab We Met cannot claim to be a perfect film. Too many songs, hummable though they may be, slacken the pace of the screenplay, and the DDLJ influence is a little too in-your-face to ignore. In the final analysis, however, these are a few wrong turns in an otherwise entertaining film. It's a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring a smile to your face.",

A great impractical but refreshing love story with evergreen songs. The way it is shown that how 2 people meet in the train and many incidents happen with them in such a way that they fall in love to each other. A man who is depressed from his love and business life is about to commit suicide but apparently meets a talkative punjabi girl and he learnt from her behaviour which changes her life.\nThe songs are incredible. The softness by Mohit Chauhan, Shreya Ghoshal and Sonu Nigam and a bit mixture of Punjabi tadka of Mika Singh makes these songs extremely beautiful. A damn good choreography in song Mauja Hi Mauja.\nKareena's acting is fantastic. The storyline is also good but predictable. Overall a good movie with great 2000s songs. Loved the movie and its songs.",

            "content": "Though pleasing to the eyes for it's scenic and lively shots throughout, this movie lacks a strong story line, and a weak third angle even makes it further implausible for the viewers to understand what the heck this heroine is up to ! If Aditya Kashyap , the hero , played by Shahid , is so cool , and restrained , mature , surprisingly for his age , why is he shown thinking of committing suicide, by jumping off the train ? Agreed, he is a businessman , and an accomplished one at that , makes it even more inexplicable , why does he embark upon a meaningless journey , just because his girlfriend has married some body else ? Geet, the bold and beautiful girl, out in the big, bad world , to get united with her man , who simply isn't appreciative of her daring, and refuses to yield to her pleas for getting married , is not convincing at all . What had Geet seen her in this guy called Anjuman , one wonders. He looks like any other ordinary fellow next door. Though shown as a straightforward , outspoken , and talkative , unassuming and all that, doesn't she practically use Aditya , for eloping from her home , which is actually full of so many people, enough to form a small hamlet of a village. They are loving, affectionate , and enthusiastic. so Geet's exercise in running away from there , is far from convincing. She never discloses to Aditya during their drives, and long journeys , that she loves some body else ? why does she ask him, how does he find her , or hug him at every possible excuse ? Firstly she antagonizes Manjeet , the groom to be, then Anjuman , and all the while continues to confuse Aditya. Period away from home mentioned as nine months , is also unbelievable . Aditya conveniently thinks Geet is with Anjuman, the joint family thinks she has eloped with Aditya , and Anjuman thinks he has got rid of her ! what a mess ! All the bad words , curses , and abuses from Geet , surprisingly bring this man's emotions to life , and he is now ready to do any thing what she plans ! so much so for the choices abuses working wonderfully ! Shahid looks younger than Kareena , in spite of his spectacles , Kareena is mostly annoying because of her dialog delivery , and looks haggard due to excessive dieting to reduce her weight , and look matching for Shahid , but alas ! Compare her with Kajol in Dilwale , where she has been engaged to Salman , to get married shortly, while actually she still loves Shah Rukh. A sincere effort, but an average performance , nothing great there . Music score and choreography is tolerable, but all the while , it fails to involve the viewer fully into it , mainly because of the faulty plot line. And who is that guy Anjuman ? poor fellow becomes pathetic all the time. The writer-director probably was himself not sure as to what exactly to call this train encounter, chasing missing trains , and finally trying and catching the running train again, as Geet says, so he concocted this title ,which starts with a Hindi word for when, and puts we met in front of it ! Perhaps the runaway train would have been a more apt one . Does any one gets reminded of the runaway bride ? If only the heroine's efforts to behave as per her mind's inclinations , as she claims to be , would have come out more strongly, and her desirable man was shown as having a real strong personality, the movie could have been different , than just another ride through rural India .",

            "content": "First of all let's get my pet peeve over with. Jab We Met, seriously? Like what, you met each other and then gave each other a jab? It should have been Jub We Met. With that said, Jab We Met was one of the first films that I watched after we got our TV. There are many things I like about this film and there are many that I don't. My mom really liked this film and had told us to watch it too. I wasn't really into watching films since I was at the age of watching cartoons (and since the TV had just come, I was more interested in the cartoons). And so I watched it, and it's pretty mediocre.Jab We Met is a character driven, light hearted film. The story moves with the characters. So here we have two characters. Aditya is a software engineer or a singer (I have no idea what he was) who is very depressed and got on a train because he wanted to commit suicide. Geet is a happy go lucky woman who is about to get married in Bhatinda. She is constantly trying to talk to him with many jump cuts from the same camera angle. Finally she misses the train and decides to take Aditya with himself. They both go to Bhatinda, where Manjeet is about to marry Geet.But Geet and Aditya run away from home because Geet loves someone else who basically ignored her. So afterwards their situations exchange. Now Geet is depressed and Aditya is happy. But since she ran from home, her family gets Aditya and tells him to find her so that she comes back home and gets married to Manjeet. But when they are back, Geet asks Aditya if Manjeet is looking at them and when Aditya says he is, she hugs him. And that's why their marriage is called off. Because friends never hug each other, especially not in 2007.The film is funny, though the acting, choreography, story are all terrible. It's one of those films that you would keep your mind away while watching. It's like a Govinda film for an educated audience. The fact that a film like Jab We Met is considered so good and nostalgic clearly shows how bad Bollywood is. In order to create memories we have to compromise on such a mediocre, senseless film. Nowadays we have many films like these, but this is what will live on with us because it was one of the first films to give us a taste of this genre.",

First of all, the music.

However, checked and it was a mere 7.9.\nCome on guys! This is heights.\nAditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is a wealthy industrialist struggling with his business and personal life. With his company in a bad condition and his girlfriend marrying another man, he becomes depressed and wanders aimlessly until he boards a train, wanting to get away from his life. Inside, he meets another passenger, Geet Dhillon (Kareena Kapoor), a bubbly, talkative Sikh girl. Irritated by her talkativeness, he lashes out at her, but she thinks nothing of it, understanding that he is upset.When Geet sees that Aditya has gotten off the train, she disembarks to let him know the train is leaving but ends up missing it herself. Aditya reluctantly helps her get to the next station but Geet misses the train again. Now stranded, she announces to the exasperated Aditya that she won't leave him alone until he drops her back home and the duo embark on a road trip to reach her house in Bhatinda. During the trip, they bond and Aditya begins to feel better, enjoying himself with Geet. At her home, he meets her large family, who shower him with affection for taking care of Geet and make him stay for a week. After her family tries to get Geet engaged to someone else, she decides to run away, as she has already confided in Aditya about the man she loves, Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Sure that her family wouldn't agree to their marriage, her plan is to run away, marry Anshuman, then come back and beg for forgiveness. That night, the two flee, and her enraged family assumes she has eloped with Aditya. The two head to Manali, where Anshuman lives. She tells Aditya to come meet Anshuman with her, but Aditya, now in love with her, bids her farewell.Nine months later, Aditya's company is now a lot more successful and Aditya is more positive about life, having been influenced by Geet. He launches a calling card in Geet's name, which her family sees on TV. Believing Geet and Aditya are together, her uncles angrily confront Aditya, revealing that Geet has not contacted them for nine months and they have no idea where she is. Baffled by this revelation, Aditya promises that he will bring her back. He travels to Manali to meet Anshuman and discovers that Anshuman coldly rejected Geet the day Aditya dropped her off at his house.Having learned that Geet is in Shimla, Aditya travels there and is shocked to find her as a depressed and quiet schoolteacher. He cheers her up by making her call Anshuman and swear at him, taking out all her anger. Guilt-ridden, Anshuman asks to get back together. Geet reluctantly patches up with him after Aditya advises her, though she is visibly distressed. The three of them drive back to Bhatinda and to their shock, Geet's family welcomes Geet and Aditya as a couple since they believe the two eloped, taking Anshuman to be Aditya's friend. Geet sees how Aditya and her family get along while Anshuman is rather standoffish and annoyed by them. She gets a chance to tell her mom the truth about Anshuman but can't bring herself to do it. The preparations for their wedding begin.The next day, Anshuman explains to Geet how the two of them will go tell her family about him and remove Aditya from the picture. As an oncoming train drowns out his words, Geet has an epiphany - she loves Aditya and he is the one for her. She runs after Aditya, who is leaving, and declares her feelings and the two finally unite. They get married and have twin daughters.",

She cannot stop talking a la Basanti in Sholay. She tries to help out the Shahid the business man as if she were an agony aunt while Shahid wants to get rid of her. So he gets down midway in the night at some station but Kareena finding him out of berth gets down from the train to get him back but instead finds herself out of the train. She gets angry on Shahid and he takes a taxi for her to Ratlam. In Ratlam station she enters into an argument with a shopkeeper and loses the train again . She and Shahid then go to a hotel for the night and they narrowly escape the police raid in the hotel. During these escapades they get to know each other. Shahid has lost in love whereas Kareena , the happy-go-lucky eternal optimist is in love and is going home to Bhatinda from where she will go to her lover at Manali, marry and settle. All this without her family's knowledge. Shahid learns to forget his woes and be happy after he meets Kareena and slowly falls in love with her. He reaches Bhatinda only to be embroiled in another controversy. The parents of Kareena have called her childhood friend Manmeet to settle her marriage. In order to get rid of him she feigns love with Shahid. She also runs away from the house to Manali with Shahid to her love. Shahid leaves her at Manali and goes back to his business at Mumbai.In nine months with newfound enthusiasm he revives his business and launches new products .

Ther the confusion starts that all the family members think Shahid to be her lover and pamper him. The confusion ends when Kareena realizes that Shahid is right for her and marries him. Kareen is superb as Geet and so is Shahid. Both generate a chemistry which shows their real love for each other. Umfortunately the break up in real life betrays these feelings.

Geet (Kareena Kapoor) and Aditya (Shahid Kapoor) have polar opposite personalities when they initially meet each other in a train. Aditya was quite depressed and was contemplating suicide at this time. However, due to Geet's clumsiness, she misses her train while trying to get Aditya back in the train when he gets off at a station and shows no inclination to return. After the crazy sequence of events, we are treated with some magical moments as they travel with each other in order to reach Geet's hometown of Bathinda. Kareena Kapoor is charming, charismatic and unbelievably energetic in her role which might be her finest work in film. Shahid Kapoor plays more of a recluse who is a rich businessman but due to some personal issues, he is quite unhappy and does not live his life to the fullest. The soundtrack obviates the need of a background score and contains some of the most memorable songs in recent memory. One of the main reasons why this movie works is because of the performances. In the hands of less capable actors, it could have become yet another boring rom-com. This movie has not redefined the genre but manages to connect to the people and the optimism radiated by Geet is infectious. As an audience, it was rare that near the end of the movie I was rooting for both of them to be with each other. That is a testament to the impact that this movie had on me.",

Take a bit of \"It happened One Night\", toss it with a pinch of \"Jetlag\" and add parts of \"French Kiss\" for fluffiness. You get the idea. But the point here is that this heady mixture does seem to work! Aditya Kashyap (Shahid) is the scion of a grand business empire and has recently taken over as the head of the group after the death of his father. But currently work is the last thing on his mind as his girlfriend ditches him. In a very melancholy mood, Aditya just walks into a Delhi-bound train where he meets Geet (Kareena). Geet is a complete day-dreamer of a girl and is in high spirits as she plans to elope with her old boyfriend. Only she hasn't planned it out.Aditya and Geet don't along well at all but as fate could have it they both miss the train at an nondescript station. Out of obligation, Aditya helps Geet to get to her parents' place, Bhatinda. But the story doesn't end there.Geet wants to run off to Manali to her boyfriend before her folks marry her off to some old family friend. And for the lack of a better person, she drags Aditya into the mess as well. At the end of it, Aditya goes home completely inspired by Geet's optimism and the positive attitude and applies the same to mend his broken personal life and business.Then there are some plot twists here and there. But the screenplay is excellent and engages the viewer. It is quite light hearted film and avoids clich\u00e9d or raunchy humour. The comedy and the relationship between the lead pair is handled superbly.Kareena has never been among my favourites but she has always given some good performance and she doesn't disappoint this time either. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised at Shahid Kapoor's performance. He has underplayed his role in the first half beautifully. I was quite impressed really - I was hoping that this will turn out to be one of his SRK-aping ham marathons. Good work. And, if I use this overused term, the \"chemistry\" between the 2 Kapoors is brilliant. The cinematography doesn't let the film down either. Plus it has been mostly shot on location (Shimla, Manali, etc.) so it is refreshing to watch. The first half especially has all the shades of a road movie - a genre I love. Good script and spunky music adds to the effect. On the whole, nothing is out of note. Good movie.",

The amusing, intelligent dialogue, steady pace and story of the movie means that you are engrossed in it.Kareena over plays the Punjabi girl she plays but over all, it was not a bad performance. She shows that she is a bindaas Punjabi girl all right, but we can see that she is trying to show that she is a bindaas Punjabi girl. She wasn't able to convince that she was in fact that character which is a slight flaw (some thing on the lines of what Abhishek Bacchan made in Yuva like Amitabh Bacchan said once in an interview).Shahid Kapoor was very good in the film. I was thinking that he was underplaying his character slightly in the first half despite the character being some one in a shell. However, he strided over it in the second half and showed a lot of promise. He can be a very good actor in the future according to me.Imtiaz Ali, the director, shows a lot of promise again and I am looking at watching Socha Na Tha, his debut movie in the future and hope he can go from strength to strength.",

The songs are amazing. Whenever I watch it I don't even skip the songs - they go with the story so well! I am giving it a 9 instead of 10 because the Anshuman character is weirdly annoying and underwhelming. You'd think that for a girl like Geet to fall madly in love with, the guy has to be somewhat special.

            "content": "Since I started watching Bollywood/Kollywood films, I've discovered that I don't like nearly all of them. Sometimes it's the actors (I can't stand Rani Muhkerjee) or the plots that veer from frantic fun to drama in the second half (Om Shanti Om) and I've sadly returned quite a few to Netflix after hoping they'd work for me as reviews. This time, I determined I'd just watch this one and not get my hopes up at all. And happily, that seemed to be just the ticket as I ended up enjoying it a lot. Kareena Kapoor is perfect as breezy Geet who can talk a mile a minute and usually has a cheery smile on her face. Her motto in life is live it to the fullest and only regret what you haven't tried. She works on the Law of Attraction and thinks that what you want to happen to you will happen to you if you want it badly enough. She's also spontaneous and fun and gets Aditya to join in even when he initially might balk such as when she decides this is the perfect time to jump off a dock into a shallow river. After all, you never know if such a chance will come again. Geet is a character you the viewer just have to relax and go with. Shahid Kapoor makes Aditya a likable and sympathetic guy. I never once sat back and thought \"Oh, cry me a river, poor little rich boy.\" He does get irritated at Geet at times but quickly realizes she's opened up a whole new side of his personality and made him a better person. During the first half of the film, it's like watching a parched plant soak up water and come to life again. It's also obvious that he's starting to care for her and only leaves her (at about the halfway mark) because he wants her to be happy with the man she's said she wants to marry. The film depends on some misunderstandings to keep the plot going as Geet hasn't told her family about the first man she wants to marry for fear they won't approve and the family must believe there is a relationship between the Geet and Aditya during the final third of the film in order to keep throwing those two together until they finally acknowledge the fact that they're perfect for each other. However, since similar things are so common in romance novels, this didn't bother me too much. The film is fairly fast paced and intensely colorful in that wonderful way of Indian films. There aren't that many musical numbers but I found myself liking the ones that are there. They're fun to watch, the lyrics are good and the beats had me bouncing along and trying a few dance steps much to the amusement of my kitties. Some Bollywood film dances are starting to look more like pole tryouts at the local strip club but with the (slight) exception of the final number, that's avoided here. \"Jab We Met\" has the flavor of Hollywood screwball comedies \u2013 watch for the wild taxi ride Aditya takes Geet on in order to try and get her back to her train \u2013 rounded out with a touch of \"she makes him a better man\" depth. The 155 minute length seems to zip by and for much of it, I had an almost permanent smile on my face. Looks like I still need some help refining what I like in Bollywood/Kollywood films but this one is a winner for me.~Emily",

            "content": "Like his first movie, Imtiaz Ali's 'Jab We Met' is also a romantic comedy about two people meeting in unusual circumstances where one of them is already 'taken'. This film has a slightly larger budget and the scenic locations are breathtaking. It's a pity you don't see much of India's beauty in more movies these days. 'Jab We Met' starts off with a heartbroken Aditya (Shahid Kapur) who wanders his way to a train where he has an encounter with a chatterbox runaway bride-to-be (Kareena Kapoor). From there on begins a journey that heads for a destination neither one of them expected to reach. The best part is the first part of the movie, right up till the point when Geet and Aditya reach her parent's house in Bhatinda, is very enjoyable. The innovative humour and situations are refreshing. The special effects are very poor but once you're passed that, it's easy to overlook this flaw. However, after Bhatinda, things take a turn towards clich\u00e9s and the intense moments thereafter don't have much of an effect and they drag on for a while. The pace picks up again after Aditya finds Geet and takes her to her parents. Most of the songs are nothing memorable except 'Yeh Ishq' sung wonderfully by the vivacious Sunidhi Chauhan. Shahid Kapur turns in a decent performance while Kareena Kapoor is okay in the comedic scenes and average in the intense sequences. 'Jab We Met' may not be Imtiaz Ali's best but it is an amusing watch and way more entertaining than his latest, 'Love Aaj Kal'.",

            "content": "Jab We Met is without a doubt the finest work of cinema that has hit the screens since Chak De India. Sure it doesn't have a Khan in the titles but it sure as heck has two very talented Kapoors. It is not often that you see a movie that is so real yet so extraordinary. JWM provides this rare moment.Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is the most despondent person that one can encounter - a millionaire with a tumultuous life. Hailing from a broken family and after his father's death, he is running a failing business and the icing - he has just been jilted by the \"love of hislife\". Geet (Kareena Kapoor), 'Bhatinda's Sikhani' is the curious, playful and annoyingly upbeat and chatty chick. She is returning home to Bhatinda, after her doing her degree in Mumbai, to a very large, loving and protective Punjabi family. The two meet on an unexpectedly when a hopeless Adi is on a train, heading nowhere. Geet's fiery and cheery persona at first annoys Adi to the point of insanity but when he looks much closer he sees that there is a lot to be learnt from Geet. In her nosy yet helpful manner, Geet, stupidly misses her train back to Bhatinda. The blame goes to Adi and thus Geet swears that she will not let him escape until Aditya, himself, drops her home. Geet is going to meet her family before putting her genius plan into action - which is to elope with her non-Sikh boyfriend. The story is not something out of the ordinary. Many such scripts have been subjects of experimentation but not until this film, has a director succeeded in finally capturing the essence of such a love story.JWM stands for everything Indian cinema has long forgotten - simple story lines crafted with an Indian backdrop, soul and essence. It's a refreshing experience to take a journey with characters so Indian and most importantly a journey that's in India, which has decreased with the new flock of 'filmmakers'.The script remains flawless with no 'out there' features. If you had to scrutinise the screenplay, the only flaw would be that the songs, \"Aaoge Jab Tum\" and \"Yeh Ishq Hai\" should have had less screen time.Almost every scene has something outstanding about it - from cinematography to dialogue to performances. However if you had to pinpoint scenes then it would be two of Shahid's scenes. The first would be his introductory dialogue scene with Kareena on the train when they first meet and the second, where Shahid meets Kareena after nine months apart.Usually it's the cast and director who receive all the accolades but there are two people who should be applauded for making JWM such a fantastic movie. The first would be Imtiaz Ali, the multi-talented writer-director-screenwriter and second, Aarti Kashyap, the amazing editor. The two managed to make the impossible possible \u0096 climax that is not a bore. Usually in such stories climaxes are full of tears, embraces, slow motion shots and prolonged melodramatic dialogues that when the actors finish delivering, audiences are fast asleep. As the story unfolds, one would think that this too will have an extended climax. But it doesn't. It's sweet, simple and you leave the cinema satisfied, if not on a high. NB: Despite being an appropriate climax, it isn't a rushed or a haphazard climax and answers any questions asked.Cinematographer, S Natarajan Subramaniam, needs to be congratulated for creating a movie that is absolutely 'real'. The cinematography is a perfect combination of classy yet realistic. It doesn't look cheap or opulent. Not many movies are so perfectly captured. For JWM this style of cinematography was a necessity, as it worked conjunction with the style of storytelling and characters.And at last we get to the performances. Where to begin? Let's start with the show-stealer - Shahid Kapoor. Saying that he has grown from strength-to-strength is an understatement. The actor simply blows you away. Dialogues delivered flawlessly, expressions that are priceless and with a fresh mature look that is to die for (especially in the 'Mauja Mauja' song sequence). It's hard to believe that such a knock-out performance was delivered by someone who is only 4 yrs old in the film industry. JWM is his best work to date. This is, hopefully, a reflection of what is to come.Kareena Kapoor appears in an unseen persona. Sure, she has been the \"crazy\" girl in many of her previous films but never has she made transitions between a \"crazy\" and \"normal\" girl so beautifully. She just might be the saving grace of Bollywood at a time when there is a shortage of actresses, in the true sense of the word. The only flaw in her performance would be the slight overacting in one or two scene. However, like Shahid, Kareena has also performed one of her most memorable roles to date.To sum up the fabulous film that is JWM, is that would this is a film that needs to be studied by the students of cinema and filmmakers of Bollywood. The movie teaches a valuable lesson which is that you don't need an \"out of this world\" script in order to make an \"out of this world\" movie. This one is without a doubt, one of the true gems of Indian cinema.",

Well, the story isn't new nor does it have any layers or novelty in its story telling. The film presents the glimpses of many successful romantic Bollywood Movies like \"Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge\" or \"Pyar To Hona Hi Tha.\" The film avoids much of its stardom values and offers simplicity which makes it pretty adorable despite a wafer thin story-line and a plain treatment. Shahid Kapoor's performance though not very polished still is tolerable; but Kareena's bubbly image gets pretty hyped in this film. Music and direction gets pretty engaging which supports the often predictability of the story and makes it engaging.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

Nope, not a winner here\u0085however it's a refreshing change from many inane Bollywood flicks floating around these days...to the plot now...A chance meeting between one Mr. 'Serious' Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapur) and Ms \"Garrulous\" Geet (Kareena Kapur) in a train goes a long way in transforming lives of both. Geet is on the way to Bhatinda to elope with her beloved while crestfallen Aditya has some other plans. Obviously irritated by the incessant chatter of Geet,Aditya decides to run away from this mega chatter bird. Fate however plays its part and loquacious Geet and Aditya become very good friends on the way. Then they part ways for good! Or not? See the movie for it!This show has got some real good comic moments. The best one for me was when Geet is compelled by Aditya into abusing her ex lover on phone! Kareena hurls one bad word after another on the phone as the audience goes in splits! Stealer that one!!\u0085And then there is this one\u0085 Shahid and Kareena decide to put up at Hotel Decent!

If there is one way to ruin a good movie, it's by throwing in some ill-timed pathetic songs and Jab We Met is a classic example of it. Yeah Yeah, we know that Mr. Aditya loves his music. But for God's sake don't make him sing at every occasion! This movie could have easily done away with (all) the crappy songs and been a more enjoyable show...Having said that we can't take the credit away from the director for this light hearted comedy. Would give it a 6.5/10. Jab We Met is watchable (is that a word?) without any disastrous side effects on your wallet and mood.",

Though she doesn't like much among new movies but this movie makes her very happy. You can watch this movie again and again and never get bored of it.I must say that the backbone of the movie is its dialogues. They are the ones that keeps you engaged and surprise you all the time. They make you laugh so much.Another great discovery from the movie is unknown actors playing unforgettable characters. Brijendra Kala started his career through Haasil directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia but the role, he essayed in this movie, of a driver is phenomenal. He came to limelight through JabWeMet probably that we've got to see much of him later in many web series and movies. The way he sings 'tum kya jaano, mai kya hoon, ek surila nagma hoon' while driving is so funny. That TC guy on station is so realistic and funny at the same time when he warns Geet of detrimental consequences just because she's a girl and she's alone at midnight. His dialogue: 'akeli ladki ek khuli hui tijori ki tarah hoti hai' is the testimony of perverts prevalent in society. That receptionist guy in Hotel is so relatable and the way he acted with his eyes is amazing. His dialogue: 'kahan mili? Train me? .... Traino wali pehli baar dekhi hain' is testimony of pervert curious guys. That water bottle seller on railway station is so memorable. The way he asks for his money, his dialogues: 'chor nahi hai hum' and 'arey kahaan gayi, aap ka chamaat kha ke jayenge hum' are testimony of the reality of our times of stalkers prevalent everywhere in our society. That horny guy on motorbike asking Geet to come along with him. His dialogue: '1 aadmi hai full night jage rahenge chal' is testimony of pervert men everywhere at night in society.The movie is too good to showcase so much reality in one single script. Pathetic men are shown everywhere in the journey of a girl with an unparalleled dose of humour.Hats off to stupendous Imtiaz Ali for creating such a gem in Indian cinema.And my goodness! I never knew before this movie that Kareena Kapoor is such a brilliant actor. Shahid Kapoor was stunning in this particular performance. Dara Singh is so endearing with his only two dialogues in the movie. Pavan Malhotra is absolutely brilliant in the role of caring brother.Last but not the least the music composed by Pritam in the movie is timeless. Each song is better than the other. 'Aago Jab Tum Sajna' is my Mom's favourite. 'Tum Se Hi' is my favourite.It's a pity that TV Channels don't broadcast such a beautiful film.

            "content": "They may have split in real life but Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur's reel love story Jab We Met is a cute film, and is sure to touch the hearts of those in love.The film starts with Geet (Kareena), a Sikh who talks nonstop. She embarks on a train journey from Mumbai to her hometown Bhatinda. On the way, she runs into Aditya Kashyap (Shahid), a young man disillusioned with life after being dumped by his girlfriend. To make matters worse, even his business is going nowhere.He's on the verge of ending his life when Geet comes into his life. She ends up missing her train while trying to get him on the train.The thought does cross your mind, that why would she do that for a stranger. But then again, we're watching a Bollywood film.Geet then informs Aditya that it is his responsibility to take her to Bhatinda, as she missed the train because of him. What follows next is a journey across picturesque landscapes where the two discover each other and understand the meaning of love and friendship.Aditya learns that Geet is in love with one Anshuman but her family is against their union.After reaching Bhatinda, you feel the plot has been lifted straight out of the Hollywood film, A Walk in the Clouds, though director Imtiaz Ali also adds Yash Chopra's 'Punjabisation'.Aditya promises to help unite Geet with Anshuman, even though he falls in love with her.Post-interval, we're introduced to a very new Aditya, who becomes a big businessman. And this is one of the film's flaws. The change is too abrupt, and it is difficult to connect the first half with the second.But besides that, Jab We Met is a fun film, with quite a few moments worth watching.Though Kareena is loud at times, she is a treat to watch -- funny and full of life. She gets to mouth hilarious lines like, 'Bachpan se mujhe shaadi karne ka bahut shauk tha.' Shahid, on other hand, acts composed and provides a perfect foil to the Kareena's bubbly character.Pritam's music also enhances the film. Lyricist Irshad Kamil deserves a special mention for the song, Yeh Ishq Hai.",

            "content": "This was pretty good, but a lot of things could have been changed to make it much better.1) Lose the 30 minutes in Geet's house at the end where the parents have the wrong idea abut who she is marrying. This happens way too much in Bollywood movies--is it really that hard to say \"Sorry, you misunderstood....\"?2) The toy car in the aerial sequence with the taxi. If you don't have the budget for an aerial shot, don't make it into a toy car and toy train. Looks really cheap.3) Shahid is about 4 years younger than Kareena, and he looks about 10 years younger. It was hard to take him seriously. Kareena is about 10+ years older than her character--she's still cute, but she doesn't look like she's in her early 20's. Sorry!4) When Shahid comes to take Kareena back to her family from the hostel in Simla, he orders her to leave with him and refuses to give her an explanation. I found that both unrealistic (Kareena is supposed to be an independent woman) and offensive. If I were an Indian woman (instead of an American man), I would be really offended by the movie trying to show that even an independent woman needs a man to boss her around sometimes. Please! The same with the repeated saying \"A woman travelling alone is like an open treasure box.\" Maybe this is a common saying (??), but why do you want the movie to reinforce this idea? It really makes women seem like objects. Not cool.5) To those who think this was like the current \"Leap Year\" with Amy Adams or \"It Happened One Night\" (1930s) with Claudette Colbert, it is. But it's a common theme in every culture, and I don't see why some people think there is direct borrowing.6) The kiss--in another discussion people said it was \"awkward.\" It was. If you're going to kiss, kiss; if you don't know how, please don't do it in a movie. Or they could have gone the other way--make the kiss really awkward to match the awkwardness of the characters and situation. Were Shahid and Kareena still boyfriend and girlfriend in real life when they filmed this? Maybe that was the problem--they didn't want to put their private actions into a public movies? Whatever the reason, it didn't work.7) Would Sikhs really be that pleased about their daughter marrying a Hindu? Or vice versa? Don't Sikh women have a distinctive name (like Singh for men)?8) Subtitles. In general, they are fairly good, but there were several really bad mistakes, and in several places the choice of words was not good. This happens in most of these movies. Can't the studio spring for a couple hundred $ and let a native English speaker clean up these mistakes??? It's also silly for Kareena to say \"Shit\" in English and have the subtitle say something like \"Oh no!\"9) Do all Punjabi farmers live in palaces and wear all new clothes? How about some average folks? I know they use the same sets in different movies, but maybe it's time to build a middle- class house (for example, like Aishwarya's house in \"Bride and Prejudice\").10) Finally, it wasn't clear at the beginning why Shahid was running away or why he was sad. Later he said his mother ran off with another man, but when he re-instated his mother as a manager of his company, there was no drama or emotion at all. Very strange.",

Although Shahid Kapoor tried to emulate the depressed Aditya Kashyap's role well it becomes a bit too exaggerated in the later part of the movie.\nThe second half is too lengthy and has a lot of loopholes. Too much focus on Geet & Anshuman's relationship makes the story a tad boring. However, the liplock between Geet and Aditya in the end steals the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the excellent comedy that was portrayed by all the characters precisely.\nOverall, a fine touch of romantic comedy feel is what you get after watching this movie.",

            "content": "Jab We Met is a movie which is okay but not great. It is with Kareena Kapoor and her former boyfriend Shahid Kapur whom I feel is too short for her as far as chemistry on screen goes. The only person whom Shahid Kapur would not seem odd being paired up with is Amrita Rao. I think the main thing which is missing in this movie is chemistry between the actors. Anyways, Jab We Met is a fairly odd movie which centers around the meeting of two people, Aditya (Kapur) and Geet (Kapoor). Aditya who seems to be going through a tremulous private and professional life aimlessly boards a train and meets a bubbly blabbermouth (Geet) whom he eventually gets stranded with. Aditya unknowingly falls in love with Geet through the entire process of getting her back to Punjab so that she can meet her family, then go to Kashmir to elope with this guy whom she thought she loved. However, Geet's family is under the misconception that she is getting married to Aditya when she actually wants to get married to Anshuman (elope-guy). There are some funny moments in Jab We Met, like when they meet Geet's Punjabi grandfather, or when Anshuman ends up meeting Geet's family for the first time. Kareena Kapoor overacted a bit, but it is still a movie to check out if you like any of the actors.",

            "review_title": "Imtiaz Ali's Magnum Opus",
            "content": "I know I know there are better Imtiaz Ali films out there including the likes of Tamasha and most notably Highway, but you see, what I'm talking about here is not his best film, but it's certainly his magnum opus. To let you know the difference, magnum opus is something that is a large and important work of art, music or literature which is regarded as the artist's most important. Not necessarily the best, but most important. So, sure Highway might be Imtiaz Ali's best film, but Jab We Met just speaks to me in a different way.Right from the start, this film drags you in. The opening montage of Aditya Kashyap just leaving everything behind and giving up on life is something I relate to on a huge, personal level. I too sometimes feel like just disappearing from everyone's life out of the blue and wanting to be left alone. It gives off a vibe that this might be a depressing, slow-moving film about Aditya's journey of self-discovery and coming to terms with various stages of his past life. Although that does happen, it doesn't quite happen in a way you'd expect things to happen. Right after the opening montage, we are introduced to Geet Kaur Dhillon. A character which is the polar opposite of Aditya and that's when you think that it is through Geet, that Aditya will finally learn about the value of life. Although, that also does happen, it does not just end there, it's actually only the first half of the film. The film transitions into something much more beautiful and emotional in the second half which shows what an amazing writer-director Imtiaz Ali truly is. After the first half, the situations are reversed and the tables are turned. It is now Geet that is facing what Aditya was facing in the first half and now it's Aditya's duty to help Geet learn about the value of life. This unique dynamic along with exceptional work from the leads is what makes this film work. The energy of the leads is so beautiful that they don't miss a beat in connecting with the audience and land a gut-wrenching powerful punch when the time comes. I was crying through most of the middle section of the film to witness all the situations reversed and seeing Aditya encouraging Geet to live again melts my heart.The performances from the leads are absolutely fantastic. There is not a single loose thread in the acting and considering Shahid and Kareena were an actual couple back then, it really shows. Their chemistry is off the charts and you desperately want them to end up being together. Tarun Arora as Anshuman is also something that works really well. You'd think of him as that regular trope-filled character of a rom-com which is there just to act as an obstacle before the two leads end up together but he is so much more. His character has an actual stake in the film and his actions have some serious plot-thickening consequences. Which is what makes him different and unique. Although, whatever fate his character met, he deserved it. The rest of the cast is also good and provide ample support to the leads.The music and background score oof. This is where the film excels again. Each and every track is soulful and eargasmic. Be it the romantic Tum Se Hi by Mohit Chauhan, heartbreaking Aaoge Jab Tum by Ustad Rashid Khan, the absolute banger party songs Nagada Nagada by Javed Ali/Mauja Hi Mauja by Mika Singh or the go-to vibe filled Yeh Ishq Haaye by Shreya Ghoshal; each and every song is great and contributes to the film in high values.In the end, I'd like to say again what I said in the beginning. This film is indeed, Imtiaz Ali's Magnum Opus.",
