            "content": "yet again i wish IMDb had a 0/10 ranking. my little brother made the mistake of renting this title from a red-box using a promo code. i was upset realizing that although the rental was free, the amount of energy i spent walking with him to the store to rent it was about as much that was put into this movie. It was horrendous. This, along with epic movie, murder-cycle, and the ghoul school, are some of the only movies that actually made my eyes hurt. While the stupid humor (or lack there of) managed to keep our golden retrieve entertained, my brother (who enjoyed from Justin to Kelly) and i would have no part of it, turning it off before the ending, which i had no desire in seeing. i regret seeing this movie and feel empty realizing that watching this probably did more damage to my body than my smoking habit.",

            "content": "I saw this movie in theaters on its opening night because I thought the trailer made it look funny. When I sat down right before the previews started I thought about it and I had only seen the trailer for this movie twice. And no other marketing besides that; I now know why. The town I went to see this movie has a large African-American population so I thought it would be a treat and it would be a movie the audience would get behind and enjoy together. There were never more than six people in the theater at a time. Aside from my two friends and I a trio of black girls were there and left about 10 minutes into the movie, only to be replaced by a guy and his two kids, who I assume were his stepchildren that he hated because he had taken them to see this movie. To start off there were no jokes. The \"jokes\" were mostly Big Boi saying something, nothing special, like \"My daddy used to golf.\" Then Faizon love(who I loved as Big Worm in Friday) would just repeat what he said in a higher voice and add the n-word. The editing made no sense and was choppy. Dialouge vital to the \"plot\" would be happening and in between the sentences there would be a cut of Faizon Love just dancing or something. To summarize buy this movie at the 3.99 Walmart bin if a friend you haven't seen in years invites you to his birthday party or something.",

It tries to be funny and thoughtful and ends up being incredibly and offensively stupid, racist, and trite.The comedy consistently misses the mark by a huge margin. This movie was intended to be a comedy although it's shockingly unfunny despite an almost foolproof set of comic circumstances and actors.Was it supposed to be a black Caddyshack or was it supposed to be a story of achievement? The movie's underlying message ends up being a thinly-veiled message of unfocused racist hate directed at white people which is actually not funny at all.Watching this film was an hour and a half of my life wasted. If you are considering watching or renting this movie please do yourself a favor and don't. Absolutely no redeeming value, even in it's terribleness. Consider yourself warned.",

It will win no awards and it's only purpose is to fill the 7 dollar DVD bin at Wal-Mart. Why not do something productive, like making good movies? I wonder when it will stop. I hope someday that the culture it represents will die out. Bring a bunch of black actors together with some musicians, embarrass them with demeaning dialog, and throw in some white actors to look awkward and poke fun at. It's a routine that needs to go away as soon as possible. There's no creativity, and some people will actually bother to complain that racism is the reason that it isn't award winning.

Instead of creating an original comedy that will forever be etched in peoples minds the makers of this movie copied other movies and threw their jokes in a big mix. Thats what I thought of it, this review is solely based on the funny factor of the movie which didn't make me laugh once and a comedy that doesn't make me laugh once can't get a good rating from me, thats all it is.",

Well, I take that back. I believe there was a moment when I cracked a smile at a joke. But the jokes were almost all targeted towards a braindead audience with no sense of humor, whatsoever. The accusations of racism got old, and it was just a painful ride all-around. If anything more terrible than this film has been created by man, I would love to see it.

You might possibly have heard of this movie, as it's one of the best comedies of all time, backed with a stellar lineup (at the time) of top notch comedy actors.Now, 27 years later, we're seeing the movie again in the guise of Who's Your Caddy, Only this time, there are a few changes. White guys are replaced with black guys, and rap culture is fused into the plot, but aside from that it's a carbon copy. Even some of the jokes are lifted directly from the original.Absolute garbage. There is NO effort whatsoever to make Who's Your Caddy unique enough (or funny enough) to step away from Caddyshack's shadow. What was once fresh and unique, has become standard and staid, and as Who's Your Caddy copied a 27 year old movie wholesale, making the jokes so obvious you already know the punchline while the directors are in the setup. Who's Your Caddy has absolutely nothing recommendable in it's reels, even if you haven't seen the original.If you want to watch a funny golf movie, Watch Caddyshack, or if you're desperate, Caddyshack II. If you've seen them both before, then just fondly re-watch them, as your memories will be forever tainted if you what this shameful, shallow, remake.",

This movie insults black people and actually makes white people look good ( I never thought I'd be saying that). But it does, it makes everyone think that all black people are mentally unable to handle even basic tasks. So it gets a 1 for being racists towards blacks. As far as the plot, if this was pre 1985 when the supreme court ruled that golf courses must be open to anyone who can afford them, it hasn't been an issue. So to assume that there is a golf course out there in a fantasy world where black people are not allowed in is the most ridiculous thing I can think off. The sad part is there were a couple of good actors in this movie, but when you are working with crap you can't fix it no matter who you put in the movie.",

And it exceeded all my expectations. The plot is contrived and unconvincing, and it makes Christopher's climb to the top look more like a spoiled kid refusing to lose. And that constant ranting by Lady G is so annoying that I wish somehow her character suddenly dropped dead from a heart attack. Take a look at one of her scenes: Christopher is awarded with membership of the club, and she spent at least 30 seconds making silly incomprehensible noises. It is seriously annoying, childish and not fun. I cannot comprehend why the filmmakers think viewers would be entertained by this, as if we were 5 year old children.The underlying message about a man of humble origin making his way to the top is positive, but the constant class struggle is tiring to say the least. The class struggle is done in such a silly and contrived, making no room for sympathy or thought provocation.I lost all interest in continuing the film half way through, but I watched it anyway. And it did not get any better.",

            "content": "This film stars rapper Big Boi and his homies in a comedy that is, roughly, a reworking of the script from \"Caddy Shack\". However, instead of the head of the fancy country club president hating loud-mouthed Rodney Dangerfield, but Big Boi and his friends. As a result, the men decide to take revenge by buying the property adjoining the club and revoking the land leased to the club. So, the snooty club president (Jeffrey Jones) is forced to allow these rappers to join the club. As for the rapper posse, the behave pretty obnoxiously once they join the country club. You almost feel sorry for the club...except that they DID bring it on themselves.There is a serious subplot--though it really seems like a real clich\u00e9. It seems that Big Boi's father had been a caddy at this same club years before but was fired. And, in a way, Big Boi's joining was because of this. Also, there is a HIGHLY clich\u00e9d final segment--right out of caddy shack concerning a foursome golf game...for EVERYTHING (uggh).While this is clearly a low-brow and rather stupid film, it is surprisingly good when you realize it's currently ranking on the IMDb \"Bottom 100\" list. It clearly isn't nearly bad enough to merit inclusion here, though I have noticed that several very watchable African-American films are also on the list (\"I Can DO Bad All By Myself\" and \"Phat Girlz\"). Could there perhaps be some bias against comedies where the stars are Black? I hope not.As for the humor, it's mostly pretty low-brow. This is NOT a sophisticated comedy and it makes little pretense about that. I mean, think about it...when Jones cannot keep Big Boi and his friends out, he hires two midget assassins! And, there are lots of scenes where people get hit in the crotch. Need I say more?! Is it just me, or did you too think \"it's just golf...I don't get it!\".",

            "content": "While it doesn't deserve the top of the bottom 100, it was in fact, a bad movie. I saw this movie for the soul reason of saying I saw it, and it wasn't as bad as people were trying to make it, but it really was lackluster at it's peak. Despite any racist claims, and all the controversy over this movie, it has a weak plot, terrible jokes, and was a waste of money.As far as it being racist, well, I wasn't offended, but both whites AND blacks could easily be offended because it plays into huge stereo-types of both races. At times I could hear \"We will overcome\" intertwined within the plot-line, and agreeable with several other comments on this movie, it was just unnecessary. To those who say this movie isn't a \"white/black thing\", watch the movie again: \".. this is not about who's at infractions. No no no. This here is about black and white...\" - Rev. J.J.Jackson played by Garrett Morris.I'm a fan of stupid humor, actually, I love movies like Borat, Hot Fuzz, Friday, Caddy Shack, et cetera, but this movie is just an insult to comedy. I didn't even mind the racial undertones, but give me a break, this movie was REALLY about a quick buck. That is all, and for that I give it my 9 dollars, and a rating of 3.. still not the worst movie I've seen.. it's just not good.",

            "content": "I do love comedy, even starting to appreciate the less subtle blend, but Who's Your Caddy? just didn't work. I mean it did have a great idea with a relevant theme that a lot of people I think would identify with, but here's the problem, Who's Your Caddy? never lives up to it.The scenery is striking in a sense, but the editing in some scenes could've been tighter. The soundtrack was pleasant enough, but forgettable soon after.If there are any redeeming qualities it is the performances of James Avery and Terry Crews who put a lot of effort into their characters. By all means it was lovely to see Jeffrey Jones again but sadly he doesn't have much to work with.I don't mind in-your-face humour, but the in-your-face humour came so fast and was so outrageous a lot of the time. Also the racism jokes got too much after a while. Not to mention, I detected some sexism too, notably I agree with the film showing a woman's bum being slapped and actually encouraging it.The story is very predictable and unoriginal, if anything it often felt like it was ripping off Caddyshack, except Caddyshack's humour was much funnier, while the dialogue was weak and very demeaning. And did I mention that the film is riddled with stereotypes, I don't mind them when they are well incorporated but sadly they weren't here. I didn't care for any of the characters finding them either dull or annoying on the most part.I suppose though I would have cared for them more had the drama(a little too sappy for my tastes but a bit of a relief after a long time of forced and unfunny in-your-face humour) been introduced much earlier.All in all, a mess of a movie that doesn't make anything of its concept. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "When rapper Christopher \"C-Note\" Hawkins (Big Boi) is denied membership into an exclusive Carolina Pines Country Club by the snobbish Cummings (Jeffrey Jones), C-Note takes measures to make himself a nuisance buying the neighboring property and forcing his way into the club where his lifestyle and image clash with the uptight rigid Carolina Pines establishment with Cummings using every means possible to get rid of C-Note.In the series finale of the short lived Clerks: The Animated Series, there's a brief bit where Randall and Dante are pleased to find themselves in Caddyshack only to react in horror when text appears reading \"Caddyshack III: Caddies in da Hood. The shack is back......and BLACK\", now we know why they were scared. Released during the crowded July weekend in 2007 that also featured the debut of The Simpsons Movie, Who's Your Caddy limped out to the minimum number of theaters to qualify a \"wide release\" and opened at number 10 at the box office fading from theaters quickly. The movie received harsh reviews from critics with many pointing out the blatant similarities to Caddyshack. While the movie isn't unwatchable and probably doesn't deserve to be on the same tier as the Seltzerberg comedies where it currently stands, it's still a lazy pandering slog.The movie begins right out of the gate with the hackneyed use of classical music only to be interrupted by loud rap as we follow C-Note's entourage to the country club. The movie has the subtlety and restraint of a battering ram with most jokes basically approached in the same manner as that opening with very telegraphed pay offs you've seen before including a reference to the Flight of the Valkyries scene from Apocalypse Now when we see C-Note's helicopter that's treated as a joke in and of itself. Big Boi as C-Note does not have any comedic aptitude as he's played overly stiff and reserved with not much comic energy. Jeffrey Jones is also way past his prime playing a poor man's Ted Knight and with his slow lumbering mannerisms he doesn't bring the needed energy to make his character funny. Faizon Love as Big Large is clearly intended to be this movie's equivalent of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler, but instead is closer in spirit to Dan Akyroyd's Tom Everett from Caddyshack II. Faizon basically has two go tos: 1) Make funny faces and 2) repeat dialogue spoken by other characters in silly voices. Faizon does this repeatedly throughout the movie and also often laughs at his own exchanges making him rather grating during the film's runtime.Who's Your Caddy? Is what it is: A rehash of Caddyshack filtered by way of The Cookout. It doesn't take the time to create characters or comic friction instead relying and bare basics culture clashes that movie mistakes for jokes as is and it's pretty shameless about just how much it crimps from Caddyshack down to a subplot with C-Note mentoring a caddy like Ty Webb. It's just a waste of time, but it wasn't painful like other comedies I've seen so it has that going for it.",

Awful characters, awful acting, awful story, just plain awful. It's not the worst film I have ever seen but it's sure as hell is up there. With so many stereotypes in place that I, a Caucasian intelligent man, feel offend not only as a white person, but equal as offend for all African- Americans alone.Also, the morals within the movie are especially stupid. \"Hey kids, its okay to be loud, obnoxious, cheat, treat women like dirt, act like a person who was raise from the streets even though you're a 13 year white kid from upper class society, and crap on everyone else's ideals that aren't like yours because Who's your Caddy says its okay.\"Bottom line is that this movie is down right atrocious.

He loved it and I said for me what really made the film was Terry Crews, I love this guy and how much life he brings to the screen. My boyfriend then mentioned a film called Who's Your Caddy and said that Terry was in it and that he's absolutely hilarious. So we watched it and sadly not only is Terry in the film for just 5 minutes, but this was just a terrible movie. Not only is this one of the most racist films I've seen but it's incredibly sexist as well. I have no idea what Hollywood was on when they thought that this would be a good film to green light, but obviously they just didn't care.When \"street smart\" rapper Christopher \"C-Note\" Hawkins applies for a membership to an all-white Country Club, the establishment's proprietors are hardly ready to oblige him. Unwilling to accept that the club views him as unfit for membership, C-Note purchases land that contains the 17th green - willing only to exchange the hole for a membership. This sets the stage for an outrageous assault on the country club and its membership committee as C-Note and his fun-loving, streetwise crew disrupts the events and games at the club with their irreverent attitudes and a back-and-forth prank fest.See my thing is I actually do love the story, but I think I would have loved it as a drama with a little comedy. The whole element of this black man whose father was shunned from a trophy because of his color from the powerful white man and getting revenge, I think that's a really good idea. However, since the comedy was a little too outrageous and in your face most of the time, they add in this touching story ad very last minute and it's way too late for me to care.I hate stereotypes and this movie was out of control with the stereotypes. Between the black man who's a ghetto rapper, the big black girl who's so tough and sexual at the same time, the white rich man who won't give one thing a chance nor has any motive and the white son giving so easily into the rapper's life embracing it. Not to mention how the women are treated in this film, the white boy slaps a girl's butt and they encourage it! I thought that was a bit much. Plus the powerful white man wants to get rid of this group so badly to the point where he hires a hit man? A hit man who plants a bomb at his son's party where he could have been killed, what the heck? Everything about this film was wrong. The only thing that was redeemable was James Avery and Terry Crews. Other than that, please skip this film, I have the better idea, hopefully Hollywood reads this comment and takes my advice.1/10",

            "content": "Compared to other films on IMDBs bottom 100 list, Who's your Caddy is fairly watchable; production values were high enough to make it look like it was actually made by real film makers, the acting is not completely atrocious, it is not s dull as a rock, the jokes are not as cringe worthy or lacking in humor as other bad comedies, and so on. I do however realize that lacking in negatives does not make a ting good, just less bad. It could perhaps even be called mediocre.There is one thing though, that firmly plants this on the bad side of the scale, and that is the complete disconnect with any sort of reality. We are meant to root for rapper C Note and his crew but they are not portrayed in a particularly good way. They are disrespectful to people around them, they teach a young kid that objectification of women is a good thing, they bring fire arms onto the golf course, and cause bodily harm to \"bad guy\" Cummings. Above all, pretty much all of their victories are caused, not by any form of virtue, but by the film makers disregarding normal human conduct not to mention laws and regulations. Oh, and suggesting that Cummings gets raped in the end is just in poor taste.I seriously felt bad for Cummings and was rooting for him all through, not a good thing when he is supposed to be \"the Man\", and C Note the good guy rebel.",

            "content": "Hmmmm, this movie looks very familiar. It resembles that other movie about golf. You know the one that came out in 1980? Only difference is that movie was funny and this one is flat out boring.Plot: C-Note(Big Boi of Outkast) is a rich rapper who wants to join a golf club but the snooty owner Cummings(Jeffrey Jones) refuses to let C-Note and his pals join the club. C-Note does everything in his power to annoy Cummings and later on challenges him to a golf tournament.Opinion: Doesn't that plot remind you of that movie with Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield and that silly gopher? This movie has other problems besides it being a ripoff of Caddyshack. You're sitting there waiting for a laugh and it never comes. Big Boi is not funny and the movie relies too much on fart jokes and clich\u00e9s. Jeffrey Jones is overacting to the extreme just like he did in Howard The Duck. Sherri Shepard plays a caricature of a black woman and as a matter of fact the majority of the actors in this movie are caricatures. You know a movie is in trouble when you have Andy Milonakis in it! And the scene where Faizon Love and the rest of those guys are baring their naked buns in the locker room is not funny, its just sick. Almost as sick as Rip Torn shaking his naked butt in Freddy Got Fingered. If you're looking for a laugh look elsewhere. Who's Your Caddy is 100% laugh-free. A certified double bogey.",

            "content": "Who's Your Caddy? is rightly considered an American classic. Don Michael Paul directs wonderfully, in the vision of a modern day Harper Lee. The story is easy to follow and the humor is fresh and original. While all these characteristics would qualify Who's Your Caddy? as genius cinema, they do not necessarily indicate a classic. What moves Who's Your Caddy? to classic status is its morality and ability to draw sympathy out of viewers as much today as when it was written in 2005. Who's Your Daddy deals with heavy and vital issues - racism, oppression, injustice. Amazingly, it is able to handle these deep and sensitive areas without feeling depressing or preachy. Michael Paul accomplishes this by making the viewer feel like a child and allowing us to learn along with him. Big Boi's (C-Note) acting makes it is easy to enter the world of modern day Atlanta. Despite all the flaws of the city, it is also easy to love many things about the place and many of the characters. If you have not yet seen Who's Your Caddy?, you will not regret picking it up at your local video store. If you saw it in the theater, it may be time to visit this world again. Wait, I've changed my mind, this movie sucks monkey testicles.",

            "review_title": "Why we should be tee'd off at this film",
            "content": "When pitching the idea for Who's Your Caddy?, the filmmakers most likely said \"let's remake Caddyshack, for next to nothing, and do it with an African-American cast.\" That's all this has to offer. The thing that made the 1980's Caddyshack so funny, so clever, and work well was because it was energized by a cast of comedic talent like Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield. I'm surprised nobody ever said \"let's ask Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and Tracy Morgan to be in this.\" I'm known to like urban films. I thoroughly enjoyed the film Barbershop, and absolutely loved Boyz N The Hood, a drama film about three males growing up on the wrong side of the street. Even urban comedy films like Death at a Funeral, Don't Be a Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, and Friday I can't help but laugh at. They are well written, but they also have a mind to their madness. They aren't always just random shouting from the characters, with pointless jokes. They can be funny and have a big heart.Who's Your Caddy does nothing but try to \"start something.\" It tries to pull racial issues where none exist, and it tries to make white people the anti-Christ of the world. This was 2007. Now it's 2011. Racism exists, but it's now much more seldom than it once was. Instead of acting like this is the first time blacks and whites ever crossed paths, why don't they try and make it something different. Something, you know? More current and entertaining.The story is a rapper nicknamed C-Note (Patton) is forbidden a membership to the prestigious golf-club that is Carolina Pines Country Club. So he purchases land that is part of the course, and winds up bribing his way into a membership earned from the club's strict owner (Jones). The rest of the film is just senseless humor about horses eating marijuana, farting, and racism. You can see this comedy comes from a very mature nature.One of my favorite black comedians, Faizon Love, makes an appearance, but he thinks that being funny means shouting all his lines and repeating everything everyone else says just adding \"the n word.\" Andy Milonakis also shows up playing a teenager, but if you know the truth that Milonakis is in his mid-thirties, and he only has the voice and appearance of a teenager because of a condition that stunts his growth, the joke is ruined. Now if I went into this under the impression that Milonakis was around seventeen, done some homework, and learned that he was in fact in his thirties, than the joke is on me. But since I didn't, the joke is on the movie for thinking I'm that out of touch.The humor also derives from gangster rap and other things not currently present today. The film passes itself off as \"just another 2007 comedy.\" Not a flashback one. Who's Your Caddy? tries to be current, but at the same time, it is so dated and so out of touch with today's society that if you're laughing at the movie, it's because it doesn't truly know what it is.The biggest problem is just the subject matter and immaturity brought to light in this film. It disgusts me that this comedy is making humor out of racism, a very demeaning and vile thing that still exists today. It makes white people out to be the enemy. They try to say \"Golf is a white man's sport and they don't allow black people.\" Stop and think - one of the biggest golfers today is black. And if you go to any golf course, I live right by one, you'll see black people play it too. Sure the sport is dominated by whites, but blacks are just as welcome. There are no racial issues here. So why bring them up as if their were? Who's Your Caddy? says a lot about the world today. It says that white people are the enemy, they are used in this film to be awkward, and that the makers try to expose it in a comedy film with no redeeming qualities. Maybe this could've been a documentary, instead of a comedy if it wanted to focus on racial issues in the sport of golf. If that's the case, pick a genre.Starring: Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton, Jeffery Jones, James L. Avery, Tony Cox, Tamala Jones, Jenifer Lewis, Andy Milonakis, Sherri Shepperd, Tony Cox, and Lil Wayne.

Neither cartoony nor really over the top (okay just a bit) this is a movie where everyone (mostly)behaves like real people. Actually one of the key points is that the hero is a better person then the jerks running the country club. Clearly made by film makers who didn't work for \"the man\" who would have the rappers as gangsters or clowns, this is a nice comedy that makes one wonder who was in the board room the day this was green lit since its so atypical Hollywood on almost every level. recommended on cable if not as a rental.",

However, anyone too harshly critical of this movie is not enjoying it on its intended merits.The acting from the players is actually pretty good and the pacing clips along so you are never bored watching it. Some films you wish you could fast forward to the end so you could leave the theatre. I find this with many films rated above 6 stars. But \"Caddy\", though never intended to be 'serious' comedy, is a lot of fun and a pleasant diversion. It is much, much better than should be rightfully expected from one of its genre.There are vulgarities, but not uncomfortably so. (However, I would not at all take children.)The racial theme I took more as an indictment on class differences, and it was not nearly as one-sided as you might expect.There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments - even more than are in the trailer. The cast is surprisingly good, especially Jeffrey Jones at his smarmy best.In short, the rating \"Caddy\" is getting from many users I do not personally understand because I consider a movie that keeps me entertained and is pleasant to watch a winner. Do I think it a great movie? - no one would. But is it unpretentious fun? - absolutely. Give \"Caddy\" a chance - you should be pleasantly surprised at its quick pace, its genial tone and its fun laughs.",

The majority of audiences have found that these films were NOT that funny. These films tend to be trite, tired recycles of previous fare. Should that relegate them to the Bottom of IMDb? NO. Although they're not great movies, they're a long way from awful. Who knows, folks of a new generation may really enjoy them? Maybe those same folks will seek out the \"original\" works (in this case Caddyshack) and benefit from more \"classic\" films. In my opinion, there are not ENOUGH comedies about golf, or hockey for that matter. Lots about baseball, basketball and football, but not so many about golf. I LIKE golf comedies, and I found myself laughing a fair bit at this movie. Is it brilliant? No. Was Caddyshack? Nope, but it was a lot better. Was Happy Gilmore? Umm, yeah, I really liked it, and Who's Your Caddy doesn't come close, BUT it's still OK. I really liked Jesper Parnevik showing up, but I didn't really like him being treated like a \"bad guy\". I kind of hoped that in the US Open finals, Jesper would've been in there simply because he had played the course before but maybe now I'm looking for too many layers in a fairly simple film.

It made me laugh, some people need to get a life, how can they think that this was not entertainment, have they forgotten why we go to the movies, it's to be entertained, not to be political, or racial. I think they need to take a look at themselves and wonder why they didn't like this movie. This was a well cast movie, the location was perfect, and the music was great, I loved the way the story came together it all tied in so well. I expect this movie to be a sleeper and come into it's own in a few weeks. The more people see this movie the more it will be understood and liked. I have seen it twice and loved it more the second time.",

            "content": "First of all, the only reason I even bothered watching this movie was because I saw it rated so low and thought to myself, \"It can't be that bad can it?\" After watching this movie, the answer was a resounding no.Let's get the obvious out of the way. 1.\"This movie is a ripoff of Caddyshack\" You don't need to even watch the movie to understand this. I have trouble believing that anyone who watched this movie didn't expect it to be heavily influenced by Caddyshack 2. \"The acting is horrible.\" I've seen much, much worse acting. Especially because the majority of the actors in this movie were rappers, and they were barely acting at all. 3. \"The script is horrible\" Once again...the movie is called Who's Your Caddy, its cast is made of rappers and Jeff Jones. It's ridiculous to go into this movie expecting a Godfather like script. The good: I love great movies. I can't stress enough how much I love those great cult movies like Eraserhead, all those great independent movies like Brick and the such. However, throughout this movie, I couldn't stop laughing. I think I even laughed at this movie more than I laughed at Knocked Up. There are 2 fundamental ways to enjoy this movie. 1: Be stupid enough to thing the jokes were good. or 2. Realize just how bad these jokes are, and laugh at the script not with it. Some of the quotes in this movie are just so misplaced and unnecessary that it's hilarious. Maybe it's all of those racial based jokes that are so horrible that they are amazing. I hope you all have heard of the movie The Room. I think it takes the same state of mind to watch this movie. If you watch Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" with the same state of mind the people who gave this movie a one did, you'd probably vomit. But, you can't. I can't stress enough how necessary it is to watch this movie as if it were an independent movie. This movie is horrible, and that's what makes it so great. Every year there are tons of mediocre 5-6 star movies that invoke nothing in people. Once every few years though, we get a gem like this. A movie so bad that we have to watch it in a totally different way in order to enjoy. Viewers, I ask you, embrace this train wreck and brace yourself for the turbulence.",

This was a renewal of sorts of the character Jones dawned in Ferris Bueller, but with a fresh hip hop twist.Faizon Love brought his unique body, and warmth to his role as Big Large. I can identify with his commentary on the roles race play in the world, and I adore his ability to tear the barrier down through his art-form.This film is filled with great cameos from Terry Crews, of White Chicks notoriety, Lil Wayne, the name speaks for itself, and the comic genius, Tony Cox, who appeared in Bad Santa.This film has it all. The love story is warming, in a world where love can seem unattainable, or cold. There is action, as well as many well shot sport scenes. The rides are strait up ill.I understand James Avery asked to do this part, after reading a synopsis of the story online. His role commands respect, and really pushes the world to strive to settle these race differences that have occurred too often, and not so long ago.I recommend everyone see this film. I watched this film with my father, and for the first time in my life, we felt comfortable weeping together. SOUTH SI-IDE!!",

Those of you who made all of those negative comments; it seems that you are upset that, for once, the black people were smarter & wittier than the white people in the movie. I know that there are those few remaining elements out there that can't grasp that idea!I think it's great for my young black adults to see that you don't have to start at the bottom all of the time. That they can walk into any establishment with there head held high and be a prospect rather than a suspect.Through out the entire movie, the young black man did not have to drop his head & \"bow down\" to the establishment. Instead, he used intelligence, the resources around him, and persistence to reach his goal. Can't we have just one \"feel good\" movie? Must we always struggle & be tormented throughout the movie in order to have a winning outcome? Let list a few movies with similar humor: Caddy Shack, Blazing Saddles, Airplane!, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, Nat. Lampoon's Animal House, Big, Shampoo, Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, Mrs. Doubtfire, City Slickers, Beetlejuice, The Jerk, Bull Durham, Good Morning,Vietnam, I could go on & on! Bet you thought those were funny! Why,then, would you single out this movie? Is it because you can't relate to the characters because the ethnicity is not like your own? Think about that!",

There are some crude moments, but the movie wisely keeps its boundaries. That's rare for a movie such as this.\r\nOutkast rapper Big Boi is surprisingly enjoyable in the lead role, and he has surrounded himself with a cast that appears game for anything. Even disgraced actor Jeffrey Jones is decent in the throwaway role of the perpetually foiled bad guy much like his character in \"Ferris Bueller\". \r\nA little push and some ambition and they really could have had something here. I laughed a few times, and smiled a lot. Just not enough for me to whole-heartedly get behind \"Who's Your Caddy?\".

This is a refreshing new direction for modern film and I believe this is the beginning of a prosperous film career for Big Boi. The polo scenes were exhilarating to say the least. The story touched me deeply, with the final scene leaving me in tears. It is a great step in illuminating racism in our society, revealing that people of all cultural backgrounds can enjoy the thrill of golf. Truly, it has been years since a film has come along with such cultural impact. Bravo.\n\nAlso nice sideboob.",

I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man. This movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it.\r\n\r\nI am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies. He needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs.\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about renting this or buying it.

I am very surprised I didn't see C-Note and the gang eat some fried chicken with a side of watermelon.  It also reinforced white stereotypes too.  I love how the black people in this movie think that \"the man\" is putting them down because C-Note pushes his way into an exclusive club, in which their is a six year waiting period, demanding admittance and when the white man doesn't let him in he's being racist. NO, there's a waiting period you jackass.  My favorite line of the movie is when the white man calls one of his \"posse\" a moron and he says \"Did he just call me a nigga?\" NO he called you a moron listen up next time.

Not only is this the worst film of 2007, but also possibly the worst film ever made in the history of cinema.

A rap mogul attempts to join a country golf club with opposition from the club's president (Jones). But he gets his membership and his war with the club president continues. That's the only evidence of a plot that emerged here, in this agonizingly terrible movie that is like having an eye enema! The script is as painful as falling into a pit of razorblades, and not even taking hallucinogenics would make this film seem good! It's as bad as Hitler's decision to initiate the Holocaust! I would rather jump off a cliff into jagged rocks than watch this movie again! It's a bigger mistake than making George W. Bush the President of the United States! It's predictable, uncreative, terribly plotted, filled with filthy sexual humour and even resorts to using pathetic flatulence gags! Poorly scripted, poorly filmed, poorly acted, poorly edited. Avoid it like the plague!!!!",

He tries to bribe but it doesn't work. he decides to buy the estate right next door to get on the owner's nerves,who has a lot of prejudice against black people. He tries everything to keep him out from accepting him to then try to revoke his membership to even order a hit to get him out of his hair. Will he succeed?\n\nThe movie's alright. It's better then i expected but not the greatest either. I wanted to see it cause Big Boi was the main actor. Some part are really funny. You got some funny heads like Sherri Shepherd,Faizon Love and Bruce Bruce. Lil wayne also makes an appearance. There's also Terry Crews who played in Friday after next and White chicks. The point of the movie is plain and sample. Some things turned me off how as soon as there's black people around people gotta try and act \"ghetto\" with the peace love. It's a stereotype that turned me off not all of us actually act like that, having the little rich boy acting black with grills etc. That part could have slightly different. If you're looking for a stupid kind of comedy and you're a Big boi fan this is the movie for you. I enjoyed it and Big boi can act good as well.",

No! \r\n\r\nNow let's forget that this movie is probably the most racist piece of trash I've ever seen, and just focus on it as a movie.\r\n\r\nIt sucks.\r\n\r\nLook, when even my friend who I saw the movie with, who is black, dresses in those cool doo-raggy thingies, and laughs at anything in the audience with me is giving the screen that \"wtf?\" look at what are supposed to be jokes, you know this movie sucks. Everything even remotely funny is in the previews. In fact, it makes bold attempts at being...I don't know...cute. It feels like a kids movie, it really, really does, some family-oriented adventure about getting into a country club. But then you throw in the numerous references to \"hoes\" and completely idiotic overexagerations of what is 'gangster.' For example there's a pimped-out golf cart (complete with 'spinners') that's introduced during a stupid rap melody in slow motion. The director obviously did this as a cheap sight gag, but the only thing I heard from the people beside me was \"that's retarded.\" Well said. In fact, that might be the best way to review this movie, being short and simple: retarded.",
