            "review_title": "A review of \"D-War\"",
            "content": "To review \"D-War\" (sometimes called \"Dragon Wars\" or \"Dragon Wars: D-War\") with any real depth would be an exercise in utter futility. I mean that, really. The film is a big, loud special effects bonanza the likes of which have been seen plenty of times on United States soil, but \"D-War\" is unique in the fact that it is not an American production, but an Asian one, specifically of the South Korean kind.But just because it's a South Korean movie with American actors, does that really make it good? It's a yes/no/maybe so type of answer. \"D-War\" comes to us from South Korean import Hyung-rae Shim, who announced the project back in 2002 and has spent the last five years getting it off the ground. It's received mostly negative reviews here in the U.S. and in South Korea (where it set box office records for an opening week with an estimated five million viewers within a nine-day time-span), but the movie's special effects and action sequences are undeniably stunning. But it's a shame about the story and characters.Supposedly based on an ancient Korean legend, a 200-meter-long Imoogi (a giant serpent) called Buraki is denied a chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined to perform the ceremonial rights run away and perish in their escape. 500 years later in Los Angeles, the man is reincarnated as American news reporter Ethan (Jason Behr), who as a child was given a powerful pendant by an elderly antiques dealer named Jack (Robert Forster) and now has to find the reincarnated woman, Sarah (Amanda Brooks), before her 20th birthday.Sure enough, in special effects sequences that seem right out of any Asian monster flick made in the last 50 years, the dragon Buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army of demonic warriors to continue his 500-year pursuit of what is rightfully his. Lots of explosions, guns, and destruction as ancient slams head-on into 21st-century military technology, and Ethan and Sarah try to find a way to stop Buraki and his army before he destroys the city.\"D-War\" is a film that looks and sounds amazing, in theory, but the execution is so poor that you'll rightfully feel that you've been cheated by the time the credits roll. Make no mistake, Buraki and his minions look pretty cool and plenty menacing, and the destruction they bring about in their action sequences is nothing short of breathtaking. In this regard, Shim has surely done his job in presenting \"D-War\" as a no-holds-barred sci-fi/fantasy action epic.On the other hand, the film's human players are drastically short-changed and given cheap, hokey dialogue and scenes that rarely connect. It seems that the only reason they're here is to give us something to root for, which is not in any real way genuine. \"D-War\" unfortunately comes off as something a lot closer to the poor American adaptation \"Godzilla\" (1998) than anything that is uniquely Korean. Another problem is that the story seems to take itself a little too seriously, with cheap humor that doesn't get anything greater from us than a weak little laugh. The acting and direction seem mediocre at best (so that you do feel a little sorry for the hokey performances of American heavyweight Robert Forster and up-and-coming Jason Behr), which is a real shame because Hyung-rae Shim is obviously a capable talent who knew what he wanted to do here and surely enough had the means to do it. His head seems full of ideas but the problem is with the execution of those ideas; maybe he was trying to do too much without really working out the material in greater detail. And the ending, a would-be \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" special effects showdown, seems pretty cheap too.I really wanted to like this movie, believe me, but \"D-War\" is a mediocre attempt at something that really had potential to be spectacular. But maybe it's because I'm an American. Maybe you'd have to be Korean to understand the mythical themes about that classic battle between good and evil. It's just too bad that the finished product of \"D-War\" appears to be like any other \"B\"-grade monster movie than the extraordinary idea that the director had in mind.5/10",

            "content": "How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.",

            "review_title": "A sloppy translation from Korean to English",
            "content": "Apparently \"D-War\" was originally a Korean film. But instead of simply translating it into English (either with captions or dubbing), they separately filmed some American actors and inserted them into the movie. Then, during portions where the Koreans talk, occasionally the narrator summarizes what they said...no captions, no dubbing...but a LOT of confusion. This is a case where a film bombed and much of it simply was because the film wasn't translated well to English-speaking audiences! It fel much like watching a film in a foreign land and understanding nothing until, on rare occasions, someone sitting behind you explains a BIT of what is going on! I think the filmmakers would have been kept the film in Korean...period.The story, because of the way it's told, is pretty confusing and I'm not going to bother recounting the script. Suffice to say that there are a lot of CGI monsters, explosions and wire fu.....all set to a story that just left me baffled. And, it left me wondering what non-Korean speaking person would sit through the movie.Overall, there is some nice CGI, some lovely acting by Korean folks and nothing of any value for non-Korean speakers! Next time you want to market a film abroad, do a better job of it! And, in light of this, I can understand why the film is #68 on the IMDB Bottom 100...at least the international/English speaking version. Pretty much unwatchable....but at least it looked nice.",

            "review_title": "The worst major film I've seen in a long time",
            "content": "I went into this movie with high hopes. Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought. I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects. All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things: -The acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. -The storyline: The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clich\u00e9d, not thought-out, and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clich\u00e9d thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and clich\u00e9. -The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out. It's gotta be better than this, cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible.",

It's totally corny and implausible, but it's DRAGON WARS, it's not trying to win any Oscars. to people who say the visual effects are the worst they have seen, PUH-lease. The effects are about on par with Dragonheart and the Godzilla remake. Of course, this means the effects are ten years old, and films like T2 and Jurassic Park still look like they were made last year, but that's beside the point. The effects aren't THAT bad.The acting is average. Nothing special. Better than Keanu Reeves or Clive Owen. See, what I'm trying to do here is show you that a movie like \"Gryphon\" or \"Raptor Island\" or \"Alone in the Dark\" are much much worse than this. Stop giving unfair comparisons. The last 20 minutes of the movie actually had some good action, and the final battle was great. Lighten up. Just have sit back and MST3K it if you want. But it's cheesy monster mashing fun.",

But once I've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a few times, I really can't take it any more.Also, I would love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.",

            "review_title": "It's happening here too?",
            "content": "First of all, let me remind you people that I'm not affiliated to this film, neither directly nor indirectly, therefore there is no reason for me to dress up my comment in any direction, which in turn enable me to put an impartial comment about this film.Second, I also watched the film, being a Korean (living in Korea of course) and the film being shown in nearby theater, so I might be able to seek out the Cons and Pros of the film more accurately than some people who just speculate on other's comment only.That being said, let me tell you what's really happening in Korea concerning D-War OK, the facts first.As of Aug 6th (Korean local time), D-War viewer counter surpassed 3 million. That's right. This movie is a huge hit in Korea, whether it is a masterpiece or crap. The increase rate of total viewer number is such that there is saying that D-War will surpass the total viewer record of 13 million, a record set by last year's The Host.For this particular film, there are ongoing struggle between two sizable forces. The Korean orthodox film-making faction, represented by 'Choong Moo Ro' \u0096 the Korean version of Hollywood - is the major force of film-making in Korea. This is where almost all Korean movies were born.And there is an unorthodox film making faction. In fact, it is so small in size and force to compare fairly with the other side. Therefore it is treated not as much as a faction, but just a time-to-time phenomenon that pops up once in a while.Director Shim belongs to the latter and his film D-War is the single most successful (as of yet, in Korean market) case.Shim was (and I believe he still is) one of the most famous (therefore successful) comedian in Korean of all time. That is a fact everyone (even the Choong Moo Ro faction) acknowledges.However, the fact that he is a successful comedian worked against his transition to a film director.I don't know about other countries, but in here, the comedian used to be treated as 'low class job' because what they do looked silly, so when he became a director, he was ruthlessly criticized by the orthodox faction.Those criticisms still exist today, as you can find those in Korean film related sites.So what happened? Almost, um... no, that's a wrong word. All of the critics rated D-War at the bottom end, sometimes even lower than some of the real crap film which did not survive in domestic market for more than a week. (Their rating was very simple. If a for-real crap film made by the orthodox faction has terrible plot, they would shrug and say, 'it's creative.') This in turn fueled the rage of people using the internet (called Netizen here), and they took their fight to the orthodox faction, creating a BIG MESS as a result.With such a huge struggle going on, general population overheard the news of it and many of them became more curious about the film of issue, the D-War I suspect this event ironically played a big role D-War getting this record breaking sale in domestic market.Now, about the film itself.As I've seen it, I don't think it is a knockout that some people say, but I don't think it's such a bad movie that some others say.The plot is there, however lacking it's smoothness in transition between the scenes. And the plot itself is not bad.The problem is how the film weaves the story. In that part, there is a major 'Whoopsie,' that in turn creates three major (serious, but not totally lethal, I think) problems.The fact that total running time is about 90mins may have affected it, but since Shim must have played a part in editing, it might not be a good excuse.First, it brings some confusion in understanding the storyline.Second, it affects the actors and actresses, making their acting look awkward and out of place sometimes.Third, it makes the first half of the movie quite boring, since that part is where the film explains the overall plots and develops them. Actually, there was some good humor evenly placed, the director Shim's trademark sort (He used to be a Comedian, if you have forgotten) to ease the boredom, but it's quite 'Korean thing,' so I doubt it might work in off-shore market.Okay, so is the D-War really crap? I wouldn't say so. Personally, I was bored to hell in the first half of the movie, but was mesmerized to the CG scene in the second half.The second half of the movie, where the action really starts is where the 'fun' begins. (That is, if you endured the first half without major outburst of anger and exited the theater by kicking the door open) Well, the battle scene is quite good, considering its CG was all domestic (I mean Korean) technology and it was really their first shot at it.Compared to Transformer? In evaluation of absolute term, Transformer is better. I mean, c'mon, what did you expect? The total cost for D-War is around 70 billion won, which is approximately $75 million. How much did the Transformer cost? I don't know. But I don't think it's anywhere near $75 mil.That fact in mind, CG in D-War is not half bad. It's even impressive in some way, as long as you don't measure it with major Hollywood block-buster film standard. I mean, you don't compare Lamborghini and Ford Mustang by same standard, do you? So, there you have it.D-War is not a 'record-setting' block-buster, but it's not a 'Straight to DVD shop' crap.Some of you might quite enjoy it, while some of you won't.",

Otherwise, don't bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and that made me feel good. After the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.The CG is good. Acting and directing are horrible. Storyline is extremely simple. But, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.It's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.",

Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10I don't drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie",

            "content": "We saw this at Movies on the Parkway, Sevierville, TN.This movie was poorly advertised from the beginning. The ads hyped a dragon on dragon war wherein mankind was at risk. And it was, but not as implied, and thereby disappointing some movie goers who expected good dragons versus bad dragons, utterly destroying a big city. I won't detail the story, but let me correct some poor reporting: There IS a story - a very rich story, at that! But it was not the story indicated in the few ads that were run.This is a story- and effects-driven vehicle wherein the South Korean tale of the Imoogi is told via memories of our lead character. It could have been a well-balanced work, adding in the character-driven plot lines; however, the acting herein was so poor, as to drive this film down into the annals of the \"B\" action/horror flick.The effects are awesome! The treatment of the Eastern Dragon after transformation was nothing short of a pure work of art! This is not just another monster movie. The story line and overall finished product far outweigh any Godzilla movie of which TOHO ever dreamed.However.The film quality is poor. A better quality would have lent a great deal to this work, but even the best quality would not have overridden the stiff performances and fake smiles. Though it did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the work, it did lessen the enjoyment somewhat.Frankly, the Lord of the Rings/Star Wars-worthy CGI combined with poor acting quality and brilliant style, left this production feeling more uneven and unprepared for filming, as if the actors themselves did not have their hearts in this work.All in all? We were highly entertained by both the story and the visuals, but we cannot decide whether this should be rated as a fantastic \"B\" flick, or a decent \"A\" film.It rates a 9.9/10 on the \"B\" Scale, which is about a 7.4/10 on the \"A\" Scale, from...the Fiend :.",

Did you really expect a movie called \"D-War: Dragon Wars\" to be good? All you have to do is look at the cast. They got B-Movie veteran Robert Forster in a small role, and with the exception of Craig Robinson (Hot Tub Time Machine), the rest of the cast were B-list stars.One thing I find absolutely amazing is that everyone says \"The special effects were great, but everything else was awful\", to which I say, \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!\". Because these were some of the worst special effects I've seen in a major production like this. No special effects shot impressed me, it all sucked. Okay, the \"dragon-ball\" and the final dragon were pretty nice looking, but that's it! Now the acting: Yes it's hokey, but that's part of the fun of any cheesy movie. Come on! The acting isn't important in a movie like this.The writing: It was bad, confusing, and stupid. But also comical. When the old lady tried to go through the fence, that was just hilarious.The direction: I have to say that this is an attractive film. Not because of the effects, but because of the colours. Overall this was a nice film to look at. The director, Hyung-rae Shim, known for his other cheesy monster movie, \"Reptilian\", may not be a Spielberg or Scorsese, but at least he has some colourful style.The highlight: The action sequence in the middle of the movie is a showstopper. Why? Because personally, I'm sick of that stupid Bourne-style action with the incoherent zooms, and the shaky camera work. Here, the action is shot in a third person perspective, allowing the audience to actually observe the action without getting nauseous. Thank god Michael Bay didn't direct this, otherwise I would've thrown up. This action scene is also impressive for being really long, however, if it ended about 3 minutes earlier, I would've been more satisfied, because it just went a little too far.The climax: It was dark, and kind of hard to see. But just watch \"AVP:R\", and this'll seem as bright as day. For anyone wondering which was the good snake, it was the lighter one. The fight scene wasn't the best, but still entertaining.Nit-Picks: A useless sub-plot involving the FBI, and the actor who played the bad guy was clearly mouthing English, but he was dubbed over with a stupid droning gibberish sound (which was supposed to make him more threatening?). If I re-watched it, I could probably find a hundred more, but I don't have that much time on my hands.The final word: Overall, a fun way to spend 90 minutes. We all have guilty pleasures, this is one of mine. This can be thoroughly entertaining if your in the right mood. This is a must see for monster movie fans. Actually, B-Movie fanatics in general. The last thing I'm going to say is that I don't understand is why people are praising \"Pirahna: 3-D\" (which I also enjoyed), despite the fact that it has a stupid plot, bad acting, and bad special effects. Meanwhile, this movie has all of those same elements, but people say that this sucks. Well, maybe it's the gore, blood and nudity, which makes everything better (*cough*). Oh yeah, \"D-War\" also throws in some martial arts, and an ancient army. In the words of M. Night Shyamalan, \"WHAT A TWIST!\". 10/10",

Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why.The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script & dialog, directing, editing, etc. was God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings. It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Sauron's army.The creatures were ridiculous. You can't just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half.The scene transitions are horrible. I didn't fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes.The characters were caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script.The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie...failed. Ethan didn't cry when Sarah died...though he hadn't known her for very long during THIS life anyways. He didn't seem too upset to be left in \"Mordor\", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We couldn't for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either.Oh, and why did the dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing...all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this as well. Then why does Ethan get screwed? He's left alone, without the girl, without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back. What's he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And IF he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.Don't waste your time or money on this movie.

The fight between good and evil at the end was, I have to to say could have been longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good.Now on to the parts that i think could have been better. The beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles.

The movie failed to meet them.I don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent. This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla.A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent \"paranormal division\" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims \"I never meant for this to happen.\" A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who \"died like star-crossed lovers.\" Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing \"Ran\" with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clich\u00e9s and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but I'm not even sure that it's worth that much.",

            "content": "First off you don't see any dragons until the end, serpents,monsters and other nasties but an actual Asian dragon only at the end.This is the story of a young man who realizes that a story that was told to him by an old guy in an antique shop is true - he is the reborn protector of a girl who has the power to make a giant serpent into a dragon- a power that the evil serpent wants to use.In the 1500's, the last time the girl was born, the protector and the girl fell in love and committed suicide when the monsters attacked. Now everyone has been reborn and the monsters-which no one believes in, at first, are on the march.The action sequences and visual effects are mostly sterling. These are mind blowing attack and monster sequences as the evil serpent tries to get the girl in 1503 with a huge army, the serpent now trying to do the same both on its own and with a huge monster army in the middle of Los Angeles, as well as final battle. As it stands now these are some of the most incredible mind blowing action scenes ever in any monster movie. I am in awe of them. they are quite simply everything you ever thought would be cool in a Godzilla movie and then some. I want to say things a great deal more, but I think that would be over selling it (which I won't do with the next bit).However............However.............Everything else in this film is awful. I mean this is one of the worst films of the year. Don't get me wrong they spent every buck on the action sequences and I'm grateful, but the rest of the film is just bad. Its badly written, badly filmed and often poorly acted, clearly it was a pay check job for most of the cast.the basic idea of the story is okay but outside of the action sequences this movie is dreadful. I can't tell you how bad it is. Its so bad that it made me wish that I had missed the set up and just came in on the monster attacks since the non-action stuff is so bad is ruins the rest of the movie.Forgive me but this is an just a really bad movie when the monsters are not on screen-so much so its very close to unwatchable.Yes I will buy it on DVD so I can see the action sequences again, but add this (minus its action scenes) to the list of films playing on eternal repeat in hell.",

Also... you really can't be that blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants. The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression. Here's the film, dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks, flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows. Old shop keep reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god. tells the kid that he's a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry. Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he's a 500 year old Asian. fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.so Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing. Its a Korean legend and she's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt, she calls the police cause it looks like she's having a heart attack. See, in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy. I have a new phobia now, and its that if i'm ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i'm crazy. I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress, Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a caf\u00e9' with sassy black friend. In the scenes prior Miffed Near divinity Bauraki has killed an elephant, slithered through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. See, people were afraid to come out after 9-11 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual, no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on. If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win. After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi$$ and vinegar filled scene to end it all with. Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess. They don't really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up, yep dragon palace. some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle/make love whatever. And i'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think i'm blowing it out of proportion, i'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly... there! Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god, sets Baurki on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragon-god, dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits... thank godNow our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful. He could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises. The actors for the most part were great... if great somehow meant terrible. Jason Behr, whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious, spacey and Patrick Dempsey\"ish\".The one thing i love about this filthy prostitute Dwars is its lead actor, Bauraki. That Giant snake acted his heart out. I'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi-god of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast. When he ate an elephant i felt like no one past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling. He was more then an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project. Yes damn it, my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake. I've got the balls to admit that, do you?Here's to hoping Bauraki get's more work and isn't type cast, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare, and that i never have to watch Blue Monkey again. So, D-War its over. I want my CDs back and let's just be friends",

Yes, it is.The fact that I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel was a red flag in itself, but I figured why not? Although just about everything on Sci-Fi is questionable, dragons are cool... Could it really be so bad? Yes. Yes it can.\"To protect the universe or destroy the world\" is the ever-so-ominous warning at the start of the film, so we're made aware of the fact that we're in for a good one. And by good, I mean bad.There is a meandering yet somewhat confusing re-telling of a Korean tale which apparently sparked the genius behind this film. I have an IQ of 150, and I really wasn't sure exactly what all that meant. Basically, it's a very original plot: good versus evil. The ancient battle, however, goes way beyond mythology by using creatures that never lived and firepower that could not have existed at that time in history, not to mention evil soldiers that grunt like sick livestock. It may be sci-fi, but it was off to a bad start.At 19 minutes into the film (including commercials), I was sorely tempted to turn it off. With acting so bad that it makes high school musicals seem like gems and a storyline full of gaping holes (at 19 minutes!), one wonders why anyone would bother wasting his/her time with it.Summary of the pawn shop: \"Oh, hello little American boy. You are the incarnation of a warrior I raised, and you'll save the world someday. Is that okay with you?\" I did find it amusing that Sarah referred to Korean writings on yellow construction paper as \"the only things that can protect\" her. And yet she decided to leave the safety of her new d\u00e9cor to go out for a few beers with pals. WHY? Then walk home alone at night in Los Angeles. WHY? So I didn't turn it off, if only to find out how bad this movie would truly be. WHY?! I must admit, however, that the CGI is rather impressive. That being said, what a gigantic waste of good effects on such a very crappy movie! The old woman trying to walk through the fence. The homeless guy yelling \"bum!\" at a car that splashed mud on him. These are just two examples of completely useless entries in this movie that have nothing to do with anything and provide no purpose, not even humor at this point. The only useless but funny parts were the scenes with the zoo security guard.Do not forget a very important point presented here: Doctors will always take reporters to see anyone they want, especially if the patient is under quarantine.Another good point: If anyone tells you *not* to take the stairs and *do* take the elevator in the event of an emergency (especially an apparent earthquake), BEWARE! Question: how the hell would the DOD know that the snake is after Sarah Daniels? Honestly. It's just not remotely plausible.And, perhaps the biggest question of them all: At what point did the dark army find time to construct their city of evil? All the Mordor references are right on! As usual, all is well, the world is saved, and love carries on. Regardless, this film is now on par with my other #1 crappiest film, Carnosaur II. Thank you, D-War.",

The good thing about it is I was laughing throughout the entire movie. From the ridiculous plot to the goofy dialog, this just seemed like it couldn't get any worse. The only actors in the film I recognized were Robert Forester, in what has to be the low point of his career, and comedian Craig Anton who used to be on MadTV. Neither of these actors are reasons to see this stupid, stupid movie.The plot, if you can call it that, deals with some old legend about dragons, and dragons and Korean warriors coming to LA, and the only hope of stopping them are two people who were reincarnated versions of these two Korean lovers. If you think my synopsis on what was happening is fuzzy, try seeing the movie, yours will be too. The plot was virtually nonexistent. Half of the movie was either a dream, or a flashback which didn't help us understand anything. Because of it's complicated story, the movie has Robert Forester explaining what's happening for about 15 straight minutes, and it explained nothing.I really hate bad clich\u00e9d movies, and amazingly this fits under that category too. The movie includes some light jokes, that were obviously meant to be funny, where instead they came off less funny than the rest of the movie. They had the 2 leads fall in love after only knowing each other for a literal 30 minutes. It had corny dialog that made me cringe. The special effects were very mediocre, just above what you'd expect on TV.If you want a good laugh, check this out. Otherwise steer clear of it.My rating: BOMB/****. 78 mins. PG-13 for violence",

For starters, there was no character development to speak of. The characters were just introduced, badly, and boom, we have a problem. Somehow the main character, Ethan, knew that he needed to meet this certain Sarah. No explanation of how he knows he needs to meet her, he just does. The old man in the movie, who apparently is a shape-shifter, and can fly, and can use magic, and is hundreds of years old, seems as though he could have handled everything by himself. So why search out all these other people? And Sarah, wow. I have bad dreams, so something bad is going to happen. That's it. That's her. Now run. Thank you, your scenes are over.The bad dragon somehow amasses an army from no where in particular. Even though they are ancient creatures they have rockets on their backs and blow up anything in their path. And I mean anything. Cars that are on streets that aren't in the way, buildings that happen to look like they need some reconstruction, just whatever. And then there's some guy with a sword that can disappear....awesome. He can also make fire shoot out from the ground by swinging his arm, and it looks exactly like someone put pyrotechnics in just the right spot for him, it was ridiculous.So this leads us to the end of the movie. Sarah and Ethan get caught by some flying creature, and when they wake up they're at a huge castle. Uh, okay, list that under one of the most random things I have EVER seen. Ethan is tied up on a pole, the bad guys didn't see a reason to kill him I guess, and Sarah is tied up on a sacrificial table. It all looks so bad for our \"heroes\" but then Ethan yells, \"No!\" and some stupid amulet he's had for half his life becomes shiny and kills everyone except him, Sarah, and the \"badass\" with the disappearing sword. Well well, why the hell didn't he just yell \"No!\" in the very beginning? Then he's about to get killed by disappearing sword guy but Mr. Badass deems it necessary to hit the amulet that just killed EVERYONE instead of somewhere else and *poof* he dies too. Who saw that coming? Finally you see the good dragon, and there's a lame fight and, well, I'm sure you can guess what happens.

It's best in the middle, when the U.S. army fights the monsters in the streets of LA; you can focus on the spectacle, and ignore the drivel that surrounds it. But the beginning has too much exposition (some claptrap about good and evil dragons, reincarnated lovers, and destiny), and by the end I was having trouble telling the good and evil lizards apart. Dragon Wars steals shamelessly from iconic movies like Godzilla, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and The Terminator, but doesn't come close to achieving iconic status itself.

            "content": "dee.reid is far too generous in his review of this movie. Allow me to offer a more blunt assessment: it was terrible! In recent years, I've never seen a movie that was so bad that wasn't trying to be. I've seen other movies that were as bad or worse, but usually as fodder for the cast of MST: 3k, a crew consisting of one captive man and two captive robots forced to endure the most hideous B-movies in Sci-fi/fantasy history. The trio survive only by slinging wisecracks and insults in a no-holds-barred attack on the movies in question.I felt myself irresistibly compelled to do the same while watching Dragon Wars. The actors, including the leading men and woman, seemed to reel from scene to scene, unsure even of what to feel or why they made the decisions they did. I confess, I was similarly confused. For example, one scene involves sending the lead characters, Ethan and Sarah, to the top of an L.A. skyscraper so they can board a helicopter to escape the evil dragon. Once they are in the helicopter, the dragon reaches the top of the building and destroys the helicopter. The pair make it out alive and are then forced to return to the street below. This could conceivably happen when running from a dragon, but the entire sequence is absurd from a movie-making standpoint. For all of the money and effort spent producing the sequence, the characters achieved nothing more than ending up right where they started before they entered the building.This sort of wasteful use of resources betrays the director's lack of experience. The dialogue, all of it, betrays his lack of writing experience. As much money as he must have spent on the movie, he should have worked smarter, not harder. Hiring a script doctor would have been a good start; a dialogue coach and an experienced co-director could have nicely rounded out a badly needed consulting team. And while I may not appreciate Korean culture, history, or mythology the way I should, this man did not make a Korean movie; he made an American movie. And as an American movie-goer, I feel particularly qualified to make this statement: \"That is the worst six bucks I've ever spent on a movie.\"",

Its got \"that guy from Roswell\" and \"Daryl\" and some pretty cute chick (and I swear to god one of those actors was in a porno I saw titled \"Busty Cops\" but that's a whole other thing that I don't feel like getting into).Also, this isn't a movie that's bad and unenjoyable (see \"War\"). Never does this get boring. When it does get to the supposedly boring parts the dialog is so laughably god awful that you are enjoying every damn minute of it.I honestly can say that I see no reason why this picture shouldn't win Best Picture come Oscar season. I haven't laughed in a movie theater this hard since... I dunno, Snakes On A Plane. Damn fine movie.Grade: A-",

The acting was strangled by a inconsistent and choppy script. I wondered if it was edited by a team of Korean script writers because it was so bad I gave up trying to follow the irrational twists and turns it made. I love Korea and just felt embarrassed for all Koreans. Other movies I have seen here like King of men, host, old boy, are kick ass original movies of international calibre. That this terrible movie represents Korea to the world is really painful to accept. The director gets no credits from me for his effort or drive or desires. I only care about the product. 2 out of my three points for this movies comes from the CGI. Which I would give to any good CGI based movie. It was good enough to make this movie great if the script, acting, direction and editing had been a lot better. If Shim Hyung-Rae can come back after taking a smack in the face like the direction of this movie deserves and produces something reasonable, then he will truly deserve to be called a movie director. I really hope that happens but I'm not going to hold my breath. Sometimes dreams just don't come true.",

            "content": "Well, on a whim my friends and I decided to see this. Mistake.The movie kind of starts of interesting, talking about a Korean legend of Dragons. Fair enough. But when the villain came in with mythological beasts that were a poor man's rip off from movies such as LOTR, I lost interest. That and the fact that despite it being set (in this part) in medieval times, the beasts could launch rockets. Yes, rockets.Then we cut to the present day, I thought at least with Jason Behr I'd have some eye candy. I'm shallow at times, but even this couldn't save it for me.The snake/dragon had now been transported from Korea to being a fossil in Los Angeles. Of course. And Jason Behr just HAPPENED to recognise it. Because he had an ancient Korean medallion that led to a long and windy flashback, culminating in him being the reincarnation of the protector of a girl who had to be sacrificed in order for a GOOD serpent/Dragon to absorb her special energy thing and thus save the world. Riiiiiiight.He manages to locate the reincarnated girl, and after 5 minutes together they're on a beach and having an obligatory kiss. He just HAPPENS to know a doctor who can help her to regress, to understand her dreams about the past.Meanwhile, the FBI are searching for the girl. They eventually locate Jason Behr and the girl, they know all about the serpent because 'The FBI have a very good paranormal section' (Guess Mulder and Scully are still working?).Anyway, they have to get to this cave, but before they do the bad nasty serpent and its owner find Sarah (the girl) and Mr Behr, transporting them to this magical realm (sooooo the point of the cave?) ...The medallion grows a pretty colour, but Mr Behr doesn't really save the day. The girl does, it's horrendous and basically the movie made me groan.The special effects, whilst I suppose I should commend them, are light years behind other movies.Overall it's a bad, bad movie that hopefully will NOT be released in other countries.I wonder if Jason Behr regrets making it .. because I know I would if I were in it.",

            "content": "D-War, is an incoherently stagnant, CGI ridden, jumbled mess from start to finish. From the first frame you can feel an amateurs hand at the material. This slop is the latest film from the ex-comedian Hyung-rae Shim who also directed the equally as terrible\"Yoggary\"(Reptilian). He is completely out of his element here. How canI say? Take all the worst scenes from Star Wars: Phantom menace, Lord of the Rings, and 300 put it in a blender and you can almost produce this trash. This film is bad, I mean REALLY bad.Whats so amazing about the movie, is so how un-spectacular it is. Its one of those movies you see in the discount rack at your local blockbuster video. You reach in your pocket, out of pure interest of course, but you still cant justify spending the 1.99 to buy it.The film's plot is the first problem. There is a pseudo-interesting intro about a Imoogi ( a Korean Dragon)in Korea and a young woman named Narin in Korea who must sacrifice her life to the dragon so he (Imoogi) can become a Celestial Dragon in the heavens (whatever that means). However there are not one but TWO IMOOGIs!!! Yeah you guessed it, one good and one bad how original eh? So a wise old man (damn that guy is wise) enlist the help of a young man by the name of Haram to protect her until the time came on her 20th birthday to sacrifice herself the large Dragon (And the plot thickens).However ever there is a problem, Haram and Narin have fallen in love(awe how sweet) so instead of letting her die in the mouth of the Dragon they jump off a mountain to their deaths. So the Imoogi, errr..Dragon, errr whatever it is has to wait another 500 years to become the Celestial Dragon. 500 years, damn that's a long time to wait. 500 years in the present our story starts. Haram is reincarnated as a young reporter by the name of Ethan Kendrick. He is investigating a strange disaster that has taken place in Los Angeles (why does every movie take place in Los Angeles?) Strangely enough the FBI gets involved, not usually the people who come to check out natural disasters, but anyway I suppose it's necessary for the ridiculous plot to take place.Meanwhile, Ethan suddenly remembers an old guy when he was young telling him about a Korean legend and puts two and two together and remembers some woman named Sarah who he protected 500 years ago (in his past life), so he uses his two most powerful tools to locate her: The Internet Data Base and a Big Fat Black guy. The black guy is purely there for comic relief, delivering one liners and loud quirky silliness we expect from our stereotype carbon cut out characters. He is also magically always around to get Ethan and his lady friend of out any trouble that may arise, using, purely, his blackness of course. Secondly Narin has been reincarnated too as the beautiful Sarah Daniels who is another carbon cut out. A helpless woman who is just in the middle of something bigger than her, (uh huh). There's also the slimy FBI agent who some how discovers why the Dragon (the evil one) is looking for her and has decided that killing her would be the best course of action. Meanwhile, the Dragon goes from door to door like a \"scaly\" salesman (surprisingly undetected) looking for her most of the movie. There are even beings resembling the Dark creatures from the Lord of the Rings in Shiny Armor, who can reflect bullets with their shields. The creature's leader looked like a lame talking version of \"Darth Maul.( I'm assuming a follower of the evil dragon) There are lots of explosions and heroic deaths with no real characters to care about. There isn't a sense of urgency seeing that you don't care what happens to any of those involved. The acting and performances are not only terrible, they are \"razzie\" terrible. Anyways, Kevin finds Sarah and they spend the rest of the movie running from the dragon until a very unsatisfying climax. D-war is a stale, uninspired, tired,regurgitated, borrowed piece of trash. Hyung-rae Shim is under the misconception that bigger and louder is better. As a director he doesn't understand the material itself, and by not realizing what he is working with he has failed to convey any vision that he may or may not have had. This film tries to be too serious. The movie feels clumsy and never really started with a solid foundation; resulting in the crumbling of the film far before the last frame. Apparently this movie took 6 years to make. If Hyung-rae Shim took 6 years on this project and this is all he could do, he should seek other fields of employment. I feel really sorry too, because the Korean media is pegging this movie as \"On Par\" with Hollywood films, proving Korea's place in the world's Cinema. They couldn't be more wrong. It may win awards in Korea, and break box office records there, but that's as far as it will go. Im not saying Hollywood is always good. I can count hundreds of movies that were terrible coming out of Hollywood. However, this D-War thing is one of those films that just makes you want to boo, hiss, throw popcorn and burn the place down. At the end of the feature there is a little Biography about Hyung-rae Shim himself and the struggle it took to make the film (all in text and pictures). This last little bit cries, \"please watch my film I worked so hard\", a self gratifying approach, which is soo Film-maker Masturbation. For those who don't understand what I mean, \"think\" about it. Its takes a very special director to make something truly great and the same could be said about the latter.",

The special/visual effects and CGI were bad. Quite bad. I have pretty high expectations for effects, but come on, anyone can justifiably say \"wow that dragon looks pretty crappy.\" There were a few action scenes, namely the one with the dragons fighting helicopters, that were not half bad. The plot had potential but it was butchered by a poor and clich\u00e9 screenplay...The bottom line is...Dragon Wars had potential, but they blew it.

            "content": "GoreMongral's Movie Review: Dragon Wars Dragon Wars has been a movie I have been waiting to see for sometime now. After hearing some not so glowing comments about I went into the movie expecting a total suckfest. Are the complaints valid, bad acting, editing and direction, yes ,yes and yes but despite all this for some reason I still found myself mildly entertained by this movie.The story is about 2 beasts known as Imoogi's one which is good, the other bad. These 2 beasts attempt to become Dragons by consuming the Yeouijoo, a magical pearl that is possessed by a girl that is born with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder. The forces of good send down 2 human warriors to defend the girl until it is time for her to sacrifice herself to the good Imoogi or have it taken from her by the evil Imoogi.The evil Imoogi with its forces of creatures and beast riders invade the village and attempt to take the girl but the girl rather dying than giving up the Yeouijoo plunges herself into the ocean and dies. Now 500 years later the 2 defenders along with the girl are reincarnated and the vicious and gentle Imoogi are back ready to claim the right to become a Dragon.Pretty much the story and editing are the glaring problems here. There is several scenes where we are propelled from one scene to the next without any middle section explaining how we got to that point. It's a real shame to as if someone with some better skills in the editing and directing department would have worked on this one this could have been a very complete film. Still with that correction we would have some issues with some of the dialog and acting as some of it comes of as severally amateurish.What the movie misses on those fronts however it makes up for in the action and effects department. Now Im not going to say the effects are the best ever but it is better than A LOT of the things I've seen a the theater. People have been hard on this movie even in that department and even though Im for the most part against the overuse of CGI for the most part I would defend this movie on that aspect as this was a lot better than say The Mummy and the other Stephen Sommers films that have come before it.Action scenes, especially when it hits the city are very good. If the director got one thing right was the action scenes. Monsters attack choppers, tanks and the military and look very cool doing it. It is these scenes alone that save this movie from being dreadful to being a guilty pleasure film for fans of monster movies, especially of the giant monster genre. Name any other movie where an army of monster riders, monsters with turrets and flying beasties attack a downtown city. I rest my case.In the end if you can forgive the dreadful editing and direction and just view it as a fun action film with monsters attacking then you will have fun. All others can just disregard this release all together. My score: 6/10: Above Average, for the action and effects only otherwise this would be sub-par on all other levels. Those that can forgive it for its shortcomings will find a nice B monster movie all others well you can always MST3K it !!!!",

            "content": "I was the first person to pay to see 'D-War'.While I could've waited just one more day and see it at a huge multiplex near my home, I chose to go to a far, shabby theater to see 'D-War' just a couple of hours earlier. I was so looking forward to this. There have been lots of talks about D-War in Korea, director Shim Hyoung Rae's second shot at the international market after his 1999 film Yonggari(English title is 'Reptilian'). Filming, I heard, was finished in 2004 but post-production on special effects took such an enormous amount of time that people started to wonder whether D-War would ever be released. Anways, I went to see this movie with high expectations and it even exceeded my expectations, although in somewhat a peculiar way. Ethan Kendricks(Jason Behr)is a reporter for CGNN(I think this name is a rip-off of CNN). One day, he goes to cover the story of a mysterious accident site, and sees the scale of the monster 'Imooki', the monster which the mysterious Jack(Robert Forster)told him about. 500years earlier in ancient Korea, a girl called Narin was born. She had the tattoo of a dragon on her shoulder. She was the 'Yeouijoo'which Heaven sent down to earth. Legend has it that every 500years, a 'Imooki'is chosen among many to ascend to the heavens to become a dragon and must have the 'Yeouijoo'to do so. Heaven has sent Bochun and his apprentice Haram to protect Narin until the day she turns 20 and must be sacrificed to the good Imooki so that it can ascend to the heavens and bring peace to the world. But the evil Imooki 'Booraqui'and his Atrox army stormed the village on Narin's 20th birthday to take the Yeouijoo,killing everybody in their path. Haram is supposed to take Narin to the good Imooki but he defies Heaven's wishes and runs off with Narin. When Booraqui corners them on a cliff, they commit suicide.Haram is reborn as Ethan, Bochun is reborn as Jack and Narin is reborn as Sarah Daniels(Amanda Brooks in a surprisingly good performance) in the present day. Sarah is soon to turn 20, Ethan deduces, so he must find her before Booraqui and his followers do. With the help of his faithful cameraman Bruce(Craig Robinson in a hilarious role), he tries to take Sarah to safety but get's caught by Booraqui's followers. Booraqui's general(Michael Shamus Wiles)ties Sarah up for sacrifice, but at that moment a shining light erupts from the necklace around Ethan's neck that Jack gave him and every single one of Booraqui's followers dies except the general. Eventually Ethan defeats the general and there's only Booraqui left. Then suddenly the good Imooki comes and fights with Booraqui. Ethan tries to run with Sarah but Sarah accepts her fate and gives the Yeouijoo to the good Imooki, who then becomes a dragon and defeats Booraqui. Many people say that D-War was a bum, that it's storyline is weak,special effects are bad and that the actor's performances are terrible. I beg to differ. The special effects are great. Sure it may not be 'Transformers'or 'Pirates of the Caribbean',but they had budgets over 150million dollars,didn't they? D-War's budget is estimated at 30million dollars, although the cost goes up when counting for the price of filming equipment because nobody loans advanced filming machinery in Korea. I especially liked the last battle scene between Booraqui and the good Imooki. The only flaw about the special effects were the flying monsters(I forgot what they were called...). While some say that their movements had the best quality, I think that it was a bit unreal compared to the slow movement of the Dudlers(these big fat walking dino-like monsters with blasting cannons on their backs that look a bit like stegasoraus without the spikes)and the monsters that Booraqui's Atrox army rode on.(again, I forgot what these were called, although they reminded me of raptors) The actors performances were better than written. I was especially impressed with Amanda Brooks's performance as Sarah Daniels. I hope she'll grow to the ranks of A-list stars like Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon. Robert Forster of course was spectacular like every movie he is in, Jason Behr's acting was above expectations and Craig Robinson did a fine job as Bruce. One thing disappointing, though, was that the movie just kind of flipped through the pages a bit too fast without explaining a bit more about the insides,for example, Sarah suddenly falls in love with Ethan, kisses him and says the line \"It's not fare that fate is trying to take me away when I have only just met you\". But on the whole, D-WAR was a supertacular movie. I never knew that our native Korean song 'Arirang' had such a wonderful tone before I heard it in the end of 'D-WAR'. I hope this is a smash hit in the USA. To Hollywood fans, please watch D-WAR.",

            "content": "Being a fantasy-lover that absolutely MUST go out to see every fantasy flick that comes out can be pretty excruciating at times. Before D-War, I hadn't seen an honest-to-god fantasy flick since At World's End (I'm not counting Stardust, which was just a romantic comedy masquerading as a fantasy flick). So by the time D-War came out, I was starving for a decent fantasy film.That's not to say I had high hopes for D-War. I wasn't expecting Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Hell, I wasn't even expecting Pirates or Narnia. I was just expecting to be entertained. Even a flick as frowned upon as Eragon managed to entertain me. But let me tell you, D-War makes me long for movies as \"good\" as Eragon. Yeah, it's that bad.As with most fantasy films, D-War comes to the plate with two strikes against it; clich\u00e9d plot and bad acting. This is something that any fantasy aficionado is quite used to, however, and these things alone aren't enough to completely ruin a flick of this genre. As long as it manages to be aesthetically absorbing and maintain a level of excitement, it can succeed.Where D-War completely flubs is in its pacing. The film starts off extremely slow, almost grinding to a complete stop several times in the first 45-50 minutes (bare in mind this flick is only 90 minutes long). By the time the hour mark rolled around and I had barely seen anything even remotely resembling a thrill, I actually pulled out my cellphone, turned it on, and looked to see what time it was so I could guess how much longer my suffering would endure.The second half of the film is where the action starts piling on, but after all the dull exposition and rising \"action\" of the first half, it's hard to get excited about the action in the second half. And there really isn't all that much solid action. Pretty much everything you'll see in the film is what you already saw during the trailers. Giant snakes masquerading as dragons running rampant through the cities, giant armies of canon-fodder troops taking up formations we've already seen in countless films of this nature since the mid-90s.In all it's a brainless, mind-numbingly dull adventure flick, a great deal of it I've already seen too many times.

I'd been waiting three dang year to see this movie, so yes I had high expectations for it. This could have been so much more.If I had the money, time, and left over will power(after the battering of a baseball bat done to it by this movie), I would go to Korea, slap the director across the face and ask for a refund. Heck, even a caveman could do better.Alright, so first things first, some one please explain to me how the U.S. Military and all its 21st century might... was so devastated by some guys with swords, and look like they were copy/pasted from LotR.And the first scene were the SWAT guys all rope in and charge in like the Persians in there battle against the Spartans. How the heck did some guys with swords blow up FOUR UH-60 Blackhawks. What did they throw their swords at the copters, which then proceeded to fall to their awesome Melee might. And the SWAT guys, no trained soldiers (at least in the US) are going to attack so unorganized, like five year old's in a super soaker battle.Then the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, why in the world would any sane pilot, after spending like a solid minute of firing machine guns, and watching them fail to penetrate the serpents hide or do more than annoy the beast, go back to using guns after watch the thing fall from hellfire missiles.Then there's the inability of the soldiers weapons to penetrate the same armor the enemy soldiers used 500 hundred years ago, I mean come on, armor like that was made obsolete because of firearms.And the good Imoogi, where the Frick was he, I mean heck the two people are being chased by an army of Evil dudes, yet he just sits back and relaxes. them out of no where, after the main dude (this movie was so horrible i didn't even pay attention to names) 'magically' takes down the entire army of Evil dudes and reptilians, he just pops in out of nothing, in that unnamed place.As for the fire balls, balls of fire don't blow up like missiles.Also the 'rocket launching lizard things', where in the world did the bad Imoogi get those 500 years ago. Then having those inferior missiles destroy an M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank in one hit, which is a tank that has been known to be hit by 20 RPG's (Which were made to destroy tanks) and still keep on going, and in one case a tank was hit by fifty RPG's and wasn't destroyed.Do yourself a favor, don't buy this movie, don't rent this movie, don't even think about this movie.My favorite character would be the good Imoogi, because he new this movie would suck so bad, that he wanted to get as little screen time as possible.

            "content": "Cheesy computer generated special effects, campy storytelling, and constipated performances make writer & director Hyung Rae Shim's ambitious new monster movie \"Dragon Wars\" look and sound hilariously awful. Indeed, \"Dragon Wars\" is so bad that it qualifies as good, but good in the sense that it stinks like Limburger cheese! You'll find yourself cackling out loud at the reverence with which Shim treats his outrageously ridiculous material. Just as outrageous in another sense is the money that he squandered on this indulgent opus. Reports have varied in the media about the budget of this half-baked South Korean cinematic epic since it premiered earlier this year in Berlin. Initially, publicists said \"Dragon Wars\" cost a whopping $70 million. The latest figures put this monstrous mythological creature feature more realistically at $30 million. Typically, this kind of incoherent juvenile gibberish heads directly to the shelves of your local video rental store before it takes up permanent residence on the Sci-Fi Channel alongside similar schlock like \"Boa,\" \"Python,\" or \"Komodo Vs. Cobra.\" Incredibly, Freestyle Releasing audaciously distributed prints of this dreadful dragon drivel to 2,275 theaters! Comparatively, the new Billy Bob Thornton comedy \"Mr. Woodcock\" illuminated only 2, 231 screens. Clearly, Freestyle and Shim are gambling that they can mop up millions from moviegoers that need either something idiotic to laugh at or parents who can't find anything better for their children to see.The action opens in Los Angeles as CGNN-TV reporter Ethan Kendrick (Tom Cruise look-alike Jason Behr of \"The Grudge\") covers a disaster at the Seven Palms Resort. FBI agents Frank Pinsky (Chris Mulkey of \"Heartbreak Hotel\") and Judah Campbell (John Ales of \"Spy Hard\") send Ethan packing when he quizzes them about the catastrophe. Before Ethan leaves, he tapes footage with his camcorder of a Fed dusting off a suspicious looking fossil in the rubble. The sight of the specimen rekindles memories of fifteen years earlier when our hero saw something similar in an antiques shop. An ancient Asian crate burst its locks of its own accord, like a Pandora's Box, and bathed young Ethan (Cody Arens of \"Shadow Man\") in a blaze of light. The antiques dealer, Jack (Robert Forester of \"Firewall\"), tells Ethan a loquacious story about legendary good and evil giant Korean serpents called 'Imoogi' that battle for supremacy over the Earth and Heaven. Shim treats us to a flashback within a flashback during Jack's story. According to Jack, a Korean girl found herself impregnated about 500 years ago with a mystical source of power called the Yuh Yi Joo. When the girl reached age twenty, she was supposed to impart this Yuh Yi Joo to the good 'Imoogi' serpent. As it turns out, Jack was a martial arts master back then in his previous life and Ethan served as his warrior sidekick. Flashbacks of gravity-defying kung fu warriors battling black-clad armies of swordsmen with chrome helmets pad out Jack's yarn. Everything here resembles those goofy action sequences straight out of Kung Fu Theater. Jack and Ethan were responsible for safeguarding the girl until she could pass along the Yuh Yi Joo to the virtuous Imoogi. Something went wrong, and the Imoogi as well as our heroes and heroine have had to wait another 500 years to complete the process.Back in modern day L.A., Ethan learns from Jack that a 19-year old girl, Sarah (Amanda Brooks of \"Flightplan\"), has the Yuh Yi Joo growing inside of her. Jack and he must protect her from the evil Imoogi's army, the Buraki, that are searching relentlessly for her. Meanwhile, the bad Imoogi\u0097basically a gargantuan anaconda with a head like a \"Jurassic Park\" T-Rex dinosaur\u0097slithers all over the architecture of L.A. searching for Sarah. The Buraki also dispatch flocks of flying dinos that scour the city for Sarah. The U.S. military responds to this threat with attack helicopter gunships. Basically, \"Dragon Wars\" tries to imitate on a considerably smaller scale the wholesale destruction of L.A. that occurred in \"Transformers.\" Before he turned director, Hyung Rae Shim was a well-known Korean television comedian. Despite the grave reverence that he holds for his native land's legends about combative dragons, Shim cannot translate that conviction to the big-screen. \"Dragon Wars\" is a hootenanny from start to finish. The giant serpent is the equivalent of Wiley E. Coyote and our heroes and heroine are Roadrunners. The American actors cast in the contemporary scenes struggle with dialogue that is so lame and convoluted that it's a tribute to their thespian talents that they can keep a straight face. Some scenes, especially those involving a zookeeper, are downright sidesplitting. The CGI special effects of the Imoogi fall light years short of the standard Hollywood technology. Mind you, these quirky dragons have their moments, particularly in the destruction of Los Angeles. Just when you want to give this nonsense the benefit of the doubt, the good dragon sprouts reindeer antlers and catfish whiskers and triumphs over the evil dragon. \"Dragon Wars\" makes the recent Japanese \"Godzilla\" extravaganzas look like Shakespearian material. Clearly, \"Dragon Wars\" is no \"Reign of Fire.\"",

No, wait, Robert Forster IS in this, and he acted and did things! And the CGI is so absolutely insane and all of a piece. Dragon Wars... is what it is, and it's great for a night with friends who know how to take it the opposite of seriously. I'd think if you watch this alone it won't be as much fun though.You really need the communal experience of sitting with a bunch of people who want to watch dragons of different shapes and varieties (though mostly of the gigantic kind) destroying buildings and fighting with giant helicopters as cardboard character cut-outs stand around yelling orders and saying things that are meant to pass as English words.It's a movie that's so poor that had it been made 20 years earlier or 40 years earlier or so on, it would be one of the timeless classics for fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - but this goes without saying it's completely understandable why it has its cult following (if it does, I haven't check the internet lately...)",

            "content": "D-War is set in modern day Los Angeles where television news reporter Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) sudden remembers the ancient Korean tale of powerful Serpent's named Imoogi that get to transform into even more powerful Dragon's & go to heaven if they eat a glowing orb which is found inside a newborn baby every 500 years, there are good Imoogi & bad Imoogi. Ethan feels the time is almost upon the world again & a 19 year old girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks) holds the orb & that with her twentieth birthday approaching an evil Imoogi named Buraki & it's army of followers are after her to get the orb & turn Baraki into a powerful Dragon & wreck destruction on the world. Ethan feels it's his destiny to find Sarah & protect her from Buraki & save the world from the Dragon wars...Also commonly known as Dragon Wars this South Korean production was written & directed by Hyung-rae Shim & is admittedly ambitious & not without it's fun moments but to be honest D-War is a mess of film that tries to blind you with special effects & extravagant set-pieces but is hollow, unsatisfying & makes no sense. The script is as sloppy as any I've seen in a while, the whole back-story with the ancient Korean legend lost me almost straight away with it's over complicated rules & KJorean names for people & things that I then find hard to associate with anything. The Eastern mysticism & ancient wars & Dragons & orbs & stuff just went over my head & it's hard to make any sense of it to the extent by the time the film was nearing it's end I wasn't sure what was happening, why it was happening or what significance it would have. There are gaping holes in the narrative, how does the evil Imoogi control it's army? Where was the good Imoogi when Los Angeles was being destroyed& why couldn't it have come to the rescue earlier (like 500 years earlier)? Who is that evil Imoogi general guy? Do we really need a flashback within a flashback? Where did that army come from? Where have they been for the last 500 years? Why hasn't the good Imoogi got an army? How can a giant snake slither all over Los Angeles & people not notice or keep track of it? Where does the end of the film take place? How is Ethan meant to get back home? Why couldn't that pendant thing just destroy Buraki's army to start with? If the evil army & those flying creatures want Sarah alive why do they seemingly keep trying to kill her by spitting fireballs at her car? There are some many questions unanswered, so much narrative that seems missing that it's impossible take take anything meaningful away from D-War. Also, what are moments of humour all about? An old woman walking into a fence, that evil warlord guy getting run over & that security guard at the zoo just feel so out of place.The one aspect where D-War sometimes succeeds is it's set-pieces & special effects, the final half of the film is none stop monster mayhem as the forces of the evil Imoogi battle it out against the military might of the US in Los Angeles which is great fun. From slow lumbering monsters walking through the streets taking on tanks to flying creatures that fight helicopter to the huge Imoogi who gets to trash a car park & wrap itself around a skyscraper while causing all sorts of destructive havoc. The special effects & CGI computer graphics look alright actually, while I didn't watch this in Hi-Def on Blu-ray so I can't comment on how the effects stand up in that regard they looked alright when the DVD version is watched. The set-pieces have a certain imagination & charm, they are certainly memorable & if watching giant monsters trash Los Angeles appeals to you then you could do worse than D-War. Being a family friendly PG rated film there's no excessive gore or violence although there are a few tame martial arts battles at the start.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this apparently took fives years to complete & was the first Korean film in over thirty years to receive a wide theatrical release in the states where, it has to be said, it didn't particularly impress. The acting is really bad, it's full of bland & bad performances especially Jason Behr who is a terrible leading men here.D-War is a terrible fantasy film that rips off much better fantasy films & is just one big mess but it has some undeniably cool set-pieces & effects even though they did start to blur into one another by the end. Watchable in a bad Power Rangers sort of way I suppose or if your under seven years old but even then you will find the story parts boring & confusing.",

            "content": "You can tell whoever made this wanted something big, something on the scale of a Lord of the Rings type film, but with some modern settings; however, it fails. This is probably due to a lack of budget as most of the effects are none too good as the dinosaurs from the 1993 Jurassic Park look more alive. Then again, as fake as the dragons look, they feel more real than the actors performances in this thing. I also get the feeling the makers just wanted to get to the rampaging as there are just so many characters relegated to seemingly important plot points but with no backstory! They just appear and do stuff to advance the plot and vanish like the wind!The story, two dragons need to eat one particular girl to become more powerful! One is evil and one is good. A news reporter sees something that triggers a flashback that triggers another flashback and we learn of the tragic and stupid tale. The reporter who is played by a guy that was probably voted most bland man of the year in 2007 then must find the girl who makes Kristen Stewart during her Twilight run look Oscar worthy and he must grab her by the arm and pull her as a big snake like dragon comes after them! We then get an attack on L. A. before going to the set of Mortal Kombat II for the finish!The effects at time look okay, but even when it looks like all this awesome stuff is happening and there is devastation the buildings look absolutely fine underneath. It is like you see debris flying everywhere, but no actual damage. The acting is beyond subpar and as I said, so many characters popping up with virtually no story, like the doctor and the hypnosis which accomplished nothing.The movie had some entertaining moments within it, too bad they could not do a bit better with the technical stuff and get better actors. I am unclear why they chose to film this in L. A. rather than somewhere in Korea, it would have been nice if the lead guy was not so useless as his former self was way more cool.",

The acting is atrocious, be it the lead actors or the secondary characters. Continuity is full of unconnected dots and zig-zags. The screenplay is the worst of the year. This is a very confusing film, and the quickness the male and female lead fall in love is completely ridiculous. The only good thing would have to be the special effects, and even those can get REALLY old REALLY fast. The sweeping camera shots are not epic, they're the biggest cheese next to the nonsensical plot -- the ending made no sense at all... NONE.

Gandalf can be funny talking Korean, the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name was.Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not on the director/writer.

I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it I think its worth watching. I give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created, this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash. I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like \"the camera is in front of them\". You will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is, me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie, the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh!# although he doesn't speak English lol. If you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this. This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame. The evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous, the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time. The evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want. The transition between scenes leaves you wondering did I miss something? So many plot holes from scene to scene. I was laughing like crazy when they decided to \"Escape To Mexico\" to get away from the serpent. Hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from Korea? interesting... very interesting.... I guess hopping the border solves all problems. Another scene that completely stupified me.. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other... the scene was so clich\u00e9d and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they JUST MET even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing. Anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light. Bad Hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this.

Politically Correct Americans will cringe as they are faced with a variety of kitsch stereotype characters that are borrowed from other American films. The Korean pandering to what it perceives as the American audience is heavy handed and super obvious and detracts from what makes foreign films interesting- the foreignness. The director works very hard to try and compete in an American fluff action film market and in doing so gives up style, creativity and imagination. The action sequences look like they were lifted directly from Jurassic park or star wars and are unrealistic at best, cartoonish at worst.Make no mistake- this is a VERY FUN B movie if you understand that this is a stupid B movie- it is gloriously cheesy including a dark army horde headed up by a Darth Vader style villain complete with an organic version of the Empire Strikes Back's famous battle scene on Hoth, only this time it is in Korea using dragons. There are lots of OH NO GODZILLA scenes as well.If you remove all expectations from the actors to act, and instead expect the movie to play out like a crappy comic book- then you will enjoy this. IF you wanted to see a movie about dragons that is cool and exciting- skip this movie. It seems to be a law in film making that every dragon movie and every vampire movie has to suck. A small handful of films have escaped this MacBeth-like curse. That's sad since those themes are the two most popular themes in legend you would think someone would take the time to treat sacred legends as sacred instead of a schlock filler for their lack of imagination in creating a script.SIDE NOTE: Americans that ignorantly bought into the terrorism fear campaign orchestrated by our unelected dictator-in-chief Herr Bush may cringe at various scenes of aircraft flying into New York buildings- it may remind you of the twin towers too much.",

And if that's all you're coming for, I suppose it's not the worst thing in the world.But it's everything surrounding the ridiculous \"war\" scene that's the problem. This movie doesn't have a plot so much as it has the suggestion of events, buffered by repeated bait-and-switch dream sequences. Can't understand what's going on? That's fine, it's probably just another dream. Still can't understand what's going on? Welcome to Dragon Wars.It's best to not question it and go with the flow, because the movie isn't going to make any effort to help you understand why any given thing is happening. Given that Dragon Wars is apparently based on an ancient Korean legend, perhaps it's just something lost in translation. But if that's the case, there's still no excuse for making it this incomprehensible. Characters come and go without any explanation as to who they were or why they were relevant, and random, inscrutable things seem to happen only to be hand waved away as being \"just magic.\"It's hard to convey just how little regard the film has for its own level of coherency. I've somehow ended up seeing this movie three times now, and only by reading a plot synopsis on the internet (by people who are likely familiar with the original legend) did any of it begin to make any sense whatsoever.At the very least, you could consider this to be a poor adaptation of whatever Korean legend it is technically based upon.

But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact, and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Sadly, by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had the sudden, sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film. And worse: I knew just how badly every point would all suck.Let me be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.As for knowing all the twists of movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales this one is not worthy to fill, it conveniently sprouted extra sub-plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.It was infested with close calls, miraculous escapes, and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor.Let me try to explain.Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest-looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade: First take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.Next, take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a \"subtle\" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them lots of film noir narration, so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading-pool depths of their thoughts.Finally add a raspy-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras, angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong, and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.Now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous.At several points during this picture, I found myself saying out loud, \"Make the bad movie stop,\" and breaking into tears.To call this a B-movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.In short, if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for hideous, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars might just be the film for you.",

Some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City.It wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great. There are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. I sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when I see summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different, and I thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's(Behr)hair looked so Asian.Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?",

Most of the Hollywood SF's are like this, following the same formula... I'm sick of it. However, Dragon Wars is pretty new to me. The CG and action in LA are something different. I've never seen this kind of action. The way Burakee sweeps the roads made me feel thrilled. And the last part, ** Spoiler ** when the Yimooki turns into a Dragon and flies to the sky, it was very impressive. It's a totally different dragon we imagine. I like the ending very much.

While the location and actors are mostly American, the story telling and sensibilities are clearly Asian and all the creative forces behind this movie were Korean. (As anyone who actually read movie credits could find out.)It does take a few odd jumps of plot... how they feds find the cave the evil dragon (technically Imoogi) is lurking in half way through the movie seems unexplained, and you have to just understand that the end takes place in a spirit realm that is the home of said Imoogi. The former felt like something was left on the cutting room floor, but the latter I think is probably something that anyone from the culture of origin would have grasped immediately. And frankly I liked that it didn't stop to say \"This way, stupid Americans, to the spirit world...\"The production values are outstanding, at times mixing live action and CG better then I have ever seen before. (Though at other times I couldn't help but to say to myself \"oh, nice composite shot.) The movie does drag on a bit during the human/Imoogi conflict. I personally would have cut some of this and put in something to cover the aforementioned cave, but all in all this was a VERY enjoyable film for anyone interested in fantasy literature about the myths of places other then the British isles..",

The story of the legend is laid out like a Princess Bride style story telling narration, then jumps right into scenes with high quality CGI, unfortunately that's its only strong point, the CGI.This movie looks like a well done, very clean, Hong Kong style movie. It doesn't even compare to most of the Korean films that have done well. This movie is to entertain kids for a couple hours but it seems it COULD have been interesting movie for adults 18 to 35, but it looks like they aimed the story to be for kids from the jumping around scenes, shallow character development and high number of very expensive CGI scenes which have a resemblance to scenes done by Lucas Art and the Star Wars movies.In comparison to other Dragon movies, it's not even close to being as good as the classic of Dragon Slayer and also sub-par film, The Last Dragon, which was a joke of a film but it was entertaining with a comedic element to it. Both these past Dragon films have characters whom one could relate and follow through out the film while D-Wars is a cold, CGI filled film with real live human action in it for some reason.",

            "content": "{rant start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \"Gwoemul\" (aka \"The Host\") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film \"Shiri/Swiri\", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end}The only \"reason\" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes. Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \"Dragonheart\", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in 2000? Hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use, but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem \"Arirang\" being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).",

The stuff that didn't even make it from storyboards to be cut...A token black guy......Lessee what else...Oh yeah... And strangely enough... mortal kombat...at least that is what it felt like in the end...and for the most part, the animation looked like something from a made for TV hallmark movie (think dinatopia, which is good for TV, just not modern cinema).As I said above, this movie had potential. It had a lot of potential, but what ruined it was the simple fact that it was americanized. Had the whole story taken place in ancient Korea, had NO American ACTORS WHAT SO EVER, then this movie would have actually been pretty good.My wife and I saw this with a group of people, and not counting the six of us (yes six gullible people paid money to see this...) there were only two other people in the theatre.

Not trying to be like our own. It's as painful as watching Turkish Star Wars. There is something seriously lost in translation when this happens. Which, i might add was where the fundamental flaw in the dialogue occurred. The inflection, the meter, everything just sounds wrong.It's sad to see that this is the type of movie that the sheeple of America think is great foreign cinema. now because of it, good movies that are foreign stand less of a chance of actually making it over to the American mass market.but hey, as long as we have gallons of soda, economy size popcorn bags, and excessive amounts of cgi, why should we complain? ...baaaaaaaaa.....",

There are times when this reaches the coveted so-bad-it's-good level, but it takes way too long to get to the titular war. When that starts happening, it's laughable and entertaining (for all the wrong reasons, of course). The two leads are utterly boring. Jason Behr in particular seems like the homeless man's Skeet Ulrich. And it's pretty sad that they kill off the cute minority girl (Aimee Garcia) and keep around the homely white chick (Amanda Brooks) to be the heroine. It's kind of sad in general that Korean filmmakers would have their legendary heroes reincarnated as faux-hot white people. I guess they were thinking they knew their audience. But then again, they don't. Why would anyone feel Americans would like to sit through a movie where their military gets decimated by a bunch of lizards? I think even war supporters are more than a little sick of seeing soldiers die, and more soldiers die in the approximately 20 minute-long D-War than have died in the Iraq War. There's one awful(ly humorous) scene where a pilot flies his helicopter into a skyscraper. We see the man jump out of the copter, as if he's going to escape, but, no, KABLOOEY!

The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene, very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles, the troops are firing away at......nothing. Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys.

The worst example of this is a bit where a girl walks out of a club and is cornered by 4 thugs, a man in black walks into the picture, throws them all away one by one and just walks out, and when i say throw them i mean grudgingly moves his arm a couple of times. This isn't an isolated incident either.There is also lack of continuity or explanation from scene to scene. The computer effects are alright but still manage to look as if it isn't real, but then most computer effects do so that can't be faulted. The lead actors try to convey a sense of worry and panic all the time showing no chemistry to each other or change in mood the whole film.I guess what I'm trying to say is yes this film looks great but it isn't, its dire. I wouldn't let a review put me off watching this piece of crap so i doubt this review will but once you do, you will know what i mean. As stated I've liked crap movies before, I've even seen trates i liked in movies i didn't but this is unredeemable.",

I tell you, guys. D-War does not represent the mainstream Korean movie. In fact, I'm not sure what it represents.The plot is TERRIBLE. I'm not sure whether the actors actually read the script before they accepted the roles.The story jumps everywhere and the scene did not seem to match with each other.It was so obvious that Director Shim (whom I used to like very very much as a comedian) copied the movies from Star Wars I, Lord of the Rings and Armagedon (I bet neither George Lucas nor Peter Jackson have seen the movie).The US Army was fighting the bad guys, and almost matched with the Orks in the streets of LA, and what happened to them? And when Ethan and Sarah get caught, they have been transported to the Land of Mordor? How? Why? Where is it?? How did the Mordor come about??? I don't know. I'm not even a movie critic! Director Shim should really get the professionals to help him to make a proper movie, if he wants to continue making movies in Hollywood.Evenyone, you should watch \"The Host\" and THAT represents the proper Korean movie.",

Though, there was not any blood I can recall (not that gore is always a good thing. But when you get bit by a large serpent, you'll bleed), not to mention that the ending was absurdly cheesy. The ending was extremely dry. The main character, Ethan, didn't even shed a tear when the person he loves and the person who basically was like his father both 'died'. Then he walked off, and it ended. It made me snort, actually, that it was that stupid.There were only three things I recall; first, when the evil dude (I forgot his name) merged through the fence and the old woman tried it - I'm a sucker for stupid things like that and I cracked up. Second, was when the same evil dude got hit by the car. I bust up laughing and giggling. And third, was the CGI. I wasn't really expecting the serpent's (Imugi somethin-rather) to be just that - serpents. But it was interesting.With many flaws, dry acting and cheesy dialog, along with a semi-predictable plot line, D-War isn't one I'd recommend buying, or seeing.",

Several points of criticism would be: 1) the energy level for the two leads (Sarah & Ethan) was a little too low; 2) several plot holes (i.e. the dragon seems to mysteriously know where Sarah is at a given time and then can't seem to know where Sarah is at a given time); 3) the anemic response by the Dept of Defense of a significant attack on LA, when all they can do is send in a few Apache helicopters? Where were the fighters, etc; 4) the final dragon-on-dragon fight at the end goes on a little too long. On a positive note: 1) the special effects were excellent; 2) the military jargon was spot on; 3) I liked Craig Robinson (from NBC's The Office (USA)), Elizabeth Pena is always good in any roll and is really due for a major part in large Hollywood movie, and finally both Robert Forester and the FBI Agents & Sec of Defense were fine. Of special note is the energy and emotion brought to the screen by the Korean actors, all excellent and in many ways better than their American counter-parts. I think D-War could be somewhat better if it could be tightened up here and there to shorten some of the battle scenes (Korean fight 500 yrs ago, LA battle, dragon-on-dragon).",

Koreans are well known for such childish behavior (When Korea dropped out of the soccer world cup 2006, Koreans attacked the FIFA server so heavily that FIFA had to block all IP addresses from Korea ...)To put is short, this movie is bad. And boring.This movie is not just a wannabe mix of Hollywood's StarWars, Lord of the Rings, Black Hawk Down and Jurassic Part. No, it's a very, very bad wannabe mix of all that. With all respect, Mr Shim, what have you been doing over the past 5 years of directing that movie ?I think he wanted to do the sort of epic sci-fi action movie. But for that you need much more than just a cluster of mega-flop computers. Instead of relying on actors, the director relied on computer power. Even worse, the director tries to impress the audience by showing some selected martial art sequences which are nothing but blunt copies of 'Crouchint tiger, hidden dragon'. Those sequences don't even fit into the overall making style of the movie.For sure we can not reward this director for finding new and innovative ways of action-movie making.What the sci-fi action thrillers Jurassic Parc and Co. have in common is at least a decent plot, thrilling moments and some good, authentic acting. But this movie doesn't have any of that.Moreover, the actors don't reveal any special characteristic of the person they act. It's so sterile. A kiss, what even in mediocre movies is a long suspected and awaited moment comes here as an unexpected sudden and sterile act (at the beach ... how romantic) The director should have used the computer for the main actors as well, it wouldn't have made any difference and he could have saved time and money.No thrills, no surprising moments, no dramatic, nothing.Don't waste your time on that movie. I recommend to rent a DVD of Jurassic Parc 1 instead. Even if you saw that one already 4 times.",

The creatures itself were pretty good, but they didn't really fit in the scenes and looked totally out of place.The acting was horrid at best. Amanda Whatever was one of the worst actresses I ever had to watch. She has no screen presence and not emotions. Jason Behr was also really bad. It looked like he was thinking ''Whatever happened to my career'' the entire movie. It looked like work and he did it to get paid.Somehow the director though that many action scenes equals a good movie. Well Dragon Wars is an Oscar winner then when using this measure. The ENTIRE movie is made of action sequences with no connection whatsoever. No storyline, no dialogue, no twists, no character development, NOTHING.All in a all it looked like a film made for TV.

I read a news article today that World of Warcraft is being made into a movie with a budget of 90 mil (coming out in 2009).The computer graphics didn't mix well in places here and there, and I thought the storyline was terrible.

While I certainly have a healthy respect for other's opinions, this was clearly children rating movies. What use to make IMDb good was the fact you could trust the rating system (unlike Yahoo that is overwhelmed with 13 year old give a 10 out of 10 to any fart movie that comes out). Sadly, IMDb has strayed from is roots...Now back to the movie...In some 500 year repetitive cycle it seems that dragons can make their way to the starry heavens. Of course, there is always an evil one that wants all the glory and this will prove no exception. The story line includes a 20 minute back story and narration so we have some vague notion as to why we are watching this poor excuse of a movie. As a note, if it take you 20 minutes to explain the premise of a storyline then it is not worth telling.The acting is wooden (too bad for Jason Behr who once showed promise) and the special effects belong on a Sci-fi original movie. The good guys are bad actors and the bad guys are even worse. Strangely, the storyline seems to wander which is surprising since so much time was spent telling us why all this is happening. I would love to find something redeeming in the film and the only thing I can come up with is that the critics were spared a pre-screening since this movie was so bad that it should have not only skipped the theatre but the DVD release as well. It wasn't worth the ticket price (I did get a free pass from AMC Theaters after viewing it) and isn't even worth a rental or wasting 1 hr 40 minutes if it were free on TV.Here is some good advice, don't listen to 13 year old and don't go see this movie.",

The scenes r visually profound and creative, and above all, very mythical & foreign. No American heroism, no same old Hollywood good vs evil/ hero vs villain fairytale--where there's always gotta be this one and only savior for all. What is unique about D-War is that its story and plot revolve around those mythical creatures and monsters rather than human hero& heroine. Monsters are beautifully rendered onto the screen and well-disposed to the taste and imagination of modern audience. Personally this movie was rather a renewing experience. Just.. sick and tired of Hollywood blockbusters involving thoughtless violence (that is somehow always gets justified at the end) and those salacious and sarcastic affairs, humors between the characters that r just getting worse and worse every time.Just Watch It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *...Strogly recommended....*",

Maybe more than once.This is one of the worst big-budget movies I have ever seen. Yes, it is worse than Van Helsing, though the creature CG looks a good bit better. This is worse than Armageddon. You won't believe it until you see it, but once you finally do see it, you will be so happy. The film starts off with a voice-over telling you a clumsily-worded legend. Then a hunky young reporter goes to investigate a scene of unexplained destruction in the middle of a city (obviously, we assume, caused by a dragon). He stands in front of a camera and talks about the incident, and he makes borderline metaphysical leaps of logic, such as, \"The damage was so extensive that there are no eye-witnesses.\" ...? Then he sees a garbage can lid that is supposed to be a dragon scale. This causes him to suddenly remember when he was a child and Robert Forster told him a long story about how it was destiny to save the world. This story, at one point, takes the movie into four layers of flashback. I'm not kidding - a flashback within a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. This story also comes with a long list of vocabulary that you are expected to learn and remember for the rest of the movie. Nobody does. More generic plot unfolds. We are introduced to the movie's villain when there is a steady shot of a sidewalk and the side of a building, and he just walks into the frame, dressed like Darth Maul. Then he walks through a wall.Anyway, this movie sucks and is hilarious. People are arguing whether an Uwe Boll comparison is apt. Here's how I see it: no, it's not quite as bad as Uwe Boll. But it's close. The high-rent CGI and action sequences save this movie from the levels of degradation and shame that we have come to expect out of Dr. Boll. However, if you were to take away this movie's budget, I think you would basically have Alone in the Dark, except a little less confusing. At the same time, this movie has a different tone of badness. I enjoy all of the inherent hilarity in Uwe Boll's style of stupidity, but for some reason, I don't find myself feeling good about it. There is something reprehensible at the core of an Uwe Boll film, even though it may be funny to watch. D-War, on the other hand, has something positively cute at its core. D-War does make me feel good. This movie is adorably bad. It's like a kitten that you have to squirt with a spray-bottle because it keeps trying to get on the kitchen table.So, anyway, I couldn't honestly give it more than one star, because one star is what I think it deserves, but you should see it if you can.

KOREANS GIVING THIS MOVIE 10s PLEASE STOP.This movie is a complete disgrace for the Korean movie industry. The director Shim should be prohibited from ever directing another movie as he will surely bring ridicule and disgrace to Korea. The move is a total rip off of a ton of film. LOTR, Star Wars, Harry Potter, King Kong.Just the snake climbing the large building is right out of King Kong. Next, this is NOT a Korean legend. The story of dragon balls and dragons is all from Chinese Legend. Even the anime Dragonball Z was based off of Chinese legend. Just a simple look at the dragon will let you know this. Why does that dragon look exactly like the ones from Chinese stories? Because it is.The acting was horrible. If you are Korean and not a native speaker you probably won't realize this. It has horrible stereotypes of black and white characters. Americans don't take very well to racial intensity or ignorance. It has no chance of success in America.The big thing her is that the Director Shim is a total GEEK. He is obviously a Dungeons and Dragons outcast. He just loves dragons, star wars, and lord of the rings. I am sure that his goal was to make a movie about the outrageous fantasy things that he loves. However, star wars and LOTR were well made so that even non-geeks could appreciate their artistic inspiration. This movie is complete kokadukie. Do not watch it at all costs. My mind is still scarred and perhaps will be for life. And to the Koreans writing here that gave it 10s, stop being nationalistic tools and start being global citizens.",

            "content": "Over the weekend, I had a chance to visit with Korean filmmaker /director, Mr.Shim Hyung Rae here in Korea, home to the Yonggu Arts and Entertainment Company. As we toured the rather spacious Digital Production studios located in a secluded area near Kimpo Airport , I got a sense of what really happens behind the scenes during the post production phased of a CGI film. D-WAR's the title of his latest movie and dragon war props appeared everywhere and were used in several sequences of the sci-fi thriller, five years in the making . Although I knew that Shim Hyung-Rae had a \"reputation\" that preceded him, I could not help but wonder if D-WAR was simply a remake of his previous movie aptly called REPTILIAN. After the first five minutes into the extended preview of D-WAR however, I knew that such conceptions I had of a boring remake was not only far fetched but a misnomer. The way computer science and technology are mastered here made it perfectly clear that the director has come a long , long way from REPTILIAN, a very low grossing film. Not only does Mr. SHim succeed in the use of a real plot this time but he casts real American actors not to mention a compelling drama that takes us back 500 years to a period of ancient history known as the Chosun Dynasty. But the director's \"message\" is just as relevant as it works it way through to present day Los Angeles. Even Mr. Shim himself is convinced that he's no longer a \"mediocre\" film maker as he plys his trade as a creative tour-de-force in directing CGI films.Will D-WAR defy any other description other than a \"blockbuster\" ? That question remains to be answered since the movie is set to be released this summer when we all get the chance to experience the absolute conquest of mankind . I did breathe a sigh of relief during a private screening and I was able to see some familiar faces on the big screen. The movie cast includes American actors such as dreamy Jason Behr and the hero Ethan Kendricks who must save Los Angeles from an army of ATROX soldiers.I figured most of the ATROX droids,clad in black armour were probably cheaper by the dozen to hire but as I found out later they were not hired extras but life size figures that were made from heavy metals and stored safely for future takes ! That was enough to convince me that there seemed to be a greater magnitude to this sci-fi flick than meets the eye.There's even a newborn baby that appears all too real but she too was made from an incredibly realistic computer rendered model. I took careful production notes about the advanced computer animation process that was used and I was also shown how the crying baby was preserved in glass and an exact replica of someone's first born.As we winded up the tour, the most pressing question in my mind was what becomes a legend most for Mr. Shim, a long time veteran in the film making business who has made over 20 films. The answer seemed to emanate from his most ambitious project: The I-M-O-O-G-I-'s of course! That's a Korean word for a mythical creature that evolved over time and it's in D WAR that the IMOOGI attempts to morph into a defiant dragon.In closing, I'd rate D WAR a solid B+ for its exciting visuals and explosive scenes that keeps a pace all its own. Also in production for Mr. Shim's next movies are GOSEONG LEGEND and a computer animation feature based on the life of myriad fishes in the sea.ANNONG !IRENE NAKANO /HARVARD U.

To me, this movie has no redeeming qualities and I am surprised/shocked that it ever got past a test audience, assuming the producers ever showed it to a test audience.First off, the opening sequence had no back story--we never know why, in the scheme of the movie, the first events occur. This is followed by an what seems to be an eternity of long, drawn-out explanation in the form of flashbacks to different eras. I thought the movie was supposed to grab you in the first ten minutes. If this is true then this move failed that test entirely.The rest of the movie was incoherent at best and a mess at worst. A lot of the problems were due to the lack of continuity in the scenes. For example, one scene shows a number of military types running out a tunnel and firing into the air with no dragon in sight. Then, as if by magic, there are only ten soldiers left standing with bodies and wreckage surrounding them, yet no explanation of what happened. It was as if the whole battle scene was edited out leaving the audience to wonder what the heck happened. Unfortunately, this lack of continuity was pervasive throughout the production.The acting, on the other hand, was not bad considering the material the actors were given. I especially like Robert Forester's characterization of a mystic. His was the one bright spot in an otherwise bad movie.Overall, this movie could have used a reworked script, better direction, and much greater effort in maintaining continuity. As it is, in my humble opinion, this movie is pretty much unwatchable.",

If half of the world can worship low-IQ, sexually frustrated film-making bipeds, then certainly we should be able to give a few confused Korean lizards a fighting chance.In all honesty, what exactly is the difference between Liberal propaganda thrillers such as \"Syriana\" and idiotic lizard flicks such as \"Eragon\" and \"D-Wars\"? Both sub-genres lie to us about the world; the former claims that man is inherently good hence deserves a merciless tyranny to help him pave the Golden Path to perfection i.e. Utopia (I know, the logic here escapes me, too), while the latter claims that mighty dragons exist but that they rarely catch their designated human prey in spite of their size and agility. So both sub-genres pray to the same god, don't they? The God of filmic BS.The poor slithery clown who chases our romantic couple never quite catches them. I don't know why that is. He certainly manages to maim half of downtown L.A., but whenever he finally gets anywhere close to killing the journalist geek and the tattooed maiden, whenever he catches up with their slow two-legged pace at last, what happens? The lizard inexplicably stops, takes a break, ends up just staring at the two in fascination(?), awe(?), fear(?), love even(?), confusion (because he doesn't understand his role in the script?)... pity even (because he knows that their acting careers are over, whereas even slow, ineffective lizards can always find parts in moronic fantasy flicks?).I don't quite understand how they did that... No, no, I don't mean the spiffing special effects applied to the lizard as he demolishes L.A.'s beauty salons and other important American businesses, but how they managed to make the geeky journalist look even more like an effeminate version of Pierce Brosnan. Did they apply even more woman's make-up on him than they did with Pierce in his James Bond turds? Even Di Caprio doesn't give us this much estrogen while impersonating men.",

            "content": "I spent 90 minutes standing in HMV torn between 3 DVDs that I might buy. One of which was Dragon Wars. My friend convinced me into buying this DVD, and it was probably the worst judgement of trust that I've ever put in anyone. This is without a doubt, one of the most pretentious, self-obsessed, badly-made films that I have ever seen. In film's synopsis, it is proud to state that the film's budget came to $75 million, which (in the special features), director Hyung-rae Shim says is \"not a lot\". Considering that they used \"not a lot\" of money making this film, it is also approximately 38 times more than the average person in Great Britain will make in a lifetime. Now, see if you recognise this story: 'There is an ancient legend that is only reawakened every 500-or-so years to reak havok. There is a good side and a bad side - although usually the bad side seems to have exponentially more fighters, despite never winning the battle - boy is put in charge of protecting something; boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love despite knowing each other for maybe a week. All ends happily ever after, whether everyone lives or not. Throw in a few scenes that don't link together, a few more that make no sense, and some incredulously naive characters, and you've got...' this crash-site of a movie. If you recognised that plot, then I know that we're thinking on the same wavelength. Within the first 15 minutes of the film's opening, we've seen the entire movie. Main character 'Ethan' has a flashback to when he was about 10 in an antique store run by the 500-year-old 'Jack' played by Robert Forster (who is actually the best actor in the film). We then see the entire story line play out to the backdrop of Korea, just shrunk down into the quarter-hour audience attention-span. From that point on, the remainder of the budget is spent on telling the whole thing again, just at 5 times the length and making it not quite as interesting. This film has one incredibly impressive feature, however. And that is the use of the stunning CGI-effects that have been loaded onto the project. Yet still, this is not a redeeming feature; the awfulness has already infected our systems too deeply to matter. I can see, somehow, just why Mr Shim saw it unnecessary to hire actors with any form of acting ability. And it's probably because the actors are only on screen for about 20% of the film's runtime. In fact, I'm pretty sure most of the mangled extras are on screen for longer periods. Furthermore, Hyung-rae Shim has not got an inkling of an idea about how to direct a feature film. His idea of keeping suspense up seems to be placing the camera in front of a 100-foot-high CGI snake and zooming in-and-out a few times between each cut whilst the seething monster rips apart vast office blocks in downtown LA. I myself am a film director. Making films is always a struggle, because, believe it or not, they cost money. Every day of film-making costs you more money. And in a feature film where someone finds it 'necessary for the story' to plonk a tank in the middle of a street in Los Angeles, you can expect that maybe the budget could be shoved up just slightly. In the special features, Mr Shim explains that he went to American composer Steve Jablonsky to create the soundtrack for the film. Mr Shim explained to him for a while about the soundtrack, and Mr Jablonsky wasn't very interested. Then, Hyung-rae showed him a graphic from the film, which changed Jablonsky's mind about doing the project. I'm just guessing here, that he probably didn't show him a first cut of the film; because I think Jablonsky's reaction to that may've been to turned around and jump head-first through his office window to the street below. At one point during the conversation, Steve Jablonsky made an inquiry about money for his work, and Mr Shim replied, \"not much.\" A quote that he jokes about on the special features. Now, at this point, I lost all consideration for this man, and any aspect of the film that I may've enjoyed before then, went straight out the window. Seventy-five-million-dollars?! Seventy-five-million-dollars?! How, on Earth, is seventy-five-million-dollars, \"not much\"? He then goes on to say that he made this film in English, compromising the main origin of the legend itself, simply so that it would appeal to more audiences. So that the advertising company could make more money. So that it could be shown in more cinemas. So that, in whole, he would make more money. This man is someone, like many other Hollywood directors of the same calibre, that should be banned from the industry for the rest of eternity. He is someone that does not care at all about anything to do with the story of this film. He has thrown $75 million dollars at visual effects and nothing else; just so that it will be impressive when the kids see it. The more kids like it, the more parents you've got that are gonna be dragged along to watch it. For every kid, that's at least 2 tickets; and if that kid brings a friend, then maybe they'll bring their parent too. You can see how, maybe, this movie's gross income could quickly build up; to pay this monstrous industry creation. Making this sort of film should be illegal. Or at least, there should be a MASSIVE sign attached to the front of the poster, DVD and every piece of merchandise connected to it, saying \"This film is awful! Do not watch it!\"... if this happens; then I'll be satisfied.",

That's why some people are crying out \"D-WAR Fighthing!!\" like some dude down there. Just don't believe this crap. You will see these idiots tell you \"You MUST watch this film\"(I even saw this one guy begging \"Please watch this film.\") Just don't believe any comments that gave this film above 7, that is not true. Personally, I like the raw materials that Shim started with. The Korean legend about a snake trying to be a dragon. Can be quite cool, No? And the movie could be better for sure, that's why I'm doubting Shim's passion for this movie. If he was so passionate about the film he certainly could have spent at least 3 months to go over the endless flaws of the film and make it watchable. It may not be the worst film ever for you, but it was for me, even considering high expectation I had because of all the mass media marketing. If what trailer show could fit in well together in the movie, it could have earned 6 or 7. But I don't think Shim understands what makes a good movie. I should have hired another director and gave out the idea and work on the CG as he believes it to be the MOST IMPORTANT element of a movie. Just think about this, Ethan Kendrick(Jason Behr) goes in to the site of disaster(seemed to me like some archaeological excavation site) to cover it. Then some people in suits(assumed to be FBI agents) tells him to \"get the hell out you can't take picture or video here\"(something like this) and THEY walk away from him. I was seriously stupefied. You'll find more and more of this. Sarah(Amanda Brooks) freaks out after looking at the dragon scale. And people have no idea about how much she knows about this matter. That's just part of it. If you wanna see one of the worst movie ever just go watch it. I can only give 3 stars because it was watchable in the end. Still, the CG and reality didn't mix well so the difference is obvious.The battle scene in the end is only watchable thing in the part... but some scene Tanks and solders are shooting at nothing(omg).

I thought the Imoogi scale was harder than diamond, what happened when the helicopters shoot the imoogi and it fell? Where the hell the good Imoogi comes from?Anyway it's bad bad bad bad movie.

All I could say was \"Rescue Me\" this is horror that I didn't even know it started. There were no titles at the beginning. But this movie was so full of flaws, not to mention the cheesy acting. Who ever thought this movie was good has absolutely no taste. Another note I was dragged to going and seeing this movie. This was not a movie I wanted to go see in the first place. But sure enough I thought about 20 times leaving this crap bomb. But let me say this movie is called Dragon Wars, and The 2 main creatures weren't even dragons but giant snakes. The only time you saw a dragon was at the very end when one apparently earned it's wings for some unknown reason, But at this point I was just wanting to get the hell out of the movie. There were too many scenes in this movie to count when I shook my head and laughed at the stupidity. Two scenes in particular were when the army was attacking the super evil army from years in the past, and they were shooting at absolutely nothing. Another scene was how conveniently the 2 main characters find out that they are part of a destiny to stop this unstoppable force and magically find each other in this mess. This movie was made for the effects only, and that is all it had going for it. But with a Craptastic story, acting, and characters you just don't care about. Its pointless. And that 1 out of 10 review isn't a typo. Its for real. Avoid this crap fest at all cost.Dragon Wars (D-Wars) (2007) Review: 1/10",

Having grown up on the giant rubber monsters of Toho Studios, and the stop-motion epics of Ray Harryhausen, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Battle of the CGIant Snakes, at the end.I also enjoyed the subtitled prologue as narrated by Robert Forster's character (who, I'm guessing was supposed to be an Amerasian reincarnation of Haram's original sifu). Plus, the nods to classic monster movies of the past, like \"beast From 20,000 Fathoms\" and the 1933 \"King Kong.\" Plus, my recognition of \"Roswell\" alumnus Jason Behr as Ethan. And, last, but not least?The fact that this was one video game-adaptation NOT directed by Uwe Boll! The rest of the movie, though? Well, let's it put this way. The fact that Behr and Forster were the ONLY big-name actors in the principal cast will NOT guarantee big returns for this flick at the box office. I was one of three people watching this movie when the opening credits started. And, I WAS ONLY THE ONE _STILL_ WATCHING IT WHEN THE ENDING CREDITS STARTED!Hence, only five stars. If that stills make it sound satisfactory to you? Vaya con Dios, amigo!",

I went to see it with friends also, and even though we laughed, a lot, it was still not worth the $6.50 and definitely not worth the hour and a half we spent in there.To let you know where I'm coming from, I actually liked D&D the movie. yeah, it was awful, but it was bad funny. Also it wasn't edited by a retarded monkey. Seriously, \"D-war\" or whatever they call it was so choppy and discombobulated that you won't know where you are in the movie. That's OK though because you will know you want to leave the theater and try to get your money back.A little more information: A woman sat behind us with like 12 preteen boys. They were talking so much that about 10 minutes into it I wanted to strangle each one of them, slowly. Fortunately, about 15 minutes into it I, and everyone else, decided to join in with the kids because that was the only way sitting through that trash heap of a movie.Seriously, I would have preferred they just turned the volume all the way down and let us talk amongst ourselves for 90 minutes.I don't want to get into detail as to why the movie was so bad. I don't want to relive that experience. I'm almost crying now just telling you it was bad. Please just trust me, don't go! If you must see it, wait a month and watch it on USA, wait, no, Sci-Fi.

Both desire to attain a human sacrifice, and neither was able to do so 500 years before this film's contemporary setting. Sarah(Amanda Brooks)is the reincarnated spirit of the Korean girl who committed suicide with her lover before Buraki could get to her. Ethan(Jason Behr)is a LA newspaper journalist and the reincarnated spirit of the one assigned to protect Sarah in the previous life, and is called on by Jack(Robert Forster, a guardian protector in his own right whose role is to make sure Ethan and Sarah succeed in her sacrifice to the good Imoogi so that the world will not be overcome by evil and terror)to see that this time the great event can take place and that order can be restored without Buraki itself attaining her. Atrox(Jesse Jam Miranda)is the one responsible for Buraki receiving the sacrifice so that evil can rule the world. Got all that? All this just to see a dragon snake and a monstrous dinosaur army led by foot soldiers obeying the command of Atrox to destroy everything it their path to get Sarah. If you want to see a metropolis under attack by CGI creatures with lots of buildings exploding and collapsing, with fighter planes and heavily equipped helicopters attempting to stop them, this is your movie. From what I understand this was financed by South Korea and I can see why so little inspiration was given to actual performances of worth. This complex story-line I grew tiresome of, but maybe kids will enjoy the live action video game that Dragon Wars is. One sequence where the Buraki serpent slithers up a skyscraper known as the Liberty Building to catch Ethan and Sarah is an obvious homage to King Kong. The sequences where flying fire-breathing pterodactyl type creatures, walking dinosaurs which are equipped with launchers that fire off missiles, soldiers in suits of armor(..carrying shields)as they target structures and human life with our armed forces using tanks and other firepower at our disposal might remind you of Star Wars(..preferably The Return of the Jedi), and there's a deadly fight to the finish between the Buraki and good Imoogi which closes out the movie. Behr and Brooks spend most of their time on the lam as the Buraki constantly closes in, leaving wreckage after each location. There is this talisman around Ethan's neck and Sarah has the scar of the red dragon both of which play major factors at the end of the movie when it appears that Atrox and Buraki have finally gained the upper hand. I guess many will consider the dragon serpent fight at the end a colossal clash of the titans, reminiscent of the Godzilla monster battles of the past in Japan. The reliance on CGI is overwhelming. Forster's character morphs into various people to assist Ethan and Sarah.",

Again, you cannot watch this movie and look for a deep plot or story mainly because you will not find it, but the movie is entertaining, and even funny at points, just because the fact that there is a legit war going on between humans and dragon/dinosaur type things.

The acting was awful by Jason Behr, and the rest of the cast that shall remain nameless...and mainly forgettable. However, one thing cannot be denied in this film, and that was the special effects. The dragons, the weird creatures that were never fully explained, were all very well done, and had that same muted naturalistic look like the autobots and decepticons in Transformers. Come to think of it, it was done very much in the styles of Michael Bay, and the score was actually done by Hans Zimmer's troupe that actually worked on Transformers. I watched the special features and learned that Director Hyung-rae Shim was making his first attempt at breaking the international scene. He mentioned that rather than using a design company for his special effects, he created his own. This, I have great respect for. He said, in so many words, something that I agree wholeheartedly with: There are two \"T\"'s in movies, Talent, and Technology. Perhaps he needed to work a bit on Talent part of those \"T\"'s.",

I've even met someone who hated koreans just because he assumed all of them were good in Starcraft.I'd give this movie at least an 8.",

First off, the story is kind of, well, what's the proper word for it....retarded. Yeah, there it is! The characters were uninteresting and a bit wooden with the performances. The story makes no attempt to add depth to these characters so you pretty much end up simply not giving a damn about them. Attempts at comic relief were pathetic and there were often moments when I forced myself to laugh. Stale characters and a bad story ultimately kill this flick, plus I didn't really find the action scenes so vivid and extraordinary as I had hoped. Godzilla films with half the budget prove more memorable.",

            "content": "Prior to the premiere of this film in Korea, every time I watched the news, there was some story about D-War.... mainly about the Korean director, who was a comedian awhile back, and how it cost $150 million and 6 years to make. But the biggest factor for this film's hype was that it was a Korean film being filmed in LA with American actors. This film was all based on hype and national pride and as a result it totally did not deliver. I don't care if you're Korean, American, European, or anything else, but if you can honestly look someone in the eye and say that this film was excellent, then you have got to be a great liar. To give this film some credit, it HAD the opportunity to become something great. It was actually a good plot, but it tanked on so many levels, from the failed CGI, to the poor script, to the poor acting, and to the insanely evident cheese factor. Oh, and just because the actor's were no namers, it doesn't mean that it was bad. It was bad acting because they were just bad actors, plain and simple. The script was way too cheesy and the bad acting just made things worse. Also, despite the fact that it cost $150 million to make, it seems the majority of it was used to get the license to film in LA. Yes, I KNOW that this movie is about dragons and I shouldn't be too scrutinizing on the CGI, but Jurassic Park was based on dinosaurs and that was made over 10 years ago and managed to have better graphics than this. The CGI didn't converge well with the rest of the scenery and made a terrible clash.I think I was soooo lucky to have watched Transformers AFTER D-War because if I saw it the other way around, I would have walked out of D-War. D-War may have set the record for best opening in Korea, but to be perfectly honest, it was all based on national pride, which isn't a bad thing mind you. But once this film hits America, it's going to bomb. It won't have the same popularity as Shiri, Old Boy, and Lady Vengeance which didn't have a big opening in Korea, yet found fame in the global film industry.",

            "content": "1. PatriotismPeople in S. Korea believe that D-War is going to do well in Hollywood and show the world that a Korean movie can be as successful as any other blockbusters made in U.S. They don't see D-War as a movie, they see it as a representative of their country. Hence the frantic support, just like they did for their soccer team in FIFA World Cup 2002.2. NationalitySomewhat similar to patriotism, D-War includes their national theme song 'Arirang' at the ending credits. Also during the intro of the movie one of the actors mention the words \"This is a Korean legend..\" which again amplifies the fact that it IS a KOREAN movie. Korean people just love that, as they are all eager to advertise the Korean movie to the world.3. Home-made CGUntil now, almost all of the CGs in the blockbusters made in Korea has been imported from overseas. However the CGs in D-War was actually done by a small Korean company. This was a major breakthrough for the Koreans and this adds more value to the movie in Korean people's perspective as they are able to boast about their CG skills to the rest of the world through D-War.4. Sympathy for the DirectorThe director of D-War 'Hyung-rae Shim' was actually a very famous and popular slapstick comedian. During the peak of his career as a comedian, he suddenly decided that he wants to create movies and went on to create quite a few low-budget movies. They were all criticized and failed horribly in the market due to their lack of quality. Shim lost most of his fortune he made as a comedian during this process and people began to sympathize for him. When Shim announced that he is making a huge blockbuster costing near $75 million U.S dollars, the public was very supportive of him and the movie as a whole.The combination of all 4 factors mentioned above have turned D-War into a major success in Korea. However the critics have criticized the movie for its lack of plot and using the mentioned factors to lure people to see the movie. Of course non-Koreans don't care about any of these factors, they only see the movie as it is. This is why the movie won't succeed in the countries other than Korea.",

The rest of the city seemed to be unaware that it had been attacked by gigantic reptile creatures and were living their lives in blissful ignorance.

C'mon, this movie has got to be at least better than those crappy movies, right? To be fair, the CGI is not bad at all! Whilst not as good as Transformers or Lord of the Ring, this movie's CGI is not as bad as 'Monster'. The dragon is made with details, its movement is very nice. The fighting scene between the good dragon Imoogi & the evil dragon Buraki is very nicely done, too. And the scene where the evil soldiers marches towards the altar also made it worth the watch.While some may disagree with me, I think that the storyline is built-up in a good way. The narration by the old man, the 'visions' experienced by both the lead actor & actresses, and even the flashbacks of the scene where their village is destroyed by the evil forces and Sarah Daniels' father killed was wonderfully made.In my opinion, the poor rating of this movie is because of its predictability. Hey, maybe it does not take a genius to know that good will prevail over evil, but it does not make this movie bad. It is like watching sports movie where the hero/heroine will most definitely win.All in all, it is a good movie to relax after a hard day at work. The storyline is good without being complicated and the soundtrack is nice to hear. If you are looking to watch complicated storyline with equally complicated twists and turns, then maybe you should stop watching movies all together.

I will give it some credit and say that the scenery and settings are beautiful and the effects while not great are at least decent, an asset I was dubious about in all honesty. The dragons do look imposing and do have presence which does elevate things a lot. But oh my goodness so many things spoilt Dragon Wars. The direction is nothing but flat, everything just lacks life and nothing stands out. The dialogue is very poor, with cheesy one-liners and hackneyed flow of the overall script, while no time at all is spent developing the characters, all they are at the end of the day are standard and in some cases annoying clich\u00e9s. I have no better news about the acting either, Jason Behr is hopelessly wooden and has no charisma whatsoever. Robert Forster was the best of the entire cast, and even he was generic. But what really made Dragon Wars as bad as it was was the story. It is one thing to have a simple story, but when it is over-simplistic and structurally thin that is another matter entirely. Everything lumbered on with no sense of heart, surprises or excitement while any climatic scenes felt rushed. Overall, the production values and dragons are not bad, but everything else pretty much is. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

In this movie, the dragons are clearly shown as 3-D, and you sort of have a feeling that if you could stick your hand through the TV, your hand would move right through the dragons.

But for some reason, this film is one of the very few that gets criticized for having the sort of fans. Why, because the fans are from Korea and not US? I just don't get it. The haters make it sound like people outside of Korea are all objective in their views. Not true.Go find the worst movies you've ever seen. You'd be surprised to see that each of those films have 10 ratings too. I just don't get this mentality of haters that just because they didn't think much of the film, all others who say otherwise are lying. Tsk Tsk.Also, there are plenty of haters that have rated this film 1, so stop whining.The biggest misperception: Koreans are sabotaging the rating system. Truth is, if Koreans really did want to manipulate the ratings, it'd have more than ~350 total ratings.And in case you haven't noticed, most of the thread starters and posters that spew hate on this film ARE Koreans. So, put a stop to this idea that all Koreans have somehow unified to mess with IMDb rating system. It didn't happen, and the evidence is clear.Just wait for its release in the States -09-14- and see for yourself. It won't be too late to rate the film then. Just because a few fans would rate the film 10 based on reasons that should not be relevant when rating a film, it doesn't make it right for you haters to rate the film 1 just to negate it. 1? 1? 1? Come on. 1? Really? 1? Again, -since it's worth repeating- even if you thought that, it doesn't mean all others who rate the film otherwise are wrong.You haters act like the lonely, introverted nutjobs who were the only child in their respective family, and were babied all their lives. Here's a free lesson: People (can) have different opinions.I enjoyed this film more than I enjoyed SpiderMan3, Fantastic4II among others I've seen in recent months. Those films received a ton of 10 ratings. Seriously, were either of 'em deserving of a 10 rating? I think not, but I won't put them down nor will I give those each film a 1 rating just for the sake of negating the 10 ratings like some of you are doing to D-War. Again, cut this BS idea that Koreans have swarmed the IMDb. Only about ~350 votes right now have been tallied, including about ~75 1 ratings. Enough said. Koreans can be very exuberant. If they wanted to swarm this place, it'd have 20,000 votes easily by this coming Monday. Easily, I might add. Don't confuse exuberance with what you claim 'false nationalism.'D-War isn't up to the standards set by the LOTR. I happen to think LOTR is one of the best films ever produced, by the way. But it isn't a B-movie that the haters are attempting the smear this film to be. If you're a fan of SF/Legend/CGI fan, go see it. Or at least afford this film enough respect to withhold the judgment until you see it. Don't let these perpetual haters discourage you.Thanks for reading, everybody!",

The bad glue-on facial hair made them even more laughable - most Asian men are incapable of growing proper facial hair - there are exceptions, but that's why you see very few Asian men with beards - but these dudes had some serious goatees.The writing is terrible. It's like they did a survey of all the Hollywood action movies and picked out the most common lines, then tossed them all higglety-pigglety into the script.Black Man:\"It's time you took this\" (hands White Man a gun) White Man:\"Come on, you know I hate those things\" The Black sidekick is SO ridiculously stereotyped it's almost nauseating. The fact that the main characters keep abandoning him to the bad guys in a fight makes me wonder why he would even be in the next scene, even if he survived.The film takes place in LA, but then for readily explainable reason, the final battle scene is in some fire-roasted plain in some alternate universe - Where the Hell did this Hell come from? Dunno! At the end of the movie, all the Koreans started clapping - I have NEVER heard Koreans clap at the end of a film - even at the Pusan International Film Festival, applause is sparse - but there was almost a standing ovation a the end of this fiasco.I stood up and gave a loud raspberry. Then I went to get my money back.When I went back to the box office, I was FUMING - they took one look at me and handed me my money back - no questions asked.Congratulations, D-War, you've done what no Hollywood film has ever done - made me demand (and get) my money back.",

The effect is very promising, the dragons, and the minions look pretty convincing and menacing and threatening. The good dragon was also a plus in this movie. But that's all I can praise from this movie.Yup. You heard me right. The only thing that I see as a plus in this movie, is the graphic and the special effect. Every tiny little bit of the effect is very good. The dragons look real enough for me. And how every destruction, explosion, and the way the dragon pass through every road, and the damage it caused, everything related to graphic and special effect is a plus.As for the story, it's just so-so. Not really good, but it's not that bad either. For the act, I have to say, it's not so good. The dialogues is kinda awkward. Everything they say just seem so, unnatural. You will know what I mean if you see it and hear it yourself.It's a recommendation for those who loves special effect and graphic and don't care about the story. But it's not a good recommendation for those who cares a lot about the story.I rate it 6/10",

The CGI in this film actually carries emotional weight which is not only rare but very difficult to accomplish (CGI is really a 'cool' medium, as Marshall McLuhan might remark). And what the director is really trying to accomplish with his storyline is not composition so much as orchestration - the construction is musical rather than dramatic.Does it achieve its intent? no, not completely. But neither is it a complete failure by any means. Rather than trying to figure out the film, go with the flow of it and you'll be surprised at how entertaining it really is.P.S. I'd rate it a seven, but give two extra points because it doesn't deserve the low rating it has here at IMDb.",

This is exactly how not to make a summer film. I felt bad to see an Oscar nominated actor Robert Forster) be part of this garbage. There is something completely pathetic about more and more companies trying to copy the tried and true and completely overly done Hollywood formula. I realize monster CG fights are cheaper to make now more than ever that they can now afford to make, but not only are they done poorly, a lot of us are tired of all special effects with little to no story! *cough* \"Spiderman 3\" w/ it's hundred plot points and twenty different characters for example. I laughed at the absurdity of the story, the dialog, and the absolute terrible acting! Now as bad as this was S. Korea did do another CG Monster flick called \"The Host\" and it was pretty good. It wasn't great but it seemed Oscar worthy compared to this. Their best decision though was working on getting a pretty good script, and getting their monster done by ILM. (George Lucas' Oscar winning special effects company Industrial Light & Magic.) I think that if you were to watch this w/a bunch of buddies and didn't take it all seriously, and made fun of the terrible wooden acting, the crummy special effects, then maybe it might be a fun watch, I don't know.

But after seeing this movie, I realized I had fallen victim to false advertising. While there is great talk of Dragons throughout this movie, there is only one true dragon, and he does not appear until the end of the movie.But what seriously bothered me the most was the lack of continuity in the plot of this movie. Seriously, this movie had more holes in the plot than the movie Holes. From the dream sequence at the beginning to the unnecessary jumping back and forth from one moment to the next, I felt more confused about things than any other movie I had ever seen. The massive amounts of time that were left out of this movie too also bothered me. For example, after escaping from the evil Immogi yet again, Ethan and Sarah manage to get out of L.A. in an FBI car while the pseudo-dragons army fights the U.S. Military. As we are in the car watching what is behind us, all of a sudden, it cuts to the 2 driving in the desert and Sarah asking Ethan \"Why are we in Mexico?\" You know what, I was asking the same thing at that point too. How in the world did you get to Mexico without stopping, and I also wanted to know what the conversation was like, because I seriously doubt that they made small talk.All in all, I do not think that this movie is worth anyone's time, unless you feel like losing 90 minutes of your life and spending money to support bad movies.",

If you like monster movies like Godzilla where the whole city gets destroyed, this is just what you wanna watch.

I thought that the plot had so much potential and the action sequences were pretty good and had me on the edge of my seat. I think what made this movie a horrible disaster was that the plot became to confusing since it flashes back within a flashback and they did not do a good job explaining the story. Poor Robert Forster tried so hard not to laugh during his monologue that it took me right out of the movie.The acting was poor and the writers did not develop the characters as well as they should have. I think that they moved into the character's story rather to quick. The FBI agents should have had a bigger part and the team screamed X-Files, since they found out about the dragons because the FBI has a paranormal investigations unit. It questions if the actors were encouraged enough, ultimately questioning the capability of the director. You could tell that they had difficulty staying within their characters since the characters themselves were so ridiculous.The plot was the biggest disaster of them all. It had so much potential that the writers didn't even execute it correctly. It right away rushed into it rather that building it up and the whole \"ancient-warriors-in-present-day-L.A.\" was good but it became to silly. The questionable presence of a giant snake dragon slithering across a hospital, and no one knowing of it, was hard to believe. They did not give headroom to expand on the star-crossed lovers or the conflict between the good guy and the bad guy. They mention the good Inoogi over and over again but we don't' see him till the end and even that battle between good and bad was ridiculous. It begs the question as to why are there dragons and why the hell can't anybody see these things.In summation, the movie wanted to be a huge A-budge action flick but instead it lacked everything an action movie should have had. I hate to say it but, if Michael Bay would have produced or even directed this tragedy, it would have been so much better in every category. Michael Bay, where were you when we really needed you?",

I had been warned that it was a modern Godzilla flick and with that in mind I enjoyed the film. As an animator it was hard to watch in some places. The composites were blurry and the human animation in some scenes were animatic level quality. When you realize that this was their first jab at a project of this scope however, it is easy to forgive the occasional bad edit or overlooked scene without any CG characters in it*. The \"wow\" moments were truly good ones. I found myself saying \"cool\" out loud several times. A lot of the huge battle scenes reminded me of the attempt at Star Wars episode I. Unfortunately this film did have a heavy Jar jar element, only without the funny bits. Not in that it had a CGI character, but rather as if Jar Jar were the one directing the film. There are some very strange moments, such as the sudden cut at the end to a wasted landscape that has no explanation except that the hero is rendered unconscious and wakes up there. For most audiences this is unforgivable. There were many such moments in the movie but this was the most jarring of them all. Then there are the \"wow\" moments that left my jaw hanging open at the absolute badness of \u0085the utterly horrible\u0085the amateurish way they were done. The scene where the hero saves the girl by taking a bullet meant for her at point blank range, and then stands up as if nothing had happened. The stereotypical FBI bad guy might as well have sneezed on him. Again there is no explanation for this seemingly inexplicable moment in the film. But if you take the film at its face value, it can be enjoyable. You just need to lower your expectations a few notches. Well, make that a lot of notches. I wouldn't mind seeing it again if I can fast forward through all the dumb bits to see the action again.Papa* In one shot the military is firing on the horde coming down the canyon between the buildings.

It's not worth the money to see it at the theater. Anyone who attempts to cloud the issue are either people who have stakes in D-war or fanatic fans of Shim Hyung Rae. (Shim Hyung Rae is a very influential comedian in Korea.) You will ask me then \"Why should I believe you? Like why should you care whether I see D-war at the movies or not?\" Well, to me it's a matter of principle. A good movie should succeed. Bad movies should fail. This is not the case with D-war up till now. And this frustrates me. Sort of like seeing a criminal get away with a heinous crime and being helpless to do anything about it. I felt as if I had to do something against this awful movie that gobbled up my 7000 won and wasted 90 minutes of my time. Anyway everybody agrees that D-war is a bad movie not worth the money to see at the theater. But nevertheless, over 7 million people have gone to the theater to see D-war in Korea. (In fact, this is the main reason why Freestyle Realising was encouraged into opening D-war in more than 1500 screens on 9/14) How did this unthinkable thing happen? Several reasons come to my mind...1. Tremendous marketing effort...The guy who markets D-war definitely is a professional worth his salt. He's a ruthless individual who makes use of any and all opportunity. Like for example, a few days after D-war opened in Korea, a gay director made a negative comment about D-war in his personal blog. Normally this shouldn't have amounted to anything as few people visited his blog. But what ensued afterward is a gay bashing thing like I've never seen in Korea. (Normally, homosexuality is a non-issue that Koreans are too embarrassed to even talk about in Korea. But not this time.) The marketers of D-war claimed that Shim Hyung Rae was a \"good Korean\" who made \"good movies\" that were suitable for children's viewing, while other directors in Korea made homosexual or violent movies that were bad for children. Of course this is quiet ridiculous. Shim's movies are just AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL and so completely TASTELESS.. (I'm 100% sure that D-war is actually more harmful to children than a pornographic snuff film.) If you wanna see an example of Shim's work, see Yonggary aka Reptilian. You should be able to download it somewhere. And you'll see what I mean. The only difference between D-war and Yonggary is the CG.. The drama part has not improved at all. It's become worse. Well, actually, at least Yonggary was sort of watchable. You could write it off as a really really really badly made cheesy amateur B- movie. But not D-war. D-war is definitely NOT a B-movie. You can clearly see that enough money ($70 MILLION dollars in all) has been spent on it to at least qualify it as a non-B movie. So you can't but help drawing comparisons with other non-B movies and it just makes it simply too unwatchable. It just sort of makes you feel like a complete fool. No, I didn't say that right. You sort of feel as if you're BECOMING a complete fool by watching D-war. As if you're being contaminated by something really sickeningly disgusting. Even people who like watching \"bad\" movies should stay away from D-war. How can I explain what the affect of watching D-war is like? Like for example, imagine you went to the hospital to get surgery to remove your appendix. And the doctor gave you brain surgery instead and removed your pre-frontal lobe. That's what seeing D-war is like. It's just simply AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL...2. Korean Patriotism.Koreans are among the most nationalistic people in the world. Most Koreans feel that it is their \"duty\" to go see D-war because D-war is being exported to the States. 3. The trailers..Oh, the D-war trailers for D-war were beautifully crafted by the D-war marketing people and I can't give them enough praise!!! Too bad the actual movie is nothing like the trailers. Well, actually, I've changed my mind. Please DOOOOOOOOOO see this movie!!!!!! So there would be more people to join the cause against this movie!!! I'm beginning to think that maybe there should be something like an \"director's license\" or something. The public should be protected from people like Shim Hyung Rae. Like if you were to make a list of people who shouldn't be allowed to make movies, Shim Hyung Rae would be at the top of the list.",

Before yesterday I knew nothing about this movie. The artwork done in developing this movie was brilliant.In watching this movie at the start I wondered if it were some kind of comedy or a spoof due to the acting and silliness of some of the scenes that were almost childishly stupid. But, it was due to these scenes that added a flavor and charm to this movie you seldom see. I was unaware the director was a comic or was Korean (or that the film was Korean). In view of this and knowing Korean culture as well as I do, I can now give a better comment and appreciate this film more. I wish that the director had not hidden the Korean flavor to his movie. I liked the concept of the setting to be in the USA, but I do feel that more of the roles should have been Korean to give more balance to the imoogi legend theme as well as to the movie itself for the audience to be more accepting of those rough scenes with both comedical and poor line deliveries, etc.All in all, I was wowed by the creativeness and imagination put forth in this film that is not seen in many these days. I do like Korean movies and would like to see more. This film was a work of art, for sure, and is entertaining. It does need fixing, but I wouldn't tell people to not watch it.",

Also the dark-army were menacing, the SFX good and it would have been interesting if the young couple had fought the dark lord instead of more-or-less committing suicide and becoming reincarnated in 21st Century LA.The reincarnated male lead was played by a suitably weak actor poorly portraying a weak character who could think of nothing but running from a dragon that gave him (and Sarah) every opportunity to run and escape whenever it caught up with them! Sarah, the reincarnated female-lead, was not a great deal better and God knows what they found to fall in love with as neither of then had a personality. The lead performances mirror the entire cast who gave uniformly poor performances.The script was indescribably poor, and not only suffered from the major weakness of borrowing already hackneyed lines from other films, but neither developed the characters or even the plot.The overall premise of the story was not particularly poor, but the developing storyline and continuity were excessively poor in that nothing made any particular sense and it was so random! E.g. Why Mexico? How did the soldiers know to go to some mine-workings? Where did the end scene take place? How could he get shot at point blank range and get up again unharmed? The battles were curiously flat; with tanks, helicopters, dragons etc they should have been good but somehow I felt them to be un-involving and, well, boring. Perhaps it was the SFX which I felt to be mediocre, or perhaps I just like close up and personal as in 'Jason and the Argonauts' or 'Aliens'.I do not care if the film was Korean, Japanese, American or Mongolian! I judged it on its own merits, which are very few. Children may like it; but not discerning ones.",

The director made this movie for international viewing and is why he made it in English also he used American actors and world famous American composer who did not do it for money (cause there was not much to get). south Korea is not a very rich country and not known for movie making and trying to appeal to the American people I think they did a great job making this movie. It does not have the special effects as let say transformers but for the money spent I think the special effects are great. I and my family seen this movie at the theater and just watched it again on DVD. We all enjoyed it. There are a few shots that could have be done different that would have made the movie a little better but all in all I give the Korean film makers a 10 star(part for effort) and hope there next sci-fi with a little more money available will give us more great entertainment.

Korea now has caught up with Japan and shown it's capable of producing its own version of Godzilla. They're a little late to the game, but who can blame the director - making a national blockbuster is akin to building a large phallic building for many developing economies. Everyone wants to have one. The Russian produced 'Inhabited Island', Chinese produced 'The Promise'. They're all terrible films, laden with sub-par digital FX, mediocre story and ham acting.

The opening storyline, which gets entirely forgotten about around the half hour mark, is absolutely cringe-worthy, along the lines of something equally ridiculous and kid-friendly like DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION.The acting is even worse: this is a South Korean production, made in collaboration with Hollywood so that we get a load of young and inexperienced American actors popping up in central roles. It goes without saying that they're horrible, although eagle-eyed viewers may notice a slumming Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN) turning up in one of those world-weary mentor type roles.Meanwhile, I do have to admit that the CGI is impressive. Those massed pitched battles are carried out with gusto and a maximum of destruction, and the creatures on show put to shame the kinds of low-budget CGI monstrosities that prop up many a television movie. But, in the end, without a decent storyline to support them, who cares about the quality of the effects on show?

And quite frankly, most of it doesn't matter. The CGI battle in Korea reminds me of the Star Wars ground combat. It's a lot of explosions for very little excitement.Then it's modern day LA. Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) is a TV reporter, and Jack (Robert Forster) owns an antique store. Together they are the reincarnation of the two heavenly warrior sent to protect Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks) against an army of magical dragons and warriors.After a slow section where everybody find one another, the movie turns into more CGI battles. Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks are not the best actors around. There's only so much that Robert Forster can do. Craig Robinson does a couple of funny bits but they hardly matter. The battle in LA is kinda fun, but that's the only watchable part. It ends in a confused mess around a CGI fortress with the dragon. I couldn't tell you what happened.",

Hell, he doesn't even get a Werther's for being such a good boy.Weird old Jack's story goes something like this (possibly): every half a millennium, a Yuh-Yi-Joo is born who has the power to transform an Imoogi into a powerful celestial dragon. 500 years ago, evil Imoogi Buraki, aided by his Atrox army, a swarm of Bulcos and squadron of mighty dawdlers (I kid ye not), was narrowly thwarted by the Yuh Ji Yoo's appointed protector. Soon, Buraki will return to seek out the latest Yuh-Yi-Joo and it is up to Ethan, the new protector, to ensure that it doesn't succeed.Fifteen years later and Ethan (now played by Jason Behr with floppy hair) has all but forgotten his strange encounter with the old man (probably on account of his story being so crap), but gradually begins to understand his destiny when the massive serpent turns up to trash the city in its hunt for a mysterious girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks).Written and directed by Korean Hyung-rae Shim, but starring an all-American cast, D-War is a colossal mess, a big-budget CGI-packed monster movie that throws an awful lot at the screen (including an elephant being eaten by a snake and a huge oriental dragon) but still somehow manages to be about as exciting as an episode of The Waltons: the script is all over the place, virtually every performance is diabolical (although you have to feel for the actors wrestling with such lousy dialogue), and the huge-scale action scenes, although visually impressive, completely fail to engage the viewer due to the sheer inanity of proceedings.",

They kind of reminded me of up dated Last Starfighter special effects. In D-War, there were these huge battle scenes, where one army was lined up and you could literally see some of the 3D animated characters \"hopping\" if you've ever seen bad CGI, I hope you know what I mean.The acting, script and one-liners were on par with Eragon, which is to say, putrescent.Save your money...if you want to see a good \"city fighting scene\" go rent some old Godzilla flicks...they are more enjoyable than this...at least then, you can laugh at the cheesy special effects rather than the presumably good special effects that are far from.",

            "content": "How to begin... I have so mixed feelings.When I saw the opening scene, I was like, man, this movie is going to suck big time. It was really, really basic scene, but you could right away tell that the director was no Spielberg. Odly, only 60 seconds from the opening, and we already got into a flashback (which again went to another flashback!), and it got a lot better. What?!? Then came the 'lord of the rings' battle scene, and suddenly it started to look even good. I really liked the 'rocketlauncher lizards', those where cool!But then... then we came back to real-time from the flashbacks, and what a load of crap it brought with it. The movie was as bad as the other reviews say it was. No sense of directing, nor editing. Really bad story telling and acting, and nothing made any sense. I really started to hate this movie, but I kept torturing myself.After an hour of living hell, I thought I would stop the movie and watch something else. It was really that bad. Then it occurred to me that (the movie was still on) I could read some (bad) reviews about it from IMDb just to amuse myself. Not surprised, everyone seemed to hate it.However, on the background something seemed to happen in the movie and it caught my attention. I sat back to the sofa and put my headphones back on. And then... I started to think that this CGI stuff was actually pretty good. The city was been destroyed and cars where flying in the air. Some helicopters where shooting dragons and I was suddenly eating my popcorn again?!? I didn't have a glue what was happening, but that didn't really matter, the action, and especially the CGI was pretty decent. After a while the characters even seemed to jump into another dimension (for some reason) and the CGI was looking really good. What the heck, I started to like this 'what ever they were trying to do' stuff.The end scene with the big fight was really nicely done, and I especially liked when the good(?) snake... I mean dragon, changed into... well, a dragon - a traditional Chinese dragon! I'm a graphic designer, and I must say the CGI was really, really good for the last minutes of the movie. Did you notice how liquid the dragon was when it flew through the air? Very well done.I was totally clueless about the story and everything not related to CGI was horrible. Some stuff was so bad you will tear your eyes out and have nightmares for years, but there was enough tiny things, like the music score and especially the last 15 minutes, that it made me raise my vote from 2 to 7.",

I personally do not want to waste my valuable money to watch these movies with my friends considering my age as 18. However, I do go watch these movies with the KIDS such as my LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER respecting the fact that the KIDS would like it. Of course a movie like this that was meant for the kids are not gonna satisfy every aspect that we have because of the fact it was meant for the kids. It would have been better to have a strong plot for the adults to enjoy as well, but for the kids, this movie surely do open their eyes and the parents can teach the kids saying how there are all different kinds of movies and cultures out there. I highly do give a credit for a director considering a fact that it must have very hard for him to make a movie like this in U.S. as a first Korean director. Therefore, because I respect the director's effort for the movie and the cultural facts of this movie, I highly recommend this movie to open kids' and your mind.",

            "content": "Here is some good news for the audience who will see 'D-war'. It's not that terrible. It was such honor (or dishonor, whatever you like) to see overblown, disjointed direct-to-video movie projected on huge screen with people around me. However, it was quite depressing 90 minutes. I hate flat, lifeless character-interacting scenes, I was not amused by its cheap humor that evoked very small laughter from audience, and I was at a loss during spectacularly unconvincing and unrealistic finale. In case of CG, the monsters are more or less convincing than hideous monster from 'Deep Rising'. Two attack scenes, good on their own, are just average showcasing of CG without purpose in the movie. The final showdown does not take place in L.A., and I'd rather see that leftover sets and monsters and soldiers from 'The Lord of the Rings' appearing in the middle of smashed L.A.Last year, 'Lady in the Water' introduced outrageous Korean folk tale with not-so-Korean names to U.S. audience. This year, 'D-war' will provide them another one, which is told by literally ubiquitous Robert Forster. I was glad to see Scott Wilson in 'The Host', but Robert Forster in 'D-war'? U.S. critics will probably have the field day with comparing Mr. Forster and Mr. Wilson in their respective movies. It's disheartening to see that Academy award nomination didn't help Mr. Forster's career, and the only consolation is, like Peter O'Toole in 'Phantoms', that Mr. Forster speaks some preposterous lines without laughing. That's the sign of veteran actor who started the career with 'Reflections in a Golden eye' 40 years ago. Anyway, he's still working, so don't worry folks.Speaking of director Hyung-rae Shim, I won't say anything offending to him. He just tried hard to make the film he wanted, and now he gets his wishes. However, he does the most annoying thing I have ever seen on the screen. He seems to think quite seriously of himself and the movie, and, with lame inclusion of 'Arirang' at the end of movie, he shows production pictures with some serious statement. I hope he will never show translated version of it or whatsoever to U.S. critics. They will have gut-busting laugh. It is just like the student who submits lousy report after long, long time with some notes saying 'I tried very, very hard against all odds and this will be my magnum opus. Help me please'. I'm a graduate student who has been as ruthless as Anton Ego to undergraduates about their grade, and big minus point will be guaranteed if I have to grade the one like that.One of the standards of late Gene Siskel is, 'Is this movie better than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?'. Mr. Shim, the answer for your movie is 'NO', and maybe you will have to prepare pretty interesting documentary 'The Making of D-War' for DVD supplement. Or, based on your 'reported' stubbornness and determination, maybe I should ask Roger Ebert about how to make Werner Herzog get interested in you. Maybe you can show Mr. Herzog that you also can move the big steamboat ship to the top of mountain. Maybe Mr. Herzog will get interested and make the documentary about your next big gamble. Now, that's the movie I'd like to see.",

This was a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy action with some incredible action sequences. Plot flaw: in the beginning of the film the evil Buraki attacks a village in search of the girl born with a dragon-shaped tattoo. If they were hoping to find the girl alive, why did they first bomb the village and then searched for her? The chances were very good they could have killed her during the attack.Nevertheless, the film is a fast-paced joyride of thrilling action and incredible effects. The Atrox Army battle in Los Angeles towards the end is insanely entertaining and well on par with the Hollywood blockbusters.",

            "content": "Dragon Wars earned its 5-star rating for seeing to it that - (1) The pretty-haired pretty-boy, actor Jason Behr, as ass-wipe news-reporter, Ethan Kendrik, got (somewhat satisfactorily) roughed up and knocked around and, yes, even got his pretty-hair sufficiently mussed up, too (but not nearly enough for my liking).(2) Los Angeles got royally trashed by both the attacking monster-lizards, along with their allied reptilian friends, as well as by the blundering boys of the U.S. military in their seriously botched attempt at a near-hopeless counter-attack.(3) The final, completely over-the-top showdown that took place between the \"good\" Imoogi and, yes, the \"bad\" Imoogi was a real winner. And even though I've grown mighty jaded and blas\u00e9 about C.G.I. effects, this particular battle-scene between good & bad was exceptionally impressive stuff, if you ask me.Putting all of Dragon Wars' crap aside (and, yes, there was plenty of that), this film actually did more than fulfill its promise when it came to delivering the goods on death and destruction done on a massive scale.And, like, isn't that why people watched this haywire movie? I mean, were viewers really expecting to be entertained by brilliant dialog, and a coherent story, and Oscar-worthy performances? 'Cause I think that only a ding-dong dimwit would've realistically expected that sort of thing from the likes of Dragon Wars.Another one of Dragon Wars' pluses was that, often enough, it was so pathetically stupid that it was actually quite funny. It even got so ludicrous at times that I literally burst out into almost uncontrollable laughter.In some ways I'd actually go so far as to say that Dragon Wars surpassed the likes of Transformers by a Korean, country mile. And, I'd certainly bet you that if this monster-of-a-monster-movie had been directed by, say, Michael Bay, rather than Hyung Rae Shim, then reviewers here on IMDb wouldn't have been so savagely anxious to trash it as they so mercilessly did.Anyways - When it comes to Korean legend, I really can't believe that upon this film's release the people of Korea didn't come forward and publicly protest about how utterly stupid this movie made their beliefs appear to the rest of the world",

Clearly this is his strength as a director.The problem is in the continuity of the story. Things just happen suddenly from one scene to the other and it gets worse as the film goes towards the end.First of all what is the purpose of the two protagonists in this movie ? If they were supposed to be the solution, why were they running away though out the entire movie ? There's no clear indication that it was them who called the dragon at the end, so what was their purpose of even being in the movie ? And worse, if they did call the dragon, why were they running, and why did it take so long for them to do what they were supposed to be doing in the first place ? And what was that orb that came out of the girl in the end ? It did absolutely nothing - nothing at all !So this bitch who was supposed to be the main focus of the story did absolutely nothing from beginning to the end. The story ended because of some miraculous act of nature as far as I can tell.And one last thing - why did the snake thing take so long to kill the bitch ? It had at least three scenes that it could have finished her off in half a second. When it comes to the time of doing the honors, it just pauses and slithers around until something else happens.Go for the action and not the story on this one. CG is good, and the battle is pretty exciting, so it's worth watching if you like giant reptile movies.",

            "content": "For those who have seen it, most agree. This movie sucked beyond belief. I will begin by listing contextual reasons why this movie was unbearable to even sit through.(1)At the very start, the characters call the dragons \"Iwugi.\" This gets very annoying, VERY fast. They should seriously call them dragons, like the title declares. (2)The evil Iwugi NEVER EATS ANYTHING! Even the elephant it picks up at the zoo, it just flings it at the fat night guard. Most of the time it just stares at its prey, waiting for it to run again. (3)Most of the scenes are random as hell. At one point the president is escorting these 2 kids to wherever. Yes, the PRESIDENT. Then they enter a random warehouse and the president pulls a gun on the girl and says, \"I've done my homework, it's the only way.\" Yes, the PRESIDENT. Clich\u00e9-ly he gets shot as he is about to pull the trigger by his assistant, whom you never see for the remainder of the film. You will walk out of the theater asking, \"what the hell happened in the past 2 hours?\" Plot flow was anything but smooth. (4)Acting was terrible. Characters barely show any emotions and say/ do things, yes, you guessed it, randomly. After they barely escape a given dragon fight, you find the main guy and girl on the beach, and they kiss. Soon after they love each other eternally. Wait, back up...they just met?? (5)The ending finally shows the title: Dragon Wars. The good and evil Iwugis fight in a surprisingly yawning battle. Totally out of the f'n randomness, the main female character gives her soul up to the good dragon and it becomes empowered and defeats the evil Iwugi. Then the good Iwugi flies up to heaven, and his girlfriend is dead. If you cared to even notice at this point, the main character is left alone in a demonic wasteland. How the hell is he going to get out? Where is he?! HORRIBLE FILM DON'T EVEN WASTE A BUCK AT THE LOCAL $1 THEATER 3 MONTHS LATER. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. I PAID REGULAR ADMISSION TO WARN THE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS MOVIE! (Don't even go to laugh at it, because you won't even laugh, you will be just in awe of how lame it is.)",

In the beginning when it flashes back to 500 years earlier, the last time the evil serpent attacked, it shows him and his followers destroying an entire village looking for the young girl. Where is the good serpent during this time? Twiddling his thumbs while these people are being annihilated? He's a heavenly serpent, yet he doesn't protect the people? Another thing, the movie has no business being named Dragon Wars. There is only ONE instance of dragons fighting in this movie, and that's at the very end. When this good serpent finally does show up, he is incapacitated after only a short time of fighting.The characters are naive and simple-minded. Throughout the entire movie, hundreds of people are being slaughtered and the entire city is being destroyed, and this Ethan guy only cares about saving his precious Sarah. His only idea to save the world or Sarah is to \"just keep running\". Apparently he can't get it through his head that this army chasing them has the ability to destroy everything,what makes him think he can escape? The evil serpent catches up to Ethan and Sarah several times, yet when he does, he just kind of growls at them. He eventually gets distracted and, alas, they escape again. It would appear the the evil serpent never did have the ability to take the Yeouijoo from Sarah, because in the end she releases it and gives it to the good serpent...The story line is too simple, and therefore this movie was unable to retain my attention for very long.

If you are seriously looking for a serious film that has a good plot line, don't watch it. I can tell you now, the story is laughably bad. The whole movie is unintentionally funny but is also very funny with its gags. So what you get from this movie is 90 minutes of non-stop unintentional with some intentional laughs with action!Now, usually, I say, \"Ignore how stupid the plot is; just go with it.\" In this case, I couldn't do that. The story is just so very bad...it fun to laugh at it, but not to go along with it as much so that you could enjoy the movie. For the special effects, they are undeniably great and the action scenes are visually extensive.There's no doubt if you want to have a fun time, you will.

The acting was a bit odd, (no, let's make that dull, and wooden) the villains came across as Power Rangeresque and just about as intelligent. Could this have been better? Yes, of course. A brief explanation at the beginning of the film (5 minutes tops) giving the legend and destiny of those involved would have saved a lot of dull bits in the film. Faster cuts in places would have helped in others. That being said, kids will probably like the action, and will most likely overlook the acting.

The acting is weak the fx in the movie is below a very low budget b-movie. Plus I don't like the racist over tone with the black guy being cocky and when they meet the Evil General who looks like a bad guy from power rangers. What does the black guy do pull out a gun!! Saying all black dudes carry guns? I think not. And what is up with the sword? why do they always have o do a close up when the Evil General takes it out epically with that cheap ass fx its like they are the first people to think of an idea like that\u0085.errm light sabre anyone? Then having the nurse have an attitude?? What's up with that \u0085don't think the makers of this move have heard of a term called racial profiling. How come Jack changes into each person and so happens to be in the right place at the right time to save them from the giant serpent!!!! In addition why does Jack speak in English and the Evil General Continues to speak in Korean? Was that an attempt to pull an Korean audience??? . Plus why do only a handful of people see it? I mean if something that big was tearing up the city you'd know about it !!! Then is the fact they make the FBI look foolish . Acting like noobs!!!! Not cool at all \u0085just wish I could go back in time and relive them 2hours watching paint dry!!!! Korean films are cool and are far more original than their Hollywood counterparts at the moment. I like the idea of Korean and American peeps coming together to make films but if they make this sort of drivel\u0085when I know I could write a better script with my left bum cheek!!!

The concept of \"fate\" might play important role in your society but it has very little role in Western tradition and definitely not this way. (In Western tradition every individual may have his individual fate - like Oidipus. But there is nothing like \"historical fate\" based on 1000 years old happenings for an individual. In Western tradition there is concept of \"free will\" way more prevalent. In non-reincarnation cultures the \"historical fate\" has no sense at all.) In the end we have C-class love story, short and unimaginative warfare scenes and bizarre fantasy army which destroys tanks and helicopters, because is probably made from pure magic (or whatever). Stupid story slowly descends into pure and absolutely incomprehensible chaos. The ending is probably from a completely different story, I guess some Korean fairy-tale. For me, an culturally not prepared common viewer, the ending simply does not exist. The story just ends somewhat and there are titles running. What has happened? What has happened to common folks on Earth? Was the ending good? Was the ending bad? Was it somewhat important? I really have no idea.Please save some time of yours and skip this movie.

            "content": "Compared to Shim's previous outing, we have a gigantic leap forward in every way imaginable. And if compared to a lot of the horrible monster films of the 60s, 70s and 90s which some people give so much credit to, D-War is by far a disappointing mess.The story, in my view wasn't bad at all, at least the prologue . We start with Ethan Kendrick (Cody Arens) and his father at an antique shop trying to sell a dagger to Jack (Robert Forster), who pretends to have a heart attack to talk to Ethan alone about the story of his destiny. Forster narrates the story well I thought, he tells of a good and a bad Imoogi (Korean dragons) who become celestial dragons if a girl with a certain mark on her shoulder, that appears every 500 years, is sacrificed to them, called Yeo-Yi-Joo. In 1507 Korea, the girl is born and a wizard/shaman named Bochun and his ward Haram are entrusted to protect her till her 18 or 20 birthday, which is when her power is activated. The bad Imoogi, Buraki and his Artox army (you heard right, ARTOX army) ravage the village or kingdom in search of her. However Haram and Yeo-Yi-Joo have fallen in love, being her life long protector, which we are assured by Forster should surprise no one (except apparently him and the king who ordered the whole mess together). as they flee for there lives rather than sacrifice her to the good Imoogi, Buraki chases them to a cliff, and rather than die by him, they jump, and die \"as star-crossed lovers\". Ethan is the re-incarnation of Haram, Jack of Bochun and an unknown girl which he must find (Sarah) who is Yeo-Yi-Joo, as the time for a new dragon war nears.Now that prologue is fine in my view, and had the film been about Haram and Yeo-Yi-Joo falling in love vs. following there proscribed destinies, an exploration of the strict caste systems of Feudalism vs. there ever growing tenderness, about Yeo-Yi-Joo's father (the King) and his grief at the death of his wife and the curse of his child, playing up the star-crossed lovers angle, and of course Giant snake fights and Artox armies with feudal age missiles, than this would have gone far and beyond the standard giant monster film, and even a very good film in general. But that would take a director with more talent (though something can be said for his work on action scenes) and a bit more courage to film for the sake of art rather than to score bank in the States (which is why the majority of the film is with American actors), and we have to have a reason for the snake and the Artox general to fight and chase Sarah and Ethan all over LA.Now from that statement you would get the notion that this is a terrible film, which it is, but it is because of things rather than despite (which I know is only different in how you organize a sentence but I think I can make a case for a bigger differentiation) , its horrible acting rather than despite good acting makes things easier to forgive, because it means there is some untainted qualities to like about a film. If you tell your friend \"the movie would have been great if it wasn't for the...\" it means there was something there to enjoy, but if you say \"even though it had (insert positive remark) it sucked\" it means whatever good quality it had was nullified by something overlapping and worse.By far the worst aspect, was the acting, which makes sense, Shim's not a great director, and like anyone who isn't bi-lingual in said languages you cant really tell if what your actors are saying came off as over-the-top, cheesy, slurred, awkward and like Nick Adams in \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" your likely to be directed into hamming it up pretty strong. The second nail is the plot after Forster finishes talking, it goes nowhere and fast, it pretty much boils down to excuses for the snake to chase from location to location smashing things. By this point plots are pointless and intrusive, but they intrude anyway with revelations which add nothing, a love story which is anti-compelling, and federal officers running about for a quasi sub plot that goes nowhere in an anti climactic anything-but-tense moment in an empty garage. Altogether, considering the type of film and the obvious state of mind you go to these movies for, you'll hate part of it, the subordinate part (story, plot, human characters, any attempts at blossoming relationships) and love the rest (the dragons, battles, the inevitable monster clash winner-take-all ending to save the world).There is one thing that can be said for Shim, his determination to make quality CGI without Hollywood, entirely in Korea. I think in years to come Korea will thank the work done here by Younggu-Art's for making Korean action/fantasy films able to compete with America, Britain and Japan, and they might very well become a sort of Asian Pixar out of there achievements here.This is the kind of film you watch with your friends, pointing out the plot holes like hidden message Easter eggs (of which there is no short supply) and being dumb founded by some of the more impossible leaps of even fictional faith and the least convincing effects (the dead elephant, the entire bridge scene). The kind of film you hope to be pleasantly surprised by or nostalgia with quality explosions. The more I've seen it and thought about it the more my disdain for the worst parts turn into welcomed additions. The kind of film you go into shouting \"D-War! woo!\".A sincere 7 out of 10",

Most of the CGs in the past Korean films has been done in Korea as well. Korean CG making is not at a very low level, they have quite a lot of demand and experience due to the prosperity of online game-making and film-making. Of course nowhere near at Hollywood level mainly due to much lower funding, but not that bad either. What separates this film and the previous ones were that MUCH more money and effort was invested to CG(there were hardly any films before in Korea that had used CG anywhere as much as this one), and that's what made some fanatics of this film think it is something revolutionary(for Korea that is). But again, I think they should realize that being revolutionary in Korea hardly means anything to the world.My advice: Watch this only if you plan to see it with your kids.",

CG could not save this film, as far as that go's nothing could save this film. Bad story line, bad acting and not very impressive CG. The story line jumped around and gave you no real feel for this movie. The actors were second rate on all counts and would have been better with Japanese actors wit sub titles or at least equal. CG had many mistakes in it, they tried to use the blur effect to demonstrate fast moving animation and it just made my eyes hurt. Don't go pay for this very poorly done and obviously rushed film. I think it will be on video in the next month or so. In the bargain bin in 3 months, not that it will justify a rental or even a 1.99 purchase. It might have made a good anime cartoon, but not a movie. You will feel riped off if money leaves your pocket for this one.",

I thought the film really respected our intelligence by expecting us to understand Korean, but they must have just forgotten to dub in dialog or enter subtitles. Why exactly heroes from 1507 Korea would be reincarnated in Los Angeles is never cleared up. Nor is it clear why they would all be reincarnated in the same vicinity and period. Apparently there's a batch mode.I watched this film on line after seeing a mention of the special effects, and they are indeed impressive. The problem I had with Reign of Fire was I wanted to see the battle, not the post-apocalyptic aftermath. You get the battle here. Big lumbering beasts of burden are reminiscent of the Gungan beasts in Phantom Menace, and some of the attack bugs in Starship Troopers. And as many reviewers note, the finale takes place in Mordor.The thing is, with about fifteen more minutes for decent plot transitions, continuity and hole filling, this could actually have been a pretty decent film.

I give 6 here. 1 for supporting the korean movie industry. 1 for graphic. 1 for action. 3 for unintentionally funny moments. This movie had potential to be great. Story-line, graphic, action scene were there. What was missing was a good script and acting. Script was cheesy and acting was soo horrible. It has funny moment here and there. Well, I have thing for the bad movie. It's unintentionally funny because it's so bad. You know what I am getting at? Anyways... I read some of the comments and it's not a Chinese legend. It's Koreans'. Don't confuse those. Oh... There were some ridiculous things through out the movie. I don't know why there were cannons mounted on those creatures. Also, I don't know why the hell there were an army of dark. They were sure not in the legend. I don't know why the director decided to put in the mythical lord of ring-ish creatures in there. Anyways... if you seat through the whole movie, it isn't that bad. Acting and script is soo bad it's funny. However, action and graphic makes up for it. If you like bad movie, go watch it. If you have kids, go watch it since I think it's targeted to more to kids. Otherwise, just wait until it comes out in the blockbuster or dollar theater. Oh... if you are Korean... go watch it for heck of it. Hope this movie doesn't speak for all the Korean movies that are out there. There are some great ones. For example... I will list some that you should check it out. It doesn't compare to the D-War. 1. Tae Guk Gi - Brotherhood of War 2. Welcome to DongMakGol 3. The Host 4. Oldboy 5. Oasis 6. 3-Iron 7.

Second there were way too many things that went unexplained.Like how the bad guy, the girl with the mark, the boy who protects her, and his mentor can all come back via reincarnate, that should have been explained for people not familiar with the concept and the mythology that surrounds it. Than when the guy gets knocked out and then wakes up in some medieval castle like area it's like OK and where exactly is this place? Than he gets ready to escape with the girl, I'm all like dude how do you know where to go idiot? You were knocked out when got you there. Do you even know what continent you're on?How is it no one noticed this big castle in this day in age? How was the bad guy able to raise an entire army from the scrolls found laying casually around in the shopkeep's store? If they were that powerful why didn't he protect them better? I could go on and on here as far as unanswered questions I mean plot holes are abound in this thing.I'll leave with this, why would a father for $1,000 leave his son alone with a storekeep that he doesn't know to travel only God knows how far to some store to tell another storekeep something so he could get the money. Granted in the movie the storekeep is telling the boy a story (whilst he's gotta him all alone) about serpents but at anytime he could've been like and now little Timmy I must show you the most powerful serpent of them all and just whipped it out! Not cool I know there had to be many parents in the theater going NOOOOOOO!

I am going out of my way to write scathing reviews on multiple movie sites today (even though professional critics have ripped it, I'm still going to review it). Dragon Wars did not have good CG; go onto a Peer-2-Peer file sharing community and find some 5 minute short animations that have no point and are free/legal for trading and you will see some good CG that serves no other purpose than to get that creator's name out into the world and they far surpass what \"D-War\" has put out. Here, I'll shorten this up a bit by saying \"D-War\" was likely created by some people with a little extra money to spend and WAY too much time on their hands that had heard some legend or just an old dragon story somewhere and thought they'd make a movie out of it. I couldn't get online last night and had nothing else to watch, otherwise I would have stopped. Now that I have thrown this 2 hours of my life away into limbo, I hope I can spare you the same fate. Let me go so far as to argue against other user reviews: this movie is not a good kids movie, not a casual adult movie, and it was not \"something to blow time on a rainy Saturday.\" Read a book on you rainy Sat. before you bother watching this travesty of a film.

Very Hard. The main girl has the Yu YI Ju in her, but it really comes down from heaven on he 20th birthday. When that happens she dies. The main dude get sad but he gets better by the end.

The aforementioned weak story and other things i said were still there and the problems everybody seems to have with it seem to stem from their expectations, when they saw it, they expected to see a masterpiece, when I saw it, I just wanted it not to suck, or they saw it in theaters and paid to see it, boy, that would've sucked badly and I sympathize! I caught this basically for free on satellite, so my expectations were low, I didn't lose much other than an hour or so from my hectic life, and I got to spend that time with my dad, so my experience was totally different from others and I and my dad were quite pleased.All in all this movie's great if you aren't expecting more than a relaxing hour or so, don't pay money, or sit in a dusty movie theater seat.

Instead of trying to avoid the upcoming danger he takes his hands over his head to protect himself. If you really have time to put your arms...Some other stuff: Who was the genius that put a swat-team up on a 300 meter high building, to fire down at enemies with their what, MP40's? Or did I see wrong? A pilot shots two missiles that tracks a small dragon and kills it, can you really lock on target on something that isn't made of metal? Even worse, at a time, some other swat-team runs into a cave led by this waving captain, following him closely like a bunch of school kids running into Mc'Donalds. They stop and scream like children and run out. What exactly did they expect to find inside the cave? At another scene there is a pilot who shots at a small flying dragon with his small revolver, shooting through his own windshield? And the doctor, who makes this hypnosis, is he actually talking to her while she is asleep? Or did I misunderstand? If U.S could get tanks into the city, why on earth didn't they get warplanes or bomb-planes or anything, effective since the enemy was walking on a straight line.I just love the classic pilot radio line, \"I can't see them.\" when there are like 200 dragons flying all over the city.I believe the main character being shot and keeps on like nothing, is already written about, and the paper-thin love-story.Well thanks if you read it, my first time writing here.

As you can imagine by now, instead of enjoying an action packed movie, you spend the entire time throwing your hands in the air, thinking how stupid the plot is or how much effort was put into it and wondering how no one thought it was a waste of time.",

While all three of us couldn't wait for the movie to be over, (and when it finally was, we stormed out to get something to eat) we could hear clapping, whispers of praise from the audience behind us.i've given a 1 outta 10 for the following reasons 1. i truly believe that's what the movie is worth... at MOST 2. to counter-balance all the people that gave 10 outta 10, not based on the quality of the movie but for the face that it came from their country 3. Made me waste $6, 1-2 hours of time in Korea during summer break\"The Host\", \"Old boy\" are both korean movies that are A lot better than this.And to respond to some of the comments given on this movie saying it reached an overwhelming record of views in Korea, it was because this movie was advertised so vigorously on all korean channels every freakin' 10 minutes before and during the show in the theaters in Korea. with such overrated comments about this movie in the newspapers and the media saying \"Ground breaking computer graphics!\", \"Epic Sci-Fi film of our nation!\" and no im not joking/lying. maybe they don't understand what Sci-fi means?anyways... /end rant",

It does not explain how all the different monsters show op in the USA.The logic in this movie is absent most of the time. Jumping from scene to scene is often erratic. Why are we here, now, and how did we arrive here.Example... Why would a team of heavily armed and geared-up policemen run on a beach towards a cave, stop at the edge of a ravine, wait for a monster, be scared of the monster, run away without shooting, run out of the cave, and then start shooting.Or... Why would our hero at one point need a car and go to max speed to escape from an attack by the main monster, while a couple of minutes later he can do it by simply running.The dialogue is minimal and mostly simple. Things are explained in a silly mythical way that makes no sense at all, like something else is explained. Things happen without explanation beforehand nor afterwards.The monsters in D-War can be compared with the monsters in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. The special effects are quite nice, but are of TV quality, not big screen quality (like LotR, Godzilla or King Kong).",

The acting is all decent, better than the Star Wars Prequels. The action scenes and special effects are frickin awesome! I thought it has some of the best \"giant monster attacks city\" battle sequences I have ever seen and the last 20-30 min are non-stop fun.The scenes filmed in Korea are beautiful and very well done. The costumes and sets used are first rate. My biggest question is why they decided to set most of it in the USA. It would have worked better if the whole movie took place in Korea.It's all about expectations. I heard this movie sucked, I lowered my expectations and I loved it.

The writing and script seemed to be very well done. Sadly, I'm sure that there are a few scenes on the editing room floor that would have helped the plot line. Backstory was provided in an enjoyable format so you don't have to know anything about the Korean folklore to understand the movie. The acting was above average for a film where the concepts were translated from Korean into U.S. concepts. There are a few things in the movie that we North American citizens probably just won't ever grasp very well. That's really just a gut feeling and I can't justify it.

            "content": "This movie is just terrible from start to finish. I am going to spoil it for some folks. Where do I begin? Well, first of all, the storyline makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Basically, it focuses on some ritual where a young woman has some birthmark and when she turns 20, she must be sacrificed to a giant snake in order for that snake to be turned into a dragon. There are two giant snakes. Each one is supported by a clan. The good one is named Imugi and the evil one is named Buraki. Our Protagonist, Ethan Kendrick meets and falls in love with a 19 year old girl who bares this birthmark. Supposedly, Sarah is part of this so-called \"ritual\".Throughout the whole movie, Ethan and Sarah are basically just running away from a giant snake and armed lizards. Nothing really happens in the movie and when something does happen it just seems pointless.At times, the plot feels unorganized and unfocused. For instance, Our protagonist has a flashback to when he was a child and opens this box and a light comes out of it. What did that have to do with anything? Also, there is this fat guy, unrelated to the story, who witnesses Buraki and goes and tells everyone about what he saw. Of course they think he's crazy, so they tie him up. Again, what did that have to do with anything? In the final act, Sarah turns 20 and she and Ethan eventually get spotted by Buraki's clan and are taken to their place. I will admit the setting and tone here is pretty neat and impressive. It's like the creators of the film put all of their effort on this one scene and then just got lazy while making the rest of the film. It's like they made the whole movie just for this final scene.Moving on, Ethan and Sarah are tied up and Sarah is about to be sacrificed to Buraki while Ethan is powerless to stop it. Then, out of nowhere, Imugi shows up and the two giant snakes have a showdown. Ethan eventually frees himself and Sarah. Sarah then realizes that the only way that Buraki can be defeated is for Sarah to be sacrificed to Imugi. In doing so, Sarah controls an orb thing and gets Imugi to bite the orb and then Sarah dies. Imugi is then transformed into a dragon and destroys Buraki. Imugi leaves and our hero Ethan is left stranded in the desert. The end. Yep, that's the whole movie right there. I just saved you 90 minutes of your life.Also, the CGI effects are downright awful even for 2007 standards. Let's just say that Sony PS1 and Nintendo 64 had better graphics than this.On a positive note, I liked the concept of the film. I think the name \"Dragon Wars\" deserves a better movie.",

I would take Dragon Wars.I know the weak part of Dragon Wars - an awkward script.But, I can understand it because I know the fact that the director Shim first wrote it in his native Korean and let a translator put it directly into English. ( Not adaptation but translation) So, there's some cultural gap in dialog custom and the way of talking because the script was compiled directly from foreign mindset.Those who have a good sense of language would find this script very experimental and those who haven't would be annoyed by short, dry and compact conversations which are made in English between Americans.Except the script and bad acting basically derived by the awkward script, everything else is awesome. Storyline is beautiful,and action is literally blockbuster itself.I saw the Bourne Ultimatum yesterday and it was very lame for me. Just a runaway and tracers. Very simple, no story if the viewpoint of those who say there's no plot in Dragon Wars is applied.I was very bored during watching the Bourne Ultimatum and so annoyed by incessantly shaking cameras.Resident Evil? Did you see the lame graphics when the birds fly? If you can overcome the crude script with open mind, you can enjoy Dragon Wars.I have some excuses for the actors who are being blamed for bad acting.Just imagine you wrote a scenario in English and translated it into Korean and casted Korean actors. If your movie is on screen in Korea, Korean audiences will find it unnatural and say 'acting was terrible'.This movie is foreign in nature.

Funny..when the black guy wanted to shoot the man in armor and he kept firing at his shield.Funny when tanks fired dozens of times but none of them hit the creatures.Funny when every time the dragon finally found Sarah it kept roaring at her until she got away. I guess monsters have to roar for a while before any further action. So typical!Funny when in the end Nathan screamed Sarah's name and a light beamed out of the jewelry he had on his chest and they all died/vanished suddenly except for 2. I guess to make it end somehow. I guess they wanted to make that moment a little touching when he screamed her name out of love lol...but they failed. Oh and it was funny when that armored man wanted to stab nathan, he stabbed the jewelry or whatever that thing was...and he simply died..lol i guess it was luck.That's just what i remember...there are more of those...And it wasn't sad that she died in the end...i don't think anyone could've felt emotional about it.

The arirang part at the end screamed inferiority complex on part of Mr Shim. Plus, I've been reading some of the reviews and there are comments on the number of years it took to make this pretty crappy movie.

But the good graphics will be my only positive remark about this South Korean import (that I saw in Spanish - quite the international experience). I assumed this movie was based on a comic book, but either way, this film might've been overlooked in the multiplexes chock-full of movies adapted from every comic book except \"Archie.\" (I'm sure there'll be one; the TV movie from over a decade ago where Archie & friends grow up ain't worth braggin' about.) But back to the dragon movie. Again the graphics were good & those monsters would've made some pretty cool toys. But the story of a journalist accompanying a poor, tortured young lady on a wild adventure 'cause she's the reason for those dragons terrorizing Los Angeles seems silly & necessary only to display those kickass dragons. Surprisingly, there are some familiar faces who aren't lead actors: Craig Robinson, Retta, & Billy Gardell. They now appear respectively in \"The Office,\" \"Parks & Recreation,\" & \"Mike & Molly.\" In conclusion, \"Dragon Wars: D-Wars\" is best watched on TV w/ the volume turned up when the cool scenes are on. But anytime you see scenes with dialogue such as the suits trying to deal w/ this dragon disaster, adjourn to the kitchen or bathroom, but leave the television on when the monsters return.",

Both leading roles have no skill at all, too milky. However, the special effect of Dragon is fantastic, and scenes that fly dragons tracing chopper as well. I think 5 of 7 mark gives to visual part. The evil side was too strong when confront with modern army. Kind of old Dune stuff that could shield bullet, first time seen in films. Those moving giant rocket carrier, very superior for Hollywood. Maybe the idea is coming from S.Korean games or Blizzard's famous game \"Warcraft\".",

Also, how did they raise and feed such a massive army? It astounds me! History rocks! My wife and I walked out of this movie and got our money back after the beach kissy scene.

            "content": "During the sneak preview of this movie (which was included in the bonus feature of the DVD),Hyung-rae Shim, the director, said that this movie \"Dragon Wars\" made him proud to be a Korean. But what is there to be proud about this movie? This movie simply reminds me of the ridiculous TV series \"Power Rangers.\" Just for the sole purpose of appealing to American audience, Haim Saban and Shuki Levy, the producers of \"Power Rangers\" glued together ridiculously incompatible Japanese TV show with some American footages filled with mediocre to horrible acting by performers like David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson. Shim essentially did exactly the same thing. Because he wanted to make money in the US--which he candidly admitted in his sneak preview speech --Shim made \"Dragon Wars,\" a ridiculous combination of some Korean folk legend with some ridiculous acting and outrageously stupid storyline in the style of the worst of Hollywood. Why would a Korean hero sword fighter reincarnate as a nerdy American journalist in Los Angeles? Why would a Korean maiden with magical power reincarnate as a young, blond Amerian woman in Los Angeles? That was done for the sole purpose of appealing to American audience. The director apparently did not care about this implausibility in the storyline. The director also did not care about a major goof. The boy who played Jason Behr as a child of about ten has blue eyes. However, Jason Behr has hazel-brown eyes. Eye color does not change from age ten to age thirty. That is biologically close to impossible!!Just for the sole purpose of appealing to American adolescents and young adults (who are the target audience), director Shim glued together elements from many successful movies from various countries. The dragons reminded me of Godzilla. The villains reminded me of villains from Power Rangers and Lord of the Rings. The villains' attack on Los Angeles reminded me of the battle scenes from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. The young Korean hero and his master reminded me of various Chinese martial art movies. This movie was just a rip-off of these successful movies. In spite of his boastful speech during the sneak preview, Shim's work showed nothing unique or creative. This movie proves conclusively that artificially gluing together elements from various successful movies does not create a unique or successful movie. It was a disastrous failure.If one wants to see a unique monster movie from South Korea, I recommend \"The Host\" which is much more unique, creative and enjoyable.",

            "content": "The title pretty much sums it up. The movie's premise, now that I've seen it (I had heard how horrible it was, enough so not to spend any money to see it, but hey, the library's free), actually seemed to have a good deal of promise. Actually, if the company and/or director really wanted too, they could probably make a good remake.Although, the script would need a major overhaul... Honestly, B-movies are allowed to have clich\u00e9s, it's what makes them B-movies, but the \"let's give the back story by having the main character suddenly remember something as he's writing, and have him introduce it to us slowly, explaining exactly what he's doing before he does it\"... That's just sloppy writing... And come on... Evil snake is about to eat the girl, and another snake rushes in and stops the first snake. \"That's the good one,\" says mister poorly acted main character...No, really? Darn, I never would have guessed that... It's not like they introduced it in the whole sloppily introduced back story thingy... Oh, wait...Speaking of the acting, yeah, that needs some help too... Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the old man and the sidekick. But the main characters reminded me of daytime soap...Going back to the script (it's what really needed help), the army uses some heavy artillery. I can see maybe the first wave getting wiped out by the ancient soldiers, but by the second, they'd be using armor piecing rounds, and no magical tin shield is going to stop that.Not to say that the writing was all bad. The old lady walking into the fence made me laugh and I wish the zoo guard would have been brought back (although, why wouldn't anyone believe him? He says a giant snake ate the elephants, did anyone bother to check on Dumbo? Course not...).I could go on and on, so I'm just going to tie this up. The premise holds promise (onamonapia :P ), but the script definitely would need an overhaul and some different actors would have to be be brought in.",

These creatures are quite \"real\", especially the last dragon's motion that \"truly\" behaves like an oriental dragon. The human fighting is also attractive too. The master suddenly shot fire from his hand & jump over water so \"naturally\" that you won't notice he is hanging by wire. Some big kung fu movies can't even match these.

Personally, I don't think that's something to be proud of.This movie was simply awful. I tried to give it a decent chance. I swear. But the acting was painful to watch. Jason Behr looks like a poor man's Milo Ventimiglia. A VERY poor man. I'd rather watch Hayden Christensen read Mad Libs for 90 minutes. And he was one of the better ones. None of them, not a one, could muster any sort of sympathy, pathos, feeling from me. The CGI might be the best ever from Korea, but I've had more fun watching cut scenes in video games.The plot was confusing. I know there were two dragons, one good, one evil. They were trying to get the Yu-Gi-Oh, or something like that, to turn into a real dragon and get to heaven (why an evil dragon wants to go to heaven is something for future generations to discuss). But assuming the good one got up there the first time, what happens to the bad one? It seemed to me like the good one wasn't about to jump in back in 1507 to fight the bad one, so if the sacrifice had worked, and the good dragon got to Heaven, what happens to the bad one? I guess it's tough luck, humans, try your best to invent the gigantic mongoose before Imoogi-Vader eats you all.The D in the abbreviated title stands for Deux Ex Machina. As in, man, things are stuck, so let's kick the pinball machine and get the film going again.Oh yeah, that reminds me of the old stranger I met who happened to give me an invulnerability necklace... oh yeah, that old guy just showed up to give us a ride... oh yeah, my television camera man friend has an internet scanning program that can find every 19 year old woman named Sarah with a dragon tattoo in the LA area... oh yeah, the random guy who just walked over to my desk just happened to have seen the exact woman I am looking for, saving me from visiting 2700 girls before a giant snake thing turns the LA Zoo into a buffet... oh yeah, I happen to have a professor friend who can make you remember your past lives... The script on this thing was, I am convinced, written by a pair of eight-year-olds who happened to tip over their toy box one day. Kid 1: \"My guy is a ninja warrior who was trained by a master with magical powers who flies.\"Kid 2: \"Oh yeah? Well, my guy is a bad guy with a sword that grows when he wants it to, like on Thundercats. And he has an army of armored ninjas.\"Kid 1: \"Oh yeah? Well, my guys have cannons on the walls of their fortress, and they can blow up your guys from a mile away.\"Kid 2: \"Well, my guys have dragons that can fly. And other dragons that have rocket launchers on their backs.\"Kid 1: \"Nu-uh!\"Kid 2: \"Uh-huh!\"Kid 1: \"Well, there's a big dragon that lives in the water that will help my guys.\"Kid 2: \"Yeah, but my dragon got there first, and ate your ninja.\"Kid 1: \"No, because he jumped to his death and got reborn 500 years later as that guy from Heroes. And he has a magic necklace that makes him bulletproof, and the army helps him.\"Kid 2: \"That's cheating!\"It was worth spending the 10 bucks on, because I'll always know how bad a movie this is. If I hadn't, I'd have always wondered if it had any merit. I paid the 10 bucks to find out it DIDN'T.",

The story was idiotic and was sometimes to simple and sometimes to complex,the acting was dull,complete with blank expressions and dry line delivery and the film lacks logic or anything resembling brains. For instance there is a scene where a fortress city is under attack by a huge army complete with giant lizards monsters(dragons?)with cannons on their back. They blow apart the wall and invade. Now these creature are extremely slow and I mean slow(a 98 year old granny with arthritis is faster) yet when one guy falls down about 15 feet in front of one he doesn't have enough time to get up and run away,he just lies there and gets crushed.This action scene also looks really cheap,complete with swords that don't cut into bodies when they are slashed and cause people to twist in odd directions when slain.Then when the army is done and has captured a very important person,I wont say who it really doesn't matter,they only send about 50 guys to escort her rather than the hundreds they had to spare. On top of that some old guy comes flying through the air(literally) waves his had and blows up like 18 of them and the proceeds to have a hand to hand fight with the remaining guards and looses! If he could blow people up by waving his hand why didn't he do it to everyone,maybe I just wasn't paying attention. And the dragons themselves are pretty idiotic to. They can chase and keep up with cars going 80 mph but when chasing humans become incredibly slow.I could go on all day about how idiotic,boring and lame this movie is but that would be a complete waste of our precious time on this earth. To put it simply this is and incredibly dumb action movie that provides no entertainment due to poor acting and a horrid script and bad action. Avoid at all costs unless you want to see a terrible movie",

One is a racist stereotype. When he dies, nobody notices. The holes were enormous. The acting was... how do I say this... oh, I don't know. Bad? The effects were mostly good, considering the budget. But the end sequence looked like it was made in the 80s. The army techniques are based on the needs of special effects, like shooting at a dragon with a handgun through a helicopter window, or shooting dragons perched on the side of a civilian building, probably killing everybody inside.I hereby discount it as a serious film, and it is my favorite comedy.

(or something like that, cause honestly the film was so confusing with twists and uncleared dialogs.) So this young woman knows that and does everything she can to 'stay-safe'. Then there's this reporter kid who, since he was young, knows he's got to protect this woman from the evil henchman that want the evil dragon to rule.

The director has put through so much because he was always just considered to be \"COMEDIAN\". But he truly was the best of all comedians in Korea. I really admire Director Shim. I hope you guy too. PLease accept the kind of different image film than Americans. There were new actors and actresses and They didn't have millions of dollars to make the movie. Please support this movie. It is truly amazing. Director Shim has shed his tears and sweat on this film for 10 years.Korea FIGHTING. and D-WAR FIGHTING. (fighting means like GO GO GO)",

This movie packs a punch as a Dragon movie and as an action piece, and I advise anybody who enjoys either to watch it. For those of you b*tching, please quit, this movie definitely served its purpose. There is only one gripe I have about watching this movie and that is the cover.

It was made in Korea and for that, I give very high credit!Who ever saying negatives about this or any other movies, Please~~~.If you are looking for Ammy Award Movies, you are in wrong line of category. Remember, this is SCI-FI (with some legend based and most of them are), not like Gone with Wind.This movie was made for FUN viewing not to make you think about humanity or leave sentimental value.If you want to enjoy nice CG and Sound Effect, any fantasy or sci-fi film will get you there, regardless the story line.Talk about story line, what do you expect? Sci-Fi is Sci-Fi. You don't expect George Lucas or Steven Spielburg to make all the movies, do you? And you will not watch or criticize all other makers?Give me a break.Is everyone riding Mercedez? no, we ride Ford, Pontiac, or Japan made.Same thing.I go see movie to enjoy and thank each director and actors for what they did and their dedication.As long and I enjoy and my kids have terrificcccc funnn, that is all I count.For those who are negatives, yeh, you know life is not always fair or is it?Start thinking positives and be thankful that there are people who are willing to make and do better.I give 9/10 for FUN and Good time.

People are acting like it came to their house and beat up their mother.No, D-War hearkens back to the days of yore, when special effects laden monster movies, filled to the brim with crazy ideas and \"exotic\" mysteries of foreign cultures would fill the shelves at your local video store.Sure, the plot is a jumbled, convoluted mess, filled with tired clich\u00e9s about \"chosen ones\" and \"you can't escape your destiny\"s. Hell, it even has that staple of 50's creature features, where a native person is dragged away while maniacally telling anyone who'll listen that \"the beast has wakened\" and to \"heed my warning or we're all doomed!\".It's a silly movie, with a silly plot, that is actually far more simple that it appears: There's a girl and the bad guys want her and our destined hero has to protect her. That's it.But D-War knows what a genre audience want: Lots and lots of action scenes and monsters. And you'll be hard pressed to mention a movie that packs as many monsters, explosions and action into an hour and a half movie, as D-War does.There are no Oscars on the horizon for D-War. But it's mindless entertainment, so grab a bucket of popcorn, a gallon of soda and be prepared to get blow away by the very impressive special effects and breathtaking action sequences that take up the latter half of the movie. Say what you will about director Hyung-rae Shim, but he is an impressive visual artist.If you enjoy the kind of cheesy monster movies where giant monsters rampage through cities and battle the military with massive destruction as a result, this is your movie. You know who you are.I certainly enjoyed it far more that Michael Bay's awful Transformers or Roland Emmerich's atrocious Godzilla. And so should you.",

Not to mention the very bad acting. The only thing that's good in the movie (and barely at all) is the special effects, and everyone knows that that doesn't sell a movie, a great story does.To begin with the flashback had a flashback (just kill me right there). Then the main character is a news reporter. I don't have anything about news reporters being main character heroes, but his position seems to get him to places I highly doubt a real reporter would be allowed to tread. No one questions him or confronts him about what he's doing or where his train of thought is leading, they just follow along for the ride. Conflict is story. Who wrote this load of crap? About two thirds into the movie do you only see the \"monsters\" in current time (they were shown in the flashback, but big deal). And the flashback is misleading. It tells you there are good dragons and bad ones. Not once did I see good dragons coming to the rescue to fight the bad one and it isn't even a dragon yet, it's a snake.I finally walked out 20 minutes before the ending. I just couldn't take it anymore. Maybe the good dragon made an appearance at the end to take a curtain call and kill the main character.

Does it deliver? Nope, sadly. There's like one dragon in the whole film, there's no dragon-on-dragon fights and the dragons look crap (they don't even breath fire!).

Nothing in this film can be taken seriously. The acting is corny (not bad, just corny), the plot is impossible to follow, the storyboard is all over the place, and the dialog is just plain strange. I found myself laughing during most of this film because of it.The CGI isn't that bad, nor are most of the action scenes. I find them quasi-epic.Perhaps my biggest complaint is how loosely connected things occur during the story. D-War begins with a 15 minute explanation of an old Korean legend and how the male protagonist, Ethan must find a girl with a dragon tattoo that is about to turn 20 and protect her. Apparently they are the reincarnations of the characters originally involved in the legend. That part is okay, but the execution of the events that happen in the present are just cooky.A giant CGI snake shows up and starts looking for the girl whilst destroying LA. An ancient army rises out of nowhere and follows suit. That very army, despite being 500 some years old manages to beat the hell out of our modern military. Not only that but in one scene, Ethan gets shot while protecting the girl. He gets right back up and says, \"I'm OK\". WTF? Oh yeah, and the whole dragon wars thing really only lasts for 2 or so minutes. The bad dragon (or inoogi) fights the good dragon (inoogi) towards the end of the film, nowhere else...This whole movie was one giant \"WTF?\". But I enjoyed its absurdness. It reminded me of the original \"The Blob\" from the 1950's. That was a strange film and this one is right up there.Honestly, this isn't a horrible film. It made me laugh, hard, very hard. The old Asian style action is there, chock-full of Dragonball style energy beams and explosions for no reason. Speaking of Dragonball, I was also reminded of the live-action Dragonball film, \"Dragonball: The Magic Begins\". Look it up, you'll see the similarities in story and so bad its good film making.Cheers.",

Blaming for all from heaven is the way Korean movies start things but why the director and scriptwriter didn't realise that it's so fantastic and not interesting.Further more, it was so surprising for me to see Korean feudal army fights with the dark force which is totally a copy of ancient western army about costume. This weird combination is so sick and didn't work at all.2. Special effects and script Special effects for the movie is good, really really good. I have no complaint about this aspect. Unfortunately special effect is only thing make this movie a movie, otherwise it's nothing.Not yet, the movie contains the crazy and stupid script that I've ever known.

There's no Korean legend about a girl sacrificed every 500 hundred years for a snake transforming into a dragon, or any other purpose, period. The small flying dragons with wings have no place in a Korean or any other eastern legend, they are from a western legend, if any. The creature with a rocket launcher on its back? Give me a break. They are more likely based on legends of Star Wars. The only relevant legend is that Korea, like any other eastern Asian country, has a legend about a dragon and a saying that an old snake transforms into a dragon. But, a 50-foot snake? That comes from King Kong.Director Shim is a marketing guru. When he was questioned about incoherent script/story line of his movie, he said that his movie, dragon war, is not for the local Korean audience, it is targeting the American market and American people. Shim said that Americans mostly don't care about movie script or story lines. Shim repeatedly mentioned that American movies like \"Lord of Rings\" or \"Spiderman\" didn't have a good story line but made a huge revenue in the US market.He was quite right. Dragon war was #5 movie in the first week in the US. Shim already said that, based on the success of dragon wars in the US market, many major distributors are asking him about dragon wars 2 and he is considering releasing dragon war 2 in 2009 summer, the main movie season, directly competing against other major Hollywood movies.Shim is a very shrewd business man and his movies are all about making money.",

Some action at the beginning, some action at the end, and in the middle not that much...Why do they have to tell me the whole story in the first 5 minutes? Never heard about SUSPENSE? This movie basically tells a story based on a Korean Legend, in which every 500 years a good and evil snake fight each other to become a dragon. Why? We don't know... This can happen trough the sacrifice of a selected 20 years old girl (she doesn't need to be virgin, just 20...modern times...) because she has something magic inside hear. There is also a chosen man who has the task to protect that girl (without knowing who she is...). This guy is interpreted by Jason Behr. Jason Behr has the charm of smashed potatoes and the emotionality of a piece of white paper. There's no difference if he orders a burger at McDonalds or he tells Sarah (the 20 year old magic girl) that he loves here... During the \"emotional\" scene where they kiss each other his eyes are covered by his hairs, probably the director realized that he isn't able to have any facial expressions... not good for an actor... The story is boring. The whole middle part is full of nonsense, scenes that don't tell anything (e.g. the guy working in the zoo, was that supposed to be serious?). What about the scene with the FBI and the president, how silly was that.... I couldn't figure out what this movie is: is it a sci-fi movie, action movie or a fairy-tale? Probably the director didn't know also... OK, a 12 year old child would have fun looking this movie. Flying animals, explosions, magical lights and stuff showing up here and there... There are a lot of special effects and visual effects (special=analog, visual=digital; for all non experts ;-) in this movie. Sometimes they worked more or less, other times they looked crappy. The scene where the Korean village is attached by the villains in parts cold be out of a video game. And the variety of animation wasn't amazing. Especially the mass-scenes looked bad. I will just explain one scene to show the character of this movie: A guy starts shooting at the evil guy. The evil guy let appear from nowhere a little tiny shield. Why does the black guy shoot exactly in the middle of that little tiny shield instead of his lower torso, the legs?!? The movie is full off scenes of people doing irrational stupid things. I hate that.Anyway I give this movie 3 points, 2 of them only because of the stylish opening animation, 2 more points for the silly action (1 point has to be subtract for bad bad acting)",

That is on top of my movie clich\u00e9, the girl born with a mark that shows she is the predestined girl to save the world. Oh, did I mention her predecessor was a Korean, yes, a princess from some 10,000 miles away country who, in real life, was as familiar as Kim Chee to the actress.Yes, even though it was quite fun to laugh at the ridiculous acting talent from that Behr dude, the ultra cheesy storyline and creatures that came straight from an online RPG game, this movie should have stayed inside that stupid ancient Korean box from whence the shinning light chose the young Jason Behr as the world's savior from a Korean Dragon.

Just because you have decent special effects doesn't mean you'll have a hit movie. The story meandered horribly and the acting was non-existent. I firmly believe that most action films should be taken with a large grain of salt, but this one just fails miserably. Too bad they wasted a decent budget and credible effects on this drivel. \"Reign of Fire\" dealt with dragons and although it too was flawed, it succeeded more than this. It's sad to see some actors sleepwalking through a film for a paycheck and Hollywood wasting money on a sub-par film simply because they think with CGI they'll turn a profit. Better luck next time.",

The special effects is really good and the real dragon in the last scene is really wonderful. The East Asia dragon is different from the evil western dragon.It's a mythical creature with a huge snake-like body covered in fish scales, and adorned with horns, a beard, claws and feet.This dragon can bring the rain to the earth and the people are grateful to that. This legend is originated from China and spread to Korean peninsula and other parts of East Asia. At the end of the movie we hear the traditional Korean folk song and it's really beautiful.

But this is one of the few dragon films I have seen recently that has held my interest and has gripped me all the way through the film. I can understand why some people think that it is a very tough film to grasp the storyline, but I think it helps watching a few dragon films before this one, and having a liking for dragons, otherwise you may be completely confused. It is a matter of opinion, but I feel that this is a version of Romeo and Juliet with a few monsters along the way. Tragic story. Check. Star crossed lovers. Check. Tragic ending. Check. I was a bit out put by the ratings on here but when I actually saw it, I thought 'What are these people thinking? This is actually really good.'

            "review_title": "A movie for the true multi-cultural or Asian, apparently not for Americans.",
            "content": "It amazes me just how American some of you reviewers can be. I specifically say \"how American\" because this movie was written and produced by a KOREAN (who isn't actually an action producer), writing about a KOREAN legend, with a focus on Asian dragon history (not Western dragon history, that is, European and American), of which Korea is part of. When you take into account that this is a Korean production, from a country which isn't quite as big and multi-cultural as the US, and if you knew anything at all about Asian mythology, then MAYBE you could actually appreciate the story and quality of the movie. (btw, I apologize for CAP words. I am not yelling, I'm only doing it for emphasis, given the lack of HTML features)As for CGI, I believe I can safely say that I've seen worse SFX in the Final Fantasy movies and Star Wars 1-3. Yes, WORSE! And I was amazed at the quality of those movies (I'm a huge fan of both franchises, especially FF). I can't believe anyone could call D-War graphics bad. The realism and quality of the Imoogi (great serpent), whom we have no recollection what they could possibly look like, except from ancient art, alone should show you that they've put considerable money and effort in creating an amazing work of art. The effect of the immense and realistic evil army was impressive, reminding me of both Star Wars and the LOTR trilogy.Admittedly, the acting could have been better, but all the actors involved have had limited Asian culture and CGI movie experience, so it's understandable that they didn't do so great. Also, Hyung Rae Shim doesn't have much experience with the American culture, so collaboration is weak, which lends to the problem of the scale of the movie.Of course, Jack (played by Robert Forster) actually did an excellent job in his part, which unfortunately, was rather limited to granting tidbits of information about what was going on for all of us to know, and to getting Ethan and Sarah (played by Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks, respectively) out of some sticky situations, like the hospital and on the bridge by driving over the Evil General (played by Michael Shamus Wiles). But, honestly, his roles in the film pretty much was limited to plot expositor, to point us, the audience, on the path of enlightenment (which most of you apparently have missed, sorry to say).All in all, I'd give this movie 8/10 for excellent graphics, strong story line, and interesting portrayal of redemption, with rather weak acting and the struggle to coordinate the two primary cultures as my two main negatives.BTW, being Half American and Half Korean, I'd probably have a small advantage over any of you, by way of knowledge and consideration, but when you also consider I haven't been in Korea since I was 4 years old, and have been raised Christian American (thus, little or no exposure to Buddhism or Asian Mythology), I'm about as ignorant as most of you. If I think this was a good movie (and if IMDb is ranking this movie 6th overall this week (21st September), and 10th for weekend gross earnings), then for those people who refuse to judge a book by it's cover (or a movie by way of poor, negatively biased reviewers), I'd recommend watching this movie, or waiting till it is released in DVD and rent it, then consider what I've wrote about cultural consideration.",

I thought the army scenes were exciting and the scenes with the serpents/dragons were engaging and exciting as well. I loved the Dragon scenes!The dialog parts of the film really dragged out for me. The acting was seriously like as bad as late night Cinemax soft core and the plot holes were more like cavernous trenches. But the old Godzilla movies were like that for me as well. I catch those on TV and I always watch. They are campy and fun, but I always wish the actors would shut up. In this I felt the same way and I have to say that I was rooting for the dragons/army during the people vs. dragon/army scenes. I give this movie a 6 for the action and for having dragons. I have to admit that I will watch just about any pile of pootie movie if it has dragons in it, but I have seen many movies and I have seen a lot worse than this one (and a lot better). If you see this movie, leave your brain at the door and bring in some candy or popcorn for the talkie parts and you should be OK.By the way, someone on these boards said this movie was worse than House of the Dead... maybe that's why I didn't mind this one so much.

The same way a 13 year old will.There is a plot, but it is extremely basic, not developed at all, has no meat to it, as well as being difficult to follow due to bad translations for backstory events (Ancient Korea). The characters get no depth, are emotionally shallow and have bad actors trying their worst to just get to the end of the shoot. The action set pieces are OK when averaged out. There are a few epic scenes where the CGI really does its work (and they are petty good), but then another battle sequences take a few pages from a bad power ranger episode, so there is no consistency.And the final scene will leave you EXTREMELY confused.

After all, the movie does boast a simply amazing A-list cast of American actors who were obviously attracted by something powerful enough to agree to work with director Shim Hyung-Rae. How many Korean movie directors can say that ? The long anticipated opening day for Dragon War in America was Sept .14th and here are some of the reasons it could succeed:First of all, there's the sheer novelty of having the scariest looking serpent and mini-dinosaurs spill out onto the big screen with incredible spontaneity. D-War is therefore totally major, a first for Korea and definitely a work that has inspired many of us who have never lived abroad. It's special effects justify the fact that it's the most expensive movie ever made in Korea by a Korean, even though some of the scenes in D-War require an appreciation for Shim's prior background in comedy. Several campy moments actually keep us in the creative loop, so to speak. And even those of us with absolutely no sense of humor are given the chance to make the same loop, thanks to some of the zany characters, like the zoo keeper who nearly gets clobbered to death by an elephant carcass. But why should it matter where Shim spent $33 million ? It should come as no surprise that it has always been his dream to become a filmmaker and he was willing to pay the price win or lose. Secondly, audiences in English-speaking countries will not have to be told in advance that it's a foreign film with some subtitles, which should help it succeed where others before it have failed, most notably \" The Host\" , another Korean monster movie that failed theatrically in areas such as the U.K. due to language barriers.In closing, D-War, like all films, is a universal medium; computer special effects give it enough leverage over more traditional methods a la Godzilla. So perhaps the main reason some members of the entertainment industry seem to have problems following D-War's message is due to their limited thinking about monster movies in general. Maybe they ought to try to remake the whole damn movie more intelligently, using different camera angles or drawings, with different scaling, instead of having the director look so derelict in his duties. Surely he must have something to boast about after six years of being so committed and passionate about this movie. So please. How you rate D-War shouldn't be based on whether you agree with such things as the size of its marketing budget or its chances of succeeding as a Korean export. And even if you don't need no good advice, go see D-War. Just remember to get a good seat, sit down and shut up! --------- I.N. Jongno, Seoul",

BLAH! all of it was a mess. The dialogue is as cheap as it gets. Although the actor i found rather hilarious, and good was Bruce, Ethans friend. I love that actor, and he was enjoyable in the movie. But everyone else was just bad. The story, or plot could have been MUCH better! The first time i saw this movie, it was on the SYFY channel, and i seriously thought it was a SYFY original, because of how bad, and cheap it was. But once i looked it up, i was stunned to figure out this movie actually hit theaters!! i immediately felt bad for the people who wasted 90 minutes, and 10 bucks to watch this crap.

The monsters were sick looking and the fight scenes were fun and exciting. Movies are all about going into them with the right frame of mind, if you go into a drama expecting a comedy, you won't enjoy it even if it is a good movie. If you go into this movie expecting something great, then you won't enjoy it, but if you go into it wanting to just be entertained for 2 hours then you probably will enjoy it.The acting is decent...some good some bad. It was a little slow at the beginning but once the dragon/snake starts destroying the city, it gets pretty fun. Please don't go into this movie thinking it is going to be God's gift to humanity or else you will be sorely disappointed...because it's not and it's not trying to be. It's just trying to be a fun and enjoyable movie, which I think it accomplishes.Obviously if you don't like Godzilla-esque movies you will not enjoy this film, so don't go watch it then b**** because you don't like it. It would be like me going to watch a chick flick and then complaining because I don't like chick flicks. If you like seeing monsters fight and destroy cities then this is the film for you. I think that there have been MUCH worse films than this, and I think it's worth a viewing. I give it a 7 out of 10 because it is nothing special, but it accomplishes what it means to and I enjoyed the cheesiness of the whole movie.",

I bought this film this very weekend with high expectations, and finished it just now. I came straight online to see what other reviews it got and I am glad to see that I was not the only one who was left mind- boggled at its inadequacy. Where to start...it really was that bad! First off, it was too short. From experience, most films under this are usually cheap and not well produced; understatement of the century!Now I'm English - fair enough the director, is 'supposedly' a very popular comedian in Korea, but do you see Peter Kay running about directing films? No. Simple as.The Plot - Transformers attempt with Dragons is what most people expected. Difference is, Transformers had a plot - this had nothing. It was not made clear at all when the plot kept branching off, maybe this was through time restrictions, but I guess they just blew the whole 75mil on CGI! I found myself constantly laughing with clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9. How did two random strangers meet up, and in the same day, understand what was happening without actually explaining how their fates were linked, and GET OFF WITH EACH OTHER? What the hell was that about? Okay, they loved each other in a previous life, but seriously, cm-on.. Oh, and the random inaudible gurgling from the 'guy in black'. Too much went wrong with the plot to explain the rest..ACTING (oh dear) - I had to mention the chase sequence through the tunnel (Ethan, Sarah and reporter friend) first because I just couldn't believe what I was seeing! Okay, he was told of a snake but they could have at least showed some emotion when a 300 foot long snake is chasing you - THEY JUST KEPT TURNING AROUND - ?!?!? - I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. At the end, it was the old 'did you see that'. Oh dear.Okay, if you're 8 with no clue what is ACTUALLY going on, then you'll love it, or if you're Korean who had actually heard of this before the film. Anyone else - do not, I repeat, do not waste an hour and a half of your life over this monstrosity. If Koreans enjoy this, then I have to say, they have a warped sense of entertainment. That was a shocking performance in all aspects except CGI. The creatures to be fair were well made. That's all I'm gonna say. Oh, and did anyone see the choppers which manoeuvred like F16's? It was a joke from start to finish, I am tempted just to destroy this film now. But hey, you could play a good prank and give it to someone to watch, claiming it's the best film you've ever seen - they would probably come for you in the night!P.S L.A >>> Mordor - WHAT....THE....*AHEM*....HAPPENED.....THERE...",

You know, some movies, people are shot, and a cross, bible, other object they have on a necklace or in their pocket saves them from dying...but not here. Our hero is shot, and just shakes it off. They don't even really say anything like...\"Wow dude, you just got shot, are you OK?\" or...\"Holy crap...that dude just shot you from like two feet away, did you catch the bullet with your teeth like you're Bruce Leroy in The Last Dragon?\"...Which by the way...way better movie than this. Nor did they say the obvious...\"Holy crap, I just got shot point blank, and shook it off...how did I end up in this movie...remind me to fire my agent.\" NO...they say...\"Are you OK?\" He says yes...and they just walk off.In short...if felt like a story that should have been about 3 hours long, with more explanation and character development...but, sadly, what you got was...Hey...that movie you guys asked for a twenty-five million dollar budget for...here is a dollar eighty for the movie...a few hundred grand for some special effect, and here's three hundred grand...because some how we talked Robert Forster into being in this movie.

The characters are flat, unrealistic, and at times just plain ridiculous.

Twenty minutes into it I desperately wanted to leave, but sadly I was not the one who drove there (not that I didn't contemplate the hour long walk).

It's so ridiculously bad you will laugh pretty much every time the movie is supposed to be serious or dramatic. The intro features giant Jabba- like turtle creatures with cannons and people being slashed to death by giant swords without even suffering a visible rift on their clothes. It also shows defenders with colorful carnival costumes making a hopeless defense, freeze the picture when it shows a group of defenders at the wall, you have to. Be aware of the scene in the intro where the dude and the girl fall from a cliff to escape the snake. It looks like the guy is first considering to defend her but then suddenly goes \"fuck this\", grabs her and jump down. You also have to laugh at the flying old ninjas fighting in the forest. This movie simply has a countless number of hilarious scenes where none was supposed to be. The fact that the giant snake is never seen by any citizen when roaming around the city in the beginning of the movie is so annoyingly unlikely. This movie is impossible to be take seriously. If you're about to see it you MUST 1: Count how many times Ethan and his girl runs/drives away from the giant snake and then stops to talk and relax, at for example the beach or at a restaurant before the snake suddenly reappears and the same thing happens over again. And 2: How many Asian people are named Kim or Chen in the closing credits text at the end. Might be cultural ignorance or something but we couldn't stop laughing.From a serious POV it deserves no stares at all, it's a mess. On the other hand it's a ridiculous mess. If you want to watch a good, solid, serious fantasy-movie, RUN, RUN FAST. However, if you want to watch one of the funniest \"not supposed to be a comedy\"-movies ever it's a MUST.

It is the movie of the decade. Simply put... ?D-war? is one of the greatest motion picture experiences I imagine one could ever have! It deserves every ounce of praise it has received, every award it has won, and every Top Ten list it has made.

Well, perhaps I exaggerated a little but this movie was everything I was waiting for.The moment D-war came to the screen I yelled so much I nearly passed out! It wasn't only me, everybody was. The director got everything right with this one. From their unimaginably fantastic entrance to their masterfully created battles, this movie was fun from the start to the end. Now before I go I have a word of advice for you who haven't seen it yet; don't listen, read or believe the reviews from those lunatic dinosaurs also known as movie critics. I thought you go a movie based on a cartoon from 80s to have fun. Nobody expect a complicated plot like in citizen Kane. This movie was for our generation, the younger generation who were grown with Dragon-wars. You, critics, should stay away from movies that have absolutely no connection with because you simply don't understand them.Director Hyung-rae Shim has fashioned a magnificent work of art that will, in all likelihood, be hailed decades from now as one of the greatest achievements in Cinema.

I was, in fact, ashamed of Koreans who kept claiming that this movie is on par with Lord of the Rings series, as Hyoung-Rae Shim boldly stated. (I still can't believe he said that). This movie was, at best, a low budget sci-fi movie. There was, however, a factor that made it at least a little appealing to me, other than the fact was that it was made by a Korean director, based off of a Korean legend, and that the ending theme song was an old Korean folk song. I mean, come on now...----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- Here's my rating of the movie.Story: Crap - Despite the thorough explanation of the antique shop owner and the flashbacks (with Korean dialog), the plot puzzles me.Directing: Sub-par - I expected better from Hyoung-Rae Shim. I pray that he stays away from any US releases from now on. Save us Korean immigrants some face, Please.Acting: Sewage - I think I've seen the guy in a show called Roswell a few years back... which was canceled. Ever wonder why it was canceled? Watch this movie. Only this time, he has a new set of horrible actors with him.CG: Not half-bad - Some scenes actually looked cool. Not bad at all, really, considering how hideous the creatures were. But yet again, it was nowhere enough to deserve a spot in a box office.Last 10 minutes: Cool - Finally, we are in Mordor (don't ask). The good giant snake becomes a REAL dragon and destroys the bad giant snake. This, by far, is the high point of the movie. It's also the only part in the entire movie that you get to see a bad-ass action. It's too bad it only lasted 5 minutes... -_-Ending: ??

The Korean language flashback segment with English subtitles looked like a nice, usual children's picture book story.CGI was worth seeing this movie. I did see reviews on countless occasions that CGI is worth alone seeing this movie, and I didn't believe it. It's rare for me to think CGI alone was really worth seeing a film. It was satisfying. I was surprised to realize while watching the film, it has been a desperate wish of mine to see a dragon flying and moving.This movie was really funny. This was something I didn't expect either. I wish the script had more funny moments than serious plot moments. I started laughing at $10 one. My favorite was the quarantine scene. There wasn't a single unfunny joke in the whole movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often in film for me. Something I also didn't expect to be good was acting. It's very placid though. There is a curious lack of good exaggeration. I really didn't think there was anything bad with acting. I thought it was definitely high above the average, flat lines. I was bored with the shape-shifting, bad guy. I was bored with two main characters. I was bored whenever dialogs relating to the plot came along. Destiny plot in a Fantasy theme setting is too much repeated for me. I wish movies were less similarly copy-formatted. I wish there is more variety of background settings, characters, and plots.",

He manages to misappropriate Chinese culture, wrongfully claiming it's Korean, yet simultaneously upholds white supremacy by writing worthless F-list white actors into the script as the stars of a supposedly asian-ish fairy-tale. But the film is supposedly set in L. A., AND made there! You mean to tell me you couldn't find ANY asian actors in L. A. to cast in roles made for asians? ( Maybe asian actors in L. A. were all smart enough to read the script first, and either turned it down or did not even audition for it? )It suffers from the trope that an utterly forgettable dullard of a girl is the most important person on the planet. From start to finish, none of the leading characters have any meaningful impact on the events of the plot, \"things just happen to them\".The bad guys clearly achieve complete & total victory several times throughout the film, at which point D-War should simply end, yet the film editor just splices on another scene in which the leading characters are running away some more. Several times, they aren't even saved \"magically\". It's not even \"deus ex machina\", they just badly edit the plot to keep going.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Then do a good deed for humanity and destroy every copy of D-War you encounter!",

It is just a puny little effort to make a CGI/SCI-FI block-buster...and it has gone horribly wrong.I watched TRANSFORMERS. I din't like it either. But at least it was OK for it genre. The typical American film with loads of regular crap to keep the brainless audience, who by the way constitute the majority, sit through it. Any guy honest enough to watch meaningful movies would agree with me. I still can't understand why TRANSFORMERS is so highly rated in IMDb.Anyway, at least this D-WAR is not so highly rated.Anyway who wants to watch this movie...Beware.The movie begins to ramble about some Korean Legend that could only be fit for an 8-year old to show interest in. Ironically, even the main character (ETHAN) after listening to the story-telling session by the 'Old Man', asks the question we audience want to scream at the director: \"WHAT ARE U TALKING ABOUT?\" At least at this point the audience is able to vent out their frustration. Probably, the director knew that such a question would come up from the audience?After a good fairy-tale( or should i tell 'DRAGON-TALE'), the action starts. The secretary of defense comes, the FBI comes, they talk in a dimly-lit conference room. They plan to attack the monster. Then the fire-power comes: the Apache copters, the hell-fire missiles, the tanks, the armoured cars. But the funniest part is the ammo from the Dragon army. How on earth would one strap on Rocket-launchers, Grenade-propellers to the body of the creatures? And at the same time, the Dragon-people are carrying swords and riding weird-looking mutant ostriches? They could have given Laser or Taser guns. The same ammo and army in 1507 and 2007. No change of technology. What a load of crap!The characters have got literally nothing to say. Maybe one can give some credit to the girl SARAH. She really acted fine IMHO. Others were all just passing clouds in the short-lived memory of the movie.And the Dragons were good-looking too. Nice CGI there.In the end, when the director's name comes up, one gets this feeling to really punch him in the nose. I mean, what does he think of the audience? Have we gone that crazy...that CGI-crazy..that he could through this rubbish into our face? That's all i can think of telling. If u really want to waste your time or are a CGI fan, then u can give this a try. If u are not, give it a skip.",

I wouldn't compare it with the transformers, where it was tech versus tech, but it is nice to watch and wonder when someone is really going to make a movie where we get to see all of our ingenuity and experience, and our war tech against an alien or whatever force, in a massive battle ground scale. We only get to see this mixture of tech and medieval stuff versus US army stuff in stargate. It was nice to see it here, dragons and apaches face to face in mortal combat! Enjoy!

That guy's acting was horrible, they should have put a mask on him!! it was just cheesy, and the armor of the soldiers looked cheap.The GOOD things:The special effects are amazing! the action sequences are fun to watch, the sound is great, the screaming of the snakes and dragons sounds very good!

The CGI parts of the film, although a bit out of place in areas - i.e. SWAT in canyons and valleys etc. these were reasonably above par for the film. Okay the first large battle felt like a copy of the 'Phantom Mennace' Gundam battle (shudder), but on the whole the battle sequences were enjoyable, but seemed to have nothing to do with the storyline.

I have read that the movie's budget was $75 million, and I think at least $74 of that went for those effects.If you want to watch a movie that makes sense, don't bother with this one.

It seemed interesting when I saw the cover in a shop. It was cheap ( \u00a30.75 ) and I thought it was worth getting for a few hours of entertainment. I was completely wrong, buying this was a misjudgement; didn't take it back though because it was so cheap. I found myself bored after about 30-40 minutes, I was waiting for the satisfaction of a good battle or two as this was what I expected from a movie titled ' D-War'. When the battles did finally commence properly after multiple dis-satisfying flashbacks that the characters dreamed about I was not amused. For one the battles were very close to the end and two the battles were short lived. As I was watching is movie I could not help but deter my attention to something else as I was watching it (my iPad) and when it was finished I was pretty relieved. I stuck it out until the end, with my final opinion being that the plot took too long to unfold, the acting was mediocre and the action hinted by the title was dis-satisfying. If you want a cheap movie to put in the background as 'noise' then go ahead, but if you are looking for an entertaining movie night, do not add this one to your list. You will most likely be disappointed.",

(maybe around the half of his participation was in Ethan's flashback at the beginning); they don't mention how did Sarah realised about everything (literally, Ethan went to meet her at the hospital and she didn't know/remember anything and, in the next scene, she magically knows almost everything that's going on); was the whole movie just to get to the point where the good reptile becomes a real dragon kills the other one and leaves with the sphere? just that?; does Ethan just walks back home at the end? \nFrom my point of view, I'd say it could've been a great movie (as I said, I believe that the plot's main idea was good), but they just wasted it (I mean, they could've expanded more things and correct the plot holes)\nSadly, I'd say they wasted a good idea",

I guess I kind of liked the huge flashback part in the beginning but it was so disjointed from the rest of the film I didn't understand why it was even there outside of showing off all the graphics used in the Lord of the Rings styled battle scene, and that was dumb because it was so derivative.

While the CGI monsters themselves are very well made, the actual compositing (the integration of the CGI into the live action footage, as well as greenscreen work) is terribly done, resulting in the monsters often looking poorly pasted on top of the picture and not at all like they're actually there.  \n\nUnless you are wowed by the special effects, this movie has little to offer.

            "content": "Rating: 2/5\nSo Bad it's good rating: 3,5/5\n\"Dragon Wars\" a.k.a. \"D-War\" is a pretty lousy movie, but at least it's got one thing going for it: Dragons! It's the story of Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr). He's the reincarnation of a man who, 500 years ago was charged with protecting a princess from the evil Buraki, a giant serpent. The woman in question, has been reincarnated as Sarah (Amanda Brooks). The young woman contains the essence of the Yeouiju, which can transform a serpent like Buraki (an Imugi) into a Celestial Drago, but only when she turns 20. It's nearing Sarah's birthday and Buraki sends his army of dinosaurs, dragons and soldiers to go get her! Ethan must save Sarah or she will be instrument in the destruction of our world... or whatever consequences Buraki transforming into a dragon will have.\nWhen this movie features the dragons, it's awesome. There is a nice variety in the creatures that attack the humans and we get two good, long scenes featuring them. There is one scene in the past, where they simply annihilate the village where the past lives of Sarah and Ethan are living and one in the present where they battle helicopters, tanks and soldiers. We've got soldiers riding velociraptor-like dinosaurs, we've got two-legged Blastoise-like monster with cannons on their backs, we've got flying dragons and sword-wielding ground troops. The battle sequences with these guys are really awesome and the special effects are top-notch. We also get some cool moments where the evil Buraki goes on a rampage in present day. The scenes where it is slithering across crowded streets, knocking hundreds of cars over, crawling over buildings, encircling skyscrapers in its coils and eating people is truly awesome. We even get a pretty sweet Imugi vs. Imugi battle and a dragon vs. Imugi fight towards the end of the movie. If you just like seeing giant monsters wrecking stuff, there's a lot to like here.\nWhenever there are only people talking in the movie, without any dragons anywhere near them, it's downright terrible. This is the kind of movie where characters really under-react to the destruction that's around them. Craig Robinson in particular looks really unenthusiastic, even when being chased by a towering serpent capable of reducing buildings to dust. You can tell no one's priorities were in any of the scenes were people are acting too, because for no discernible reason, no one ever sees the monster moving as long as it's off-screen and every single person in the world, except for that one comedic guy no one believes, is fast-asleep whenever the monsters show up. Even from an overall story level though, this is really bad. The climax of the movie gets resolved in a Deus-Ex Machina that really cheapens the movie and makes it obvious that writer/director Shim Hyung-rae wrote himself into a corner and had no idea what to do with his own story. The movie becomes really laughable in hindsight because you realize if a character in the past hadn't been a total moron, the whole situation could have been avoided and millions of lives would have been spared. \nWhat this movie has going for it is the laughable storyline, which includes flashbacks within flashbacks, a confusing story that's just an excuse to tie in scenes of monsters wrecking civilizations together and a half-dozen clunky moments of characters interacting with each other that will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The special effects are good and pretty exciting, but the story sucks. That means the movie is great for making fun of and makes for a great background movie at your party. When people are talking your guests can either laugh or ignore the movie. When the dragons start wrecking the place, it'll make for great conversation. I say rent \"D-War\" (I think that title is so nutty it's awesome) on Blu-ray, watch it with your buddies that want to have some laughs and you'll have a good time. (On Blu-ray, June 20, 2014)",

Like when Brooks and Behr break out of a mental hospital, then suddenly they are on a beach kissing out of nowhere and he says we need to get you some new clothes, next scene they are in a doctors house running tests on her?

Image a 200-meter-long evil serpent from ancient Korea with an army of giant lizards, flying dragons, black-armoured humanoid warriors, and immense reptiles. A spectacular and dynamic action-packed display of computer-generated imagery (CGI) awaits you in Dragon Wars!\r\n\r\n\tAccording to a Korean legend, long ago there lived great serpents called Imoogies. They lived in the heavens with their legions of followers. Every 500 years one Imoogi is rewarded for its good deeds with a chance to become a Celestial Dragon. The Imoogi needs to receive from heaven the gift of the Yuh Yi Joo. It is the strength and power of the Yuh Yi Joo that allows an Imoogi to transform into a dragon. One evil serpent, Buraki, wanted to possess Yuh Yi Joo; heaven would not allow it and so hid the Yuh Yi Joo on Earth. Heaven sent down its best warriors, Haram and his master Bochun, to protect the Yuh Yi Joo. A female named Narin was born with Yuh Yi Joo which would become completely formed when she reached 20. This is when the evil Buraki and his followers attacked the village searching for Narin who was saved by Haram. Defying the rule of heaven he threw away a special pendent and ran away with Narin. With Buraki still in pursuit they jumped off a cliff and died. Now, 500 years later Bochun, Haram and Narin are reincarnated in present day Los Angeles. Bochun/Jack finds Haram/Ethan and gives him the pendant who finds Narin/Sarah the day she turns 20. Buraki and his army attack the city wreaking havoc and destruction in their quest to find Sarah. Haram/ Ethan gets a second chance to protect the Yuh Yi Joo.\r\n\r\n\tThe director of this fantastic action fantasy B film, Hyung Rae Shim, did an excellent job bringing this legend to life. He used flashbacks to tell the original story so we can predict the destruction coming to LA. It took Shim five years to make the most expensive and elaborate film in Korean history, creating a familiar atmosphere for international audiences. His direction demonstrated good timing, technical and artistic techniques.\r\n\r\n\tThe qualities of the visual effects are astounding and extraordinary. A director must image everything he cannot see when shooting a film. To accomplish this, Shim built his own special effects studio, Young Gu Art, to create the CGI. The battle scenes are complex and realistic. Wave after wave of continuous heart-pounding action keeps you enthralled.\r\n\r\n\tI really admire Shim for the fantastic technical effects he accomplished and increasing the reputation of the Korean film industry. He took a big risk making this film and I believe that it will stand the test of time. Dragons are good for films. Period.",

Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon. So right off you know the story won't go anywhere as it include random scenes that makes you wonder if you're watching the most expensive high-school movie ever produced. I'm serious, there so much inconstancy like how a helicopter crashes into a building and then magically blows up when the pilots get out for some reason. It's also very uninteresting to have a hero who's useless for most of the movie which made me feel like also watching a comedy just because on bad certain scenes are.\r\n\r\nSo the story isn't what anyone wants to watch in this movie, they want the monsters, and they disappoint for the most part. These monsters just look terrible and terribly animated. I will say I did enjoy when the monsters got released in Los Angles and the battle began. To bad they were terribly filmed and not as cool as they could have been. As for the epic finale, i'll just say i've seen better in terms of monster movies. I mean the area where the final battle looks so bad and incomplete with bad special effects. The final battle is a let down, it's last less than three minutes. Now I originally was going to give this a 30% before I saw the ending. The ending makes you feel you wasted your time and got ripped off.\r\n\r\nIt's such a shame to see a movie featuring Dragons be this bad and so poorly made. I mean it's not often we see Dragons being the main focus of a movie let alone in a watchable movie, but maybe one day we'll have a decent movie featuring Dragons. Until then, avoid this at all cost.",

First, I will say the opening started off with an old man faking a heart attack in front of a boy's father; sending the father off for 'help' as an excuse to explain to the boy that he's a re-incarnation of a 'protector' from 1507 a.d. Korea. Next was a pitched battle scene from that same era, and that actually fooled me into thinking this could be an interesting movie. How wrong I was. To me, it all went downhill from there. This film tries to invoke imagery from such classics as \"The Neverending Story\", \"Dragonheart\", and even \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\". However, I'm left debating whether this was actually worse than \"Reign Of Fire\". From the moment I first saw the 'evil dragon', I had my doubts, and they were satisfied.

This is a very ambitious, good-looking movie that never lets its modest budget show. The battle scenes that permeate the second half of this picture are exciting, well directed and a lot of fun.\r\nYou only wish that the writers didn't take so long to set-up those wars. That set-up is a tedious, boring and laugh-filled mess. After a half hour of ridiculous explanations and contrived dialogue, you're ready to scream \"Enough!\" at the screen. Everything is as clear as mud, but once the action gets underway, none of that matters. You don't need to understand the first half of the film to enjoy the second.\r\nThe cast is bland and forgettable, and veteran B-lister Robert Forster even looks embarrassed to be in this. It's a pretty silly performance and a lame part to begin with. But, if you can make it past the mystifying, completely unnecessary opening half, there are some enjoyable moments here. The special effects are quite remarkable considering what the filmmakers had to work with. The battle sequences are a blast, and so much better than the big-budget \"Godzilla\" remake. \r\nI just wonder why the makers of \"Dragon Wars\" felt the need to lull us to sleep first. There are some laughs, but mostly blank stares and puzzled looks. The script is needlessly complicated and overly plotted for what the writers set out to accomplish. It's ambitious, but to what avail?",

You have mini-dragons chasing helicopters, dawdlers bombing buildings, and one hell of a massive king cobra calling upon storm clouds, it's nuts! This film never has a dull moment, in fact the problem with this film is it is what people want to make, something that is all action and skipping the boring stuff even if it means tearing massive plot-holes in the story. This is what every film director wants to make but is too ashamed to make it due to everything else that's supposed to go into a film other than dragons and action, as if the director put his untamed imagination into film format and just played it regardless. \r\nAlso, the ending is awesome! What better way to end a crazily-over-the-top film than with having two giant cobras twisting and coiling into the heavens while ripping at each other's hides, then come crashing down again, then for one of those cobras to turn into a mahusive screaming dragon and beat the scales off the cobra?

Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon.\r\n\r\nSo according to the title Dragon Wars I expected to see massive battles between dragons but NO just one wreaks havoc and its minions follow. So I hated the story I think it's wrong Era and Wrong Place to set it in and the story is unfocused to what it should be doing. I think my favourite was the scenes set in ancient Korea because at least that had something to do with the story. The acting isn't to bad I disliked the female lead but our hero did okay. The special effects in all respect are the only great part about the film I mean it did have a very high budget to bad the effects just saved the film from being a major disaster. And the creatures are cool I guess. The music is really good and as for the editing and stuff like that pretty good.\r\nHere are some facts I found.\r\n\r\nThe music associated with Muraki and his army makes extensive use of the \"Dies irae\" melody, a medieval chant traditionally used in ceremonies for the dead and, since the nineteenth century, in contexts evoking the macabre and supernatural.\r\n\r\nThis marked the first Korean production in nearly three decades to receive wide theatrical release in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe final edit for both the US and Korean versions of the film run approximately 92 minutes, considerably shorter than the 110 minute cut first shown at the American Film Market in Santa Monica, CA on November 4, 2006, and again at the Berlin Film Market on February 8, 2007. According to D-WAR production company Younggu Art Entertainment, the film was tightened to improve pacing based on feedback from preview screenings.\r\n\r\nOverall failed again Korean monster flick that could have been nothing but epic and my final verdict is not recommended.",

And Dragon Wars plays like a homepage to major elements of this or there legends but is it just me or is this film just bad? I mean this could have been an amazing movie but there is just so much unfocused stuff and things that trail off into nothing. And the amazing fact is that they set it in America and not Korea? The only thing that saved this movie were the amazing special effects, and some major creature designs of their culture. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/255niqg.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBased on the Korean legend, unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet. Reporter Ethan Kendrick is called in to investigate the matter, and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl, stricken with a mysterious illness, named Sarah is supposed to help him. The Imoogi makes its way to Los Angeles, wreaking havoc and destruction. And it will be the start of a massive climax to end this legend.\r\n\r\nPersonally I hated the story it is 100% unfaithful to the legends and how they have placed the setting in Los Angeles and only a brief moment in Korea. It should be Korea and it should have Korean actors for a Korean film.\r\nAlso despite it being Terrible it was a big hit in Korea landing in there highest grossing films of all time.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/aelfew.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n20% for story: I liked the ending scene at the massive temple with the fight but that's about it. The movie is just annoying because of its modern day setting which just really pisses me off. I have no doubt that Koreans would have liked it.\r\n\r\n15% for Acting: it's terrible and even bad attempt at humour which just isn't funny at all, our leads are good but overall it's just terrible. Its funny how they or most would even try.\r\n\r\n30% for characters: Indeed there interesting but overall still bad only because there American and annoying. Again Koreans might have made the film interesting.\r\n\r\n90% for special effects: This movie cost around $75 million dollars in American Money or $69 billion won (South Korean money). Making it the highest budgeted film for the time, to bad the amazing effects were the only good part.\r\n\r\n39% for everything else: Some amazing music but that's it and some epic creature designs but that's it.\r\n\r\nAlothought its better then his first film Reptillian big time but Is it worth anyones time? I say read the books not watch the movie you will only be pissed off big time.\r\n\r\nKeiko's score 24-100",

            "content": "D-War, I must admit, is the best giant snake movie since Boa versus Python. I say this with no disrespect to BvP which is truly a misunderstood sub-genre classic.\r\n\r\nBut back to D-War. The film deserves credit for its sheer audacity alone. Not only do we have a giant snake ripping things up from feudal Korea to modern day America, but he also has at his disposal an army of black armoured soldiers (think the Uruk-Hai from Lord of the Rings on a tight budget) who ride around on the backs of dinosaurs... with rocket launchers!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the storyline is a bit off-the-wall (referencing obscure Korean legends), it is somewhat refreshing to watch a film about a giant monster that is not an alien visitor run amuck or a result of genetic engineering gone awry. The special effects are mostly solid, if not spectacular. Indeed there are times when they get a little bit ropey. However, the budget of  D-War budget was fairly low for a film of its kind so this is forgivable as the film is a fairly impressive technical achievement overall.\r\n\r\nEnough of that!, I hear you say, Tell us about the action! Well, I am happy to say that for the most part it delivers. The first act contains some fairly cool over the top kung fu fighting that looks, how shall we say, inspired by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Toward the end there is a great battle between the dinosaur people and the US army in a busy city which packs a nice punch. There is also one of those epic CGI showdowns to cap off the finale. Unfortunately the pacing of the middle of the film is a bit too slow, consisting of several chase scenes (apparently the only weakness of a Demi-God snake monster is to drive away from it very quickly) and some hammy detective work. Luckily it does not take itself too seriously, offering some goofy humour every now and then to keep the tone light and stop the film from becoming too dependent on a lacklustre storyline.\r\n\r\nOverall, D-War is an enjoyable romp well worth checking out if you are up late and in the mood for some B-movie style action.",

And that includes \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" There is no story structure. There is no attempt to make you empathize with the main characters. You get slammed with a half-hour of exposition at the beginning, and it's bad exposition. It's so confusing that you have no idea what they were trying to set up in the first place. The next quarter of the film is devoted to a bunch of cuts between the male lead and the female lead, while the male lead looks for her. Then there's a battle between fantasy creatures and modern military technology in the middle of LA, with total disregard for civilian life by the military. The chopper pilots are hilariously bad. I feel like this sequence was one of the major reasons this film was made. You can tell the director liked it, because you see the main characters for all of two minutes in this roughly 20 minute battle. Oh, and another thing. This movie fails at creating tension in every way imagineable. I know every movie does this, but none so blatant as this one. When the bad guy is two feet from his goal, and he just stands there and stares at his goal, easily within reach... WHY NOT STRIKE ALREADY!? That happens maybe 10 times in the entire film. The special effects amalgam at the end between the two giant serpents, good and evil, is also something that you can tell the director really wanted to do. Too bad it fails for using special effects on par with a film like Independence Day, an 11-year-old film. Aside from all of these flaws, add in non-sequitur dialog that is badly delivered, a \"tragic\" ending that is practically joyous when the credits roll, and a bad guy with dubbed Korean lines who overacts like it's going out of style, and you have what can easily be called the worst movie ever made.

This film did not live up to the unlimited potential it had to be an awesome dragon flick, but it wasted it all (How do waste $75 million to create this?).

I have frequently logged on to metacritic to get an overall idea on what critics as well as the general public think of a particular movie so I can try and determine if a movie is worth my time and money. Unfortunately for me and the kids, on the day this was released I checked on Metacritic to read the reviews and there was not a single review posted. After watching this total piece of crap I can see why. No doubt this movie was never screened because the producers of this debacle must have known the film was going to get savaged by the critics and the general public alike. The only reason I took the time to write a review on this waste of celluloid was after reading others express that this was the worst film they had ever seen as well. Reading others write the very thing I was feeling was very therapeutic for me. Just knowing that others saw this movie as I did made me feel a little better. I guess misery does love company after all! The only good thing to be said about this piece of total crap was that the special effects were pretty amazing. That being said it still was not enough to raise my review above \"zero\"! You truly would have to have the I.Q. of a common house plant in order to enjoy this movie.

And the one guy that seems to be untouchable gets plowed by a car. Why does the serpent chase them, because when he catched up to them just roars at them. What's the point?... Lol I thought this movie was very funny, but overall it was very unorganized. Lol.",

Another reviewer said \"If you want to share some unforgettable memories with your children, this will be an excellent choice.\" Absolutely true - any future rubbish movie you see with your children can be accompanied by \"hey, at least it wasn't as bad as Dragon Wars.\" Pretty much all the actors (I use that term extremely loosely) seemed to have no idea what was going on, both in the movie, and in their own private lives that meant they were forced to accept a role in this film. The special effects were the best part of Dragon Wars, and even then they would not have looked out of place in an episode of Buck Rogers. Seriously. I literally have absolutely no idea what the point of this movie was. It made no sense whatsoever, and there was absolutely no attempt to get the audience to either like the good guys or hate the baddies. Whoever they were.

The reason for this review is that the past few reviews have been generally solid titles. As a man with very limited resources, I try to filter through the oceans of crap released by companies and spend my hard-earned dollars on media I know I will enjoy. Dragon Wars was a free DVD, meaning I could sample it without damaging my checkbook, as well as take an unbiased look at a movie that has been universally hated, to see if I agreed. After seeing the movie, I can tell you that not only were the critics right, they were being soft on the producers.    Dragon Wars is, without question, the most lopsided movie I have seen in years. I started the movie expecting that the majority of the budget would be spent on special effects; I did not, however, prepare myself for the level of crap that the movie would fling at me. From a broken storyline, to poorly executed scenes designed for character development, this movie was far and beyond what could be considered as a movie released for a quick buck.    The story loosely follows a young girl in Korea some thousand years ago, who was cursed to be eaten by one of two dragons, one apparently being designated \u00e2",

If I can spare but ONE person from wasting 90 minutes of their life, by keeping them from watching this unwatchable piece of trash, then my job here is done. Essentially, it's: Boy finds out about girl, boy finds girl, girl holds the mystical \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" or whatever, boy and girl flee evil forces, girl eventually is sacrificed to the good \"Omura\" (or whatever), boy stands alone (since the theater has since been emptied). First, I will say the opening started off with an old man faking a heart attack in front of a boy's father; sending the father off for 'help' as an excuse to explain to the boy that he's a re-incarnation of a 'protector' from 1507 a.d. Korea. Next was a pitched battle scene from that same era, and that actually fooled me into thinking this could be an interesting movie. How wrong I was. To me, it all went downhill from there. This film tries to invoke imagery from such classics as \"The Neverending Story\", \"Dragonheart\", and even \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\". However, I'm left debating whether this was actually worse than \"Reign Of Fire\". From the moment I first saw the 'evil dragon', I had my doubts, and they were satisfied. Instead of wings on the side of it's head, there's a 'hood' similar to that which cobras exhibit. There are even mild attempts at comedy relief, and those failed miserably. Solid 1.0 rating material if I've even seen it (and trust me...I have).",
