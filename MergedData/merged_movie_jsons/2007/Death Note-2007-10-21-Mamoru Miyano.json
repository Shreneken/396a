            "review_title": "I'm glad Death Note was my first anime.",
            "content": "The first time I heard of Death Note was from a youtube channel Hello Future Me and his storytelling analyses. Previously I had resented anime as childish and totally weird-looking, but after Timothy took Death Note as an example of a good story-beat management, I was wiling to give it a shot. And boy, was I hooked.Never before have I seen any show try to copy that sherlock-ey way of thinking and incorporate it so cleverly with mystery and fantasy elements. Death Note has such an unique feel to it that no other anime has... every moment Light's and L's theme play, I get slight goosebumps while wondering who will outsmart whom next. It is a matter of simple beauty seeing the writers play with the contrast of Light's and L's personality, making them grow close while simultaneously growing further apart. Ant to top it off with so much symbolism and biblical references in the final episode of L's saga is a matter of pure perfection.Yes, people will say that the second part sucks. Truth be told, even though it may not be equally as engaging as the first one, I wouldn't say it was unbearable either. The fact is that by this point Light is so cornered that he cannot operate on his own; therefore the tension is dissipated towards minor characters and Near that we don't get enough time to care about. Nonetheless, seeing Light maneuver through all the traps Near sets for him provides a proper build-up towards the eagerly expected end.And about the end... I really felt for Light in those final moments. Part of me didn't want the series to end the way it did, simply because Light was the embodiment of my answer to the fundamental questions of justice that stem from Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment. As much as I may be a follower of Kira in one part of my mind, I also cannot deny that Near is absolutely right - Light Yagami is just another serial killer; nothing more and nothing less.Death note is the first of all the animated series that has introduced me with the fact that not all things animated have to have a happy ending. Think of it, how many western-animation movies do you know that do not end on a happy note? Very few would be my guess. And from this time on, my journey through japanese animation has started. I couldn't be more grateful for the way it began and therefore, Death Note will always be the No. 1 anime I will recommend to people new to anime. If you haven't seen it yet, I really do not know what you are waiting for...... btw I hear the bells. Do you?",

            "content": "Seriously the first half of it was the one of the best things I've ever watched in my whole life. The psychological warfare was brilliant and the show had me on the edge of my seat at every single moment. And once L died, everything went downhill. Light turned into an absolute physcopath and it was almost unbelievably stupid of him to fall in Nears trap. Near was nowhere nearly as smart as L or Light, yet she had the last laugh. If the second half would've continued like the first half, this would be the best show ever made.",

            "content": "This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric \"L\" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected \"Kira\" or \"Killer\" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, \"Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper,\" but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note.",

Truly captivating story......until (without spoiling it) the main story arc ends quite anticlimactically and new subplot begins with new characters in the primal focus. The latter half takes away a hint of brilliance from rest of the story.Still I would recommend it!",

Like the film and manga, it depicts the cat and mouse hunt between L and Light on who will uncover one another's identity.Death Note is a cake; everything good about a cake; and therefore people should see this landmark. Overall, Death Note will remain a classic forever... if the Americans don't remake and ruin it!!!10/10",

            "review_title": "Well Written, Masterful Anime",
            "content": "I have to say two things turned me off. First is the idiot reviewer on the front page who feels the need to use 70% of his review(even titled it \"Eat Your Heart Out Naruto\"-really subtle) to bash Naruto like some insecure 12 year old spoiled brat fan boy. Pathetic. The second was that it sounded like some Gothic action anime from others. However when I finally saw it I thought, meh, okay. However as it went on I got more and more drawn in.The plot is simple enough to start:successful and brilliant student Light stumbles upon the Death Note, which will kill anyone who's name he writes down provided it's their real name and he knows his face. He experiments with it and sees that it's real. He plays with the other rules all the while killing other criminals and meeting up with the shinigami who wrote the death note. The deaths of these criminals does not go unnoticed as the renound and mysterious detective El is trying to discover who Light, under the name Kira, is. Whoever finds the other's identity first will win in this power struggle.Like I said, the first episode is interesting enough. The story however develops and becomes better and more complex as it goes on. The moral ambiguity of the anime gives it a unique feel among others of it's kind. I was shocked to see a show like this under Shounen jump which usually host anime that combine strong actions scenes with a complex plot and character development. What we have here instead is an anime that dosen't have adrenaline pumping action scenes advancing the plot(not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact I enjoy that as well) but the proverbial chess game between Light and the police as Light becomes well aware the police are after him as he does everything possible to hide himself all the while continuing to do away with criminals at his whim.Ryuk, the shinigami who follows Light, actually provies some of the comic relief of the show believe it or not. He's not over the top goofy by any means however if there's any laughs to be derived, it's usually from him.Even if you're not a fan of Shounen Jump anime, you should give Death Note a try. It easily rivals the majority of thriller films. It is well worth your time.",

The mixing between mythical fantasy world of god of death and police detective story line is brilliant, just works brilliantly.\nBut as the story grows the details on how things work out gets blurry and un logical character decision making happens more and more often\nBut overall very enjoyable despite the weak finish, and oddly i am hoping there is a death note 2",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome series. From the first episode you can note the well characterized characters, incredible production and direction by MadHouse, the good tone and a story that can be interesting for casual viewers and for smarter people. The constant fight between Kira and L was the point where the series harnessed its potential, you know, THE SERIES STAYED ALIVE BECAUSE OF IT and it was damn awesome, you were always thinking what Kira would do next and what would L do to catch him, it was unpredictable in a good way and fascinating.This was until episode 25 unfortunately, and everything just goes down. Without L, Light feels so distant from the viewer making the next events monotonous and boring to watch,he suddenly starts acting like an impulsive idiot that betrayes his previous character, and about Near, it seems like a plot device being just there for finishing what L started. There's no personality or characterization in him, so it's a nonsense. And then we get to the final episode, Light seems he's going to win but you know what? Let's make an stupid and forced situation where Mikami has the stupid idea to leave the note in a place like the bank. Are you serious? After we saw Light's elaborated plan to hide it in the first episodes, Why didn't he tell him to do that? What I hate from this is that they tell you that Mikami is a very intelligent and metodic guy, but he acts like a fool making decisions without Light's orders. Forced, convenient, inconsistent and rushed.Death Note starts as an incredible and smart show, then they took the smart part and got rid of it. On it's defense, I have to say that the second half isn't too long to ruin the series, so it goes from being a masterpiece to just a very good show.8/10",

When you watch it, you will clearly know when it ends. I recommend you stop there. I wish I did. It's the halfway point of the series. The main characters story really does end there. But to show some moral lessons they put in another half to show that \"good through evil isn't good\". All world governments and empires disagree with this, so why did this show have to forcefully fabricate new stories in the second half. It totally ruined it. It takes away from the characters that had been established.Due to the first half being the best thing I have ever ever seen, I give this 9 stars. Even though the second half was so bad I should reduce it to 5 stars.",

            "content": "Death Note was a stellar TV Show and on its way to being one of my favorite animated TV Shows. With its incredible concept, interesting villainous protagonists and an antithesis to the protagonist that complimented his genius perfectly. The formula was great with the exception of episodes 18-22 which features our protagonists cunning on a boring way that leads to a lackluster payoff. After this however. Episodes 23, 24 and 25 are phenomenal works of art. This is where the series goes from Incredible to incredibly mediocre. With the exception of the last 3 episodes of the show, there is no right for any of the episodes after episode 25 to exist. The show went from having me completely invested to it feeling like a chore to finish, which is a shame because of how great the last 3 episodes actually were. They introduce new antagonists that are literally the exact same thing as the last one we had, except much worse and no fun at all to watch. I was frustrated with these new characters and their placement in the show. In my opinion Death Note should have ended at episode 25 then it would have been a nearly perfect anime.",

The fact that this series goes morally were few others will go is definitely one of the reasons I find this series to be so enticing.I'm definitely hooked!",

He was despicable and a psychopath that thought himself a God. It was chilling to watch him transform into Kira because he was willing to kill anyone that stood in his way. I enjoyed every second of it. If I could make a comparison, the dynamic between Light and L is similar to that between Hannibal and Will in the tv show Hannibal. This anime kept me on my toes in every episode as Light outsmarted the people who were against Kira, until he was eventually outsmarted. I kind of wished that Light would've won in the end but honestly the ending meant that nobody but Ryuk won. Ryuk had the most fun being around Light and it was only right that Ryuk was the one who took Light's life. It had come full circle and it was a little bittersweet to see this end.",

This was the first crime/ action anime I finished. I loved how the story turned out. The hats tee development was nice. I liked the fact that the police son was the person killing everyone using the death note book but yet the police and everyone didn't know it or want to believe it for most of the series. L was my fav character hands down even know everyone else was good too. Something about L made him so good. I when I first saw L from the way he looked I thought he would have been the person using the notebook killing anyone but he wasn't. It turned out that he was on the good side and was working with the police. At first I thought the police son was gonna be good but it turns out he had the notebook and was using it to kill anyone and was getting more and more power hungry as time when on. I like how L was on the good side working with the police instead of the son it made the story so much better then it would have been if the son was on the good side working with the police instead of fooling them like he was in the anime. I loved the fanstay/ magical creature that we're suppose to be caring for the death notes books so they didn't get in the hands of someone that would use it for bad. I like how they were designed. All of the other character designs where good too. I liked the colors they choose for this anime to be in. It had lots of action. I liked how the anime had darker colors in it. I would recommend this anime to everyone.",

Light decides to use this power to kill anyone he deems criminal or unworthy of life. Light's continuous killings eventually attract the attention of the genius detective who is only known as L (L doesn't show his face or reveal any information about himself for most of the show). Light figures in order to be completely safe, he needs to eliminate L. The show then becomes a clever game of cat and mouse between two masterminds and it's incredible. You never know exactly what the other is going to do and you don't know if L will capture Light or if Light will kill L. It's absolutely riveting and this is the fantastic part of the show. The second half of the show sucks, for lack of a better word. Without spoiling anything here are the main problems: 1: Some new characters are introduced and none of them are likable. 2: The clever cat and mouse formula gets lost somewhere and the show loses interest. And 3: The ending is wrong, bad, stupid, and I don't like it.You'll see what I mean when you get there. So, Death Note is only good. It could have fantastic, but the second half of the show happened and it became simply a good show. If you only want the good parts watch episodes 1-26. Skip 27-37.",

            "content": "I have seen many anime but few compare to Death Note. It provides it's viewers with incredible characters, a deep storyline, and view of how power can corrupt. The focus of the story is on Yagami Light, a college student who is feed-up with what he considers a rotting world. He soon finds a notebook named \"Death Note.\" The instructions state that any human whose name is written in the Death Note will die as long as the person who writes the victim's name has the victim's face in mind at that time. While Light considers it to be a foolish prank, his curiosity gets the best of him. Upon learning that the Death Note is real, Light realizes he has the chance to rid the world of crime and create a new world over which he reigns supreme. The story of Death Note follows Light as he tries to create his new world, and the forces that try to stop him. Perhaps one of the most interesting elements of the series is that the main character is neither a hero or an anti-hero but instead an anti-villain. This an excellent series that is guaranteed to leave viewers in awe.",

            "content": "After bored Shinigami (god of death) Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world it is found by an equally bored school boy named Light Yagami. Light soon discovers that the instructions in the note book aren't a joke and any name he writes in it will die! He believes that he can use it to bring justice to the world and soon killers are dropping like flies shortly after their details are made public. It isn't long before it becomes clear to law enforcement agencies that somebody must be behind the mysterious deaths and they work to discover who alongside a mysterious detective known only as 'L'. The public also realise what is going on and the killer is given the nickname Kira (Killer). As the series progresses Light plays a game of cat and mouse with the police; at times it looks certain that he is caught and at others it seems that he can get away with anything even when he is enlisted to help the police.This is a really gripping series that even those who aren't a fan of animation should be able to enjoy. The plot is tight with all the rules of the Death Note explained so we aren't left wondering about possible problems are two people sharing a name and such like. Light is a great protagonist; he is clearly becomes psychotic and frequently kills sympathetic characters just because he fears they could expose him. While this is very much a drama there are some enjoyably light moments such as Ryuk's craving for apples. At thirty seven episodes the series may seem a little long but it needs that long to tell the story\u0085 in never seems rushed nor does it feel like any episodes are there just to pad things out. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of anime or supernatural thrillers\u0085 and don't worry if you've already seen the live action version; this deviates from that story and has a totally different ending; an ending that I wasn't certain about till I saw it; as the penultimate episode ended I had no idea whether he'd get away with it or not!These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",

There are around 5 excellently developed characters; there's a great premise; the plot develops logically and compellingly; the pacing of building tension then action is spot on. You've got a unique feel, and some moral dilemma action thought-provoking action. Everything has a balanced and cohesive feel - pretty much everything you'd expect when you see a series rated 8.9.*I have to warn a very slight plot spoil, but I won't give anything remotely specific.* Then about halfway through the series, to solve some stagnation they throw in a good dose of anticlimax. Now the majority of the interesting characters stop getting any screen time for various reasons and follow up by introducing and then disposing of characters you never have any reason to care about. The very ending was well done. (Pity it wouldn't make sense if you just skipped the 15 episodes preceding it!)Maybe the manga developed all of the lame characters in the second half and had I first read all of them I would have enjoyed it all, but still... I just can't justify how sloppy everything got. Compare with either of the Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, or Code Geass if you can tolerate mecha action, and you'll see where I'm coming from.It either needed to be around 20-25 episodes and finish off strong without all of the later stuff, of have been extended to at least 50 so that they could have developed the last half into something workable.",

The use of colors and light effects is equally brilliant, keeping a high quality level in all the episodes. The voice acting and the music are pretty effective, complementing the greatness of the plot and the animation.\"Death Note\" deserved all the hype and praise that it received, being one of the most brilliant television shows that I've ever watched. It would be the perfect series if it wasn't for one little detail: Misa Amane. She is one of the most annoying characters ever made, and she feels totally out of place in the context of this series. I know that there is too much hate directed toward other characters (Such as Mello and Near) but none of them were so irritating and dumb as Misa. Maybe is just me, but I feel like this character were from a completely different anime, and that's the main reason why I don't like her very much.Other than that, this is a magnificent series, which I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this yet.",

I had always been intrigued by its concept of a notebook that can kill anyone whose name is entered in it, and that alone was enough to convince me to watch this supernatural crime thriller anime, and it was just outstanding! I've just now finished watching all episodes on Netflix, and I kind of feel blank.The show raises a lot of moral questions about justice, capital punishment and vigilantism in a very plausible manner. Instead of giving us clearly defined hero, the anime gives us a rather complex protagonist we might even have trouble rooting for at times. It's a first-rate thriller, and a powerful character study at the same time. Throughout the 37 episodes, the show gives you edge of the seat suspense and intriguing twists, as a result of which it becomes very addictive and hard to stop watching. Action scenes, although present only in a few episodes, are done really well and the dialogue is intelligent. And yes, the soundtrack elevates this show to a whole new level of excitement. I couldn't help but listen to the intro music every time I picked up to continue watching the show.No doubt this anime has been such a success with the viewers and has left a memorable impact. To anime fans who enjoy crime thrillers with a supernatural twist, this is definitely recommended, but adults who enjoy live-action shows dealing with similar topics can watch it as well, because it's only the format of the show that's animated. The story is very well mature and intelligent enough to be enjoyed by someone who doesn't even watch animation in general. Fun fact: Having known I'd love the show, I'd got myself a copy of the Death Note (notebook) in advance. No wonder it's a memorabilia for me now!",

I think that there was a couple episodes round the middle of the show that fell a bit flat, they where needed to build the story and further improve the plot but they were a bit stale. That and I wish there was more about the shinigami, they had a lot of focus at the beginning but were forgotten about towards the end. Alright there is a very long list of positives but I'm not going to mention all because there just is way too many. For starters I believe this has the best beginning to any show ever created, I was instantly hooked and got the overall feel for the story and characters. The idea behind it is so well thought out, nothing such as this has ever really been put into film. The characters are all great, especially L and Light, they have such an opposite personality but are so similar in the fact that they are incredibly smart...and it is those smarts that makes the show so incredibly tense all the time and lead to major moments that left me absolutely baffled. The tone was very serious as well which fit the story and the aesthetic of the show, but some things such as the character Misa try to be a little light hearted and maybe funny, I don't believe it works that well but she is a good overall character as she is the complete opposite of every one else but is still quite capable. I feel like I gained a couple brain cells when watching this, it's that high IQ...i recommend you watch this if you haven't already...9/10 no doubt",

The titular character Light Yagami who is Kira from the beginning and L are the two greatest and well written characters ever. This is mature without requiring any of the sex, alcohol and other stuff that other movies and tv shows need because they can't write a great mature story. The twists and turns with some of the things Light does, requires some 200 IQ writing. This show questions your morals and who you support keep in mind Light only kills the worst criminals.",

It was serialized in Japan's \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" magazine before being given a green-light for a Madhouse-produced OVA series in 2006.The story finds its main character in Light Yagami, a bored Japanese high school honor student who one day accidentally discovers the \"Death Note,\" a notebook of otherworldly origin that gives him the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in it. (The Death Note originally belonged to the rogue shinigami - death god - Ryuk, who was bored himself and wanted to see what kind of havoc could be wreaked upon the world of the living.)After a little trial & error, Light begins to see the virtues of what has been dropped into his possession. At first, he uses the Death Note to rid the world of evil, by eliminating many of society's worst criminals. So in short order, Light goes from being a bored high school honor student to a serial killer with delusions of godhood (he's later named \"Kira\" - \"killer\" - by fans of his work). Light's actions are not without consequence, however. Thus, the story adds two wrinkles: It doesn't take long for the authorities to find out that the deaths are somehow connected, and a police investigation is launched. Wrinkle #2 comes in the form of Light playing a cat & mouse game with the authorities and the mysterious and reclusive criminal investigator L, who has vowed to find out who is behind these mysterious deaths and how they're getting away with it.Having never read the original Manga, I can easily say without any bias that the show has to be a perfect (and logical) elevation for \"Death Note.\" This is one Anime' that really caught my eye, since I saw it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late one night, and I've constantly been barraged by the Anime' DVDs and original Manga at the local bookstore. So I took a chance and I can say that \"Death Note\" is now one of my favorite Anime' shows from Japan.This is a moody, effective, and stunningly envisioned and intelligent Anime'. Being a fan of Anime' myself, I know firsthand that intelligence is never in short order in this genre. The story twists and turns and goes a great many places that are incredibly hard to predict. Also as a fan of fantasy, I'm glad to see that \"Death Note\" is pretty dark fantasy, and paints a rather chilling view of a world where the lines between life and death have become so blurred that it seems the two coexist. This show is fairly disturbing, with a very disturbed lead character who lives in a world of amorality and is hard to connect with, but he is such a strange and intriguing character, nonetheless.I hope that wherever \"Death Note\" goes, it goes to some place good because, after all, once we're gone, all that we'll have in the end is the Death Note.10/10",

And the book's power is that 'the human whose name is written in this note shall die'. And the book does just that. Now Light is stuck with this book, along with its owner: Ryuk the 'shinigami'. After using the Death Note to kill some petty criminals, Light starts a crusade to vanquish evil, and 'will become the god of this new world': Kira.Death Note is well done, and becomes a fun ride and more complicated one, when its best character, 'L' (we never know his real name), is brought into the story in Episode 2 and is Light's equal. And 'L' is my favourite part of the show. He's smart, can outguess even himself in the most outrageous circumstances, and he's completely unpredictable. You can also never tell what he's really thinking; but he fights for JUSTICE! This dynamic is akin to James Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes, Ernst Blofeld and James Bond, The Joker and Batman; Light and L are no exception to these great rivalries.The story of Death Note is masterfully adapted to the television storytelling format, it looks just like its source-comic book ('manga': as they call comics in Japan) and its amazing cast of characters makes the show easily worth a watch from start to finish.You want to watch anime but don't know where to start?

I feel like as if that's harder part of the show to swallow so people try to water it down as \"it sucks\" without acknowledging that their own perception on morality and what's right or wrong doesn't make the quality of the show any worse. (ALSO DON'T BE LAZY AND WATCH THE HORRIBLE DUBBED VERSIONS, WATCH IT IN THE LANGUAGE ITS MEANT TO BE WATCH AND TURN ON SUBTITLES)This is an amazing anime, with an captivating and memorable aesthetic and my favorite sound-track of any TV show ever. It definitely has substance and is super though provoking, and almost everything about is perfect. The flaws within the show do come with how crazy the whole idea of a Death Note is, but the logic makes a lot of sense and there couldn't be a better group of writers to make it work better than it does in this show.I am not going to spoil anything, but I feel like the ending of this show helped me mature and made me think about things I never thought I would. A form of media being able to do something is always amazing, which is why I have to recommend it even if anime isn't your thing.",

            "content": "I am glad to see that despite the average of 9.0 from numerous voters... there are still many people here who can look at this anime series from an objective point of view and openly state its flaws.No need for me to go into details or spoilers at all. I've seen about every Death Note there is to see (aside from the 2017 American series which I refuse to watch just on principle). Like many here I understand the Death Note concept and found the original move to be a masterpiece.But this anime... it was like packing a 2 hour movie into a 14 hour slow-motion treadmill. As pointed out by several others-- plot concepts were repeated, concepts thrown in and then ignored, and by the 20th episode I was feeling like Ryuk... bored bored bored. Although well-presented, this felt like nothing more than someone trying to drag out the original story lines to as many episodes as they could possibly milk. But the cow ran dry long before the series ended.Filled with gaping plot holes, lack of logic, areas of ridiculous complexity and jump-the-shark \"logic\"... this felt like an old Charlie Chan movie mystery where one person says \"I have won because\" and the other person says \"Except I foresaw that and\" and then the first person says \"But I knew you foresaw it so I\" and then the second person... well, you get the idea. Savvy viewers can only handle so much of that stuff before they start thinking \"seriously?\".The gore in the very final episode was unprecedented in the series, gratuitous and totally unnecessary to ending the story. There was a strong feeling of anti-climax pretty much through the entire last half of the series (if not before). I started questioning where they were going somewhere after the 10th episode. At the 20th episode I was asking \"how long are they going to drag this on?\". By the time we got to episode 30 I had given up all hope and watched the rest on sheer \"closure\" factor-- let's get this watched and over with.One major mistake in production which I don't understand (probably had something to do with legal rights) was the change in the theme song about halfway through. They went from a barely-tolerable beginning and end song to a total-trash, super-heavy-metal theme song that sounded like it came out of some stoner's garage band. If the purpose of that \"music\" was to convince us there are insane people in the world... it was a total success. I like just about all kinds of music, but that second theme song was a loser in both concept and performance and did nothing to support the series. It turned Death Note into Dead Note and was a terrible choice for theme music.One scene especially (no spoilers) where someone was going to murder two people in cold blood to eliminate Kira-- all I can say is the writers must have been smoking weed when they came up with that lame concept. That didn't make any sense from any viewpoint, and certainly was not Death Note. They had a shark jump the shark on that one.In the end the series was way too long, too contrived in plot, and had too many unbelievable points and logic flaws to stand up to examination. No matter how much someone may have enjoyed the original Death Note movie, if viewed honestly this anime just doesn't stand up to the standards of good anime or the Death Note concept either one. I'm a great fan of the original 2006 movie... but I was yawning 2/3 of the way through this series. The story line was forced and mediocre at best. As I've stated with a couple of other Death Note wannabe's... we don't need yet another Death Note; the original was just fine.",

            "content": "The fourth best anime I have watched, this is definitely an anime for newcomers but also mega fans of anime and that's why it works so well.This anime has an amazing start, the first 25 episodes are this interesting cat and mouse game between Light and L, two different views of justice, whichever wins you will be constantly be rooting for them both.Light and L are definitely the best characters of the show, Light personally being my favorite and always wanting him to defeat L, I wanted them both to live, this is just an example of how well written these characters are, you don't want to see neither of them die. A surprising character I ended up really liking was Misa, at first I found her super annoying but eventually she grew on me and I loved her. I don't think any character from the first 25 episodes are bad but the second half we will get to.The soundtrack is amazing, this may possibly be the best anime soundtrack ever, I can't choose between this or Evangelion. But the themes for each character and the christian orchestrated music is epic, I listen to this stuff all the time it's just that good.The second half if you can call it that (it really is only 12 episodes)\nare super disappointing. After L dies and the satisfying ending of Light saying that the last obstacle was out of his way to make a new world new characters are introduced like Near and Mello. They just aren't interesting and fleshed out like the amazing L was. Yeah Mello is the better of the two but still the show relies too much on the manga to reach the ending when I hoped they would deviate from it's source material and give us a more interesting ending. The best thing of the second half is the final two episodes. Although Light is sort of an idiot the final five minutes where pretty sad and the character I rooted for was dead although his death was a satisfying one.This anime is one of the greatest made, although the second half definitely doesn't capture what made the first half so good, it definitely gives a satisfying ending. If this is going to be your first or hundredth anime it is well worth checking out.",

            "review_title": "Good premise, major plot holes and repetitive themes",
            "content": "If there is one thing that Death Note has, it's a creative concept that could really lead to some very deep and interesting concepts. The show could've been deep and profound... HOWEVER it has nothing to say. While this isn't always bad, it just means this show is nothing but pointless entertainment. There is nothing truly unique about the show because it doesn't take the extra step to actually have a point.First let's get to the plot holes: This show has a lot and this is one of the worst things about this show: the character's will have huge shifts in character just to force the plot in a certain direction. This is frustrating because there are multiple occasions when Light should've been caught but huge character changes (or coincidences) occurred kept him from being caught. If Light is going to escape then I want him to escape fairly. No bending the rules. No forced plot. However, this series constantly forces the world to its will to make sure everything goes in a certain direction. This is cheap, unfair, and unsatisfying to the viewer.Imagine the ending to Thor 2. Why did the spears kill the bad guy in Thor 2 if the red mist was clearly established to protect him like a shield. Imagine if in the The Lord of The Rings the ring got destroyed by dropping it off of a 20 foot drop... even when it was established it was nearly invincible. This show doesn't do this once or twice, no, it does this CONSTANTLY. It will establish rules that are crucial to the survival of the characters and then it will break those rules just to throw in a \"plot-twist\". This is a blunder if anything else, because plot-twists only work if it fits in the plot. The show acts like it is being really clever but it isn't.Little plot-holes I noticed was: If someone dies by suicide, what is to make them die immediately? Couldn't the person go off and kill Kira and then commit suicide? How was Rem able to kill Watarai when that is clearly helping a human out? Why did Ryuk have a sudden character change of helping Light find the cameras even when before and after that episode he says that he won't help out? Why did Chief Yagami kill the thugs without giving them the right to surrender? This goes against his character. How did ANYONE survive the blast from that gang raid? Why in the WORLD WOULD THE COPS UNBUG LIGHT WHEN HE IS THEIR TOP SUSPECT!!! SERIOUSLY, HE IS THEIR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT AND WHEN LIGHT SAYS \"unbug me\" they unbug him. That is an example of a terrible character change/alteration. The characters were clearly established as thinking Light is their number one suspect, but when Light says \"unbug me... you know... just because\" they do it... how stupid.Trust me, there are a lot more.The other major issue with this show is that it is incredibly tedious. The same things happen in this fashion: Light is smart, someone chasing Light is smart, Light becomes friend with the chaser, chaser dies, Light is smart, someone chasing Light is smart, Light becomes friend with the chaser, chaser dies. The show throws in character after useless character that do nothing but just buy time for the show to be longer. Many \"new and unexpected\" characters start joining the show, but for very little purpose other than to make the show longer and bigger in scale.Overall, Death Note has some good in it, but it also has a lot of bad. The premise is a great one and a lot of the supporting cast (L, Near, Mello) are all very interesting and intriguing characters, the rest of the cast is dull and boring. Light has almost no motivation other than \"because I want to\" which makes him incredibly 2-dimensional. Why should we care about Light? He has no interesting qualities, he has no \"views\" and he has no personality other than being \"smart\". He is a walking plot-device. Even worse, his henchman (who's name escapes me) is an exact duplicate of Light but even more dull. It is a guy who is just obsessed with Kira and has a really stupid back-story: \"I kill people because I realized that students in High-School were mean\". The good parts of the show are mainly in its premise and a few of its really well done characters. Other than that, it turns out to be fairly disappointing and frustrating to watch.",

            "content": "Continuing my immersion in the world of anime, my choice to watch \"death Note\" was not accidental. I was recommended to watch it by many friends, and fan reviews made it clear that this is exactly what you should start your acquaintance with anime culture. It is not superfluous to add that according to a survey conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of culture of Japan, \"Death Note\" is ranked 10th among the best manga of all time. I dare say that after watching this extraordinary story, the plot of which I have not met before either in literature or in movies, my idea of the harmony of good and evil, as well as such a slippery concept as \"justice\", was greatly transformed.I especially want to emphasize the total unpredictability throughout the series, the exciting atmosphere, as well as, worthy of a separate analysis, the characters and reasons for certain actions of the main characters. Yagami light is not an ordinary schoolboy, in my opinion, and the further events develop, the more difficult it becomes to understand the motives of his actions. The coolness with which he sentences to death the people who fight him gradually negates the primary understanding of his naive views and ways to solve how to make the world a better place by taking the lives of avid criminals. The situation is completely different with the main opponent of light. \"L\", also known to us as ryuzaki, becomes much clearer and closer to me as the story progresses, and his attitude towards Light sometimes resembles that of a wise and kind doctor who actually feels compassion for the owner of the Notebook, rather than hatred. It is also interesting to follow the thoughts of the characters - in this anime, this part of the way the characters are revealed evokes the greatest response from me as a viewer.I can't wait to write about the music, which is so different and always emotionally and harmoniously reflects the mood and emotions on the screen. I'm probably not the only one who, after watching \"Death note\", found a few favorite tracks on the web, listening to which, by chance, you catch a stream of thoughts remote from the everyday bustle and think again and again about the eternal dispute about good and evil. After all, someone believes that good and evil are two irreconcilable sides, and you just have to decide which side to stand for in this life. Another opinion, which I share more, tells us that good and evil are two inseparable components of the nature of everything that surrounds us. But since I am an optimist, I will add a curious fact to this observation: the shadow, as we know, is the absence of light. Evil is the absence of good. But at the same time, light can exist without a shadow, but a shadow without the presence of light is impossible. And in fact, everything in this life is relative. After all, the undoubtedly brilliant light was not an evil person, not at all. It would be more applicable to include such vices and traits as pride and anger, naivety and the notorious youthful maximalism. And here you can't help but ask yourself, what would I do if I got my hands on that very Notebook? Would I be her hostage, like light? Thoughts about this evokes the same composition Hideki Taniuchi - \"L no Theme\". It is this exciting motif (among many no less significant in this anime) that has become the most heartfelt for me...\"Death note\" - anime, which is quite unfair to attach only to one genre of detective, looks in one breath just because of the amazing mix of narrative forms. The plot develops with you, and not always, sitting at the screen, away from the tense and restless human battles, you can confidently give your personal assessment of the decisions and actions of the main characters. Everything is so controversial that even the concept of \"justice\" ceases to be a significant criterion; for what is justice, which is different for each person, unlike the justice of other people? Light fancied himself a God, completely forgetting that God is not justice, but something else entirely!.. But the lover is not guided by justice, for as long as there is love, no one thinks about justice. It is no accident that the words so often occur in the centuries-old Epistles of the saints: \"Never call God just, or ask him for justice.\"\nI advise \"Death note\" to view all who are interested in serious, filled with deep meaning, not entertaining anime.",

Dragon Ball Z is a hundred times better than that to start with!\". First, I said 'I think' at the beggining of what I said, so that means It is my opinion. Second, I said that because I think the length of Death Note, the theme of it and the thought behind the anime is just perfect to start watching anime with it (Again, in my opinion). It REALLY makes you think and not just look at the TV with meaningless looking eyes. So that is an anime that makes you learn, think and have fun at the same time. What more could you want?!",

            "content": "Light, a Japanese high school student, finds a so-called Death Note, that enables the user to kill people by writing their names in it. He sets about cleansing the world of evil, while the police try to determine who he is... and stop him. This is the first anim\u00e9 series I watch, so I can't draw comparisons to others. It gets extremely visual at times, but at least half of the time, it isn't, particularly. The focus is on the writing, the twists, the mind games. There is a lot of cat-and-mouse going on, and we follow the investigation. Thankfully, both the law enforcement and our young lead are rather smart, so it is a very even match, and quite interesting to follow. In fact, at its best, this keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you'll find yourself watching multiple episodes in a row. At least until about the halfway point, after when it, at times, seems to not particularly move forward(and it suddenly decides to follow something that hasn't been brought up at all prior to that point, and sometimes soon after stops doing so). There are a few plot threads that go nowhere, or that could have been removed to tighten this up. The characters vary... L is awesome, definitely. We do have some that are clearly mainly comic relief, and yes, this does have a little of the silly humor that can be found in a lot of mainstream manga. The animation is nicely done, with some stunning moments and impeccable style. There is brutal, bloody, violent content in this. I recommend it to those who like the concept and want to see it explored, or anyone who enjoys this kind of detective thriller. 8/10.",

            "content": "Death Note (2006-7) is a 37 episode series I recently watched with my daughter on Hulu. The storyline focuses on a young man who discovers a book that upon touching unveils a Yugami that only he can see. The Yugami is a demon like creature that instructs him on the rules now that he has opened the book, one of which is every name written in the book leads to the person's death. A task force is identified to track down the young man when they start seeing patterns in his killings. A series of cat and mouse ensues between the young man and law enforcement. My daughter and I loved this series. The dialogue is great and the characters are both entertaining and frustrating. I couldn't help but think that the Netflix series Money Heist must have stole a lot of ideas from this series. There are a lot of clever aspects to this storyline and unpredictable moments. I also loved the animation style. Overall, this is an entertaining series that is entertaining for both adults and teenagers. I strongly recommend watching this and would score it a 9/10.",

The titular character Light Yagami who is Kira from the beginning and L are the two greatest and well written characters ever. This is mature without requiring any of the sex, alcohol and other stuff that other movies and tv shows need because they can't write a great mature story. The twists and turns with some of the things Light does, requires some 200 IQ writing. This show questions your morals and who you support keep in mind Light only kills the worst criminals.",

            "content": "This is a super-difficult anime series to describe--especially to those who are not anime lovers. This is because the plot is so totally bizarre and complex, but I'll take a stab at it: I death god (\"Ryuk\") is bored, so he drops a death notebook randomly to see what occurs when a mortal finds it. A brilliant high school student, Light, finds it and soon realizes that if he writes a person's name in it and concentrates on the face of that person, then they will die! At first, Light uses this notebook to kill off the evil scum of the world and he becomes a pop hero--though no one knows who is doing these murders or how they are done. Eventually, the police decide that murdering these scum is bad and try to put a stop to it (why, I don't know--he is performing a community service).At this point, most viewers will likely side with Light and the story isn't all that compelling. However, the writing is brilliant, as Light slowly transforms from a well-meaning young man to someone with a god complex--and a person willing to kill ANYONE--whether they deserve it or not. The anime really has a lot to say about the notion of power corrupting, though I would sure be willing to use a death notebook to see if I would be corrupted (look out DMV workers with an attitude and trial lawyers, here I come!).As is typical of any anime, the original manga is slightly different and the live-action movie is even more different yet. I advise you to give the series a try or watch the first movie (which is even better). Even if you are not a huge anime fan (and I am NOT), you'll enjoy it if you are willing to give it a try with an open mind.",

Death Note is a must-see for those who love to have a good 5 minutes of thinking because Death Note beautifully weaves suspense and unexpected turn of events that leaves the audience stunned and fascinated.You'll notice the good production, but to truly decide whether it's worth watching you will have to watch to the 2nd (and for those who are stubborn, the 3rd) episode. If you are planning to watch this for a limited of time, you're in luck because the series is only 37 episodes long since the manga already ended.While the IQ of the two main characters is straight-out impossible, you still cannot feel but admire just how logical their reasons for making possibilities and theories are (what makes it even scarier is that most of the theories that L or Light, the two protagonists, are true). If you are one who watches things from a personal view, you would have a hard time deciding whether the things they are doing are right and if they are, in reality, insane.There is slight humor that adds faint scratches on the anime, but it is soon covered up in the next minute with what a character has done or said. There was not a moment where I wasn't sitting at the edge of my seat, my eyes literally sticking to the screen. Every minute is worth watching, even the sinister theme songs played by Nightmare.What makes this anime/manga unique is that it's a mystery thriller where you hardly question the origins of something. You rarely ask yourself unanswerable questions (not even in the back of your mind) and without realizing, you're only focused on the present events.I promise, no matter what kind of audience you are, you will be gripped by this chilling life and death chain of events of a bored genius who kills criminals mercilessly with the mysterious Death Note.",

Those sharp writing skills cannot only be ascribed to the original manga but also all the people dedicated to adapt this story to a television format. That's why, when the writing doesn't hit as hard as it does in some episodes, you feel palled. It almost felt like you had to compensate for those edge-of-the-seat instants with some boring sub-plot that doesn't pay off until later in the show, and the cycle goes on again.The animation also feels incredibly inconsistent, even for a 2007 tv show. Those contrasts between those incredibly thorough backgruonds and character designs to some of the most pale and unsharp artwork really makes you feel disconnected.Finally, what basically EVERYONE has been talking and protesting about since the show's first airing -which I will complain about as well-: The sole fact that you can see the potential this show could've had if it was divided into two seasons the moment it peaked and then sharpen those pencils for the writing of a second season, it could've given a different -and better- outcome of a second half that already feels sharp, but not enough for the standards this show created for itself..",

The catch is that you have to think of their face and know their actual name for the power to work.The hook to this show is the amazing battle of wits that emerges between the main character and the leader of the investigative team who is trying to figure out who is killing criminals across the world en masse without having to be there to perform the execution.The last episode was so good, I watched it over and over again just to re-experience the awesomeness!

It got an unbelievable rating of 9 on IMDb, that's like the second highest rating of any anime show after the Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, which is at 9.1 .. well for me to narrate the synopsis of this show , well should I or should I not .. it's all about criminology after all .. there's a guy who discovers a notebook fallen from the Angel of Death from above . And whoever's name he writes in the notebook once he discovers it's powers literally dies within the mentioned seconds, and if he writes the cause of death then that person is gonna die in that same way. So this guy Light Moon Yagami, whose the main antagonist of the story is like the villain, he starts considering himself to be some sort of god for the people , and the new world which he creates . So this guy starts killing all the criminals from the world even those who weren't on death penalty that he hears about on the news but in the process whoever tries to stop him devilishly kills them too .. now the Japanese task force, when all hope gets lost to catch Light cause no one knew who was killing all the criminals or how did they just die with simple heart attacks if no cause of death was mentioned in the notebook .. call in a person who literally is never wrong about anything and never has he failed in catching criminals. Now Light Yagami cannot write his name in the Deathnote cause no one knows his true name even he himself doesn't know it so he just refers to him as L .. he gives the name Riyuzaki to the task force but that's not his real name either . But through the shinigami eyes that's the death angel's eyes one can see the real name of the person, but whoever takes those eyes reduces there lifespan to half, does Light take those eyes or does he get someone else to do it. Then how does L catch Light, This show is all about catching Light and putting him to justice . How do they do it is what this show is all about . Once you watch this show, you may never come across another show like it . This is literally the show of all shows.",

            "content": "After re-watching this again, I'm reminded how brilliant this anime was. Everything was there, the plot, the cinematography, the character development, the directing. Plus there was a lot of philosophy about morality, and life & death.Light was compelling at the meticulous killer for justice, Kira. In fact, the first episode with him is what draws you in. L was brilliant. There was something sad about L. L's death episode was very sad and good, tho I was disappointed they killed him off. He was a very deep character. The relationship between L and Light is almost like a love affair. They are frenemies. If it wasn't for Light's dark path that he chose, you get a sense they could be best friends, maybe more. Notice Light nor L ever really seemed interested in women. Light pretended with Misa Misa and Kiyomi. I got man-crush vibes from these two in their cat and mouse game.Misa Amane was annoying as hell. Yet I think deliberately so. She's a twit, yet very clever too. I think her screeching was the worst though. Uh boy. Ryuki, the Shinigami was hilarious and one of my favorite characters. Aizawa was probably the most interesting out of the police force team along with Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Matsuda really was an idiot, lol. Mikami's life story and role were really good, I thought.I think the series falters when they kill off L and bring in Near. There was no depth to Near, and he comes off as a smug little...um..something, and frankly robotic. He seems like a weak imitation of L. Why have an imitation when you can have the real thing? I think the ending was really good with Light finally getting caught. But I think it should have been written with L being the one to finally catch him. The series tries to promote that Near and Mello were really like L, so therefore L is the one that caught him. But this came off as very weak reasoning. I suspect that was written to \"make it ok\" that Near was the replacement for L. Yeah, nobody bought that.More weak writing when it's revealed that Mello teamed up with Near to finally catch Kira. It was like, did I blink and miss something? There was no developmental path that occurred that would suggest that Mello would suddenly change, or would even be willing to die to get Kira. In fact, the writing after L was killed wasn't as good as before that event. I wouldn't say it was awful, but just weak, and jarring with the sudden introduction of many new characters. Also, they wrote Light as being not as smart as Near and it became a bit cringeworthy in that sense. There are good parts after L, but the series just didn't have the same compelling dynamic afterward.Finally, there's the philosophy. I suspect a lot of people would agree with Kira. That evil people should be killed. But though one can understand the sentiment, especially if you are a victim, or family of a victim, the problem with it is that some people CAN be rehabilitated and can become good productive citizens. Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances, as well as social constructs such as extreme poverty, not to mention mental illness situations. Also, there ARE people who are charged and/or in jail that are innocent. To further demonstrate how wrong Light was, he DID kill good people such as the FBI agents and others that were working on the case. He made the mistake of thinking he was God, and his extreme hubris left no room for love & compassion for all of humanity. This is why he was evil. He was a psychopath. 10/10. (I thought about giving a 9 but took into account the overall awesomeness of the series.)",

            "content": "This is like the Prison Break or 24 amongst anime. Every episode is building up a certain tension, leading to the most nerve wrecking cliffhangers you can imagine. It fuels the drive for its viewers to watch the next episode as soon as possible. And I think that's the best thing about this show; the addictiveness of it. It is also a nice intellectuel ''chess'' game between great minds, the evil Kira and the noble L., both making their moves one at a time, trying to defeat the other one with cunning plans. At a certain point the story takes a slightly different approach by introducing some new characters that join this game. Most of my friends hate this, but I think it refreshens the battle between Kira and L. and gives it a new dimension. I can't be more specific without spoiling the plot. On a deeper layer it asks a philosophical question: is it alright to kill rapists and murderers without any trial? Will it make our world a better place? Answering that question may well spoil the show for you, so I'd suggest you better go watch it! This is anime in optima forma!",

But I'm glad I came here. Growing up, I watched Naruto (which I loved it but it was longggg-well fair length) , some of Dragon Ball Z (long as hell), some of One Piece ( that is long as hell) some of Inuyasha, some of Bleach and those Anime Movies like Spirited Away but let me tell you this was like a drug. I started watching skeptically, especially when I saw Ryuk. I was like \"demon flee,\" but it's not even like that; the storyline was out of this world-like it was like the book of life but death, and this dude who is young and smart but miserable finds it and hopes to do good but turns into a maniac. I know it's classified as a goth anime, but I laughed, I cried, I wanted to be as smart as the characters (cringe), and I was surprised. I like when anime doesn't give me what I expect-because believe me, I did not think L would die. Neither did I think the police officer would die, and so many people died in this that it made AOT look normal (that's a lie; don't listen to me), but there was some plot twist-I wasn't disappointed at all. The writer deserves the props he has gotten, because what was he thinking when he decided to make an anime about demons and monsters coming to the human world and watching humans kill people and make rules as well? I became an anime enthusiast after this show. (The minds of Japanese writers entice me.) Please, new anime viewers, start here; you won't have time to blink, and you may scream out loud at the plot twists now and then. And then you will build a binge-watching anime legacy for yourself; you're welcome.",

But suddenly we are surprised by the triumphant appearance of the greatest detective in the world using the nickname of L, it is at this moment that the spectators start to change chairs, thinking again about which of them is right, who is the true justice.(Bonus comment) I want to declare that Touta Matsuda is one of the characters I had the most affection for in the work, he is extremely funny, serious when necessary and proved that he is indeed useful filling Kira with accurate shots, a true gunslinger!",

The entire series goes like this:Protagoninst: Haha, I have this super plan that no one can stop. Arch enemy: AhAha, but I knew you would do that, so I did this. Now I got you! Protagonist: HAHA HA! I knew you knew I knew! So instead I did this! Arch enemy: WELL!!! I knew that you knew that I knew, so therefor I did this!! Also, f**k you! Repeat...And this goes on for every episode. Killing off the main opponent was a bold move, but replacing him with an identical kid, just younger, just didn't give anything story wise, you could have just kept \"L\" and the story would have been the same.

            "review_title": "The Best Anime of All Time",
            "content": "Introduction:\n'Death Note' is a perfect animated series of all time, and the first 25 episodes of the show, are some of the best episodes of any show ever put on television. A show with interesting characters, interesting philosophy, and interesting stories. 'Death Note' is a show for any fan of anime.The Story:\nCentering around a high schools honors student, named Light Yagami, that discovers a notebook that kills anyone who's name is written in it. Under the alias of \"Kira\", he plans to use it to kill off criminals and create a new world where he is god. However, he runs into a few issues, as the world's greatest detective, a man who goes under the alias of \"L\", is out to stop him from achieving his dream of his Utopian vision, and his extreme ideals on justice.I'm gonna get this out of the way, 'Death Note' is one of the most excellently written shows out there. From the ideas this show presents on the concept of justice, to the endless questions and discussions this show can bring. To the interactions between all the characters. And the excellent use of symbolism.With all that, the show leaves the viewer a question. Who is right? Who has the right concept of justice? \"L\" or \"Kira\"? On one hand, \"Kira's\" justice does get results. But the other hand, \"L's\" is a little more just. And in the show, we see how Light or \"Kira\" progressively worse, showing the cons of having this kind of power, and what it does to a person. It's honestly comparable to \"The Republic\" by Plato. However, \"L\" is no good guy either. He's willing to do truly evil and even illegal things that make him come across as more of an anti-hero. From using people as bait for \"Kira\", to breaking many laws, in his quest for \"Kira\".The concept of the \"Death Note\" is a scary one. A notebook that can kill people, just by writing a name in it. I just love the concept, and the show lives up to the concept. As to keep consistant with the world building, the \"Death Note\" has a very specific set of rules. And going over all of them would take too long, but the rules set in the show, prevent any potential confusion from the viewer.To Conclude the story section of this review, \"Death Note\" contains truly amazing writing. Some of the best writing of any television series, the show kept me invested while I was watching, and allowed to think about it, when I wasn't watching it.The Characters:\nBoth \"L' and \"Kira\" are two of the best characters in all of anime, or even just fiction. This show could've just made \"L\" and \"Kira\" opposites, one is willing to kill, one isn't, but it's a little more complicated. \"L\" and \"Kira\" in my opinion, are more similar. They both have a sort of childish view of justice, and stubbornly stand for their ideas, and aren't willing to computerize, or see the contradictions in their arguments. Both have an extreme view, but one is clearly more extreme than the other. Light believes that a perfect world should be ruled by one god (himself). And \"L\" simply thinks a world without crime is not achievable. And even though Light mainly kills criminals, he's not against killing the innocent, if they get in the way of his plans. \"L\" is not willing to murder the innocent, but he does use them for his own means.\"L\" and \"Kira\" are not the only interesting characters in the cast. As this show has an amazing supporting cast; and choosing my favorite is difficult. Chief Yagami is a pretty interesting character, as he is the father of Light, creating an interesting dynamic between the entire cast. Misa is interesting as she's a supporter of \"Kira\" and is willing to do anything for him. And many others in the cast.However, my favorite supporting character, is Ryuk, as what is called a Shinigami, and was the creature that put the \"Death Note\" on Earth for someone to find, it just so happened it was Light. Just the way Ryuk is simply an observer, not really on a side watching the events happened, as to quote him, \"Humans are so interesting.\" he watches because he is just bored, and just wants something interesting to happen. Plus, the vocal performances in both the English and Japanese dubs is great.Speaking of that, the voice acting is amazing to hear, as they clearly put all their best effort into their performances.The Animation:\nThe animation of this series is a beauty to look at. From the detailed designs, to the nice use of color. The animation style is beautiful, and I don't need to say anything else, sense I think just by looking at it, anyone can tell how good the animation is.Conclusion:\n\"Death Note\" is an amazing example of how to write a good story, that raises questions, and crafts an entertaining series, that any fan of animation or storytelling, can appreciate, and fall in love with, like I did.",

It hits some rough spots, the second half or so (after the first 15 or so episodes) isn't as great as the first half, but the final two episodes are magnificent and end the series on a very high note.

The music in this anime is not just random crap, it fits well with every character, the music is well thought out. You will listen it later on when you will complete this series. Tip: do watch its analysis on internet after you finish it. Because there are many things that you may miss. Apart from being thriller, detective this series is very philosophical.",

I wont lie, my knowledge of anime is not great and this is one of the few I have seen, and, embarrassingly enough, I haven't even seen Akira (please don't hurt me Anime fans). However, when I watched Death Note, I am more captivated than almost any other movie or show on lately. I got the first 4 episodes on Disc about 4 weeks ago, and now I am up to Episodes 14-16, and I am still captivated. The stories are extremely complex and multi-layered with great discusser issues to it, and great characters. Nobody ever feels safe, you honestly believe anyone of them could die at any turn, and the stories are very well paced, thought out and believable. Another great part of the series is the Music, the music works very well and gives you a early feeling of the type of show you are witnessing. Also, the animation is very top rate, it looks brilliant and is very convincing. The introduction of L, of Misa and Rem, of the Universitie episodes where Light and L meet, the whole issue of both Kira's, the story gets better and better, and each episode whets your appetite for more. It would be interesting to see how it would have been if this was a Live-Action series, but then again, don't look a gift-horse in the mouth. Truly brilliant series, and deserves recognition all over the world.",

A lot of people state that the show will lose some of its charm after the 25th episode (the death of L) and i cant say i totally disagree with the claims. For me L was my favorite character and losing him that soon made me both sad, but also concerned about the contents of the remaining episodes. Near and Mellow just didnt feel just as great as L did, and they didnt have the same dynamic and interesting interactions like L and Light always did. At the same time people pointed out the sloppiness of Light, and how out of character it was of him. But thats where i would kind of disagree.To me Light is of course calculated and intelligent. But one of his other strong traits is his pettiness and big ego. Same as the time he killed the man on tv claiming to be L in the first episodes without thinking clearly. After L dies Light loosens up more because he starts thinking he've won. He gets so in his head, that he starts making slip ups and take his chances to be a show off instead of remaining cool and calculated. Like his \"I won\" in the last episode. That's why the ending is so perfect and reminds me of the last season of Breaking Bad. I had a feeling where it was going all along. Same as Breaking Bad. I knew no happy ending was awaiting Light. He was getting too selfassured and cocky, he didnt even mind killing those closest to him all that mattered was being seen as a god and winning the \"game\".His patethic desperation in the last episode hits so much harder after all the build up. He's been so pompous throughout the entire show, so seeing him in a situation where he's trying to come out on top but has lost all control is painful. He tries so desperately to be the god character he has spent years establishing and knowing that there is no way to go, he starts pulling at straws and we see a side of Light we don't even recognize. Even his dramatic monologues fall flat, failing miserably and ends with him being shot, lying in pain on the dirty ground in the warehouse. In this pain he even realizes that he might miss the relationships he took for granted - Misa who he never even seemed to pay a second thought before.And the way he dies, with the light hitting him gloriously on the stairs, killed by none other than the shinigami, Ryuk.This is the kind of ending I hate after watching, but grow to love over time. And I couldn't have wished for a more perfect and absolutely grim ending to a serious and bittersweet story such as Death Note. But that's just my opinion on it of course.",

            "content": "Before, I goes into this critic, I just want to make it clear that I didn't dislike this show. In fact, there is only one mistake in that show, but this mistake is so big, that in my opinion it justifies the 4 points that it lost.First, The concept is excellent, at the very beginning you even don't know in which team you stand, because the motivation and the fact that Light is able to reduce the rate of crime is great, but it also make you think about the meaning of justice.Second, you have some very powerful moments that changes completely the plot like the death of Raye Penber or the one Naomi Misora. Aswell as the last scenes of the show in which Miss Amane kills herself, or the one of Light.\nBut the two first were especially important, because they mark the point where you notice that Light is now ready to kill innocent to achieve his goal then you realize that he is more and more evil as the story progress.Now for the big error that I was talking about, the biggest mistake is the characters of Near and L. Those characters are simply here to put a challenge on Light, but there are not as well written as him. In fact, on that side I think that they have suspicion on Light too fast, throughout the whole show, they don't show any emotions, and they jump to conclusion unrealistically fast. This is why I think that approximately the half of the series where you see them investigate is boring, unrealistic, and repetitive. The beginning was way more full of emotions and heartbreaking scene.Finally, I have to admit that after the torture scene of Miss Amane, I didn't show anymore understanding to L, he want Light to be executed like Light execute murderers, but for me that is not the true justice, he would do exactly what Light did. He has no remorse for anything like Light, but for me the part that made me decide that L was really the bad guy after all is that he don't even hesitate too torture Misa. I'm almost certain that Light wouldn't have torture anyone.",

            "content": "It is indeed very good, plot twists and turns, with a excellent idea and chain of events that will leave you shocked, intrigued and some small laughs at times. The progression of Light is interesting to see; from a hard-working senior student with great morals and goals, to a man that slowly loses himself in attempt to create the \"ideal\" world. Though I have one complain, the character arc of Light is rushed, he instantly decides he wants to rule the world, leaving him no time to think or for us to see what is really going on in his mind, which could lead us to not really love the character all too much but on the plus side; It is very fun to watch light come up with these genius, slick and insane ideas to get what he strives for. My verdict: 8.3/10 (so far) I am only five episodes in so my opinion could very well change, but for the mean time i must say: good idea, good plot, excellent character progression, with a moderately rushed character arc. Excellent series so far i reccomend watching.",

            "content": "The Death Note manga is a socialist artwork between a painter and a writer. But in fact the person who is credited with elevating this manga to such status is the writer and author (Tsujumi Oba). This person weaved an interwoven plot with strong and pivotal turns at all times, and even made sure that his plot was wrapped in a difficult police character. Unlike all other police work, Death Note is one of those works that took the general concept of policing and transformed it completely to serve a different purpose. These plots are known to be a group of benevolent characters, pursuing a group or another evil person. And in these plots, the matter is not personal or mostly psychological. But in this work of art, the matter took over time personal curves that led to unexpected turns in the plot.Therefore, when we transfer the axes of the plot from the general axes of all the characters to the private axes of two particular characters, we are really here to make matters completely personal, and the personalization of the situation here led to pushing each of them to exert all possible effort and strength in order to achieve victory, whatever the cost or means. Made for it. In this anime, the writer placed the chase between (person) and (person). And each of them has a very high IQ, and each of them is able to carry out the most heinous crimes without leaving a trace of him, and even turn the tables on their owners at any moment. But one of them chose the path of truth, and the other chose the path of falsehood. Now in this anime, we see literally two people who can be called (god) in relation to cunning and the ability to reach the end by harnessing the capabilities of the mind. Here we witness the struggles of the ancient (Olympian) gods once again on the ground, but with false identities and endless pursuits. And between this and that, we find that events escalate and the plot begins to twist little by little until we find ourselves in front of mind-blowing events and fueling emotions in an unimaginable way.",

They were the two smartest brains in the world. I think, if the makers could have added the part of Light's personal life in the 2nd half so that would've also created interest in watching. I slept many times in 2nd half of it. Not the expected end... Just some foolish way to end because all brain's capacity, they've been using had finished. Last episode really disappointed me because i was expecting Light to win this time. Anyways i am giving 5 stars because of 1st half and getting my frustration out here. Thank you.",

            "content": "WOW. Death Note might very well be the very best TV shows I have ever seen. The anime is very well made also. It has a very intellectual side to it, because you never know who is gonna win the battle. Death Note presents a contest of wits between Light Yagami, who can kill criminals from the privacy of his bedroom, and the detectives seeking his identity, who know only that criminals are dying under mysterious circumstances and that they too might be killed from afar if their identities become known. As a psychological thriller, the action of this series is almost entirely mental or conversational, as each antagonist attempts to out-think the other: taking risks which might reveal their enemies' identities, or expose their own. Also interesting are the many moral quandaries the series poses. MUST WATCH!",

Light acts completely out of character and makes some truly stupid mistakes when we were shown throughout the series he was a genius. The L ripoff named Near made utterly ridiculous assumptions that were always correct which led to lights \"defeat\" and then he has the audacity to claim that he surpassed L. What a joke. If you disregard lights poor final plan, N won due to complete luck and a stupid mistake of lights subordinate. So disappointing to see the \"good always beats evil\" cliche ruin a show that definitely would have been better without it.",

It is classic anime with good animation, good music, good plot, intense head to head battle between lead and detective..\nIn second season things went down. But i still enjoyed every episode..

            "content": "Death Note was a fun short series to watch and very different from anything I've ever experienced. There were a lot of elements of the show, at least in the first half, that was very unpredictable and unique. The series started out very strong with the character/story building, overall darkness and introducing new ideas to the viewer but as the series progresses the story starts to slowly become less intriguing. Once it got about half way through, it started to become very repetitive and predictable.There is a reason why this series was so short and that's because the overall plot was doomed to hit a dead end. They over did it with the passing on of the notebook, giving it to multiple people. I loved the idea of a second Kira, especially when I found who it was. But then Random characters with absolutely no back story popping up out of no where getting possession of the notebook and getting such a huge responsibility and role in the story was a huge turn off. It made the death note insignificant imo, and took away from its grandness in the story.L carried the story and his fate was extremely disappointing, not necessarily because he died but how early in the series he was killed off. I found myself losing focus on the TV many times in the second half of the series. They depended on Kira to carry the story forward but he was so predictable in the second half. They introduced new characters to carry on such a big role filling L's shoes with N and Melo and they expected the viewer to accept them as the heroes who ultimately claim victory over Kira. It was so random and kind of annoying to be honest.But all in all, I really enjoyed the first half. I'd give the first half of the series a 10/10 and the second half a 3/10. Overall a 7/10. Definitely shouldn't be in the 9/10 club. It's not on the same level of the AOT's and Breaking Bads of the world.",

            "review_title": "An intense supernatural thriller involving mind-games between two geniuses which unfortunately suffers a big decline in quality in its 2nd part",
            "content": "Summary: Dark, atmospheric and complemented by fitting soundtracks, Death note, built upon the dynamics of two polar opposite geniuses playing mind-games as they try to out-maneuver each other at every step, takes the over-the-top nature of anime and combines it with a certain degree of realism, making the perfect formula for a powerful thriller involving tense, complex situations which aren't entirely nonsensical. Unfortunately it is good only for the first half of the show which is a completely self-contained story by the way. The second part fails in multiple ways as it tries to imitate the first half but lacking its heart, only manages to extend it unnecessarily and taint its reputation.The shows consists of 37 episodes, 25 of which make the fabulous first half.Premise: It has unique premise involving a supernatural item called Death note, a notebook which can kill anyone whose name is written on it and whose working is described in a pretty detained manner. It falls into the possession of a genius teenager who wants to use it to 'cleanse the world from criminal filth' by killing them off and becoming a symbol of fear and justice but before that he must deal with a certain 'world's greatest detective' who is set to stop this arrogant abuse of power.First I'll discuss the first half of the show; how it keeps the viewers interested, what are its good points and what are the aspects that felt underwhelming.How does it captures the viewers interest?A large chunk of the show involves:1. A spirit of rivalry between the main character Light Yagami and the antagonist detective L. Both share moments with each other as suspect and detective. Both are very interesting characters and have some qualities completely opposite to each other, so its interesting to see them juxtaposed. For eg: Light is a liar and a narcissist. He can be charming whenever he wants to be. He deals with problems in a clever but straightforward way. L on the other is honest, doesn't care about how others see him, is quirky and awkward and unorthodox and unpredictable in his way of dealing with things. At the same time both the characters are similar to some extent. Both are very intelligent and are represented as a symbol of justice, when in truth neither care about justice so much as they do about being right and satisfying their ego . L just wants to be right about his conclusions and Light uses his twisted sense of justice to satisfy his God complex.2. L coming up with clever ways to catch the mysterious, 'supernatural' killer of criminals, that surprises the audience, a feeling shared by the side characters who work with him as well. I find it somewhat amusing when side characters analyse, appreciate and act surprised at the main characters doing extraordinary stuff because of how over-the-top and overused it is. Since L is dealing with a supernatural enemy he knows nothing about, he looks for patterns and tries to figure out, how the killer works.3. Light also exploring and experimenting with the working of the death note. The notebook which kills anyone whose name is written on it. What if two or more people share the same name? What will be the cause of their death? Can the cause be altered? To what degree? Its interesting to learn about such an elaborate system.4. Light coming up with an equally clever way to deal with L's plans. You can even hear Light's monolgues about his thought process which makes everything more intense and interesting to follow. Light finds himself in situations that can ruin everything he has worked for, yet he thinks of something clever and works up to get the desired result which is difficult to achieve. This creates a strong sense of thrill. In the beginning episodes, Light goes to many different places to deal with different kinds of situations on the spot. This kind of traveling, change of environment always feels great.5. Light showing the kind of person he is. Its interesting because Light is one heck of a character. Although usually stoic, nonchalant and reserved, Light is very expressive when it comes to his secret life of 'bringer of justice'. His reactions to whenever he outwit anyone, is a sight to behold. The sly smile followed by crazy maniacal laughter if the place allows it, the desperate obsession to 'defeat' L is really interesting to watch.The good points:1. It has one of the most intriguing beginning. It will get you hooked instantly.2. A very interesting main character. His traits complement each other. These include stoic personality, a detachment from life because its boring, a disgust for filthy criminals, sociopathic personality, narcissism, asexual orientation, high intelligence, ability to socialize and act charmingly whenever required etc. His monolgues and thinking process are interesting to hear, plans are clever and the sheer amount of chaotic aura he emits whenever someone innocent who dared to challenge him falls a victim to his scheming, is beautifully depicted. He is a true villain main character.3. A perfect antagonist, who as mentioned before shares many similarities and differences with the protagonist. His cleverness combined with quirkiness is charming in its own way.4. The show doesn't take sides. It doesn't put L on a pedestal and treats Light as a villain destined to lose. You can root for either. One can't predict who will win the battle of wits.5. Its very thrilling, intense and clever. One genius trying to manipulate the other. One with supernatural aid, other with the aid of the law system and organization. Both finding themselves in tense situations and trying to outwit their rival. The things that lead to the situations and the characters' way of handling it is sufficiently believable. What makes a situation thrilling? There are many factors like the viewers must care about the characters, the stakes must be high, the outcome unpredictable, the actions believable, the directing, silence, music etc. Based on these criterias, Death note is indeed a great thriller.6. Elaborated rules about the working of the supernatural elements i.e. Death note.7. The last two episodes and the ending is really good.8. The visuals. Dark, atmospheric, beautiful, unique. It has a gothic feel in 2000s setting. Sometimes everything becomes sepia, while only L and Light's hair remain blue and red colored respectively which looks really cool. The tall glass buildings at night or dusk is something you'll get to see frequently and its beautiful. Visuals also include character designs and they are perfectly fitting to each character. Light's stoicism, charm and villanous aura and L's calmness and quirkiness are perfectly encapsulated by their respective designs. The artstyle is one of the most beautiful in all of fiction. However the animation while good, could've been better or clearer.9. The music. Again, one of the best ost set in all of fiction. Perfectly fits the visual style and the feeling the anime wants to evoke. The music has a Christian feel to it. Infact, some of the music is inspired from Gregorian chant. It has lots of ominous music that Light would love to hear while celebrating his victory with a smug smile after crushing innocent lives for the 'bigger good'. It also has the music that can be described as the sound of high functioning sociopaths thinking. The intro and outro are also perfect. The second opening in particular which is a metal music evoking the feeling of sheer insanity.The bad points:1. Death note isn't exactly rational fiction. The individuals and organizations must act in a believable manner with as little plot convenience as possible. Sometimes the characters may not take the best or safest decision, or may come up with a plan involving too much convenience or luck.2. Even the first half of the show isn't perfect in terms of enjoyment. There are certain plot points which undermine aspects that made the show good. For example the rivalry between Light and L as well as the villanous nature of Light is temporarily thrown out of the window in the middle of the series for reasons I can't reveal without spoiling. At the beginning of the show, in the first 10 or 11 episodes, Light used to go to different places and deal with various kinds of problems or situations on the spot. This outgoing nature of Light and thus the plot becomes less relevant as the show progresses. As I have already mentioned before countless times, the rivalry between L and Light and the villanous nature of Light drives the show. Without it, there isn't a lot to keep the audience interested. As a result, the quality shakes slightly during the middle of the first part of the show. Anyway the dip in quality isn't too big and the last 2 episodes of the first part and its ending makes up for it.3. A female character named Misa Amane, a young goth girl with blonde hair plays a very important role in the anime. Unfortunately she is an obsessive simp for Light, who behaves in a dumb manner and is treated as a comic relief. Her character is obviously exaggerated and obsession with the leader or idol of a cult (as Light's action become more and more noticeable, people start supporting the mysterious bringer of justice) isn't entirely impossible but Misa is not a very interesting character and is somewhat incongruous to the tone of the series.4. Sometimes, the show can become too over the top.Now coming to the 2nd part of the show. I'll keep it short.Good points:The last two episodes and the ending. It was very intense. There were some problems with the ending but it was as good as the ending of the first half of the show if not better, especially in terms of raw emotion.The animation and music was still good ofcourse.Bad points:Tries to imitate the first half but lacks everything that made it good. The new characters weren't very interesting. The cleverness of the show was gone. The pacing was too fast. Felt nothing while watching it.",

            "review_title": "Absolutely mediocre!",
            "content": "I believe that every favorable review for this title is coming from persons who watched the show only until 25th episode, because there is absolutely no chance this show would get so good reviews based on all episodes, since the ones from episode 25 are just... blah... (sigh)\nSo here's is my opinion, an opinion coming from a guy who watched the entire series and reviews it as a whole. An my verdict is simple: This is the most inconsistent show ever put to screen. The first 11 episodes are awesome with some of the greatest moments ever put to the smaller screen, then comes around 15th till 17th episode some great moments, and then from there the show lost it's tempo and never recovered it. Then aside from 23th, 24th, 25th, 29th and 32th episode the rest is just generic anime that compared to those great episodes seems like garbage.\nI don't understand how many people consider this as one of the best anime since it has some huge problems, especially about character and story.\nThe Character: Light Yagami is very one-sided character from the beginning. I remember when he found the death note he acts as he has an inside turmoil about keeping the death note or not, seeming as if he knows what the death note is from the moment he first saw it. It seemed so in your face along with countless other moments throughout the show where I was like: \"Why is that happening? What's the reason/logic?\". Next, his motivation has no background. He wants to bring justice because he is bored? Is that really a motivation? Usually a human being wants to bring justice because events that either shaped his life or someone who he cares about. Here? Nothing... absolutely nothing. More, he wants to become god of the new world... again why?... don't know... the same reason most of the Hollywood villains want to do bad things and that's because they want and maybe can. The show even went so far as to give \"L\" background before his death and give background and motivation to the fourth \"Kira\" instead of Light who was THE MAIN CHARACTER and the one we should understand and feel for... but nah... there is room for filler and other nonsensical stuff.\nStory: The story is interesting only in the episodes I mentioned above... the rest is just filler due to the fact that the show introduces characters and situations that are just not interesting and at one point repetitive. The story was interesting until the 25th episode with a few exceptions because there were so many drastic things that happened that made you think \"what more can happen now that can be better than this?\" well the show up until a point improved upon every previous great moment. But from the 25th the story became a rehash of the first 25 episodes but faster and more ridiculous. The death of \"L\" was the most bold thing this show did and maybe any other show did. But they should have continued it with something different not the same with different characters that were just boring. For example at the beginning of episode 26 we see a video that is pretty much a compilation of all the proves \"L\" got all along the case. I expected that to be a background plan of \"L\" to make the other people in the task force doubt Light(since he was a suspect and even imprisoned at one point) and bring him down in the end. What did the show did? The same thing it did before episode 25: bring another \"L\" called \"Near\" that was just way too over powering that eventually brought Light down, who after episode 25 got dumber and dumber eventually reaching the lows of childish behavior somewhere around the end of episode 36 and 37. All these scream inconsistency which is a problem that many TV shows have, and honestly I would rather prefer a medium TV show like \"Person of Interest\" that had clever writing and action that improved each season and showed that the writers had ideas, rather than watch a show that has some great moments followed by stupid filler and repetitive stuff.\nIn conclusion, this is another overrated TV show that just wasted my time overall, even if it had some of the greatest moments in TV history those were unfortunately followed by repetitive and stupid stories. 7/10 from me.",

The beauty lies within the main character, he starts with noble intent, meant to make you believe he is a hero, and he quickly looses that and by the end is an insanely being who sees himself as a god. On the other hand we have L. A literal opposite of Light,, to the point that it is obvious they could never see eye to eye. The ending doesn't pull any punches in its moral of power being a catalyst for corruption. It deserves its place as a favorite in every corner of the world. 11/10.",

It will make you question life and everything in between.As a whole Death Note is a low 8 (in my opinion: 290 = t \u00f7 37), with an amazing start and an amazing end. Death Note is a brilliant concept with a surprisingly high execution. The series takes some turns that may fail in fulfilling quality expectations, but that ends up being quite necessary for a worthy finale.The real evil is the power to kill people. Someone who finds himself with that power is cursed. No matter how you use it, anything obtained by killing people can never bring true happiness, and thus a great unfortune to the one that finds the notebook of death. And bad luck will follow that person that is pursued by a God of Death.There is no heaven or hell. No matter what you do while you're alive, everybody goes to the same place once you die. Death is Equal. However, justice is thus a divine judgement and a one greater motivation to be righteous. Laws aren't perfect, because humans who created laws aren't perfect. It's impossible to be perfect, which Death Note brilliantly shows. But laws are evidence of peoples good will.\n\"You have lost, Light. Didn't I say in the beginning, when you die, the one who'll write your name down in a notebook will be me? That is the deal between the Shinigami and the first human to get their hands on the note in the human world. Once you enter prison, I don't know when you'll die. It's annoying to wait. Your life is already over. You'll die here.\" Ryuku.",

A Wonderful concept like in Hindu Religion Yamraj's (God of Death) Notebook drop into Earth and then how humans use it to get benefitted from it!The main thing focused here in this entire series is 'Justice',which is definitely different in every persons prospectives. But I would say The Ending of the Series is Just goddamn Perfect. It have to be Like this! Because whenever humans get some Supernatural Extraordinary Powers, Sooner or Later they're gonna use it Like their own Choices (or At their Point of Views).They can't be Stick into the Holy path, because killing someone is definitely a sure-shot crime, whether it's a criminal or whatever! So here I will surely giving a Big Applause to the Writers of this Series..The Second half (especially after 25th episode) the show became little bit slow and new characters were introduced to us, which is just a little bit boring part for some of it's users but it will again hold it's fast screenplay and storyline very soon...I will go with 9 Out of 10 Stars for sure, because this series not only entertained me very much but also gived me very High Morals. Just reduced 1 star because of that later half's slowness, otherwise A Masterpiece to Watch. Definitely Recommending to everyone. You can watch it with family as well, because it doesn't have any kind of parental guidance or heavy graphic violence type things.",

The ending is unpopular but necessary to prove the point of the show's writers', that good eventually does triumph over evil.The show has many themes and is thoroughly entertaining and is definitely a must watch for the general public and especially for those who enjoy tense and thrilling shows as this show keeps you on the edge of your seat for its entire runtime and you're left wondering what is L or Light's next move, and rooting for whoever you resonate the most with.",

            "content": "Here's a show that proves once you begin a kill list, there won't ever be an \ud83d\udd1a to it.DN is an intricate mouse trap of a chess game. Being fairly new to anime, DN is unlike anything else I've seen. Don't expect any laughs, DN is as utterly cheerless as it is enthralling. Don't expect any warmth, either: DN is all head, no \u2764.Light Yagami is like many other anime protagonists. In the West, we are charmed with teen girl warriors, and in the East, they can't get enough of brave & daring high IQ'd teen males who embody cold-blooded, paralyzing logic. I've since seen Code Geass and Kaguya sama which also feature masculine protagonists who have all their logical \ud83d\udd10tumblers in place, quite similarly to Light. {The adorable and funny Kaguya sama actually involves a HS r\ud83d\udc93mance, so it has plenty of heart, and Code Geass involves a widescale rebellion, a family tearing itself apart, and an emperor that plans to kill God, but it's warmer than DN by far, just as a reference.}Doubtless there's dozens, if not \ud83d\udcaf's of these anime dudes. That's a good thing, especially for enlightening our minds. Light Yagami is such. He's a brilliant HS student, residing in a loving, well-adjusted home with mom, his detective father, and his sister. He is #1 in his class, and headed for a bright, full of light, future. He's also interested in a smart & practical girl that is much like him, Kiyomi Takada.Light's life alights on a new path when he crosses paths with a strange \ud83d\udcd3. Light uproots the volume from the ground without pausing to reflect on its strange allure. On the blackest of black covers is written: Death Note. Inscribed inside are rules, or operating instructions:1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.3. If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.The \ud83d\udcd3 also has the caution that users are not permitted to go to heaven nor hell, but will rather face oblivion.Nevertheless, after watching a horrific newscast about Kurou Otoharada, who killed 6 people before taking hostages at a nursery school, Light, out of anger and disgust, decides to try it out.It worked like magic. It works... like... it's supernatural.GAME \ud83c\udfb1NLight starts \u3030\ud83d\udd8b names in the \ud83d\udcd3 every day - after his homework\ud83d\udcda is done, of course. He can rid the world of its most heinous villains! He is doing good work! He can recreate society. He applies\ud83d\udd0d himself in the same manner that he's adopted for schoolwork. Scouring the \ud83d\udcf0, he has no trouble finding names worthy of inscription, in our world of trouble.It doesn't take long for law enforcement to realize there's a mysterious killer afoot. Even though the targets are, arguably, deserving of their fates, this killer is breaking the law by, from the shadows, taking on the role of judge and executioner. (We all know police can't stand vigilantes. No one likes being shown up). The investigation begins. Eventually, a group of world famous detectives get involved, which is when the real fun starts. The rest of the show is \ud83d\udc31-and-\ud83d\udc2d, the hunter and the prey, next the prey becomes the hunter. Who is the \ud83e\udd85, and who's the \ud83d\udc3f? And around it goes. It's a supreme battle of deductive reasoning, strategems, and wits, and it is terribly clever.Light starts to become corrupted by the power he's obtained. Having not read the manga, it isn't clear if the very DN\ud83d\udcd3 itself is corrupting, but certainly, human nature alone is plenty sufficient to wholly rot the core of a person who is afforded absolute power. The tragedy of human nature is that most individuals believe they are better than that; that they would only use this power for good.Even so, it's smooth riding shotgun with Light, until the cops start closing in. As all the initial deaths occurred in the vicinity of Tokyo, the culprit's likely location is pinpointed as being there. In order for Light to avoid arrest and continue his virtuous work of creating a new and better \ud83c\udf0f, what will he do? Will Light become dark?Another aspect of the DN\ud83d\udcd3 is that once a human touches it, they can see Shinigamis. Shinigamis are the reapers who own the \ud83d\udcd3\ud83d\udcd3\ud83d\udcd3. It is their job to \u3030\ud83d\udd8b & deal death at the proper time. Once in awhile, Shinigamis misplace their DNs\ud83d\udcd3. Sometimes they'll do it on purpose; especially when they're bored. The creepy looking guy in the show's artwork is Ryuk, the owner of the DN\ud83d\udcd3 that Light found. He becomes Light's constant companion. Ryuk seems easygoing, and he has a sufficient sense of humor. As long as he gets \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e to eat (his one obsession) he's no trouble. As Ryuk is, in all respects, enjoying his time and particularly his discussions, with the bright Light, Ryuk's attentions and flatteries only embolden Light more.The manga and the show take place over several years. The timeline is from November, 2003, when Light first picks up the DN\ud83d\udcd3, until early 2011. We'll see Light \ud83c\udf93 school and become a detective himself, working on the taskforce assigned to catch the killer, who has taken the moniker, \"Kira\".Eventually, governments, the media, and the mobs weigh in on Kira. Everyone has an opinion, right? Even a mature and carefully virtuous person might succumb to out-of-control pride with all of these multiplying factors, but when we first meet Light, he seems considerate, thoughtful, and modest about his accomplishments. How would worldwide attention affect him?DN has become my prototype example of all-head-no-\u2764 anime. One can easily infer from the name that there's a fair amount of killing in the show. As my temperament is on the softer side, DN dem\ud83d\ude1fralized me a little. I was often sad as I watched. However, it's too good to not keep watching. Small doses was the \ud83d\udddd for me.On one hand, claiming that DN is 'merely intellectual curiosity about unmitigated power over life and death' could be an excercise in feeding the monster that's in each of us. Only by nurturing the good within can we quiet the brute. On the other hand, DN is an honest look at the human condition and how our choices can slowly corrode us, if we aren't careful.Regardless, DN is outstanding. Periodt. It has passionate fans, many of whom consider it in company with the all-time great mangas/anime. They have their valid arguments. DN delivers the goods, without question. While it's high quality throughout, the last handful of episodes are decidedly riveting. The exciting outcome is not revealed until the final episode, which is titled: New World.Not superficial for one moment, DN is also an examination of justice and society. One character spouts: \"Evil must be deleted. There are only good\u2b1c and bad\u2b1b people.\" While many readers/watchers may feel that way about many individuals or groups these days, (particularly about those on the opposite political spectrum) it's rigidly simplistic thinking; it would create a brutal culture. True justice punishes wrongdoing for the good of society.{Justice and forgiveness are wholly unique in perspective, btw. Justice is corporate, being by community\ud83c\udfdb for the benefit of community, while forgiveness is personal, and practiced for our own good. Forgiveness is allowing one to put a person and event behind them, in order to move on. Forgiveness does not allow an offender to inhabit one's brain, which h/s otherwise would. Don't carry the weighty burden of offenses with you. Free yourself. Ain't nobody sayin it's easy. Forgiveness is hard. I find I'm only able to forgive with divine help. Sometimes, it doesn't stick, & a repeat cycle is necessary. As important as it is, forgiveness does not negate the need for justice, though.}Regardless of the full spectrum of my reactions along the way, when the final credit rolled (I was immobile during the closing music) the only conclusion to be drawn is that DN is a true thrill. The artwork, sound, voices, directing, and editing are crisp & skillful. The English voice actors for the dubbing were excellent as well. The last shot is beautifully eerie.In summary, DN is mandatory for those who are interested in anime or a good dectective story. It's a shining milestone on anime's path to world domination. Write it on your list.Case closed.IMHO...\n\ud83c\udfac8 \ud83c\udfad8 \ud83d\ude050 \ud83e\udd1410 \ud83c\udfa87 \ud83c\udf1e0 \ud83c\udfb58 \u26a19 \ud83d\udd1a10Age 14+",

And in many cases, this represents that we are about to watch. A god who will bless those who follow his teachings, and strike a storm on those who don't.\nDeath note is a show about Yagami Light who finds a notebook on the school grounds. Someone must have dropped it. This catches Light's attention. So after class, Light checks the same place to see if the notebook is gone, which it isn't. He takes the notebook and reads the next on it, which says that \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die\".\nLight drops the note and walks away thinking that it's a sick joke, but something makes him take it home anyway.\nHe decides to try it out, and it works. Light has found a way to kill anyone. He has become a god.And if I had to describe the show in one sentence, it would be that Light tries to become a god. With the accompanying sacral score and dramatic animation, we see how Light's mind works. How his god complex is affecting him.But even though Light is the character that makes everything work IMO, it is L who makes it all stick.\nL is the \"detective\" character who is introduced as the contrast to Light. He is very unpredictable, quirky and calm. But even though they're personalities are different, they're \"intellectual levels\" aren't. L is the only one in Lights way. And that is what makes L's character work so well. Even when similar characters are introduced in the last third, they could never compete with L.This is both a problem and a blessing.\nCause L works best when Kira is active. Both of them work the best when both are active (BTW, this doesn't really have anything to do with the story. Just my opinion on the characters). And so when one of them isn't, my enjoyment suddenly changed. And if you have seen the show (Which I hope you have), you know why I bring this up. Cause when a little more than a third of the show has gone, Light isn't Kira anymore. He gives up his role as the killer. This made his character a lot less interesting IMO, and therefore L's too. And when that arc has finished, L dies too.So as you can see, I wasn't nearly as big of a fan of the second half than the first one. It wasn't bad. But if one of them were gone, then the show lost what made it special in my opinion.But again, I really liked this show. I'll give the show a 9/10. I know a lot of you will disagree, but I couldn't ignore my lack of enjoyment during the parts where one of Kira and L was gone.",

Really unlikable characters, same things happening over and over again, with some rare twists that are not even that brilliant. I am completely ignorant of the anime world, and this might be considered good. But it never happened to me to be so utterly indifferent about the main characters (especially after the time jump). So watch it if you really don't have anything better to do, or if you really like egocentric and self-loving, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous characters who try to defeat \"mistrerious\" and brooding ones by \"manipulating\" an army of weak and stupid (by the main character's own definition) ones.",

            "content": "An intelligent high school student named Light Yagami finds a 'death note' which could be used to kill anyone. All that the user has to do is write the name of the target if he/she remembers the face. It was in fact the Shinigami Ryuk, who intentionally drops this book on the earth. He did so because he was bored. The anime has a good theme, no doubt about that. However, I feel it is because of the storyline that this anime has managed to achieved the classic status. Light Yagami uses this book in order to secretly kill as many criminals as possible. The 'unknown murderer' was then called 'Kira'. And when the police and the other authorities start investigating this Kira case, that's where the real storyline begins. It becomes the battle of the intelligence. Light and the key investigator L constantly try to outsmart each other which makes the storyline more intriguing as the viewers are mostly left curious. Even though the ending was predictable, I would say it was still satisfying to some extent.The anime also does well in the characterization. Light's character would make you go from being understanding to literally start hating him. I was glad to know that L had some very strange and weird habits. If he was normal, his character would be boring. However, Near, who initially looked like a copy of L, somehow couldn't be as interesting. Even though he had an hobby of arranging so many blocks, he looked humorless for most parts and as a character didn't have much to offer. The other supporting characters are well written. Despite the nature of the plot, almost each of them had at least some significance. However, the character of Misa Amane felt unconvincing. At the beginning the of the series, she was in a strongest position. It was almost unbelievable how easily she gave up her autonomy in favour of Light.The animation is outstanding. The anime first aired in 2006 and yet the animation is comparable even to some of the latest releases. The soundtrack is amazing. You can't get enough of it. The opening song and the ending songs are also good. But when I compare them to other mainstream(yet less popular) anime, I feel that they should've been even better.Overall, I believe that it was mostly because of the storyline that the anime is so mainstream and so popular. I am certain that many people, who are not really into anime, must've have enjoyed this show. If you haven't watched this anime, what are you even doing with your life?",

The premise of a DeathNote in itself is quite ludicrous of course, but once you get over that you just watch in awe as the most epic cat and mouse game in a long time unfolds before your eyes over 37 episodes. You never quite know where everything is headed. The plot and constant twists always kept me guessing and thus highly entertained. (Not exactly in the anime version because they followed the manga very closely, but still. Watch the anime. I actually would recommend this in this case.) The characters are quite fascinating. While I didn't care much about Misa, even she played her role. But its obviously L and Light that take the crown. Their relationship pretty much carries the series, and it shows when L is suddenly absent.Light is one of the most scariest, twisted, nihilistic and most of all intelligent bastards in recent creative history and you still root for him. L is pretty much every detective ever and I couldn't really place why I like him but I did. You end up rooting for both sides, and that makes for the fascination in this series.Truth to tell (and thats why I'm subtracting stars) I didn't that much care for the things happening after L's demise. It was a nice twist, but I never really warmed up to his replacements. Hence I also didn't like the ending. It just seemed like N and especially M didn't deserve to win. Things like they were, I would have much preferred for Light to succeed and the ending to be open.Still, this was one of the most original series I've seen in a while and is definitely worth a watch. If you're not hooked after three episodes though, it's probably not for you.",

His name is Light Yagami and he finds a notebook that gives him power to kill people and Yagami uses this notebook to punish criminals but not everything is that simple.The thing is it is a kind serial killer story but it brings some fresh ideas to the table.The series sometimes makes you feel smart to watch the series and it is not an easy thing to convey this feeling to the audience. One of the most crucial point is the clash between Light Yagami and L characters, it is very thrilling to watch two compelling characters trying to outsmart each other. From these aspects series is a different and interesting and I really liked this aspect of the series. On the other hand, I must add that I really would like to watch past of L and Watari characters, how they met each other and how they became a team.There are a few things I didn't like in the series, first of all After two characters has been introduced named Near and Mello, I couldn't connect with them so a few episodes could shortened because some episodes decreased my concentration. One other thing is Misa character and her Shinigami's actions are very illogical during the series so I didn't like their story arc. In short, I really liked this anime series and I can say that however I don't watch so much animes, it is one of the best I have seen so far. Mostly it deserves its imdb rating and I suggest it to everyone who likes to watch serial killer- detective stories and I assure you will find it more than a serial killer-detective story. If you want to fully enjoy the series I advise you to ignore a few illogical things in the storyline.",

Kira-sama will ALWAYS be remembered as one of the most hated/loved, ICONICS anti-heroes of all time (just as Lelouch or Walter White). And not a simple villian we're talking here, but the Judas figure himself.The \"God\" complex twisted sense of justice takes form in a brilliant, charismatic, high-class privileged japanese young student; Yagami Light. But yet, there can't be darkness without light (paradoxically).\nAnd so, there's the antithesis of Kira (but not necesary a heroe...); L, Lawliet; a gifted, lonely young investigator who will challenge Kira's vision of his \"perfect world\", in a intelectual, strategy game to death, or untill one's identity is revealed.You'll not only be moved by this anime show, but you'll be forced to use your head so you can understand how the Death Note strategy game to death, works for each character. Mystic, esoteric, religious and even philosophical content will be featured. But most of all, the Heaven and Hell concepts will be mentioned a few, but very important times.So, if you considerate yourself a smart-cookie fan of intellectual series, go watch inmediately.",

The story is designed around a set of rules regarding the deathnote notebook but the writers obviously couldn't deal with their own rules and after a few episodes started adding more rules and changing existing rules until I forgot what half of the rules were but even so the story and characters started off amazing. By the time I got to the the episodes in the late teens I was starting to feel it had become silly, disjointed and at times confusing maybe because by this point it had lost my attention. Episode 19 I rewatched 4 times because I was getting bored and kept getting distracted at which point I thought enough is enough and I never watched it again. I can't deny though the good bits are pure brilliance and exceptionally clever. Such a shame it lost direction. Would I recommend this - yes - but without me giving spoilers I will just say when it starts getting silly call it a day and then watch a good anime like Hunter x Hunter.",

The plot\nFrom the beginning we are immediately plunged into the story, a notebook that kills anyone who's name is written in it.\nNow such an idea has a GREAT potential. fortunately \"Death Note\" met my sky-high expectations on this front\nby adding a few rules to this base idea, this show explored the death note to its full extent. using it in as many sophisticated and twisted ways as possible.\nBut the awesomeness doesn't end there.From the opening sequence we realize that the series revolves around the clash between two titans. Light Yagami -a very intelligent high school student- and L -arguably the smartest fictional character of all time.\nThe attacks and counter attacks shot back and forth between these two geniuses is just mesmerizing. their conflict slowly escalates in scale as the show progresses (although it does get far fetched at times) and reaches a beautifully breathtaking climax in episodes 24 and 25.\nThe twists and turns we encounter in these two episodes are surprising and unexpected on a \"The Prestige\"-esque level, which is saying a lot.So here the show was getting better and better when suddenly L had to die. Now if the show had ended there it would have been much more appreciable. unfortunately it didn't.\n\"Mello and Near vs. Light\" never came close to \"L vs. Light\" in any way whatsoever. I have to admit the ultimate ending was pretty good and well thought out, but was still weak compared to the first two thirds of the series.\neven though the last twelve episodes were bad, the first twenty-five were so good that this show still deserves a 10/10 rating.EDIT:\nI recently watched \"Your Lie in April\". My conscience didn't allow me to give both \"Death Note\" and \"Your Lie in April\" 10/10 when the latter is more than a million times better, thus I changed my rating of this show to a 9 even though it deserves a 7 at most if I were to be just.",

            "content": "Death Note is the first anime I have ever watched. And while it may not be the best representation of what most anime really are like, it is an excellent show to start with. I have also read the manga, which I will compare with the show.As you might have guessed from the title, Death Note is one of the most gripping shows I have ever seen. I am a huge fan detective type storytelling, usually because of how clever the best of them tend to be. And while Death Note is not your typical detective show, it contains many elements that make a lot of them good, with a little mythical fantasy thrown in as well.The story centers around Yagami Light, a teenage genius who comes across a notebook that can kill people if you write their names in it. When watching for the first time I had a lot of questions. Thankfully, all the rules and limitations of the notebook are clearly explained. This is one of those shows that sounds complicated on paper, but the way it is explained makes it simple. There is a lot of exposition in this show, but again, because it is a show, they can space it out enough so that it does not get boring.For a story that has a fantastical premise, it is surprisingly realistic and well thought out. In many ways it reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, with insanely intelligent characters who use their wit in a believable way. The mythical fantasy stuff is important, but never the focal point of the story.Anyways, Light uses the notebook to kill criminals, hoping to purge the world of evil and create a better one. There are some who believe in his cause and call him 'Kira'. Obviously, there are opposing sides who want to catch this killer, the leader of which is L. I wish I could explain some more, but it would get way to complex. The premise is simple enough: A cat and mouse chase between two extremely intelligent people, Light wants to kill L, L wants to find the identity of Kira. This back and forth between them, not knowing who is going to come out on top or who is going to lose is the prime reason why this show is so popular.Do not worry though, that is not all that happens. The story moves at such a breakneck pace that it is almost hard to keep up. The manga, which is one hundred and eight chapters long is condensed into thirty-seven episodes. There is absolutely no filler whatsoever, and each episode is integral.Light is automatically portrayed as very smart, constantly finding a way to stay one step ahead of the police. L's introduction might be the best character defining moment I have seen in any media. From the first episode he appears in, you know he is going to be a very good contender for Light. The first eighteen episodes consists of Light and L's rivalry and it is the best part of the entire show.Episodes nineteen to twenty-three are what I like to call the Third Kira storyline. Light does a memory gambit and takes lengthy steps to clear his name. L starts to lose confidence in Light's guilt. This section of the story focuses more on the secondary characters, which I thought was a good idea, but it also made things less interesting, as the main appeal of the show was temporarily lost, with L and an amnesiac Light teaming up together to stop the latest Kira.Thankfully, the show comes back with full force in episodes twenty-four and twenty-five. Light, with his memories returned, finally triumphs over L. At first, I was annoyed that Light won, since I was hoping for L to win. But the more I thought about it, I realized it was the only feasible outcome. Light has always been a groomed genius, raised with a perfect family and had an ego that was admittedly bloated but also justified. L, despite his brilliance, was never able to be ahead of Light simply because he just did not have the info about the notebook that Light had. Light won because of his intelligence, but there was also a lot of luck in play which gave him the step ahead he needed to kill L.After that, the manga and the anime have one crucial difference. In the manga, the Post-L saga was the same length as the L saga. In the anime, it was only half as lengthy as the first arc. This means that several characters that were introduced were not as developed, and entire storylines were dropped. The manga also developed Mello and Near more.Both stories end with Light's defeat and death, but in the manga, Light's death is far more humiliating and pathetic, with him begging Ryuk not to kill him and crying. I personally prefer the ending of the manga, as it really drives home the message being told. Despite Light's delusions of grandeur, at the end of the day he is nothing more than a serial killer, and the notebook was just a more effective way of killing people.Which begs the question that I always come back to, which is better, the manga or the anime? It is true that the manga had a lot more chapters and arcs, but were they necessary character and story development, or just a bunch of pointless fluff? Was the anime's style of being more concise and fast paced really an improvement, or did it hamper the story? And then there is the terrific soundtrack and voice acting, which make the anime a much more rewatchable experience. It is hard for me to decide which one is truly superior, like which of the two is smarter: L or Light? Light killed L, but it was ultimately L's actions which brought on the defeat of Light.Even though many people think that the second storyline of Death Note is terrible, I disagree. I think it is an important part of the storyline, even though it might not be as good as the L saga. The truth is, in just two episodes I was completely invested in the saga, and I had to see it through the end. That is the best part of Death Note, you never know what is going to happen, and in just a few episodes you are completely absorbed and impressed with the story. It is an excellent watch, and even at it's worst it is still great show.",

Their maneuvers, manipulation of others and use of resources available is fascinating, both pursuing the downfall of the other yet neither willing to violate their rules of engagement to wage total war. Both sides were confident of their intellectual supremacy over the other and expected an eventual favorable outcome.The result of these clashes produced a complex web of character interactions and situational plots, yet the show never cheats. Events don't happen off screen, we are shown everything: the reasoning, the planning, the execution and the results.The detective plot is on par with a Sherlock Holmes novel. However unlike those stories, we don't have a clear hero / villain labels for the two parties. Both characters pursue what they believe to be a noble goal and see themselves as the righteous party in their conflict. What puts them at odds are their moral principles. Methods used in pursuit of the goal that one sees as justified are abhorrent to the other.What makes this show so amazing is their respect for the audience. It fully flushes out both characters, their reasoning and justification. Leaving it for the audience to consider which side they feel is morally justified. The dilemma isn't a simple one either, both sides have valid arguments and historical examples supporting their view. Whichever side of the conflict you end up rooting for, you will enjoy the show.I highly recommend this show.",

            "content": "This is one of the few series where I would love to see a *faithful live action adaptation series (e.g. HBO). As is somewhat typical with anime, the 20 minute runtime for episodes means that amidst all the fast pace action, there is not a lot of room to flesh out characters or the really provocative themes the source material introduces.Light is an extremely compelling character and I would love to see more of him and get into his head. Does he ever have doubts? What about some of the other characters. How are people in the world grappling with this? What is it like for multiple national police agencies unable to get control? What's the vibe like in the bureau? Are any cops struggling with their conscience, struggling with their fear, what does that look like? Does anyone have a change of heart? What is the meaning of \"justice\" when it comes to punishing crime, and how does that differ across nations and across cultures? Light uses women and sex to accomplish his goals, do other characters do the same, is this always wrong, do we all do it to each other?There are so many provocative and meaningful questions this series brings to the surface, but does not dive into. It instead spends more time in the cat-and-mouse of the chase, which is indeed very fascinating and understandable given the anime medium and the run-time available. But if I could have a wish, it would be to see someone expand this into a multi-season series which meditates on all the many dark and cerebral elements that remain under-explored. Maybe flesh out the characters so they don't seem so exaggerated. Maybe capture the brilliance of Light, L, Near, and Mellow without indulging in some of the exaggerated leaps of reasoning that are preternatural to the point of being cartoonish. This serves to make the plot interesting and keep the viewer guessing, but I think this can be done in a way that feels a bit more grounded.Ultimately the show is creative in its use of a dark protagonist who is also the villain, however who also has a well-fleshed out moral framework that is not simply evil for the sake of evil but which genuinely is oriented towards improving the world. I think I would have liked to see this done a bit more service.Ultimately the characters are engaging but a bit superficial, and the story is engaging but a bit exaggerated, and the themes are dark and provocative but under-explored. It's 8/10 generally, but I think it ranks more favorably among anime for its willingness to portray dark themes in an adult fashion that feels more grounded in the real world even if told through animation.",

The notebook has other rules that are discovered later as Yagami Light learns how to use the book and continuously evolves into a maniacal anti hero. He is challenged by a detective that I personally think is better than Sherlock Holmes. They face off against each other in an intellectual battle that is thrilling and exciting. The writer's decision to allow us to hear their thoughts at times enhances the experience as we understand the way their minds work. They weigh possibilities like rational characters and remain diplomatic with less important characters. They don't tell everyone their motives when it is necessary to keep ti a secret and they never stop being intelligent even for a second. If they make mistakes, they are usually do to lack of information at the time. With this said, the show isn't perfect, but it is as close as I have seen. The second half of the show isn't as strong as the first, but the new characters prove that they are unique and worthy of their titles. The ending is also very entertaining and quote worthy.",

Anyway, the anime provides a very good dispute between Kira and the police, especially the amazing \"cat and mouse\" relationship between Light and L. The characters are pretty good and have a great personality and the soundtrack is terrrific. The story is very well paced, well written and the plot twist are excellent. When L is not in the show anymore, the anime clearly shows some problems like hateful characters with bad design and poor motivations( yes Mello, i'm talking about you), questionable conclusions and the need to replace L, who was an oustanding character, with Near, who is the exactly same person but with white hair. However, L wasn't just super smart , but also charismatic, manipulative and special, but Near is literally the identical person, eats sugar like L, and that's it, a meh character without the depth of L. Despite that, the finale is pretty good, not predictable, not clich\u00e9, with a nice outcome, in my opinion it was a worthy ending. Overall, one of the greatest animes of all time that got some problems with the second half, but it is still a must-see for anyone, AMAZING!",

After watching the show twice, I have picked out two flaws which prevent it from being a perfect show.First of all, some of L's deduction skills are just unrealistic. He comes to the correct conclusion about Kira's intentions or plans almost instantly without considering the millions of other possibilities that are just as likely. Some might say this is due to L being an incredible detective, I disagree. The writers made him impossibly good for the plot's sake. This frustrated me sometimes. Light can't do anything clever or trick L because the dude instantly knows what's happening after 6 seconds of thinking.The second flaw is the second part of the show, after L dies. Mellow and Near were thrown into the plot and never gave the viewer enough time to get a feeling for who they are. I never cared about Near, or any of the new characters like Mellow and Mikami because they were crammed into the last 7 episodes and made the plot slightly less captivating.I went from being 100% engaged in the show and eager to know what will happen next, to checking my phone every few minutes in the later episodes. The ending is good and intense, but could have been better considering the INCREDIBLE first few dozen episodes of the show.So overall, this show is not a masterpiece, but instead is a very, very good show.",

The cat and mouse chase between two masterminds really gets you into it. The plot twists are amazing and unpredictable as the rivalry consistently moves back and forth.

            "content": "Like many, I first watched Death Note on Adult Swim many years ago. Back when I felt rebellious sitting in a dark room until 1:00 A.M. And nothing was more fitting than Death Note. Dark, borderline controversial, smart, and page-turning, its probably one-of-a-kind.After half a decade, I decided to watch it again. I wanted to see how it held up. For the most part, I still think its one of the best animes of the 00s. Its fascinating and suspenseful to see the characters set up their elaborate plans, only to be countered by those a step ahead of them, or with even smarter ideas. Most of the characters are realistic and likable. Even Light, by all means a selfish man, has ambition and charisma. Writing-wise, its excellent. Even when little action is in an episode, I couldn't help but see the next one.However...two problems stuck out to me this time around. I still think Death Note is great...but I lowered my score because of them, and I can understand if they're deal breakers.The first big problem is the post-L episodes. Going in, I had no idea why they got so much hate. I figured it was due to whiny Light/L fans. But now I realize how bad Mello and Near really are. Mello has surprisingly little presence for a main character. When he dies, you don't think of him as a misunderstood genius, but an impulsive idiot. Even when his role is revealed, I still didn't like or respect him. Near is even worse! He's basically L without any moments of personality and Gary Stu levels of intelligence. Light and L were unnaturally smart, but Near is just unbeatable. He's never stumped, nor wrong about his assumptions. L didn't need to survive to the end, but his successors show that not even Death Note's writing is perfect.I should note that I still found the second season very exciting, despite the imperfection.I've never seen the next problem get brought up before, which I find kinda distressing. Throughout the show, you are forced to wonder if Light's actions are morally right. We get a good idea of his philosophy - the truly evil do not deserve to live, and their deaths only benefit society. Regardless of what you think about it, its an actual, human belief. As for the humanistic side? L, Near, and the task force are all complete i-d-i-o-t-s. It is rare for their arguments to go beyond \"Murder is wrong, yo.\" Yet few questions are asked when they... A. Consistently violate others' right to privacy B. Use death row inmates as pawns C. Even encourage the death penalty (L says so at the end of episode 2). Evil is evil, no matter the intended purpose...unless they do it? Its hypocrisy, but its barely brought up, so it just seems like bad writing. No wonder why so many Death Note fans have become pro-vigilante justice. You and I could make a better case against Light.For these reasons, I no longer call Death Note a \"masterpiece\". But its still very good. I don't hand out 8s often. I'm glad I watched it, and for the early impressions it gave.",

The show always keeps its audience on edge and their ceases to be a dull moment. Merciless to the end, the characters are very three-dimensional and the story is satisfyingly unpredictable. In a tale with such a controversial main character, it finds itself explaining (or justifying) things through dialogue instead of action, which kind of feels like we as the audience are being underestimated. Perhaps maybe some of us are, as there tends to be a line between the fans who support and who are against Light Yagami. A truly powerful series.***\u00bd",

Besides, in a way L is actually the hero of the show while Light is the villain. Villains typically are supposed to be more powerful then the hero so it makes sense to make Light a Mary Sue.The music in the show is also phenomenal. Simply putting on an episode and just listening to it is enough to be entertaining. Once you add the visuals, you're talking about true art.

The side characters are also good and well developed. Even characters of Misa and Kiyomi Takada, which are disliked by the majority, were nice addition to the story.Now for the only bad thing in the show. The ending. After L's death in e25, the show lost its focus. I understand why L's death was necessary but it made the ending less satisfying. L's replacement Near and Melo were ok but they should have been used for maybe next season. It would have been so great if L had managed to take down Light. Also Ryuk was almost gone from the show after. E16.Other than that the show was absolutely incredible.",

It took me some time to sit down and watch it.But then, after all this fear, I couldn't put it down. It was so enjoyable, full of suspense. There was no real action, fighting scenes or shooting, but that didn't bother me one bit. Why would have it, when the plot makes up for it. You never know what will happen next. Just when you think 'That's it, he got him' you say 'Wow, another twist'. That is what makes this series stand out for me.Despite its praises, though, I feel that after L's death the series took a dip. From there on it's too rushed and things don't happen in the manner they used to. Near (or the new L) just realises things to quickly and easily. L, who is clearly a better investigator and character, would never have come to conclusion that easily. Also, the inclusion of Mello is useless, he doesn't add anything particular to the series.This doesn't take too much away from the series, though, and I would still highly recommend watching it. Great series!!!",

In spite of staying on IMDb for 4 years and giving out several ratings, never wrote a review. This is my first, and I thought my ''first should be special'' :D Death Note is not just a mind boggling back and forth psycho manipulation between Yagami Light and L. It is a tale of deception, lies, a sense of justice within their own minds, and how the decisions of one man can have a chain reaction and make someone else join him up on that ladder, for him or against him. I must praise the dialogue writer and the person who did the background score of this series. It is one of the best, and even though it was subbed, it had me on the edge of my seat. Animation is good, if not great. The premise and plot is mind-blowing, and the character development is class apart. If you miss this series by any chance, don't. This is one of those things which have the potential to change the way you look at things.",

I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away.

Then, Light who always had vision for ideal world or utopia or new world used the notebook to kill criminals and those in his way and followed by his rivalry with sharp-witted people like L, Near and Mello. To add to your knowledge, the anime shows two different worlds :- human world and shinigami realm (ruled by great god of death). I am not telling about about rules of death note and note it yourself by seeing it. As for review, I would say that the narrative has been amazing and it is full of suspence, thrill and darkness. All the characters were amazing with there act with special mention of L, Light and Near and so is the background music. I would credit the makers and the team for this masterpiece and there are no cons to put out as such as narrative has stable and good pace and not feel boring and the theories are not that heavy (as for me).

            "content": "Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched.Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.But this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels. With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed.The flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 in my books.Characters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10Sound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light's demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5/10 (rounded to 10)Art/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10/10Overall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10.",

But they made the ending so good that I've gotta bring it up. Can't be a 10 for me but I can see how to some people it could be. Because the show is done well, and if you don't mind Near then it was all done exceptionally. Unlike some shows that start well and end badly. I still think the lead up to that ending was bad and had badly written parts, but that ending was good in every way.

            "content": "The central premise of Death Note is one that, to say the least, left me rather sceptical, the whole idea seeming like something dreamt up for someone's high school creative writing homework.It doesn't take long, though, to realise the error of such a judgement. The skill and precision with which the story unfolds is rather breathtaking - the central battle of wits between Light Yagami and his nemesis 'L' must surely rank amongst the subtlest ever laid out on screen, yet the pace never seems to drop for a moment. A mere self-introduction has surely never been as electric in any other story as 'L's is to Light here...Much of the success of the story can be put down to the brilliant characterisation of these two protagonists, engaged in a life-or-death struggle that essentially boils down to a difference in moral opinion - each considering himself a bastion of justice. It's a story that's been done many times over, sure, but it's kept fresh here by the particularities of the set-up. Indeed, Death Note is a story where everything comes down to the minutest of details, where one simple slip-up could mean total failure or death.The supporting characters work exceedingly well too; the Shinigami (Death God) Ryuk in particular, playing the role of the voyeur, providing some blackly comic moments of respite from the ever-present tension. Amane Misa is, perhaps, a little grating at times, but even she eventually charms.If there's anything to criticise in Death Note, it would probably be the slightly disjointed final act. The events at the end of the second act are understandable from a storytelling perspective, and a very bold move in terms of writing. From then on, however, it somehow fails to quite measure up to what has come before. A shame, really, but it doesn't do much to dampen the brilliance of a quite extraordinarily entertaining story. Highly recommended for fans of quality anime. Or, indeed, anyone.",

            "content": "Death note is a fantastic anime depicting the philosophy of the value of life. The story itself is one of the most intelligently written stories I have ever scene. The sheer brilliant deductive skills and thought out scenarios are almost always incredibly impressive.The story is about Light Yagami who gains the power of the Death Note: a notebook giving him almost endless free reign over the lives of strangers from around the world. He gets corrupted by the book as he strives to rid the world of the \"rotting scum.\" As he becomes Kira, the one killing all of the criminals, a detective by the name of L goes on a campaign to bring Kira down.The story is shockingly bold and amazingly intelligent. In the beginning, every single interaction between Kira and L was always noteworthy and fascinating. Their relationship grew to almost that of a reverse Messiah-Judas relationship, whereas in this case the traitor Judas was the one in the right and the messiah God was the one ruining the world. I've never seen something so unique in storytelling. Kira even has a \"death and rebirth\" as part of his grand plan to further this symbolism.Another fantastic theme of \"Death Note\" is the concept of the value of life. Kira never is able to understand how valuable human life truly is. Throughout the story, he genuinely believes he is helping the world become a better place. He sees his victims and thinks to himself how no one would really care if this person were dead, in fact it would make their lives better. It is only at the end of the story where he's desperate to sustain his own life where he sees why life is truly valuable: not for the convenience of others, but for the sustaining of the one. Kira was wrong, and he died for it.The only real complaint I have is that towards the middle of the show, it gets pretty slow and almost boring. I was uninterested and unexcited to watch the show, which was sad given how strong the beginning was. However, the show will pick up VERY fast and become the insane rollercoaster it should be.Another complaint is that there are several plot points which don't really add anything to the story. Some characters get into the show and seem to have a lot of potential and likability to them, only for them to die before affecting anything. Even after their deaths, they are almost never mentioned. Given, in the most part the show handles death fairly well, however there are some characters that really could have simply not been in the story and it would not have affected anything.Overall Death Note is an amazing story and is almost the perfect 8/10 rated show I can think of. The story is fantastic and the theme is brilliant. It will get slow and boring towards the middle but it is completely worth it to finish.",

            "review_title": "superficial & stereotypical",
            "content": "Let as an exposition suffice, that I expected, after reading the comments, a somewhat reflexive series -i.e. something that requires thought to get insight out of it- and was extremely disappointed; to be fair not during the whole course of watching the series, but really instantly after the sobering first episodes and anything that followed.My purpose is not to get into the story details of the series, as those are not its primary flaws, but rather get done with the notion that Death Note is in any way \"intellectually stimulating\", or such. The conception and nearly any other aspect of it's protagonists characterization is extremely misguided, and the series whole dynamics -by whichever standard you choose to evaluate art by- deeply ignorant. It isn't simply that the whole presentation of the protagonists is immature (though there are many parallels to, for example, flat, heroic depictions in fantasy books) they are throughout strongly misconceived, or rather devoid of conception, only tagged with primitive notions like \"genius\", \"dumb\", \"girly\" etc. This naturally determines the pacing of the series, and it does so in a negative way, especially in the beginning: I of course get, that it was the intention of setting up the premises fast and to develop a character setup that efficiently generates suspense, which led the writers to compactify Light's decision to become the 'god' of his envisioned 'new world'-utopia and hence to murder countless criminals, without considering any evidence but TV-newscasts in the first episode- but exactly this decision already nearly destroyed the possibility of the actions of the main protagonist being believable in any way. And as absurdly it may feel to state the plot as above: that's essentially all there is to know about it.The exception being the presence of Death Gods, whose powers allow the titular Death Notes to work: but these are a unmotivated, comical construct that rob much of the series credibility, not only because they are Death Gods, and as such rather ridiculous, mythical creatures- but most of all because they are extremely helplessly, and without any interesting explanation, embedded in the story and they individually have no defined personality whatsoever. They further are seldom of importance as plot catalysts (because there were seemingly no ideas about how to include them reasonably) but still are featured the whole time simply because of their function as a necessary story-device and as such constantly introduce (outragouesly arbitrary) 'rules' that shape the possibilities of the Death Notes. The Gods themselves are badly thought-through, badly presented and badly integrated in the story-arc, and therefore their presence often is awkward and irritating.As the overall story is really hard to take serious, I hoped the characters would at least partially relief this circumstance by being interesting- but this is not the case. Light and L. -which are for a good part of the series the absolute center of the plot- are its gravest flaw. They are at no point characterized and act at (nearly) no point like humans. Both seem to have no interest in anything still mysteriously know and are able to predict everything (for example: neither of them is ever seen reading a book, neither of them has at any point a scientific or philosophic discussion). These demands are primitive I know, and should serve only exemplary: it doesn't suffice to let some character hold a book about string theory and tag him a genius- but L. and Light are worse than that: they simply are geniuses, without having a personality- which is obviously a paradox and makes them seem like obsessed robots bare of any motivation. The central premise, that Light wants to create a world for 'gentle people', isn't addressed in more than a few sentences in the whole series. He doesn't reflect any moral dilemma, or is tormented by it in any way, he doesn't even sense that there may be a contradiction in murdering without regret in order to create a purer world- instead everything the viewer perceives of his thoughts are his childish schemes and ridiculous deductions. L. on the other hand is vaguer still: He has no personality, background or declared motivation except pride, and is only given a few stereotypic trademarks that obtusely symbolize concentration and obsession. The plot dynamics therefore are: will he be caught?, and diverse variations of it- the rest of the series' construct is devoid of any believable aspect. I didn't mention another important character, Misa. I don't want to spend much time discussing her because she really is a f--king disgrace. Never, I think I have seen -not even in b--lshit Holly-Wood-action fabrications- a character of such sexist design. Her unconditioned love for Light is never explained or analyzed, but merely introduced as another premise which can be used as an artificial story device and includes thereby conveniently the possibility of randomly showing her of in a short negligee. Really; it occurred to me that her character comes closest to a 'babe'(proverbial: as she behaves like a little child) out of some hentai. I cannot belief how anyone can be satisfied by such an ignorantly cpmstrued protagonist. In spite of this having been only criticism, I give the series four stars: Primarily because it managed at many points to really generate a strong field of suspense and kept me watching -unproportional to its quality- many episodes (though leaving me, besides of wanting to know what will come next, deeply unsatisfied), and furthermore the criticism is at a fairly high level,in comparison to, say: Pokemon. Finally Death Note is anything but a thought-provoking, good series and at best to be called -in terms that aren't too harshly degrading-: harmless, naive, slightly childish. So it really either is misconceived and misshapen or doesn't intend to be thoughtful. It generates an atmosphere of intellect, for those who cannot envision it themselves, i.e. it creates a model of genius that is pleasurable for those who can't see that it's phony.",

This anime had alright characters (not much character development), good music, good animation, and some of the most clever plots and plans I have seen in anime. However, I must note that while it had some great features, this was in the first half before L died. If it had ended there, it would have been a masterpiece. However, after L's death the show became quite boring. The show had a deus ex writing moment when it is revealed that L had a timer to tell everyone in Watari's orphanage that he was dead. The once clever plots became boring, and the new characters were bland and boring. And the ending? Oh god, the ending. This was especially disappointing since the first half was so good that if this half did not exist I would have perhaps given this show a perfect score.

The plot is so interesting and creative. The story is so original and genius. Nothing is left unexplained. You get to know the characters so well. The story progresses in the best way possible. And when you get more into the story, the more excited and interested you get for the show. It is really commendable how they have directed the show and written the script. The story of this show is like a game of chess, strategical and complex. But the way the story progresses, you understand everything. As I've said that every character is beautifully explained and you feel for the character's gain, loss, sorrows, and aim. Another thing is that the music is beautiful. It pumps you up and there are moments which just make you excited and make you feel like jumping out of your seat. This anime should be seen, it is highly recommended. You'll fall in love with it.",

These characters act very intelligently, always considering what their enemies might be up to. This works most of the time, but I think there are some episodes (especially in the second half) where this causes the plot to get overly complicated. The finale was really great except how did Near get the real death note?I think the show should have ended at episode 25 with L's death. The rest of Death Note was still very good, but it gets way too complicated once Near and Mello are introduced. L and Light's rivalry and eventual friendship was phenomenal. I don't think we really got that with Light pitted against Near.If this show was a little slower paced, ended with episode 25, and wasn't extremely complicated, then I'd give it a 10/10. But those issues move it down to the 9/10. At least we had Matsuda for comic relief amongst the chaos.",

I also liked the way the characters have been written.The idea of having two strong characters eying for each other's throats is definitely great entertainment. But not only that add some serious writing on to it and one can create legendary show.Having said that the show has some problems also. One can see those problems more prominently in the second half.

It turns out to be a curious examination of the concept of justice through a teenager / young adult's eyes. The setting laid out in the beginning of the series with a bored-to-death shinigami, a god of death, deciding to amuse himself by venturing to the human world is rather non-trivial, although his own story is quickly sidelined and, unfortunately, not explored in any detail. The plot develops with the introduction of some well-written characters, like the protagonist Light Yagami and his antipode L, as well as the skillfully devised twists to keep the viewers engaged and eager to watch the next episode. With the Misa storyline, however, it all goes a different direction and when the Higuchi narrative comes into play, the whole show simply starts to drag.I would also hope that the original dialogue is more sophisticated than the English-dubbed version, which at times seemed painfully simplified, childish and, by and large, too westernised. So, since it was just about 11 episodes that I could watch without feeling like the series was losing its potential, after the fact I would give 'Death Note' a pass...

Especially when the owners would just go on a killing spree. The animations were nice and smooth. I just didn't like the music in the anime, I was thinking of giving sound a 7, but the overall dramatic music during scenes and moments were hype and really well done so I gave it an 8 instead.The world building was really well done, it was unique and creative, nothing I have ever seen. Especially with the rules of the Death Note which was well thought of also. But at times I felt like they were jamming us with info that we never really were into and had other questions left unanswered, such as how was the death note created or why the Shinigami Realm exists. It definitely had a interesting and different take on the mystery genre which I liked.The story was really well done. Nearly all the episodes were pretty good in terms of quality and I felt like the creators put consistent effort in each and every single episode. The ending was just absolute madness and was just surreal and absorbing. The characters were well written also, most of the characters felt flushed out and were not one dimensional including some of the side characters. The themes in the anime included righteousness, one's own humanity, and justice which were really well represented and shown.Overall a worthy anime. At times the pacing was a bit too fast. And between the beginning and ending of the season I felt like it dragged a bit too long.Memorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Maybe.",

Light Yagami will go down as one of the most devious and interesting characters of all time, in my opinion at least.If you're a big fan of strategy, role play or mind games, you will love this series from beginning to end. An all out deceptive and ingenious game of chess going on between mastermind characters in this series. And as the plot thickens, you will see the chess match that goes back and forth get even more intense.The Concept will blow you away too with the Death Notebook in general and with how descriptive everything is pertaining to the Death Notebook. A very slick series with an ambiance of a very unsettling creepiness, a must watch for any fan of a great story, terrific characters, and masterful animation.Also, the opening song for the first half of the season, not my cup of tea. The opening song for the 2nd half of the season, loved it!!",

            "content": "Let me begin this by saying there are hardly, if any, things that can be described as 'bad' in Death Note. This anime is just absolutely amazing in every possible way. When I first heard about Death Note a few years ago I was not appealed at all and had no intention to watch it, but then last year I was searching for a series to watch after finishing Dexter and I stumbled across this again. I'll be honest when I say I wasn't sold on the first episode as I found it very sudden and it seemed too rushed. How wrong was I? By the sixth episode I was absolutely engrossed. With the short but sweet 22 minute runtime per episode, the show left me wanting more without letting it drag with irrelevant segments. The entire series is only a brief 37 episodes but it doesn't give some draggy backs-story, it cuts straight to the action. After breaking through the shows somewhat intense opening episode, I managed to watch the entire series in less than two weeks.The characters are amazingly developed with an unusually unique protagonist and other characters with flaws, they give the show a realistic feel and let the audience connect emotionally. The story is probably the most unique story I've ever come across. It packs a punch with its darkly twisted story interlinked with a lightening touch of comedy and jaw dropping plot twists to make the audience completely unsuspecting of the plot's next turn. Bottom line: Death Note is amazing, even if you don't like anime, I highly recommend that you watch this as you will rarely ever find another masterpiece like this. I may seem a bit biased with this review but believe me, it's for your own good!",

Actually, it's hard to find anything that makes sense in this show and some parts simply seem funny.Basically, it is interesting to watch but I'd suggest doing it only once otherwise you might start hating it.",

It is well thought out and you see the progression of two brilliant characters in Light and L, it's quite intense and surprising plus you get some humour from Ryuk to break things up a bit. I also think the art style goes very under the radar, it's beautiful but it's hard to talk about Death Note and not just talk about the story.",

            "content": "I have to say that the three movies combined are shorter than the time it would take you to watch the animated series. Not to say that it's not worth your time, but I am on episode 32, and four episodes ago it was really dragging and still is. I'll most likely be finishing the series today, but I will definitely not be watching the two OVA for a while.Don't get me wrong when I say that this series is both amazingly written, and Incredibly acted by the Japanese cast, but when you put too many layers and plot twists into a series it really makes your head spin and wish that the series was over. Not because it's too mentally straining to keep up with all these plot twists, but because they keep introducing characters super late in a series that you know is going to end at episode 37, so you figured why bother? I will say that the last right hand of Kira did they introduced is one of the more interesting, but at the same time it's gotten to the point where you introduce a second L, who is now referred to as N, and he's just a child. He's literally the same character just with white hair and apparently ten times smarter.All in all this is a great series, but by the end it drags and you really wish that they would stop introducing characters and adding plot twists. Focus on the story that you have already written and stick to that, or make the series longer and really flush out the story that you have created rather than just slap in a new character and expect everybody to just be okay with that.Update after finishing the series:\nWhat an incredibly disappointing ending. If you want to save yourself some time I'll go ahead and spoil it for you. Near catches light, tricks him and instead of him just going quietly he turns into a squealing little pig and runs away after getting shot several times and then suddenly after all this time, Ryuk he's apparently bored and apparently decides that it's time to write lights name in The Death Note, and that's it. We then get some clips of Misa Misa on a train in a maid outfit and lights dead corpse. That's it. That's the end. 37 episodes. You had 37 episodes to build a great series that started out with a great beginning, and this is how you choose to end it? What a waste of time. Bumped the Stars on my review down further after watching this terrible ending. Not even going to bother watching the two movies that came with the set that I bought.",

            "content": "Death Note is not your standard anime nor is it your standard TV show for that matter. It's a psychological drama that excels at probing into questions of morality and what it means to be good and evil. It focuses on a cat and mouse chase between hunter and hunted but it's masked through the idea of criminal vs detective and what's crazy is that there are times when you can't tell who you're rooting for. The show uses anime inner monologues to their fullest by using them for exactly what they should be, inner monologues. It actually sort of feels like something Shakespeare would have written and it plays masterfully when each character tries to outsmart the other. Each scene gets more intense as the conflict escalates and nothing ever seems simple. Even when you think that something has been solved or recieved closure, a new element brings it back until you can't imagine how it can get more intense, which makes it all the more satisfying when you're proven wrong. Death Note shows that an anime doesn't have to be action packed to be interesting, nor does it have to be overly humorous with constant jokes and inuendos. Death Note instead relies on psychological tension to carry itself and by doing so breaks away from the many cliches that surround anime in general. The story makes you think and it refuses to make things easy. It makes you think so much that you can't help but wonder if the character's are just inteligent prodigies or just people who use their inteligence to the maximum. As two brilliant minds from L and Light constantly force each other into tight corners it makes them wonder who's truly the master intellect and if they really can win this battle of wits. If you can get into this psychological aspect of tension than you will love this anime, but you have to have the inteligence to follow it or else it doesn't make much sense, meaning this show unfortunately isn't for everybody. Despite this it goes above and beyond in being suspenseful and it is one of the best anime's you can see.",

I have never read the manga but now I really want to give it a try. The story follows a young high school student named Light. He is preparing to leave for college in hopes of pursing work in law; just like his father. He is deeply troubled by the mass number of crimes committed all over the world and is out raged with how Japans worst criminals seem to be able to just walk away unpunished.During this time we also find a different world that is ruled by Death Gods. Higher beings that takes the lives of humans by arranging there deaths. You think this would be an exciting world of horror and adventure but it would seem the world of the death gods is one of boredom. All they do is gamble and joke around causing the boredom for one Death God named Ryuk to become just too intense. Then we find ourselves back in the Human world and Light has discovers a strange note books with the title Death Note. In side there are instructions written in English.\"Who ever name is written in this book will die. Write the person name why picturing his/her face to avoid killing others by the same name. Once the name is written, write the cause of death in the next 40 seconds so that it can happen. If not, they will simply die of a heart of attack. If the cause of death is written then the details must be written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds so they can happen.\"Light takes the book home thinking it's a Joke. That is until he test's it out on a pair of criminals with successful results. He latter learns that the Death Note belonged to Ryuk who had thrown the book in to the human world in hopes some one would use it. All in attempt to cure his boredom. Being the new owner of the book, Light decides to take it upon him self to kill ever criminal in Japan and the world. He starts to write the names of every criminal who appear on the news or internet causing them to die of heart attacks. After so many criminals start to die people start to suspect that someone is behind it all. The public comes to know this unknown killer as Kira, meaning killer. Light/Kira actions catches the attention of the world's Greatest Detective, L. A man who's true identity is unknown to all, even those he works with to solve the case. L Promised the public that he would find, catch and put Kira to death. Thus beings the big epic chest match between two rivals. The game is to find the true identity of the other first. If L wins Light go's to jail and receives death but if Light win's, L will die. That all I will say about the plot. I don't want to give away to much, but it's very interesting to watch this story. When you first meet Light he looks like a nice guy who has noble intentions but as the story moves forward we watch him change in to a monster who's more evil then the people he kills. In fact you may find your self routing for those who are hunting him down more then him by the end of it all. The only down side to this series I can think of is half threw the story we start to meet characters that I found to be annoying, but these are minor draw backs and do not really have a big negative impact on a very good story. I tell you more about them but I would have spoiled too much. The story is very well thought out and well written. Ever move done by Light, L and other Characters is all about trying to stay one step ahead of there opponents. You will be on the edge of your seat as Light make his way to become a New God to rule a world with out crime; even if it means killing good people who stand in his way.If your an Anime Fan, this is a must see. If your not, it's a great place to start.That why I give Death Note a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "I checked out Death Note because I had seen a couple of episodes on Adult Swim way back and had been intrigued by the premise but never caught it from the beginning and wanted to see what all the hype was about. While the series is entertaining and wasn't necessarily a waste of my time, it fell short from being a masterpiece for me for several reasons.The characters and their motivations are simple and static. They barely develop if at all throughout the show. Light is the same from beginning to end: a brilliant sociopath with a black and white sense of justice and a God complex. L is the equally brilliant oddball detective not above taking unorthodox and unethical measures to take Kira/Light down. That's about it for the two most interesting characters in the show. Everyone else is even more one note or if they are interesting or have potential, they are disposed of. These characters have no shades of gray no complex or conflicting emotions, what you see is what you get. Just as simple as the characters is the plot. There are a lot of plot points and details in the schemes of the characters that make it seem like the plot is convoluted but it really isn't. Light wants to rid the world of criminals so that he can rule it like a God. When L and the police start investigating to bring him down, he focuses on covering his identity as Kira and bringing down the task force before they can bring him down. The cat and mouse game between two geniuses is what the whole show boils down to. The rules of the Death Note and the different players that come in and out keep the routine from becoming stale, but the plot is straight forward, the sides are clear, the stakes don't change.Then there are some plot point actions where characters do irrational things to either secure Light or the task force a win. For example Light's big plan to throw suspicion off of him relies on two Shinigami following through on a plan that they have no incentive to follow through on because one said he wouldn't get involved and the other hates Light, yet she goes and helps him anyway because? Then the last part of the series has one character just figuring out every key detail that identifies Light as Kira with no explanation as to how they drew all of those conclusions.Like I said before, the show is still entertaining as long as you ignore all of these shortcomings and don't think too much about what you are watching and if you are expecting this show to deliver a message about morality or justice or have any depth. It could have offered so much more and been a true masterpiece, but just doesn't do enough.",

Every episode L is a step from exposing Light and every episode Light manages to cover himself and divert the investigation.

I\"m not sure its still worth checking out but please watch in English DUB or your ears will bleed of annoyance from Misa's voice but again not bad, good but not perfect check it out",

            "content": "\"Death Note\" is a Thriller/Mystery anime series directed by Tetsuro Araki, and produced by Madhouse. Consisting of 37 episodes, this series is based on the manga by Tsugumi Ohba.Basic plot: A young genius named Light Yagami, who dislikes the Japanese justice system, accidentally finds a mysterious book called Death Note. Learning about its power, he kills lots of criminal people one by one by writing their names on the book, in order to become \"the God of the new world\". Calling himself a \"Kira\", he even gets a death God named Ryuk as his company. And so a mysterious character called L is presented, and his task is to capture and arrest Kira.This series has to be one of the most bizarre anime series I've seen so far. The story itself is very original than many of the animes I have watched. Beside from the animation and the story itself being great, once you get into the series, the story gets somewhat more and more complex in later episodes, leading to a suspenseful end. So you might have to pay attention to this in order to understand what is going on.This anime is basically serious throughout this series, but the funniest part of this anime has to be how Ryuk has to eat apples, just like how we people get addicted to drugs and cigars.Beside from having watched this anime, I even have a figurine of Misa Amane, a Japanese idol who has a crush on Light Yagami. I bought this figurine while on vacation at Copenhagen, Denmark.Two animated movies of \"Death Note\" exist. However, these movies are basically summaries of the original series. Also, three live-action movies based on the same story exist.Several other bizarre anime series I've watched include: \"Elfen Lied\", \"Gantz\" and \"Highschool of the Dead\".",

The scenario is so complex and every single episode has a wonderful twist. It is totally unpredictable!

However, at the end, I found myself crying when he died. It was so sad for some reason!! My favorite character was L, I found him an extremely interesting and intriguing character. I also cried sooo much when he died. This is one of those series that you won't even notice how long you've been watching it. It raises moral questions and explore them rather than give the audience a clear cut of was is right or wrong which to me is a lot less interesting and impressive.This series deserves the hype 100%. I recommend it to everyone, especially people who have a thing for mystery and intrigued packed series!!! Hands down amazing!!",

Most of the ones I've watched have had one-dimensional characters, an unrealistically fearless, heroic main character and a below- average plot. And then comes along Death Note. The concept is immediately intriguing and although it toys with moral ideas, it doesn't have so much moralising that it gets in the way of the plot. In fact, it's very plot-focused, with the majority of the focus being on Kira trying to sentence all these people to death without being caught. This makes Death Note a constantly gripping thriller full of ingenious plot twists and a complex plot that sets the mind racing. At first it seems deceptively simple but within a few episodes it's turned into a game between Kira and the authorities as they try to outdo each other in attempts to get one step ahead of each other. It had me hooked till the final shocking episode, and even then I didn't know which way it was going to go. If there's one problem, it's that the focus on plot comes at a cost. Some characters are introduced with strong emotions with seemingly no reasons to feel those emotions. When this happens it seems jarring at first, but you can see why the writers made those decisions as those features are later crucial to the plot. It makes the experience uneven at times though.Death Note is an excellent series about justice and the best anime I have seen.",

The anime has an interesting storyline about a notebook that is able to kill anyone who has there name written inside. Other things like giving the notebook user the ability to gain the Shinigami eyes which allows them to see the persons name in front of them. The animation is very stylish, the music is awesome, characters are interesting, voice acting is very well done in both English and Japanese (tho Japanese wins by just a bit imo). The second half of the anime isn't bad or anything like that but the new character they brought in called N was nowhere near as good as L was. L was funny, interesting and just plain awesome all around. Death note is still a great anime that is full of mystery, suspense and has a great storyline. I would give this one a look.",

First, L is too lucky and look I didn't say too clever because it's not always clever sometime he finds things about Kiera that it didn't even make sense he find out. Let's be honest, if someone stupid would have a death note it would take so many years to get bust so someone as smart as Light wouldn't have been caught before dying of old age. I get to make the show work, L must be a treat to Light but still they should have thought of a way to give L an advantage because like this it makes no sense.Anyways it's still a good show but I don't think its masterpiece.

However, it is not without flaws and while I would strongly encourage any anime fans to watch it, I would also never recommend this to someone who didn't already have an interest in anime.The series greatest strength lies in taking the relatively simple premise of the deathnote and building complex and highly engaging characters around it. The challenges and interactions between these characters is the singular driving point of the series, and what keeps the viewer engaged.Kira and his continuous battles with his pursuers, most notably L, are fascinating to watch and well executed in concept and form. The visual animation is excellent and the production values, scripting, and voice work (in both Japanese and English) are very well done. I also noticed that the music for the last 7 episodes was especially perfect. The major plot twist at the end of the second act of the series is absolutely stunning and there have been few times I've felt so engaged in what I was watching.Despite these winning combinations, I did find some faults with the series. First and foremost is that the final act failed to live up to the second. I found many of the key actions of the characters lacking in previous brilliance. Yet an ultimately satisfying conclusion is still there.Secondly, the series can seem a little too long at times. While I don't think it could be fit into the usual 25 episode anime format without losing some of its quality, I did feel that there were at least 5-6 episodes that could have been cut out for being ultimately inconsequential.My third and final criticism is more about my personal preference. I found that it held on far too strongly to the conventions typically associated with Japanese-animated film. Deathnote lost some of its potential by making use of several overt stereotypes, most notably the highly annoying character of Misa Misa who seems to exist only to provide fan service, and the far-too-perfect Chief Yagami who's every comment is both unneeded and boring. In addition, the over elaborate settings, resources, and quirks the characters are provided with are somewhat over-the-top.The core focus of deathnote remains the brilliant game of cat-and-mouse between Kira and his pursuers, but the fact that it is framed within the overly-conventional aspects of anime means it lost both its accessibility and some of its potential to be truly unique. I'm aware that the series is extremely faithful to its source material and thus don't see this as any fault of the series creators. Yet this is why I consider more accessible/nonconformist works such as Watanabe's Champloo and Bebop to be slightly superior to Deathnote, and certainly a better introduction to anime for new-comers.Despite my complaints, the pros far outweigh the cons and I'd like to reiterate that this is an exceptional series that should be watched by anyone who claims to be an anime fan.",

It starts out with lots of dark colors and a generally gray atmosphere that gave me headaches from the blandness. But that's a stylistic choice I won't focus on. There was character dev in the first episode, and that was it. Light when from boring student to serial killer in like 15 minutes. And then it's just him Ocean's 11-ing schemes to kill people without the antagonists finding out. Well, until an 8 year old boy joins the crew. So Light talks to Ryuk a very small amount of time then he just became a background character. Light is a generally unlikable guy with a flat personality that he held true till the end. L was probably diabetic by the end. And the finale finished up just how I would expect from the person that created the series. A big \"f**k you\" to any fans by killing of the guy that most of the -angsty girls that touched themselves to his image- fans liked. The animation and drawing style are what's to be expected from a big budget anime, the dubs are acceptable, and any technical aspects were fine. In the end though, I personally watch something for an experience. I want to feel emotion about the media in some way, and I just didn't have that. I found a completely overrated and boring story about a kid that wants to kill people and is aided by a death god. What seemed possibly exciting became boring as it went from psycho-drama-adventure to cop drama. tl;dr boring",

I have never felt the obligation to follow people's advises or 'recommendations' but there have been times when you have to be honest to agree with people's opinion. Unfortunately this was not the case.When I finally finished to watch the anime, I felt DISAPPOINTED - yes, in capital letters- disappointed with the end and disappointed with the plot. I do not consider myself as a genius but the plot turns out to be clever and dumb at a time, with unrealistic points on the table. Although I have to admit that the first half is interesting and entertaining, the animation is great and the character designs are awesome. The story is predictable and you easily lose interest in the series after the first half. I won't say it is a waste of time because it is not, but it's not like watching Code Geass either, which keeps you up with the story.I do not try to offend people that may find this series as a masterpiece but I guess the cleverness on the plot makes it boring at one point (if you are smart enough to understand), maybe Death Note does not have the perfect balance between cleverness and silliness, turning it into a plain story.I think the '7 out of 10' is perfect for DN!",

The ending was tragic and Near just got lucky nothing else, he didn't had the humor like L did. However even when he was defected if he had managed to talk though it and surrender than somehow air that he's the real kira there was a greater chance his fans would've rescued him from the bottom of the earth.

In all honesty the series could have been created as a live action series, as there actually aren't that many animated scenes that are that otherworldly. However, the story is brilliantly woven. Moral lines are almost immediately blurred as we are introduced to different characters who present themselves publicly as moral and righteous, but who privately reveal their true feelings on good and evil, and the true meaning of justice, and to what lengths they'll go to in order to serve it.A brilliant battle is set up btw good guy and bad guy, where each move they make has serious consequences: people's lives. With each subsequent move btw killer and detective, the viewer is drawn further into the story and can partake in the guilty pleasure of siding with either the killer, the detective, or even both.

            "content": "I must say, that this show started out so great and that I got so hooked up by it, so it is really sad how it stupid it ended...This show is about Light Yagami, a 17 year old boy who finds the death note. Whatever name he writes into it, the person dies, so he uses his new power to kill a bunch of criminals in an attempt to create a new world without any crime, an utopia with him as the new god of this world. Of course this doesnt stay unnoticed and shortly after he has started to get rid of the criminals he finds himself in a cat and mouse game with L, the world greatest detective who wants to bring him down. The only problem is, that nobody knows who L really is, so whoever finds out the true identity of his opponent first, wins.The rivalship and the psychological warfare between these two characters develops a fascinating story and tension, which binds you on the screen. The use everything they have, use every trick they have up there sleeve and risk everything to bring the other one down. it is almost like a psychological thriller.The characters are great in this series, not only L and Light, but also all of the supporting roles deliver a good performance and they do there part in creating this amazing atmosphere and it is fun to see how everyone evolves.There are many amazing twists in she show, some you may have foreseen, others you may not. And even If you think that this show goes into a direction that you dont like, it resolves it brilliant at turns back to the basic idea of the show. All of it culminates in the \"end\" and it could have delivered a phenomenal, worthy and satisfying ending to this story and it would have been a 10/10 show... But this doesnt happen and when you think you reached the end, it delivers an unworthy and unsatisfying ending to this story arc, which was just dissapointing. They could have done more with it.And then they use it to go into a different direction with this show and this is, where the downfall beginns. Because the second story arc of this show just sucks in my opinion. The characters we got to know behave so diffferent and out of the sudden the act so stupid and do stupid decisions. The new characters are just bad rip offs of other characters, which dont seem to act logical and only achive something by luck or by how I said stupid decisions of other characters. All of it led into a really dissapionting ending for me, that wasnt worthy for it after how brilliant it started. Probably are there people who like what they did with the show and how it turned out in the end, and I am happy for them, but for me it didnt work and they ruined a brilliant show which could have delivered an amazing ending.But still I can really recommend to watch the first act and then simply skip the second act of this show because the first one is really brilliant and you can cleary see when it ended and the second act starts. Or you give it a try and maybe you even like it",

The plot is smart and unpredictable, which is a very good thing. The animation is awesome and helps with the dark tone of this show, and even makes the characters seem more lifelike and stand out. What bothers me about a lot of anime is that when a character walks down a street, it's like he's walking down a still picture since the cars and people are standing still, as if painted into the background. But no, oh no, not this show. The producers and animators and directors and everyone else actually did a very good job adapting this anime from the great SJA *Shonen Jump Advanced) manga of the same name. The characters you love to hate, love or just simply want to drag out of the TV screen just to tell them to shut up are used very well.My favourite character is L, mainly because I can relate to him with being smart, hardly ever going outside, doesn't wear socks and of course has a major sweet tooth. Now for the plot: Ryuk, a death god (or Shinigami, pick one) is extremely bored with, pardon the pun, 'life' in the world of the Shinigamis drops a notebook into the human world as an experiment. An excelling high school senior who's just as bored with 'actual' life as Ryuk with his world, finds the notebook and picks it up. He reads the instructions of the Death Note, \"Those whose name is written in this notebook shall die\" and thinks it's all just a big joke. Still, he takes it home and tests it out on some criminal he sees on the news and naturally freaks out when he realizes the Death Note works. Soon though, like a siren, it grabs hold of him and he begins to think that he will become the 'god of the new world' by killing every criminal in the world. This sets off a chain of events that eventually brings in L, a genius detective who works in secret to track down Light, dubbed \"Kira\" by the public that supports him. Since Light needs a name and a face to kill someone, Light begins his quest to track down L and kill him, all the while with Ryuk watching and giving the odd hilarious remark or comment, mostly about apples. Overall, I give this anime my first ten.All you Light fans, don't write my name in your own notebook just because I think Light is an ass and L's awesome. Frankly (and this is one of my only complaints about the show) Light should have been caught about thirteen episodes in, maybe even less. He's way too arrogant and careless at first. The whole way he dealt with the Penber situation was so flawed that L should have figured him out. But whatever. It doesn't take much out of the show.",

            "content": "The story finds its main character in Light Yagami, a bored Japanese high school honor student who one day accidentally discovers the \"Death Note,\" a notebook of otherworldly origin that gives him the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in it. (The Death Note originally belonged to the rogue shinigami - death god - Ryuk, who was bored himself and wanted to see what kind of havoc could be wreaked upon the world of the living.)After a little trial & error, Light begins to see the virtues of what has been dropped into his possession. At first, he uses the Death Note to rid the world of evil, by eliminating many of society's worst criminals. So in short order, Light goes from being a bored high school honor student to a serial killer with delusions of godhood (he's later named \"Kira\" - \"killer\" - by fans of his work). Light's actions are not without consequence, however. Thus, the story adds two wrinkles: It doesn't take long for the authorities to find out that the deaths are somehow connected, and a police investigation is launched. Wrinkle #2 comes in the form of Light playing a cat & mouse game with the authorities and the mysterious and reclusive criminal investigator L, who has vowed to find out who is behind these mysterious deaths and how they're getting away with it.Having never read the original Manga, I can easily say without any bias that the show has to be a perfect (and logical) elevation for \"Death Note.\" This is one Anime' that really caught my eye, since I saw it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late one night, and I've constantly been barraged by the Anime' DVDs and original Manga at the local bookstore. So I took a chance and I can say that \"Death Note\" is now one of my favorite Anime' shows from Japan.This is a moody, effective, and stunningly envisioned and intelligent Anime'. Being a fan of Anime' myself, I know firsthand that intelligence is never in short order in this genre. The story twists and turns and goes a great many places that are incredibly hard to predict. Also as a fan of fantasy, I'm glad to see that \"Death Note\" is pretty dark fantasy, and paints a rather chilling view of a world where the lines between life and death have become so blurred that it seems the two coexist. This show is fairly disturbing, with a very disturbed lead character who lives in a world of amorality and is hard to connect with, but he is such a strange and intriguing character, nonetheless.I hope that wherever \"Death Note\" goes, it goes to some place good because, after all, once we're gone, all that we'll have in the end is the Death Note.",

It had some clich\u00e9s, some horrific plot holes and overall just didn't blow me away like all my friends said it would. This show, Death Note, was what got me into anime. I'd recommend you go into this anime knowing nothing as all I knew was that it was about a high school student who used a notebook to kill people. The story is written so well and unlike most television series' it doesn't make you anticipate a thing. When you start wanting to know what a character looks like or wondering where a plot point goes it reveals it to you almost immediately yet only then unfolding more plot points and complications to always keep the series tight. The story is so well-written and it's at it's highest point when the characters show off how smart they really are. Also what's so amazing about this show is how many different directions it goes that you just wouldn't expect. Nothing gets dull as interesting situations are always happening and they are presented in such fantastic ways like the subtlety in story-telling, the awesome art-style and really cool music.The story's themes surround morality and it's presented in such a clever way that you start questioning yourself and who you are really rooting for. A few flaws I have with this anime is that a few plot holes arise at around Episode 20 and the show get's a little underwhelming between Episodes 32-36 but it is horrible because it finishes off brilliantly at Episode 37. This series is impeccable and I recommend it to everyone,especially people who are first getting into anime. 9/10",

Then...WHAT THE !@#$ DID THEY DO TO THIS MASTERPIECE, they start off by killing off THE WRONG !@#&@#&#&ING GUY... :*( WHY HIM SERIOUSLY (If you watch it.. you will know who I mean), then they throw in some stupid generic anime twists to a already convoluted plot line. NOW to top it all off, three new terrible antagonists step in and eventually it all winds down to a very anti climatic ending.It's kinda funny, you can see it happening a million miles away, despite the convoluted pile of crap leading up to it, yet you watch it to the end... Sort of like if you could only look as your life's savings got slowly poured through a wood chipper..Really... sad... I hope the manga is better, still gets 7 out of 10 for the first half though.",

Finally, I felt the series overextended, to the point when I was bored and wanted it to end. It would have worked better with around 20 chapters.Again, it's not bad, it's not that childish, and it's overall interesting. But for the love of the god of movies, it doesn't deserve a 9.",

I kind of agree. Lol it's like a Batman movie told through Joker's perspective where Batman dies in the middle part. I'm not saying it was a bad idea to give audience a shocking blow. But actually the show should have ended right after that.Albeit it seems stretching the show after L's demise\nto 12 further episodes with rushedly introduce characters like Near(lol) ,Mellow and Tagada shows that makers expected audience to just go with it.There was no need to continue the show with such boring characters.

He wants to reach something good by playing an evil game. At the beginning we can see a normal boy who wants to create a new better world, but after L's death, we can see a change in Light's personality. He becomes more cruel and without consciousness. He can kill everyone who stands in his way, even his family. L is one of the best anime characters I've ever seen. His abnormality makes him a man without feelings who only wants to play a game. He is not even frightened by the possibility of loosing his own life. This two characters keep the world in an equilibrium that breaks after L's death. L and Light also share a mutual respect for each other knowing that only they know the truth. They could have been friends or even lovers, regarding the fact that they both never felt something for girls (I know it's a stupid thing to say, but maybe it's true), if not for the Death Note. While now the only thing they can do is to hate each other. That's because, as L said, they are both childish and hate to lose.The directing is very good and highly watchable. The atmosphere is very dark and obscure from the beginning, as it has to be.I also think that this anime has one of the greatest soundtracks I've ever heard.10/10",

Me being a big fan of anime and manga I dove into this series with high expectations as always, and I have to say this show has earned a 10/10 for good reason.The entire storyline is a good combination of spookiness, drama and mystery. The originality of the story made it interesting, the drama kept the story fresh and alive with each episode, and the suspenseful mystery kept me at the edge of my seat the whole ride through.Second, the artwork, the voice acting, and the comparison. The artwork for the scenes and characters were beautifully drawn as many anime, and I felt myself really drawn in with the type of storytelling through what you can see with your own eyes nearly as good as the voice acting, which was superb both in Japanese and English. The voice was perfect for each character, and it gave each one the very life you would expect to see. And next is the comparison to the original manga. They really kept it close and accurate with the book series that I was impressed. Like all anime there were some things they had to wing but it fit just as well with the story.Now the conclusion. This series was dark, brooding, sinister, dramatic, suspenseful, fun, and a thrill ride beyond what I was expecting. I still have my favorites but this anime series had made it to the top three of my favorite anime, and highly recommend it to anyone who like dark and suspenseful tales knitted with good drama, and intense mystery and desire. Death Note lives to its reputation, and deserves a 10/10.",

I started watching this with so much expectation and maybe that expectation made me think this is an overrated anime. I wish the finishing could be the opposite so that it can live up to my expectation. Starting of this anime was so interesting as it is based on a death note where if you write someone's name then s/he will die within a couple of minutes. There were many instructions and rules for using the death note which made the anime extend too far. The twists of this anime are so amazing but after a couple of twists, you can easily think what is going to happen this time. The story will forcefully drop the protagonist into danger and after that again solve those problems.I did not like the protagonist selection as 17 years old kids are ordering everyone and everyone including the president of the USA is also following their command. I did not like the Shinigami part because that was too childish. Though the first half of the anime was good enough until L died and N came. That's was too much for me. I could barely tolerate L but I couldn't tolerate a kid like N. This story plot was rubbish. The whole anime is based on doubt and fantasy. I liked the main character Light Yagami so much and only his part was smart and interesting. I found some wrong explanation about solving various scenarios where it was obvious that the writer forcefully showed inhuman analytical ability which I found irrelevant. This was a boring anime for me as it took almost 2 months for me to finish only 36 episodes. Overall this is a good anime but not my cup of tea.Personal Rating - 6.5/10.",

            "content": "I am a fan of animes and I watch diverse varieties of them, mostly the the ones with the highly praised. So, I decided to watch Death Note. Everyone was talking about how geniusly written it is, how great is the battle of two of the greatest minds, how it is suspenseful etc...I watched the whole series, but I really don't get it. The idea of some mortal boy finding a death god's notebook and using it to create a crime-free \"Utopia\" is genius. However, the writing of this anime is not genius at all, as most people saying. Actually, it has very dumb logical flaws in the base of its story. Until the last episode, I waited to see that jaw dropping moments, but there were none.Let me explain: The so-called genius boy Yagami Light finds a death note and wants to erase crime from world by killing criminals. That's okay. However, he kills small time criminals like murderers, rapists etc. The genius isn't able to think about the big guys who finances crime and creates the environment the crime thrives in. For a genius, he's pretty dumb. Making the world crimes by this way requires hundreds, even thousands of those death notes, there are hundreds of thousands small time criminals. A genius would have go after big corporations and organizations which promote crime, and corrupt politicians who sides with rich and powerful, instead of righteous.Another thing about Yagami is, aside from his intelligence, that he's a normal person, having a normal life until finding that death note. He has a good family, he is successful student, he didn't have a psychological trauma caused by a criminal. Then the minute he found that notebook, he turns into cold hearted killer. He even uses the girl who loves him, just to learn more names to write to death note. The only time shows signs of emotions, when he writes to death note and at the end he got caught. If he doesn't have any compassion in his heart, why does he want to rid the world free of crime? Now, let's talk about \"L the genius detective\". He's more than a genius, he must be a psychic. From the first time he gets the case of dying criminals, he gets after \"the\" killer. Criminals are dying of heart attacks, traffic accidents or other natural causes at random places, at random times. Yet, our psychic genius smells murder. Even if this isn't enough, he starts to investigate who the hell is \"murdering\" those criminals. I mean, even if those deaths are murders, it might be some organizations doing. It might be a vigilante organization, a corporation that tests illegal drugs on unwanted people, or it might even be the government. But no, thanks to his genius and psychic powers he narrows it down to murder and decides to go after \"the dude\" murders those criminals. Riiight!!! After beating the anime's plot senseless, I want to say about a few good things about it. First of all, acting is very good, and the sense of suspense and mystery is very appealing. The animation in this anime is top notch, characters are realistic, and movements are fluid.If the plot wasn't that flawed, I would have loved this anime. I really, really don't get why people get so exited about this. Its whole point is to have geniusly written plot, its mediocre and high school level at best, like the most of other Japanese animes. It isn't worth more that five stars, just because of acting and perfect animations...",

I think Light is a reflection of uncensored society, because we have all thought that the world would be better if criminals did not exist, and Light's philosophy of creating a world without malice is something that many people share at some point of their life. On the other hand, the development of the anime seems spectacular to me, as the story unfolds in each chapter, and what I like most about this series is that it does not need physical fighting action or supernatural powers such as Dragon ball, but the The protagonists' fight throughout the series is internal, an endless intellectual fight between Light and L throughout the anime to find out who makes the best decisions to play cards in the next move that each one will make. Also, the section of drawing, music, scenography that can be observed and heard in anime fascinates me, it is perfect, especially the music I love, because it hits every specific moment that can be observed. To finish, I can say that this anime I consider it a cult anime that everyone in this world should see it complete at least once in their life, since it is extremely interesting and because it is short of only 37 episodes.",

            "content": "Death Note is one of those \"Definitely Should Watch\" anime that my friends kept talking about. The animation is well-crafted and due to the gloomy plot, uses a dark tone of colors frequently to bring more weight and despair to the scenes. The soundtrack in crucial moments rises bringing magnitude to the scene, making it far more surprising and mesmerizing. After seeing it, I'm impressed how good it is. The story premise is already intriguing as it creates a dilemma of how far would you go to make the world a better place as well the sense of justice assigned to what you do to reach this superior world. The entire anime develops, with some rare bumps, an engaging and exciting story, it gives a great emphasis on symbolism. Death Note could be divided, since, in a point, it's added new characters and the story suffers big and relevant changes. Due to the main characters be persons with a extremely high intelligence and the constant chase between them, the plot twists are very constant. The link of Light Yagami and L, their conversations, their nonstop distrust in each other are the most interesting aspect from the anime as we never know what going to happen.",

I love the anime art and the concept behind the anime and how develop were the characters. It tells us about a boy Light Yagami who is top in his class and one day he found a strange notebook that change his life. It deals that how we think about the Justice and what is actually Justice. Light who is killing people by Death Note is thinking that he is Justice while another character L says no that he is wrong. Authorities have the right to judge and give pushiments and there is a constant war between them.",

It always seems like one of them is a step ahead of the other but then just when you think you know what's going to happen....BAM!!! A NEW PLOT TWIST!!!!Deathnote is a great series for anyone not just Anime fans as it is packed full of mystery and intrigue with a great blend of dark humour thrown into the mix and every episode ends on a cliff hanger leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting in eager anticipation for the next chapter in the thrilling Deathnote saga!This series was brilliant from start right up until the dramatic finale!Highly recommended!!!",

You might think that this isn't a show for you, and maybe it ain't, but it sure was for me even if I had my doubts.I like animations and such, but I just never seem to be able to take the anime style serious and really connect with the characters, so I always end up falling off very quickly if I eventually do watch an anime. While the anime style is apparent it isn't the front and center and the over stylized and overly exaggerated expressions that are custom to this style of writing, didn't really seem to be apparent as an apparent as the plot and characters. What I got was an interesting world and characters and in many ways it feels like a great combination between Japanese style and western writing.The show is basically compiled of two parts, with the first being a masterpiece with a great narrative and the urge to keep watching after finishing every episode, every episode evolves your interest. You wont be able to chose a single episode which feels like fille, every single one develops in some way.While the second half is not bad, but actually pretty great, it makes a few changes which hurts the show in its entirety. You will quickly realize when this change in tone will accur as it is very apparent, and while the second half takes a step back from the more serious and tight narrative that it established in the first many episodes. It still feels important, maybe not in the beginning, but in the end as everything coalides you feel the impact and I personally think it was a perfect ending, even if it felt like \"extra\" in the beginning.I did watch it in English and the voice actors do an astounding piece of work and they truly managed to achieve the same energy and characteristics that the characters express, it makes you feel love, hate, understanding and every other feeling towards the people of the world, and to me every voice felt right for the person, both main and side characters. The themes and perspectives are well explained on and beneath the surface, and you understand their opinion even if you know deep down that it's wrong.Most people reviewing on IMDB say that the second half ruins a masterpiece, and while I didn't like the second half nearly as much as the first. The great writing and characters remain the same, even if the overall plot is not as tight and precise as in the first half, which made that part a masterpiece. While the second half isn't as amazing its still great and stick with it as I personally think the last few episodes are amazing! The entire show was a great experience with great characters, mysteries, twists and the more absorbed you become of the world and people, the better series becomes. The all around package you get is startling.9/10.",

            "content": "The Bad= I'm going to start off with the Annoying Character of the review. I just Hate how Misa Amane was introduced to Light. Because she's all Dark and Gothic which I like, because I think it not only fits the Anime but also it completely fits her Character Design. Then she turns around and starts acting like a Complete Bubbly Air Head in the same scene, let me repeat that in.....the.....same.... scene..... and speaking of she also mentions this mysterious friend of hers. And yet the best to my knowledge Misa's friend was never shown talked about nor mentioned after that for mentioned scene. Then the next issue that I have is that In My Opinion They Killed off 'L' way too soon. Because Personally The two that Replaced 'L' wasn't as great. As they Basically were 'L' only one of them likes eating Chocolate Bars while the other likes playing with Toys all the while using the very same toy which happens to look almost exactly like the Characters in the show, which also includes a Book Accessory that that's right looks exactly like the Death Note itself. As an aid to help him Strategize on how to catch Kara.And since they were using the Letter of their First Names as Aliases when hiding their identities while talking to each other Anonymously on the computer screen or whatever. I think it was blatantly obvious that they were planning on killing 'L' before the Series Finally, very early on. As the 'L' real name doesn't even start with an L, very early on just so that Light Yagami could use that as his allies. Then there is the fact that aside from Misa's Mysterious friend I feel there are still quit a few Holes that Still needed Filling after the end of the Series. And I think it's just me but I find a lot of the rules of the Death Note Book itself Really Confusing and hard to fallow along. And that should do it for the Bad unless I'm messing anything else.The Good= Okay I'm going start with obvious two which are. The First is of course even I'm not the biggest fan of hers nor is she my favourite character in the series, I still like the character Design of Misa. And Second is that just like the title of this review suggests. I really like how although it's still a Literal Life or Death I still like how Both Kara and 'L' are acting it as if they were playing a Game of some kind. By the way not how they Strategize but also with the words that they choose to use, in particular with them using the word 'Win' quit Frequently. Especially in the Climax of 'L's' and Kara's Rivalry with one another. I especially love how they choose to depict that scene.And speaking of visuals I find there are a lot of great visuals in the series. Especially in the final episode they make it seem like time is ticking so slow that it is not only eerie but also those few short seconds feel more like hours. By the way it is shot and animated. And I guess this kind also goes with the visuals as well. But if you have a Physical Copy of the Anime then you would already know why I like the Menu Screen. In case you don't know what I'm talking about. Well tell you, with the physical copy the Main Menu screen almost right away you would get this Lightning Sound Effect to go along with the Thunder Strike Visual Effect and while all of that is happening you would get the Anime's theme faintly playing in the Background (at least I think?) and speaking of theme I kind of dig the theme not only the theme of the series but also the literal opening theme.I also Love the twist of the series, and that's one thing that I won't Spoil for you. But if know anything about the series then you might already know what that twist might be. Going back to the theme I also like that Generic Tune that they play through out the series. And despite all of the Fantasy elements of the show I just Love how Grounded and Real this anime really feels. And in a way you could not sympathize with some of the characters but also you feel like you could also identify with them as well. I think that was the Best Part of the Anime. And I just like how one of the Rules of the Death Note really reminds me of a Card Effect from the Anime Card Game Yu Gi Oh. In not only the Cost but also the Power that you Gain after Paying that Cost but only in Life Points instead Obviously. And unless I'm missing anything else that should do it.",

            "content": "Yes, I believe this title represents this anime the best. However, I suppose it does require an explanation.1. First of all, it is a rare bouquet of vidid characters, clever plot and lots of tension and suspense. There may be a few dragged out scenes and some that could be considered \"cheesy\", but... it's not your regular anime, it stands out and doesn't rely on the common tropes. Hence the overall comparison to something as impossible as \"lightning in a bottle\".2. However, what is lightning? Can it truly be... suspended in a bottle? No, obviously not. Lightning is a force of nature, and the series presents us with very meticulous, sometimes downright annoying worldbuilding, but... sadly nothing comes out of it. What does lightning in a bottle look like? A fancy custom LED. This is pretty much how all the world building feels in this series - very, very intricate, yet very, very downplayed.3. Finally - what is a bottle? Obviously it's a very tight space. This is because the biggest problem is that the protagonist, who drives the plot, has to be... himself. That's as much as I can say without spoiling anything. He essentially has lightning in his hands, his potential - limitless. But throughout all of his ordeals he has to remain... himself. The ultimate prison. As much as 75% of the plot could be unraveled and discarded if only the protagonist would drop these shackles and embrace his goal.Additionally, this series suffers from a curse of anything with a limited runtime: series, anime, movies... The curse of rushed resolution. A lot of the best works of art in this category begin by bringing out the biggest guns, the most intricate and interesting plot. They captivate the audience and give the illusion of quality. But... the bigger you build your world, the more the looming truth of limited runtime digs in. And you have to write yourself out of it somehow. Obviously the manga doesn't have such constraints, but this series - do. In fact so much that... it's basically necessary to watch Death Note Relight 1\\2. Again, that's as much as I can say without spoilers. The series is wonderful, and it must be watched in its entirety, because it still has the highest runtime, however, because of the fact that it relies on post-series content that merely retouches the... uhm... \"subverted expectations\", without truly fixing the issues of the \"lightning\" and the \"bottle\" - I give it only 8\\10.",

The guy starts to kill bad guys all over Japan but the story focuses on his tactics to avoid being caught and sentenced.Death Note is definitely one of the best series I have ever watched. Its amazing how it keeps you always focused on whats happening. Its like it was on a constant climax state. Characters are really well built and animation is also really good.I find that the most interesting part of Death Note is that actually the main character is someone that you cant love or hate. You get somewhat attached to him and you don't want him to get caught but at the same time you know he does terrible things (not the killing criminals part but the things he does to avoid being discovered)(not to mention the fact that he cares for no one, and all he does is use people to achieve what he wants) and you kind of hate him for it.Not just the main character is interesting, but all the other characters are really cool and you get really attached to most of them.My personal experience watching this series was basically a lot of: NOOOOO!! I Cant Believe this is Happening!! and a couple of other things I cant really mention here. Well, there is just one thing I didn't like... The second opening theme is really really bad... Maybe some of you like it and that is cool. I just don't like that kind of music.Anyway... I really recommend this series.. it is one of those that you just cant miss. I guarantee you will enjoy it very much.",

But Death Note is one of the most intriguing, intelligent, gloriously stylized television series to ever blaze across the small screen. Now, I've only seen the first 12 episodes, but I can't wait to see more.Death Note conveys the story of a young high school student who discovers a notebook, owned by a death god, that can take the life of the person whose name is written in it. Light, the student, decides to use this power to bring justice to criminals, but he soon develops his own perception of justice, killing innocent people who stand in his way, like police officers and FBI agents.The intrigue of Death Note lies in the character of Light Yagami. He's a mix of intelligence and arrogance, and his twisted sense of justice remains the most interesting part of the show. Light aims to create a world where he is god, by eliminating evil-doers, but has become a evil-doer himself, by taking the lives of innocent people. Add this to entertaining supernatural elements, multi-layered themes, exceptional voice work, solid writing and fitting music, and you have Death Note, a show that defied my expectations and is becoming a fast favourite.",

This show really makes you think. Once you side with L you see him kidnap a model, once you side with Light you see him kill, well, everyone.\nDeath Note is great, no point ignoring that.

There was so much potential for a great story and it's all wasted on something a basement-dwelling, introverted teenager would make up under the shower.Most of the characters make no sense at all. The Interpol is introduced a bunch of fumbling idiots who are just yelling at each other. All police detectives, FBI agents and other, supposedly professional law enforcement agents are helpless amateurs whose interaction with the world is mostly just being astonished and gasping. \"Aaah... Oooh... Wow... Gasp!\" All of them are easily fooled by a seventeen year old kid, even when his intent is blatantly obvious. Come on, an FBI agent or a veteran detective won't fall for silly lies, like said kid stating that he's working for a top secret police operation! Who the hell wrote these characters?Then there's the mysterious L, who later turns out to be an unkempt and seemingly vitamin-deficient nerd, able to boss the world's police forces around. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! That's even less likely than a Shinigami dropping a Death Note on your front yard right now. If someone told a high ranking police officer that a faceless, nameless guy is going to give him instructions through a laptop, he'll just laugh at it and send him to hell.There are so many blatant plot holes that I can't even keep count. Just for one, if Light wants to stop L, all he needs to do is to threaten to kill world leaders. He can literally hold the world hostage, why bother to find out who's L? There are more powerful people who can stop him.I frankly don't understand what's the hype around this stupid story. It's genuinely a terrible one. It may entertain a 10 year old, but it's just annoyingly stupid. The single good point is excellent artwork. Except footstep animations. They somehow couldn't get them right.",

Two kids, and they're meant to fill in for L. Their presence doesn't satisfy me that L went, and I was routing for Light. But can't try and bring back the feeling of L with two kids. Then for them to win aswell is just more annoying. Everyone who loves the show loves the first 25 episodes for sure. So if you're honestly reviewing the whole show. It's a 9 or 8, because although it kept the elements or tactical intelligence and slothful interesting detective work. That satisfying rivalry was gone and it didn't feel the same.

I would recommend it to most people it isnt very long either so you can easily finish it in 4 days.",

Every episode sets up the next one in such a well made way and leaves you dying to want to watch another episode! The main character Light Yagami is the most loved not hated character you'll ever see, he is crazy smart and thinks of everything regardless the situation. L is my favorite character (big surprise) He's very intelligent as well and is adorable. Unfortunately, as the title of this show states, there is quite a bit of death in this show. For those who might be reading this and haven't watched it don't get attached to any characters. Other than that I highly recommend this mini series to anyone! Regardless if you watch anime or not! I can't imagine this series becoming any better than it already is! Absolutely fantastic show you won't be disappointed!",

That is just ridiculous in my opinion. Makes my not want to eat potatoe chips. And another: I would have liked this series better if a few things didn't happen. It is interesting to see the characters scheme and chase each other around in conflicting ideas of justice, but why did they have to kill L? Just why? He had to have been my favorite character besides Ryuk. And the rest of the anime was just a downfall from there. None of the other characters like Near for example were nearly as good ad L was. I miss him *sniffle*. The other thing that I had a problem with was the ending. What kind of an ending is that? Light gets ruined by having the Death Note swapped out. Seriously? That is way too simple! And he dies from a bullet wound, and the last thing we see is Light closing his eyes. Wow. I wanted to chuck my tablet across the room after that. I wanted to do the same thing to Cowboy Bebop's ending because it was basically the same thing. Both of the main characters from Cowboy Bebop and Death Note die from bullet wounds and The End. That's not how it works! Other than that though, I consider the series as OK. It was entertaining enough and wasn't boring. Just some major problems that drove me crazy.",

It is a psychological phenomenon that has extremely intelligent characters playing mind games in order to trap the other. The sort of cat-and-mouse premise makes the show really intense, and the show will always be one step ahead of the viewer. Most anime (that I am aware of) has extravagant fighting scenes or scenes of high action. Death Note opts for scenes of contextually high action and and undeniable suspense. The show tackles some varied topics, and will leave you thinking of how or when or why. It constantly pulls the rug from under your feet with its plot and amazing characters. While, like mentioned, it may not contain supremely high action, it emphasizes on its story. As far as the story goes, there is Z E R O filler in Death Note, as it is straight to the point. If you want a break from regular fighting anime, watch this. If you want to experience a battle of only the highest intelligences, watch Death Note. If you want a dark-themed mystery, detective-esque, and overall amazing TV show, don't forget to watch Death Note. Its worth the time, trust me. There is not one thing that I dislike about this show, and it will sit comfortably at the top 3 TV shows I have ever seen for my short and miserable life.",

Misa seems like a parody character, but instead of being a one-off episode comic relief she stays to the end to ruin the mood of the show.The \"chess game\" between L and Light is entertaining but 11 episodes of the task force investigating Kira (with Kira) and getting nowhere was a drag to watch through.The moment I felt the show had gotten really bad was when the Yotsuba arc began. The Yotsuda were uninteresting villains and Light was beyond bland without his memories.Episode 25 was better than the 11 episodes before but at that point I could hardly care about the story anymore or the new characters they started to introduce so far into the show.Overall Death Note has a really interesting concept and a strong beginning, but it goes on for too long and left me really disappointed.",

Seeing him go from a promising, relatable teenager to a sadistic pseudo-god was both exciting and devastating. This series delivers a heavy message about the fragility of human morality and it doesn't pull its punches. Death Note's antagonist L is one of my favourite characters in all fiction, and his cat/mouse dynamic with Light is second to none.Perhaps the biggest advantage of Death Note's anime over the manga is its music. The soundtracks in this series are an iconic blend of drama, divinity and darkness that fits the series' tone perfectly. The anime does deviate from the manga very slightly, most notably in its ending, and while I found most of the changes to be unnecessary, this a relatively minor issue. My biggest issue with this series is that its supporting cast isn't as fleshed out as it could be, but that won't stop me from giving Death Note a well-deserved 9/10.",

If you take Ted Bundy and give him Spacey's complex from Seven along with the good looks of a Japanese Robert Patterson you get Light. He is a piece of work if there ever was one. Determined to create a world in his own image, he goes on one of the most intense and complex modern reigns of terror the world has ever seen. But his reign soon becomes challenged by one of the most unique characters of all time, L, a Japanese crime profiler who makes Warhol look like the picture of etiquette. Eccentric and straight to the point, he is focused and infatuate with capturing the allusive \"Kira\" and bringing him to justice. The moves and power plays in this show are mind boggling and jaw dropping to say the least. But Death Note is the quintessential series because regardless of its medium: anime, animation whatever.

The best part of Death Note is the rivalry between Light and L. Their interaction is amazing to watch, especially as they outsmart each other at every turn. The mythos for the gods of death, or shinigami, is also great. The show isn't as good after L dies, because it loses the rivalry and the game of cat and mouse between L and Light.

The supernatural aspect of the show makes it unrealistic but it is very LOGICAL. Noo loopholes, no character inconsistency to manipulate the plot, characters don't make mistakes, they're are geniuses, things don't just happen everything is explained very logically. The elaboration on the thought process of the characters, the human behavior, deductive skills are TRULY OUT OF THIS WORLD.

He's too smart for everything and everyone and he thinks that his life is too boring. But one day he finds a mysterious note book, called the death note. Light just thinks it is some stupid joke but he takes it with him home. When he tries it for himself he soon knows what It's all about. When you write a persons name in the notebook that person will die. He then meets the shinigami Ryuk who owns the note book. Light's goal is to be the god of the new world and he kills all the criminals in Japan. The police tries to find Light or Kira, which is his serial killer name. The police takes help from L, who is one of the best detectives in the world. Light and L fights for who is truly Justice.\nThe story is full with so many plot twists and that's probably one of the best things about it. The characters is also really good especially Light and L, It's so cool to see them coming closer and closer to each other every episode. So this is probably the best anime I've ever seen and I think you should watch it if you haven't.",

            "content": "Let's get one thing clear: Death Note is not for those who don't like to be challenged or have thoughts provoked. That being said, it was a totally unpredictable, dark, suspenseful, and fascinating show. It's not your typical 'shounen', heck it's not your typical anything. The 'protagonist' is actually the not the 'good guy' depending on your viewpoints, of course. Light Yagami is a bored teen-aged boy with the view that the world is rotten. He finds a notebook which can kill anyone whose name is written in it, as long as the user knows their face as well. He decides to kill off all the criminals in the world. L, the world's greatest detective and technically the antagonist, is trying to catch him. And so it goes. A cat-and-mouse game between two brilliant minds. There isn't too much action; actually, the number of fight scenes can be counted on two hands so far (although I've only read to chapter 75-ish). There's bits of humor that add a little light to the series. The characters are really interesting, unique, and quirky, especially the much-beloved L, a 25-year-old who lives on sugar and rarely wears shoes. This anime will sweep you away and keep you on the edge of your seat. It's part detective show, part fantasy, and all wonderful. It's also being dubbed on Adult Swim and I've seen what they have so far, which is four episodes. They're not doing too bad a job, although L's voice is a little deep and Watari's is annoying. In any case, I'd recommend it to anyone mature enough to get the deep plot line.",

(No I didn't ruin anything for you because you should figure this out in the first episode) Light Yagami is your typical boy-genius: bored, stuck-up, cynical, and selfish; but when he starts to use the Death Note for his own personal gain you actually start to cheer for him.Death Note not only gives you a charismatic anti-hero, but it also gives you a great cast of secondary characters that you begin to cherish.

Also, before closing his eyes he saw L's spirit or image admitting his defeat or feeling like \"At last old friend I'm dead, too\". Misa is going to kill herself probably from sadness of Lights death or because her lifespawn reduced to 1/4 after all. I'm also really sad that L died. I really liked him as a character. The genius but harmless guy. At the death scene of Light seeing L, light passing behind L maybe because he went on paradise or because he won evil even after his death. Also, Near and Melo have both characteristics of L. Near has the strange type to sit and the sharpness, Melo eats sweet (chocolate) and acts despite the danger to lose his life.",

The vitality and complexity of decision making is just beautifully portrayed. And all by heightening and exploring the vulnerability that comes with mortality. In my opinion, this show goes beyond just anime.By revealing the blur between what is thought to be \"good\" and \"bad\", it shows just how possible it is for black and white to be one and the same, all by their capability of being grey. Just remarkable. I can't think of anything I've ever watched (including anime) that explores the concept of \"change\" as well as this show right here... that had 1 perfect season.

I was floored from episode to episode right until it was suddenly over, and I realised I completely lost track of time.It's an extremely strong series, one of the best ever. I can hardly think of a single flaw. It takes more attention to watch than your average viewing experience, especially if you don't speak Japanese and are watching the subbed version (which in this instance I would strongly suggest instead of the dub).The writing, acting, pacing, character building, music, and cinematography are all pretty much perfect.

I asked what he was going to see, he said, \"Death Note\" I was young at the time and the show seemed very disturbing. I asked him if I could see it, he said, \"Yes, as long as you don't come running into my room scared at night\" Then, I immediately started watching.At the time I didn't have an amazing discerniment of what was a good or a bad TV show. But, watching Death Note felt different. I had watched many shows at that age but I had never seen an animation so dark and cruel with it's characters. It was new to me.The protagonist was an anti hero, the kind of character that I've never been in touch with until I watched Death Note. Light is charismatic, yet, so cruel. Which creates an interesting complexity to the character, the relationship with Ryuk is pretty much the beating heart of the story. L is the other protagonist, I consider him that way. And he is pretty weird. And a lot of people seem to think that he's a simple character. If you think that, you haven't paid attention to the show.The main theme of Death Note is Justice, which to me seems very interesting. As both Light and L have very different visions of what justice is. The battle between the two, raises a lot of debate towards what's the most efficient approach when dealing with justice. The series asks you those questions.By the second half of the show things get pretty bad. After solving the conflict between Light and L, the series becomes ,simply, a whodunit. It forgets about the themes of justice, some introduced characters are there only to serve as substitute to others, it's very poor writing.The soul of Death Note is the conflict between Light and L. When solved, the series should've ended. But it didn't. Giving this show a 9/10 really proves how even though the second half is crap, the show is still pretty good. And still, holds up to this day.

            "content": "If you like mind games and crime solving stories, this is the anime for you: it poses the idea of an assasin that kills without touching, looking at, or even being close to his victims, with a team of detectives led by a thouroghly careful genius attempting to discover his identity. Meanwhile, the assasin, an incredibly intelligent young student who has found a magic book that allows him to kill only by writing the name of the victim, tries to discover the identity of the detective, whose face and name are unknown. You probably see where this double mistery is going.The fun of the show is seeing what mind game the two use against each other to discover tiny specks about each other's identity, and the show manages to deliver these in a very satisfying manner.The show also tells a story about the progressive loss of morals of the main character, whose power ends up transforming him into a monster (not literally). The subversion of good and evil is very interesting and leaves the viewer not knowing what to think, unless you just stan one of the characters, in wich case you are morally wrong either way.What I disliked about the show was the fact that when L died, it got replaced with basically an equivalent of him, wich completely undermined his death. If the show were to have ended with L's death, or if at least the second part of the season came up with an original idea as the next L, then I would've rated it an 8.It is a good show, it has some great moments and even the least innovative parts of the story are interesting and fun to watch.",

            "content": "An incredible pilot and first few episodes 10/10 for sure. One of the best starts to any shows I've seen. Just a very unique and thought provoking premise for a story.A lot of people say that it gets bad after L is dead, and it is true that the story becomes much less engaging after episode 25 or so. But I think it also slows down a little before that. The issue for me was that- even though this is a story of \"power corrupts\" by the end of the second episode Light already tries to kill the fake L presented on TV, and he's basically self interested to extreme measures from that point on without much change. His evil gets more established when he kills the FBI agents and behaves in shockingly horrible ways to Misa, but Light's moral approach doesn't really change from episode 2 to the end. While his memory is wiped the situation is more interesting because Light's personality is less \"pure dark side\" in its motives. So this lack of dynamism and nuance in Light's ethical character takes a lot away from the show I think.That being said, up through episode 25 it is still really fascinating. Misa, L, Ryuk, and Rem are all distinct and enjoyable characters who drive the plot in interesting ways. And there are some fun twists and turns in Light and L's mental game/ almost friendship. Memorable soundtrack (not meaning the opening credits, but during the story), and appreciated that the show doesn't really have any sexualized characters besides Misa. Refreshing to have a few animes that don't have short skirts and the like in every episode.So all in all one of the best series out there if you like psychological thrillers. Thanks again to the writers and developers of this show, very impressed with all your hard work-",

The show is truly despicable, and people out there need to know both sides. I caution everyone out there. DO NOT trust the ratings.

An intelligent high school student named Light Yagami finds a note book (Called the \"Death Note\") which has a power: if you write a name in the book whilst thinking of their name, that person dies of a heart attack. So Light decides to rid the world of evil by using this Death Note to kill off all criminals, but then the worlds best detective named L decides to hut down the Light. This series is a battle of the minds to see who wins. Light needs to uncover L's name and face to kill him and L needs to find out Light's face so he can sentence Light to the death penalty.Death Note is extremely good at getting you on the edge of your seat, each episodes leaves you with a massive cliff hanger so that you are demanding to know what happens next, each episode is an brilliant as the other. I highly recommend watching Death Note, even if you dislike the whole Anime genre, this is a must see! But please, trust me on this, don't watch the movies, before you watch the series! In my opinion, the movie's completely kill the series and they take away all the tense scenes and action and the movies will put you off the series!",

L was my favorite character because he carried the humor in the show. Mello and Near were just unlikable. In conclusion, the second half of the show, including the ending, were bad. The first half of the show was somewhat enjoyable because of L. Overrated, but a classic.",

The characters will make you love the show. But the best thing is the amount of twists in the show .. I can say they are endless ! Amazing atmosphere ...I couldn't stop watching the show so I watched all episodes continuously without any break ! If I had to describe the 1st season with one world, I would say it is Masterpiece ! Now the 2nd season (last 12 episodes) ... Unfortunately the writer went for a weird path ..they were not good as the 1st 25 episodes, they were nice and thrilling but not to the level of the 1st 25 episodes .. So If someone asked me about the show, I would advice him/her just to watch the 1st masterpiece 25 episodes , and ignore the last 12 episodes not to get disappointedBut for me , I will rate it as 10/10, at least the 1st season deserves it, was a unique experience to me.",

Most shows I watch involve some sort of a mental duel between two equally matched minds (Sherlock vs Moriarty, for example) and Death Note is nothing but that. It has no secondary filler story lines, something which haunts too many good TV shows, and it has only a 37 episode duration, which makes the story focused and tight.

However, it is dragged down by the fact, that a main character, gets \"swapped\" in a sense with a different character, who essentially is the same character, sadly just with less personality, and a weaker connection to the main character. This \"character swap\", sours the sweet taste of the first half, but it doesn't completely ruin it.

The characters are complex and interesting. the protagonist is twisted and dark, who you'll love and hate at the same time. the \"antagonist\" is technically the good guy, and is so clever that you'll be routing for him, and against him. The relationship between the two is unlike anything I've seen in a show, with hatred, curiosity, and respect mixed into one.The story is full of twist and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat, and the ending truly wraps up this incredible story perfectly.Even if you've never watched anime, I would recommend this to anyone. It is so brilliantly twisted, interesting, and dark that it truly deserves it's 9 rating, if not a higher one.10/10 easily",

            "content": "To put it shortly, Death Note is one of the best animated TV shows to ever air. It matches the quality of TV shows such as Sherlock and True Detective. Death Note is a Japanese anime about a teenage boy named Light Yagami, who finds a notebook. Whoever's name is written in that note book dies by heart attack. Light takes it upon himself to rid the world of criminals, killing them off one by one. However, a detective named L is trying to figure out who this killer is. Drama ensues.Where Death Note shines the brightest is its feel of suspense. From episode 1 to 25, the viewer is kept on edge, never knowing what could happen to the characters. After episode 25 when (SPOILER) L dies, the stakes get higher as Near, his successor steps in.Another great aspect of the show is its characters. Light Yagami, the main character, is in my opinion the greatest. He starts of as noble teenager wanting to help the world, to murderous psychopath. By the end of the series, many will want him dead, especially after he kills L.And let's talk about L. He is by far the most beloved character, the fan favorite. His character is possibly the most complex and interesting. There is always an area of mystery surrounding him, but he can be really funny and quirky. There are lots of other characters that are pretty good as well. I can honestly say there is only one character is genuinely did not like, and that's Misa. Misa is Harley Quinn, and Light is the Joker. Only difference is, Harley Quinn has an interesting back story, a unique character. Misa, does not.The only other thing I did not love are episodes 17 - 36. While they are still brilliant, it is completely beaten by the first 25 episodes. The finale (episode 37), I'm still split on, and so will many people. However, I felt it was satisfying.The only reason I am not giving this show a 10/10 is due to the second half of the show. However, they are still good and most people will get enjoyment out of them.Death Note is a near masterwork in animation and TV in general history. I highly recommend it to both anime and non-anime fans.",

I mean for most of the anime fans out there , death note was there starting point. The level of dialogues and battle between L and light(kira) is the most brilliant score of this anime. That ironic potato scene is the most anticipated scene in the whole anime world... The sad part is we didn't get to hear the real name of L, I mean we get to see glimpse of his name in Japanese I believe when that second kira saw him for the first time. I don't know if it reveals his name in Japanese. Overall the background score was great compared to other animes in this genre.

The introduction of a brilliant consulting detective creates this excellent cat-and-mouse story, but it's evident the writer wrote himself into a corner and introduces a series of contrivances to keep the narrative going. Add another Kira? Another notebook? Kill a major character and replace them with an exact copy? It only undermines the tension the show has created.There are so many interesting concepts that this show introduces on how power can corrupt, how brilliant minds can face off, how fascist justice can create order but at great cost, but none of these are really explored so much as introduced. Maybe this would only work in a shorter form, or if the original author had taken a little more time to develop it.

Secondly the amount of twist that are predictable are hugely outnumbered by the ones that aren't. I'm not really good at writing reviews as I usually end up giving my opinion. But by any means.

However, reviews don't have to be so staggeringly low for these reasons.the concept behind death note was that based around a very specific idea. Its a style of concept making used in many popular animes(one punch man and naruto). The potential in this idea wasn't too much to be honest. There's not a lot you can do with a notebook of death. However, the creators of this show, put their greatest effort to extract as much of a story as they could from the idea itself. It is comparable to squeezing a lemon. Good tv shows always happen when either a good \"lemon\" is squeezed enough or an ordinary \"lemon\" is squeezed to the fullest(the second one being the concept of death note). While the idea is unappealing in the way it sounds, how it is used is what made this tv show amazing.",

This supernatural notebook is used to kill people by writing their names on it. And Yagami has some wicked plans for the Death Note in order to create a crime-free world by wiping out criminals with it.

A very bright and intelligent student 'Lighht Yagami' finds it and decides to use it to kill the criminals to achieve his dream of crime-free world. What follows afterwords is a continuous battle between Light and a mysterious detective by the name 'L' as both try to outsmart each other in their plans. Both are amazingly smart people and hence it is quite entertaining to watch them as the viewers are sent straight into their minds and we get to experience first hand the logical thinking thinking process of these two geniuses.Each show promises us something new and awesome. No dull moments. Just when you think that its over for either of the characters they do something unexpected and change the game entirely. You can't help but think what's going to happen next.

Anime proved to show such complex fiction plots better than a normal movie played by actors. Also, some soundtracks played are just wonderful.The only objection is that the movie ended so early because of Light's assitant's silly mistake (he went to the bank in an unusual time).

The last episode is a dissappointment, certain plotlines lack, and the feeling of the show completely changes that left a sour taste by the time the show ends.\nThe first episodes though... FIRE. I loved nearly 95% of the show from those episodes and if those final episodes wouldn't happen, I would've put it up there with Cowboy Bebop and other classic animes, but it doesn't deserve the spot of one of the best of all time.

The series, how shall i put it, first off it comes up with like 2 crazy twists per episode, it is SO gripping, once you start watching an episode its just joy all the way. Another great thing about the series is its \"take side\" aspect. You are usually with either \"L\" or Yagami Light, and no matter who you are with there is going to be a complicated reason to why, its a little like politics (sp?). Truth be told, the series isn't exactly as philosophical (again sp?) as you could expect, but it makes up with this in tension and suspense. Another great thing about the series is the character development, while only a select few characters are fully developed, those who are developed are also special, with a lot of personality and a lot of \"I like him because\" or \"I don't like him because\". The music is also very good with a lot of catchy and gripping tracks, although one of them sounds like a rip off of The Exorcist theme with an extra note on top.B U T ! This is the bad part, after a couple of episodes, the series lose its grip, and about the midsection of it is downright boring, it does pick up a little near the end, but doesn't have the same feeling of every episode being fantastic in their own right. But you can see the rest of the episodes as extra topping, you arn't forced to see them, although you probably would, en mildly enjoy, since you are now related to the series.

            "content": "Death Note is arguably the most popular and well-known series in both mainstream and the anime community.The story involves the existence of death note or a notebook of death in which if a person whose name along with the though of their face then that person would die in a few seconds. Ryuk, a death god drops the death note onto earth in hoping that someone would find it and satisfies his boredom.A high school student light yagami finds the death note at his school and starts using it to kill all criminals and thereby create a peaceful world where he can act as it's god.However upon taking law upon his hands light quickly brought police attention and that of the worlds greatest detective known as \"L\". From there on it become a psychological warfare between the two characters where morals and ideals of a person are questioned.Death note is without a doubt among the greatest anime's ever made(at least for the first half). It's a Will crafted story with a tight script, amazing soundtrack,smart deducting and a peculiar color pattern. the first half is basically a psychologically warfare between L and Light. The characters of L and Light are portrayed as intelligent, manipulative and knowledge people who uses questionable methods to find the other and achieve their sense of justice.Light in particular started out as a brilliant and innocent student waiting to join the police force after age but upon finding death note we see light's progression towards a dark nature as little by little as the series progressed.L on the other hand acts as the law but also reveals have no problem in using immoral methods to solve the crimes committed by light.The rivalry exhibited by both light and L is the highlight of the series as it is full of twist,turns and substance.The art direction is really well done often displaying a realistic expressions in picture and the dark and drained color of the art compliments Lights journey to darkness.One of the best elements in death note is it's music.Every track is brilliant is some ways and the soundtrack's are used so efficiently and effectively that it really gives an addictive world of evil as given by the show.Howerver as all good things come to an end, Death Note's quality severely dropped after the death of a certain character and the newly brought out characters both N and M were not properly utilized or written thus cheapening the legacy of the series.The finale which resulted in Lights death was among the most divisive finales in anime where in reality the writers tossed away a realistic conclusion and simply bent the plot to give a morally acceptable solution(don't even give me the crap of how mikami's screw up resulting in lights breakdown and even the more lamer excuse given by N on faking the death note and copying the names in one single night). Like i said the quality goes down the drain during the second half however the overall story ark still prevails moreover we witness the dark and evil nature of light yagami from an innocent student to a sociopath.So overall death note is an iconic and enjoyable anime.The overall morale are basically revealed in the opening episode and the rest is basically an entertaining battle of wits.Highly AttackedFirst half(9.5/10), second half(7.5/10), overall(8.75/10).",

It is so interesting and very different from the series we are used to watch.I am not going to talk in overall, i am just here to talk about the end.During all episodes, i both loved and hated light. Especially after episode 25, i mostly hated him, but still, there was this toxic feeling that i couldn't ignore. However, at the end, i wanted him to win, actually -which i still mostly hated him-. Maybe if he were to lose against L, i would be okay with it, but when it came to Near, I wanted Light to win so bad since Near was a very bad written character after a phenomenon like L. And the connection between Light and L was amazing, which Near and Light didn't have any. So at the end, you know that Light is probably the worst person on earth, he is narcissistic and he thinks of himself as a god, but still, Near is so bad written that you can't accept the fact that Light has lost to this guy! Still, you have this other feeling that even though Light is a genius, he is not perfect and even he can be outsmarted. This plot both feels like it's different, since protagonist does not win and dies in a very, very!! Poor way, but also like it's very cliche, where good guys always win. You don't know how to feel, or should i say, what to feel. It has been years since i watched this freaking anime, but i came here to write a review for the first time in my life, so i'll leave it to you to understand how complex it'll make your feelings.",

Death Note is far too good to be in the same category as Bleach or Naruto. The story is too good to miss and the characters are really interesting. Though you can find minor errors in the plot if you try hard enough, it's still the best story ever been written for an anime. In a sense, it's one of best thrillers I've ever seen. It doesn't follow any old-fashioned thriller style which you can guess the end of by merely watching half way through it. It doesn't keeps you waiting impatiently to find \"the guy behind it\", matter of fact there are no mysteries to find out about in the story, the mystery is the development of story itself! Furthermore, you can't find a character in this series, following the clich\u00e9s of an anime, to be too perfect and unreachable till the very last episodes. Each character has its flaws and seems believable and interesting. To be concise, the writer hasn't tried to make the characters interesting by giving them superhuman powers or putting them in weird situations. What makes them interesting is their role in the story and the decision they make regarding the situations. I can only imagine that the guy who wrote this series is a sick GENIUS.Putting aside the story, the animation is done perfectly and the music follows it quiet well. There are not that many anime clich\u00e9s and at some points the story gets too serious that you forget about it being an anime at all.Overall, excellent Series! 10/10",

            "content": "This show, by far through the past half year that I've spent watching anime, is the best one. The show is about a very intelligent high schooler named Light Yagami who is extremely bored until he finds the Death Note. Sometimes later, he also finds Ryuk, the shinigami who dropped the Death Note. Starting during this moment of the show, Light's journey to start a new world with no criminals begins, but shortly after, the hugest detective in the world, L , interfere with his plans when he tries to uncover Kira's identity. The worst thing about this show was the art since it wasn't too unique. Even then, Death Note strides for some huge big marks.Story: 10/10 I don't think that I've have ever found any show anywhere that had even a remotely close plot to the one this show has. The only problem was that after episode 25, you could sense some of what would happen during the rest of the show's run. But still, the plot is amazing. The show had been very dramatic at some points such as during Light's death and even had somewhat comedy such as when Light and L were chained together. The show had never lost anything, even when Near and Mello came along. It also had a really slow pace to focus on approximately 5 years of Light's life, from high school to him being promoted to the leader of the Japanese police. This was good for the show because it added to the suspense. It actually took time to reveal the plot when compared some other shows that came after it such as Terror in Resonance or blue Exorcist.Art: 8/10 The art on this show wasn't too unique. The only character designs that I found to have been somewhat different were the shinigamis.The background however, was decorated beautifully enough to contribute to the mood.Sound: 10/10 The show had a huge diversity of openings and endings. It ha everything from classic rock and roll to heavy metal which I haven't found a lot of shows, even Durarara to have done based off of Death Note. The background music was also great and it also helped the mood. The sound was done pretty well also, it really added to the detail of the show.Characters: 10/10 The characters on this show were amazing. The most unique thing that I found was that although Light was the protagonist, he technically acted as both, the hero and villain. L was also a good character. I could tell that he inspired some characters which were found in shows after Death Note finished such as Izaya Orihara from Durarara. The only character that was off was Near. He was basically a copy of L. The only thing that was different between both of them was that Near loved playing with toys while L didn't. Misa Amane was also great. Her Gothic nature added to the darkness of the show so she was pretty well developed. Overall the character development was great.I don't think I have found any show that has come near to or has met the level of Death Note besides Steins;gate so the creator Tetsuro Araki did a fantastic job by creating Death Note.",

Also, the theme song is nice and catchy but the 2nd song is not that good. I recommend this series to everyone who is interested in mystery and thriller. I also like the intelligence that the main cop and the main lead has. Both are equally intelligent. Also the female lead is cute. The concept of Shini Gami is nicely put and it makes you wonder if its actually true.",

I don't think anyone could have thought what will happen next. I thought the ending was okay, but for all the knowledge of the show the end was a bit un-ironic and un-emotional. Light for being so smart was an idiot towards the end. Plus to be honest with all of lights genius I wouldn't of thought he would have died.

The rules of the Death Note clearly state, whoevers name is written in the note shall die.With this power Light starts to kill criminals in order to create a perfect world.But when legendary detective,L comes on the case, It turns into a game of life or death.

One of the things that surprised me the most was the soundtrack. Open and ending themes were amazing, but I loved the violins and the crescendo of the sound on tension parts.

            "review_title": "Good story, lots of plot service",
            "content": "I've found it difficult to pick an anime to watch. Most people in the \"fandom\" have high praises for almost anything in the medium.Distinguishing between accurately rated shows and the over hyped entries on anyone's top ten list has been my biggest challenge in finding anime that I enjoy, and this challenge is worsened by the fact that anime truly is not a single genre, but an umbrella with many different styles to check out.That being said, some context for my rating:\nI enjoy shows like Attack on Titan, Cowboy bebop, and I have read all of Berserk. I consider these to be accurately rated and incredible stories.I also thought one punch man season one was good, the bit of demon slayer I watched was good. Outside Anime I am a big fan of breaking bad, Game of thrones, true detective.With all of that being said: I do feel that death note should have been right up my alley, and a 10/10 based on what I had been told prior to watching it. Dark plot, twists and turns, etc.THE GOOD:\nI don't want to come down on the show too hard, so I will start with what I liked.I think the overall plot was inventive, and they took it to some very interesting and unexpected places.The main characters for the majority of the show were great. L and Light's game of cat and mouse was great.The tone was great, cinematography was creative and fantastic (especially the rain sequence in ep 25), The sound track was amazing as well.I did enjoy the watch, but It is far from my \"watch again soon\" list for the reasons outlined next.THE BAD:\nWhile I enjoyed the plot, I think this game of cat and mouse has been done much better elsewhere since. Breaking bad is the perfect example, in my opinion.Comparing it to a show that came much later is not fair, and I do not think the shows are as comparable as others have claimed online.It also does not seem fair to compare it to a show outside its medium and context. These are very different shows with very different goals. And it may also just be true that I am nearing 30 and outside the target audience for this anime.Plot Service:\nMy main issue with the show was the way information was handled. L and Light are designated as geniuses dueling against one another, However the majority of that genius comes in the form of knowing things which would simply be impossible to know or deduce given the information they had in front of them. They just knew more than the audience, or had lingering suspicions that no rational person would have.I know this may sound nit picky, and I will likely be downvoted for this, but it is true.I am not saying that this show wasn't grounded enough in reality for me: I liked attack on titan remember? The plot of that show is far from plausible.I just found the \"intelligence\" of the main characters to be contrived. **Spoilers ahead:**After L locked up Light and Misa, and the killing continued (even with a brief lapse), there would have been no real reason to continue suspecting Light. Believing that his memory may have somehow been wiped or he was being controlled by someone else is a massive leap that makes no sense for him to suspect given the rules the world follows: Shinigami do not exist as far as anyone is concerned.There is no magic in this world, mind control devices, etc. There is simply no reason given that would make this suspicion make sense.His suspicions should have entirely died there but they did not. And this is just one example. Truly L should have stopped suspecting Light the day they put him under supervision and the killings continued. If you watch someone around the clock and see them doing nothing but homework and eating chips, he really should have fallen off of L's personal suspect list.How could someone sitting in their bedroom be responsible for the death of criminals around the globe? He did not leave his room, had no communication with anyone, no radio device, cell phone calls, and he is a school kid.Now I understand it was necessary for the plot to move forward. And demanding every show be entirely grounded in reality is unreasonable and limits creativity. But my critique here is not of the mechanism that the Death note uses to work, or the existence of Shinigami, its of the lack of internal logic in the show. The Character is so intelligent that they piece something together that has no rational basis to it. When the show is essentially predicated on this unreasonable intelligence, this feels like a Deus Ex Machina to me.Targeting Lights location was smart, and narrowing it down with well placed bets was even smarter. But the leap from there to him being a suspect just lacks any reason outside of \"because the writers made him suspect light anyway\".Even if L had somehow caught light writing in a notebook with all of these names, there is no way you could convict him of the imaginary crime of wishing somebody to death. Maybe the justice system works differently in Japan. Maybe the show invented a justice system for their purposes. I don't know. But even L's final wager on the 13 day proposal was an unreasonable assumption.**Breaking Bad Spoiler** Comparing this to Skylers suspicions of Walt in breaking bad: He kept disappearing, ran into a drug dealer class mate, money shows up out of nowhere, two phones... it has a rational basis to piece things together. I understand the plots of these two shows are very different in their dealings with reality vs. The spiritual world (the latter not existing in breaking bad), but the deduction based on the rules of the world still follows.The Last Third:\nI am not the first to make this critique but the show jumped the shark in episode 25. While decent overall, the show lost its driving force after that moment, and I don't feel it picked up the pace fully again.The Pacing:\nMy only other critique was the pacing. It dragged on in many places, especially after episode 25. I felt that a lot of unnecessary elements were added just to stretch it to 37 episodes instead of the 12 it could have been. The girlfriend, the FBI plot... these things could have been cut out without much change to the tone or tension. But I digress.CLOSING STATEMENT:\nIt was good. Not great, not bad, good. I was along for the ride, and episode 25 was really well done. I just don't feel that this is the masterpiece that everyone claims it to be.If the last 12 episodes were better It would be a 7-8, but the plot service greatly diminished the impact of the revelations for me. Having everything be more than sneaking suspicions that just so happened to be correct would have given the entire thing much more impact.That being said, I will continue my quest to find another Anime that rivals AOT (which lags in some places too, to be fair, but remains consistent with its own world).I did enjoy this one, it might be true to say this would have been a 10/10 for me had I watched it 16 years ago, and comparison is the thief of joy.I still will recommend most people give it a shot. With a less than critical lens it was a fun ride.",

Thats such a shocking concept, Very captivating.What sticks most in mind as my favourite things about Death Note are 1) The masterful presentation of a Byronic Hero in Yagami Light. He becomes very dark, evil at times, yet you still route for him, and secretly hope that he will succeed in creating his new world. 2) The 'valediction' by Ryuk where he says '. Well, it was good while it lasted... We killed some boredom, didn't we? ' just reaffirms what a great piece of literature death note is. That piece of metatexuality just puts the icing on the cake for me. I will surely watch more anime soon.",

            "content": "So when I first got into anime this was one of the first series' that I began watching, and I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest...at first. So the series follows almost perfect protagonist Light Yagami, who is a flawless student with a clear and promising future, his life is changed however, when he comes across the Death Note, a book holding the powers of a death god. He uses this to wipe the world clean of criminals, but his morals soon come into question. Obviously the authorities notice this and use what they can to catch the person killing the criminals, who is nicknamed 'Kira' The premise is absolutely fantastic but the only thing that did get me at first was how quickly Light descended into madness, by the end of episode one he was already showing signs of it, which got to me a bit. The characters are great and realistic, and Light's rival named 'L' is a complex but equally interesting character, his goal is to catch Kira and soon Light and L have a game of cat and mouse between them, switching roles on occasions. Now here's for the bad parts of Death Note; First off, the series makes the most simplest of things dramatic, for example, there is extremely dramatic music playing while Light is just writing names down in the death note or just eating potato chips, it isn't that bad, but it makes the series look less serious than it should be. Now here's for the main flaw, the series begins to get repetitive, but then gets good again by episode 20, and episode 25 is absolutely brilliant, but after episode 25? It just gets boring as hell, I nearly gave up on the series because of how boring and uninteresting it got, it introduced two characters, Near and Mello. Near is a little sh*t and makes the series worse while Mello just acts cocky and eats chocolate, which didn't really appeal to me and after looking at other reviews, it didn't appeal to a lot of other people. So in conclusion I recommend Death Note highly because it is a must see series for any anime fan out there.",

Smart, clean, smooth, with one of the most entertaining, unique characters in recent memory - L is made of so much win it's not even funny.The entire premise is very unique and morally provocative. Not to mention, Light is one of the best anti-hero protagonists EVER, and he throws hands-down the best b****-fits. Bristly, indignant Raito-kun caught off-guard and getting all hissy is beyond awesome. Somebody buy the boy a line of shots and a spa package.However, there are exactly 1.5 drawbacks for me when it comes to Death Note: First, the Misa character - who the hell thought it was a good idea to stick a high-pitched airhead in the middle of an otherwise perfectly enthralling, intelligent storyline? I know the creators were probably trying to lighten up the mood, but 1, that's hardly fitting, and 2, the resulting gap in intelligence between L and Light on the one hand and Misa on the other is just jarring and kind of misogynistic. And not-really-second, the second story arc did kind of disappoint, especially after the amazing first half. But I don't know if this counts as a full compliant, bc the second half is by no means bad.And lastly, as with almost all other foreign works, subs > dub.",

Seriously You nailed it guys. Hats off to the maker of this series.

            "content": "I hate anime.This might sound weird coming from a guy who's only two reviews on his account so far are of anime shows, but they're the only two I've seen, and under most conditions, it's a statement that holds true. I find the story lines to be unnecessarily contrived, the visual design to be atrocious, the voice acting to be overdone, and the whole thing all-in-all to be just not for me.However, if there's ever such a thing as a \"gateway\" anime, Death Note is undoubtedly it.If you're like me and skeptical about the prospect of watching any anime, much less this, you should know that almost every single thing that people don't like about anime is not present here. The character designs are sensible (except for the Shinigami, but it makes sense for them), the few action scenes that are here are realistic and not overdone, the voice acting is believable, and most importantly the storyline is very grounded and makes sense, rarely introducing any fantastical elements beyond the premise.It's all-in-all a story of intrigue and mind games. A story in which one character has a mystical item that can cause the death of anyone that he has the name and face of might not sound particularly challenging for said character, but it quickly grows more complicated than that. For all of it's different plot threads, though, the story never feels like it's taking on more than it can handle and never gets too confusing (except for the ending, which we'll get to later).The writers dumped most of their characterization into the show's protagonist, Light Yagami. Despite being the protagonist, he's quite clearly the \"villain\" of the story, making him a character who you simultaneously love and are also rooting against. It's a difficult balance to pull off, but it's done well.The first season's probably better than the second, but the second is still very much worth your time, even to just see what insane and elaborate schemes will come up next. The show has a good sense of humor but never overdoes its comedic bits, taking a role of comic relief very fitting for such a dark storyline.Fans of \"epic\" soundtracks (using the word in as much of the old sense as possible) will also enjoy this aspect; every track in the show is memorable and excellently accompanies the scene it's in.The story loses a bit of steam around the latter parts of the second season, as new antagonists are introduced that, while likable, can never match the perfect dynamic between Light and L. The conclusion of the story in particular is the only part of the story where I felt lost, but the subsequent scenes were much better and, while not perfect, were still a nice conclusion to the series.The real victory of this show is that it's one of the most engaging things I've ever watched while having relatively few \"action\" scenes. The rules of the more fantastical elements are kept constant and logical, and the story avoids introducing new elements in favor of finding new ways to use existing rules. Luckily, none of the sillier parts of the world are ever required to hold up the plot. All-in-all, it's a unique and well-told story, suitable for even the most dedicated dislikers of Japanese animation. Highly recommended.",

The sheer brilliance of both characters creates a mind game that will have you shaking with excitement as strategies and plans unfold.The show also challenges ideals/moral values and you'll have to think hard about your idea of justice as you pick a side- or are unable to.The only negative I can think of is that it felt forced after around 3/4 of the way through, but don't let that stop you from watching- it truly is an incredible series.Notes: Watch with subtitles- the English voice acting simply isn't as good as the original Japanese.It's very important to watch the first 2 episodes. I can almost guarantee you'll be hooked.*The Verdict* Death Note is a dark psychological thriller and you will enjoy watching characters make impossible deductions and work their way out of impossible situations.

One of my main frustrations which became more and more as the series progressed was that nobody tried to Kill K or his associates. It was ludicrous that K was treated with the softest of kid gloves whilst all around various bad and good characters were being assasinated or dieing in their droves. K was like a blood soaked terrorist with his finger over the trigger of a bomb. When it was known beyond reasonable doubt who K was somebody should just have killed him, not even for punishment, not even to prevent further serial murders but for mere self-defense...he is killing all the authorities who are after him and can kill by just writing your name. From watching the ending it seemed the only resolution in mind was confronting K with irrefutable evidence AND getting him to confess so they could, not kill him....just lock him up! All the while giving K numerous opportunities to escape or just kill them by writing their names down.So an interesting show that, for me, just couldn't sustain itself with the plot line it took. I did however appreciate who resolved K's fate...it was quiet apt.",

Based from what I've read in the manga and if they are going to bring the exact storyline from the manga to anime, then I would say that the first few episodes would certainly be very interesting to watch. It'll give you a jolt to your human conscience, whether it is right or not for a human to act this way or that. Anyway, Ryuk rocks! ^-^ He certainly looks cool and funny in his ragged clothes!

The idea of killing criminals around the world is a repetitive and spoilt subject. Although in American movies with this subject, you can find some characters, actions and joyful movements but in this TV series, you can't find any of those things. Self-speaking scenes were spook as hell, those must be shown at dialogs or acts. In dialogs there are so many problems and I will tell you a little bit of them. First of all dialogs were full of useless and additional sentences, for example if the hole speech could be told in 2 sentences, you see 10 sentences full of repeats and useless explanations.

My only logical explanation is that, the writer purposefully made it look like \"Light who was an intellectual to actually turn into a foolish person\" to end the show... so the ending would have been very good if it was something like \"Light getting shot by misa in an unexpected turn of events after killing near\".",

And yet, they are superheroes. The idea itself is not completely bad, but development of the story made him do some things that are characteristic of bad and evil people. He was not a gruesome villain at the beginning and with the power of the book, he became one. I like how \"Death note\" shows us what happens when person has power. Can we change from good to bad or we have all of that inside us, but just showing some of that, depends of situation we're in? What is good and what is bad?

            "review_title": "Death note is one of the greatest anime of all time",
            "content": "Death note has one of the most interesting concepts, I've ever seen in anime. It's about a Teenage kid, who picks up a notebook that can kill anyone. Concepts like this live and die on how they're executed . Death note is one of those rare occasions when a show doesn't just execute this concept to its upmost potential, it's much much more...Well, let's not get carried away, I'll explain why.\nIt starts off with as I said a Teenage kid by the name of Light Yagami picking up a deadly book, that can kill anyone! Light decides to use this notebook to kill all of the criminals in the world. Naturally, the Interpol realizes there is a large increase in criminal deaths and decide to put the best detective in the world a mysterious man only known by the name of L to the job. L, takes up their offer and this is where Death note's story really starts to shine! The relationship between Light and L is very unique. L, considers Light his rival and wants him to be Kira meanwhile, Light wants to kill L and to finally get him off his back. They both despise each other, and this triggers an unpredictable cat and mouse chase between the two in the hopes of one of them \"Winning\" once and for all. It's unpredictable, that It made me think and guess till the very end. How would Light get out of this situation? How would L trick Light intro revealing himself? Fortunately, Death note isn't just about the mind games. It presents the viewer with pretty thought provoking themes, it makes you question yourself many times. Is Light doing the right thing? Should we really let these ruthless criminals live? Are the rules of society preventing us from creating a better world for mankind? When a story makes you second guess your morals and beliefs like this, you know it's something very special. A common complaint Death note receives is that it had a weak second half. I disagree, I thought the second half was very good. Yea, Near and Mello aren't nearly as charismatic and entertaining as L, but that surely doesn't make them bad characters! They had pretty interesting back stories, and had a certain level of unpredictability that made their intellectual battles with Light all the more entertaining. They also had a pretty interesting relationship, that made me tense up every time they confronted each other. That's not the only reason... It also showed us Light's path to insanity and how the Death note impacted him and changed him into who he hated the most. The way he developed really showed us how greedy humans get when they taste power. He changed from his calm old self into an arrogant jerk, who uses others to get what he wants, and won't let any get in his way no matter what... Even if it requires killing them.\nThe show is basically carried by 4 characters(If you count Misa) the first being, Light Yagami. Light Yagami starts off with a noble wish to stop crime. He's a handsome, intelligent, calm and collected guy. He's a sheltered genius with the with the power to change the world. As the series goes on, he changes bit by bit, and begins to lose sight of himself and forgets who he really was and starts becoming arrogant, and loses his humanity.(This is the 2nd time, I've mentioned this, but it's that good!) This is proven when Light loses his memories! He wants to help the police, doesn't want to use people,and he wants to catch Kira! This always fascinates, and makes me question myself... What if Light never got this deadly book? He could've been one of the good guys! L, is the opposite of Light he's somewhat ugly, dirty, and is more of a mad genius, then a sheltered one. He had a certain charisma and presence that was vital to the show's success. I mentioned before that the death note was dropped from the sky, well who dropped it? It was dropped by a death god by the name of Ryuk! He dropped it for one reason, and one reason only and that's because he was bored! That made me chuckle when I first heard it. Ryuk is a great character, that adds a bit of comedy(Albeit dark comedy) To a pretty dark show. His relationship with Light is Simply extraordinary and is the essence of the show. The chemistry between them is magnificent and they play off of each other naturally. Unfortunately, Ryuk doesn't make as much appearances in the second half as I would've wanted, but I digress. We have Misa, who adds a certain level of appeal to the show? Let's be real, she's completely useless and unnecessary but I still thought she was entertaining to a degree.\nI loved the visuals. They fit the show's dark nature and atmosphere well. The character designs are also very well done and help set Light and L apart from other anime characters. The animation is phenomenal! Just look at the potato chip scene and tell me that's not good animation! I also appreciate the level of detail that was put in the car chase scenes.One of the best parts of this anime is the soundtrack! The two openings show us how Light changed during the anime. The symbolizes how calm and collected he was at the start of the show, and how prepared he was to change the world for the greater good. Meanwhile, the second one symbolized how Light had changed during the show and how he became corrupted by greed and power. And I'll be honest they made me genuinely excited to watch every episode, they're great. The ost really enhanced the experience and made the show a whole lot better. Seriously, I sometimes rewatch scenes just for the sake of listening to those tracks again. The voice acting is phenomenal in both languages. But I have to give an extra round of applause to the English voice actors! Brad swalie and Julianie Alessandro voiced Light and L magnificently! And they're not alone, all of the English voice actors did a great job. They're voices and the great sound track enhanced the show dramatically and are the main reasons, I prefer the anime over the manga.\nOverall:Death note has delivered on every single aspect, and is easily one of the greatest anime of all time(If not the greatest) And I'll give it my first ever 10/10. A must watch! Seriously, if you haven't watched it get off of mal and immediately watch it NOW!",

You will find yourself wanting to ditch whatever commitments you might have just so that you can sneak in one more episode of the series. Without revealing too much, it is just an amazing plot, a solid error free story line, and an all star team doing the English dubs for the series. It truly is remarkable.

Best one I had ever seen....and no way you can really figure out the succession unless of course if you really are a genius.",

That is, the amazingness of the series was the fight between Light and L, and the moment L died, just consider the show coming to a good end. After L's death, the whole Near and Mello saga was interesting in the beginning, but by the last 3-4 episodes things were so all over the place that you don't understand the logic being used to come to conclusions. Still the show was just too good. It's suspense of what will happen now and the brainstorming between the 2 masterminds (I mean, Light and L) trying to overcome the other is just so very addicting and engaging. I'd started the show thinking that I'll only watch 2 episodes a day max, but I ended up binge-watching the entire series in 2 days.",

            "content": "I've never written a review but i will for the first time because of how frustrating it is that everyone calls believes this to be a masterpiece.The first half has great tension and character building and any plot holes and are excusable because they're necessary to drive the plot forward creating an interesting foil to Kira. It is necessary for the story to go forward but so many ridiculous deductions ruin the credibility of the story and its logical premise (which the show flaunts).How could Near know of the deathnote before its existence? Based on a cop saying that out loud? How could Near deduce rule 13 was fake when Mello gave no information while never even having access to a deathnote? Why is it Okay for Mello to kidnap and murder, Near all of a sudden turns a blind eye? Not to mention how the hell Mello didn't get shot nor did he die and why Mr. Yagami's murderder was chilling in that room. Then for the first half you have an ever more Godlike L basing an entire accusation on assumption and calling it proven. If characters are allowed to have such plot armor to deduce and question Light at will, why didn't anyone question the super-detectives? L or N could have just as easily been Kira but the Japanese force didn't question them one time. They gave them everything even after L was \"proven\" wrong. In the perspective of Light, it was sad to see him forced to cooperate with all their commands when he had every reason not to especially once he cleared his name.If you watch this anime rooting for Light the psychopath, which is how it is meant to be watched, it is a disappointing ride. It is quite clear that if someone else had Deathnote power it would be abused even more. It is not a masterpiece but an entertaining one. I'd even rather recommend the movie, especially taking the second half of the anime into consideration.",

I have seen couple of superb works of anime before and after it, but honestly, nothing can reach up to the level of Death Note. I wasn't able to understand why something so genius have never been made into a live-action series before, but then it hit me that it will never be as good as the anime. I realized that after i saw the live-action movies. The main characters were delivered so brilliantly to the level you find yourself attached to one of them. One of the reasons that made it so popular and made it also one of the most controversial animes. Despite the storyline which was shocking at how genius it was, The continuity of the episodes was excellent as well as the music and the digital graphics. For me, this series can simply compete with all real live-action thriller series running at the moment. That's why i recommend it to even those who never watched anime ever.",

            "content": "There isn't much out there that comes close to Death Note. Anime has gained somewhat of a reputation for being one-dimensional and focused on action rather than plot and character.This is not the case in Death Note. This is actually a show that has less action than what you would expect, but masterfully keeps your attention anyways. Death Note focuses on a young man, Light Yagami, who finds a notebook which has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it. This notebook is accompanied by a Shinigami, a god of death. Light, being an ambitious young man bored with his current state of life, decides to utilize this power. He begins executing criminals, achieving justice. He becomes Kira, the god of a new world. As Light kills more criminals, he is hunted by his own father and a word-renowned genius. Light maintains the illusion that he is a prestigious high school student, while meanwhile he grows more and more ambitious with his killings as Kira. Finally, after the Kira issue has become a tangled web extending across the world, entangling many people, the plot comes to a crashing halt with a conclusion that left me staring at my television with my mouth hanging open long after the ending credits had rolled.Death Note is an especially unique anime due to the fact that it made me question my own beliefs. I was unsure if I should be supporting Light in his killing of the criminals of the world, or if I should disapprove of his murders.The issue that haunted me throughout the series and that I still can't stop thinking about: Was Light completely delusional or painfully sane?Death Note is an amazing blend of fantasy, mystery, and thriller that tackles themes on justice, ethics, and perhaps most of all the painful reality that all humans will die. Aside from the plot, this anime has some beautiful animation, excellent voice acting in the Japanese version at least, and is overall a must-see for not only anime fans but anyone. This is an unforgettable show that will dwell with you for a long time.",
