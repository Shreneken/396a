            "content": "After sitting through the entirety of Daddy Day Camp, I have to wonder what was going through everyone's minds who were involved in the making. The most likely reason was probably them thinking, \"Is it really possible to make a movie this year that is worse than Evan Almighty and Delta Farce? Let's go for it!\" Fortunately, Daddy Day Camp is nowhere near as horrible as those other two films, but lord know that it does come very close. This abomination of a movie somehow manages to feature a great actor, Cuba Gooding, Jr., in by far his worst role yet.Anyone even slightly familiar with the first film will know the deal here. Low on money, Charlie Hinton decides to open up a camp similar to the day care service he ran in the first movie. Along the way, he must resolve problems with his father and show his son that he really loves him.Yes, I know the plot sucks. While the first movie wasn't anything to write home about, Daddy Day Camp is about a thousand times worse. In the few scenes where there is supposed to be something meaningful occurring, everything just comes off in the wrong way. It might be because everything about this careless sequel is just ridiculous. Was it really necessary to make a sequel? The first film is almost entirely disregarded and almost every role is recast (although I haven't seen the first one in quite some time so there might not be any of the original cast members returning.) When Eddie Murphy turned down the movie, they should have just dropped it and forgotten about it. He was part of what made the first movie work, to some sort of level. His manic energy, his great comedic timing, his general appeal\u0085 Cuba Gooding Jr. is a great actor, but this role was just altogether wrong for him. It just didn't work as well as it should have. That being said, however, he was certainly the best aspect about this utterly atrocious film.Daddy Day Camp is missing much of the magic that made the first movie watchable. None of the scene meld together very well (some of the younger characters go from heartfelt moments, to being rude to other kids for no reason to be rude and increasingly annoying) and the writing and dialogue are as unbelievable as they come. The villain is just pathetic, and the lesson that is supposed to be learned by the end of the film is a very weak one. Since none of the younger characters follow this lesson throughout the movie or seem to have learned anything by the film's end, it all feels just so useless. There are also, of course, those same old gross-out gags that you find in any boring family comedy. Here, however, they are not done as tastefully as in Underdog or as effectively as in the Cheaper By the Dozen films. In Daddy Day Camp, just like with the first film, it is pretty much lame gag after lame gag, watching flashy boring moments thrown onto the screen in the hopes that something will stick and not come off as completely and totally immature. In the first film, more often than not, most of the gags worked to a certain extent. In this film, there are very few redeeming factors, though. Barely any of those gags work. In fact, I didn't even crack a smile throughout the whole movie, and I am incredibly easy to please.Another huge problem of the film was that most of the child actors were not only annoying, but their acting was so bad that I wanted to kill myself. Each person had their moments, but the kids mostly came off as incredibly inexperienced. Movies as bad as Daddy Day Camp could at least have the common decency to provide us with a semi-likable cast of children that won't annoy us to death throughout the movie. The people who cast this predictable shame of a movie should have learned a lesson from the talents of the kids in the feature film adaption of How to Eat Fried Worms. All of those kids were incredibly likable, and I loved every minute spent with them and their childhood lives. That film is much more interesting and complex than this simplistic bore-fest that cannot even credit a single laugh to its name. With Evan Almighty, I did at least laugh quite a few times. In Daddy Day Camp, I cannot even give it that compliment. The only reason that it ended up better than Evan Almighty was because of the story between Charlie and his father. Surprisingly enough, it actually worked at times, and it worked very well I must say. And not all of the kids were completely terrible.So all in all, Daddy Day Camp was a pretty crappy movie filled with wasted talent and some of the worst child actors I've seen on screen. It is really obvious from the get-go that very little effort was put into this boring sequel. I just hope that nobody goes into this movie expecting even a relatively good movie, because it disappoints with even the lowest of expectations. 2.5/10",

One of the guys, Charlie, is at odds with the guy who runs the other more fancy camp. Charlie doesn't want that guy to take over the older camp. Some of the \"funny\" parts were the cleaning up of the camp. It's always so funny to see someone fall through a roof while hammering or cleaning up a nasty bathroom. It will have you rolling in the floor, NOT!! So, the ending is the predictable competition between the 2 camps and the other camp cheats to win some of the games. But, Charlie's kid saves the day by winning.Why would Cuba Gooding be in this. He must have been desperate for a check.FINAL VERDICT: You will hate yourself if you waste 90 minutes on this.

The second half of the movie is just good, when the plot picks up, evolving around a rivalry between two summer camps, intertwined with \"lessons\" about the father-son relationship. Despite that this movie is currently rated on average 1.7, I don't think that any child will be disappointed by it; they just don't vote on IMDb that young. If you want to hire a movie for your kid between 5 and 10 years old, don't be afraid to hire this one and I assure they'll have lots of fun and really feel good afterwards.",

            "review_title": "Send Fred Savage to Movie-making Day Camp",
            "content": "It is impossible to have a spoiler for this movie, because it is already rotten. At age 31, Fred Savage should know better. Directing his first feature film after years of work in television, he allows Cuba Gooding, Jr. to shamelessly mug the camera as if his eyebrows needed exercise. I have had high school student directors who exercised more restraint than this. I really don't mind fourth-grade gross-out humor either (my wife teaches fourth grade), but the bits in this sad excuse for a movie are merely gross without being remotely funny. Brown (did it have to be brown?) water gushing from the most disgustingly filthy toilet in history is not funny. Having a small boy throw up in the camp director's tent is not funny, no matter how tightly Gooding can clench his facial muscles in response. The most amateurish comedian knows that jokes have to be set up. In this movie there is no setup, there is no payoff, hence there is no joke. Having Gooding's character take a pratfall every third time he stands up doesn't help. In a theater full of families we were 50 minutes into an 80 minute movie before anyone actually laughed.It would be tedious to note every major problem in this movie. Here is one. The big bully kid (there has to be one, of course) who looks to be about twelve going on thirteen, turns out to have a bed wetting problem (note the originality of this plot twist). A big, bad Marine colonel admits that he had the same problem until he was ten. This means the bully must be under the age of ten. But in his first appearance in the movie this same kid complains, \"I wanna stay home and watch nudie movies.\" For those who may have forgotten fourth grade, this is not normal nine-year-old dialog. I begin to wonder about Fred Savage's childhood. Oh, that's right. He grew up in Hollywood.There is only one exception to the annoying hyperactivity of the entire cast: the quiet dignity of Richard Gant as Gooding's Marine colonel father. An excellent actor who has never made it big, Gant almost manages to make his scenes work. The problem is that even though others are on screen at the same time, Gant is always working alone.Not even the moral of the story - and this being a \"family film\" there must be a moral - provides any redemption for this movie. The closing scenes seem to establish that if the other guys cheat, you should cheat right back. Let's hope director Savage watches a few good comedies before he tries again.",

It kinda remind me my childhood. Kid's acting was not annoying, and directing - not boring. Storyline - simple, but not crazy unbelievable. Jokes makes me smile, but not laugh of course, i am probably too old for this humor :) But kids may like it very much. And most important, movie is not stupid and has some moral thoughts.It is definitely NOT 2nd worst movie in history! I see A LOT of movies every day and to half of them i am not paying attention too much or just turn off after few boring minutes. Daddy day camp i watched till the end (and with some pleasure). 5/10p.s. but if this movie had 3/10 i am probably never would watch it :) \"Worst in the history\" take my attention.",

His performance here isn't exactly one that suggests he cares about how he comes across - he is constantly mugging and overacting, and it's hard to care for his character or for Gooding himself. It's also hard to care about anything else in this movie. The bad guys are cartoon characters, and the white partner of Gooding's character is given almost nothing to do. As for the rest of the protagonists, they are a group of people you will hope will fail, mainly because the kids are obnoxious stereotypes. Throw in some gross literate potty humor, as well as the production values of a television drama, and you get what you think you'll get just by seeing the front of the movie's DVD case.",

            "content": "Wow. I can only assume that either Cuba Gooding Jr.'s agent is crazy. How else can an actor go from an Oscar-winning performance in \"Jerry McGuire\" to making crap like \"Daddy Day Camp\" in a decade? As the expression goes....\"my how the mighty have fallen\"! Here, you know you are in for trouble when this film is meant as a DVD sequel, of sorts, to an Eddie Murphy comedy--a man whose taste in film projects in recent years has also been baffling to say the least! Both men play the same character, Charlie Hinton, and I guess we are to assume he's been through a major accident and massive plastic surgery between films--only this would explain how much Charlie has changed! So why would I choose to watch a film that from all appearances will be crap? After all, in addition to the down and out Gooding, the film also has the distinction of being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films with at least 1500 ratings. Well, by this point, I've done over 8000 reviews and I've gotten bored. After watching a lot of foreign, art and independent films, I have recently decided to try watching the very worst there is to offer as a change of pace! I've already seen 41 of the 50 worst films from the Harry Medved book (\"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\") and since the other 9 just don't seem to be available, I'm now working on IMDb's list. This particular film is about the 55th film from this list I have seen. Wow, am I a glutton for punishment!! But also, I like laughing at the ineptness of many of these films--they often really are unintentionally funny. Of course, occasionally they are just horrible...period.The film begins with a Black actor and a White actor (just like in \"Daddy Day Care\"--just with different actors). They are trying to find the perfect summer day camp experience for their kids. They hit upon the lame idea of re-opening the camp that they'd gone to as kids--as it's bankrupt and COULD be run successfully if they use their \"Daddy Day Care\" method they used in the last film.As for the camp, the kids and their parents are all kooky characters (or is it 'caricatures'?. Of course, things soon completely fall apart at first and things look dire for the future of the camp--especially when the folks at Camp Canola (who bear a lot of similarity to the folks at Cobra Kai) try to put them out of business and buy their land. But, given that this is a Hollywood film, you can safely assume that against all odds, everything will magically work out by the end of the movie. So what is their secret for making it all work? Charlie brings in his drill sergeant-like father, the Colonel, to help run things--since he is an organized man of action. And, of course, there is the obligatory sports competition between the nice camp and the evil one. Overall, the film isn't quite as bad as you might think, though it's all formulaic and predictable and has every clich\u00e9 this sort of film could possibly have. Now I am not saying it's good--but it's also pretty harmless entertainment for kids. However, I can't imagine teens or parents watching this poorly written fluff and actually enjoying it because the writing is amazingly broad and the humor awfully dim.",

Upon seeing the case for the movie, I realized that Eddie Murphy was not in the movie. I turned the case around, and discovered that the same character was being played by another actor; an actor who shouldn't be in terrible sequels, playing an already well-known actors character, only a few years after the original had come out. The film itself delivers a lack-luster storyline and secondhand laughs. The acting isn't so great and the believability of the entire thing is low, much unlike most of the first movie. I'm going to have to say, for Oscar-winning Cuba Gooding Jr. to take a role such as this, he may have risked his entire career's great overview. The original itself wasn't exactly sequel prone, but at least it was watchable.",

Cuba Gooding, Jr., is not as wildly off the wall as Eddie Murphy, nor as funny. Still, the conflict between his character and his character's father is something that many fathers and sons encounter and can relate to. The interplay between Cuba and his on screen wife is also something to which many husbands and wives can relate.Most of the laughs are for wacky, wildly inappropriate adventures, and the conflicts between Camp Driftwood and the exclusive rival camp brings up many noteworthy topics for family members to discuss long after the movie is over. This is a silly, pleasant movie, that is probably just as good on cable or DVD as it is in the movie theater. However, that being said, with so many non-family friendly movies in the theater this summer of 2007, this might be one of the better movies for the family to see before school is back in session.",

The sequel is so much different that... well, it really isn't a sequel. Every roll has been recast. The plot, instead of being humorous, is nonexistent. Eddie Murphy, who was a highlight of the original, isn't here. The children seem passive-aggressive, one moment having a heartfelt conversation and the next screaming at each other or breaking into a snack shack for ice cream. But the real problem is, this film is just... not funny. It tries to be, and several scenes, if they were in another film, would have been. However, the idiocy of the plot, stale acting, and psychologically disturbed children take away from a possible slapstick laugh. Of course, the adults are stupid too. Why have a mock-war with someone who vandalizes your camp? Why not just call the police? Great things to teach three-year-olds, alright. Other things they love to teach kids? Underlying stereotypes run rampant in the film. There are scenes where girls, \"jocks\", and \"gamers\", are all stereotyped, (albeit unfairly). If this film were actually funny, there would be nothing to complain about. But the stereotyping is actually serious, and comes off a little strangely. The only highlight of this film is the man who plays Cuba Gooding's father. Never seen him before, but being able to actually act well in this mockery of a movie awards him some merit.",

This time however the studio and the director could get no one from the original movie to come back. I think the preview was funny when it said \"from the studio that brought you Daddy Day Care\", like the studio ever really matters. That's like saying, \"Yea we made that one and then we made Bikini Sluts 9\", since studios make a wide variety of movies. Anyway, OK so you want to make a sequel and you can't get anyone from the original, they why would you use the same character names. I mean what are we supposed to think that people morphed overnight. We aren't talking about like one minor actor decided not to come back, no one would even be associated with the film, not even for a brief walk-on.",

            "content": "Charlie (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Phil (Paul Rae) have been running their successful Daddy DayCare for several years now. However, summer vacation starts and the kid care guys are ready for a break. Not so fast! Charlie's wife thinks it would be good for their now elementary ages son to go to day CAMP. This horrifies Charlie, who hates bugs, snakes and competitive sports. But, when he finally agrees, there is no other camp choice but the one he, Charlie, went to, Driftwood. Driving out to the woods, though, with his son and Phil, they are astonished by a couple of things. First, there is a flashy day camp just next to Driftwood, run by an medal-winning and obnoxious Olympic athlete (Lochlyn Munro). Secondly, Driftwood is about to go under from the competition and is extremely rundown. Guess who steps in to turn it around, Charlie and Phil, that's who. Good at promotion, they snag a bus load of kids for their first week. But, after exposing the kids to poison ivy, wet boots, getting lost among the trees, etc., they lose a good deal of the children to the nearby \"super\" camp. Not wanting to be defeated, Charlie calls on his retired Marine-father colonel, Buck (Richard Gant). to help save the day, even though they have crossed horns many times. Eventually, the wangle more kids AND a day of competition with their foes next door. Who will win? Viewers may think they are traveling down Deja Vu lane, which is true, but the movie still hits the funnybone. The cast is one big reason, for Gooding, Jr., Paul, Munroe, Gant and the rest enthusiastically play out the slapstick script. All other film aspects, that is, costumes, sets, script and direction are worthy as well. Think this is one to skip? Not so, its fun!",

            "content": "In the midst of big blockbusters and award-winning films, it's all too easy to forget that most of Hollywood's output is stale, rehashed trash. That is, until you come face-to-face with one of those films. This is a boring, by the numbers film designed purely to cash in on the nostalgia of American parents for something they did when they were young. No one working on it had any idea how to make the characters' motivations fit the script, and the result is a cast of unlikeable characters who make stupid decisions. The entire premise for the story falls apart when you realise the main character could have just called the police on the other camp and solved all his problems, but no, Hollywood has to fill its quota of films teaching manly self-reliance as a religious absolute, and that the little guy can always stick it to the man if he believes (despite the mountains of evidence that this approach fails 99.9% of the time). If this worked, why is there a police force? Why are there laws? Above all, why is it 'the man' keeps promoting this message via terrible children's films?Aside from the crippling problems with the overall story, this so called comedy only ever attempts jokes on a par with The Garbage Pail Kids Movie. Your film has a problem if it's possible to draw parallels between characters in your film and TGPKM based on the disgusting qualities of the characters. The resolution of the film even has similarities to that of TGPKM, with protagonists winning various events using skills such as projectile vomiting, or throwing urine over another child.This is an awful film. It is not remotely entertaining, even for its flaws. It teaches an awful message, and bizarrely even sexualises one of the children. Do not watch this, and especially do not show it to children.",

The emotional aspect is that a father and son learn to see each other's strengths. Not a bad lesson to learn. And that, in turn, is passed on to another father and son. It also teaches a lesson about cheating.Cuba Gooding is one actor I sort of feel sorry for. I don't feel too sorry for him...he's supposedly worth about $15 million, but his career has not fulfilled its early promise. I think there have been a number of bad selections of projects to work in. But I like him in a film. He does fine here as the co-owner of Daddy Day Care.Lochlyn Munro plays Gooding's childhood enemy and the owner of a rival camp. He does fine, also, though I imagine he's a more limited actor than Gooding. Richard Gant plays Gooding's somewhat estranged father -- a retired military officer who takes army tasks too seriously. He's good here. Interestingly, Spencir Bridges, who plays Gooding's son, is the real life son of Todd Bridges.He was quite good here.Look, it ain't Shakespeare. Nor was it intended to be.

Vomit and farts and piss jokes aren't funny when are they going to get that through their thick skull.",

Ten years ago, having a former Academy Award winner starring in this dreck would have been shocking. But now, considering the downward spiral Gooding's career has become, this is merely par for the course. As for the other past members, there's the generic fat guy and a young mop-haired actor apparently subbing for Steve Zahn. None of the child actors have any charisma at all, and most of them only appear to be reading lines without any idea of what the words mean. \r\nThey each have their \"thing\" (uncontrollable vomiting, unreasonable intelligence, etc.) and that's what passes as being a \"character\". The one positive here is the mercifully short running time that could have been shortened even more if the writers cut out all of the jokes about bodily functions. And stuck in the middle of it all is Mr. \"Show me the money\", wondering how it all went wrong.\r\n\"Daddy Day Camp\" was made for kids, and they'll probably eat it up.

Daddy day care was good for a laugh, as was daddy day camp.  Simply the fact that you douchbags think you can come to a forum, and speak your mind, simply based on the last review reverts to my original statement.  Enjoy the movie, for the reason of it being a movie.  When we were kids, we didn't have internet, and we LOVED even the shittiest of movies.  I know being in camp and watching \"Bingo\", \"Teenage Mutant Turtles\", or anything Ernest goes to on a rainy day, meant time with the girls, not time being an internet tough-guy......

It is a sincere, magical tale that all generations can enjoy. By now I hope you realize that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m full of shit. Daddy Day Camp is the cinematic equivalent of horse manure. Wait a minute- I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even say that because at least with horse crap you can grow something useful. The only thing that Daddy Day Camp grows is a reputation of being one of the worst films ever made.\n\n\nThe film is a sequel to 2005\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daddy Day Care, which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very good movie itself, and has the distinction of having absolutely no one from the original film in its cast (the fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that means that someone will correct me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be honest, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste the time checking because what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point). This time around Charlie (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Phil (Paul Rae) end up running a day camp due to Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood nightmare of blowing a triathlon at Camp Driftwood thirty years earlier. From here it goes into a crappy version of Meatballs/Bad News Bears as the campers compete against the rival Camp Canola. Farting and belching ensues.\n\n\nWe could address the problems with Daddy Day Camp one by one, but I have to eat sometime and, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest, most of you out there know that this movie sucks. I knew it sucked, but I had a 2 for 1 rental and my son wanted to see it because of the first one. He liked it, but a good fart joke is like Richard Pryor to him, too. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone over the story, which is pretty much every other underdog camp story known to man. Only this time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executed very poorly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cringe worthy. The acting also fails on all levels. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to blame the kids because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kids, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the guy that won an Oscar. The idea that Cuba Gooding, Jr. won an Academy Award leaves a little bit of green on poor old Oskie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Pat Quinn of the Academy, being in the right place at the right time. I know I can say the same thing about Marisa Tomei, but at least she had a good turn in The Wrestler and not because she was topless. The tell tale sign was when Eddie Murphy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this movie. When Eddie Murphy won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be in your movie then you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be garbage. Eddie and bad movies is like Mikey and Life cereal- he just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough. Enter Cuba.\n\n\nKids will like Daddy Day Camp. So save it for a long car ride and give them some head phones. Let the 90 minutes of joy engulf them as they watch. Ten years from now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it on cable, watch five minutes and realize \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis movie sucks, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch Night Patrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming\u00e2\u0080\u00a6",

I love Cuba and think he is a great actor so it pains me to see him melting away in front of us on the screen. Had it been a Sandlot, or Big Green, or Little Giants, or Bad New Bears, or Heavyweights, or Mighty Ducks, than it wouldn't have been so bad.

            "content": "Let us begin by considering this: Eddie Murphy said NO to this movie. Let that stew in your head-pan for a while. Eddie Murphy turned this movie down. He turned it down for Norbit, but we're getting ahead of ourselves here, let's just focus on this for now... Daddy Day Camp was too crap for Eddie Murphy.\n\nWOW.\n\nI don't even recall ever sitting through Daddy Day Care and that movie actually contained actors I either like or still respect for their past body of work, so I wondered how long it would take for me to catch up to speed with these characters.\n\nEarly on I assume the entire point of the first film was to establish how children are all little bastards and we should begin lobbying for some kind of mandatory reproductive quality control scheme. We see a small child ruin a cake that somebody clearly spent hours baking and preparing just because the impatient little whore can't wait for it to be served in manageable slices. Incidentally this cake reads \"Daddy Day Care, Class of 2007\" so I am lead to believe there have been several \"classes\" in this Day Care scheme and I am left to wonder why this monstrous experiment has been allowed to continue for this long. We see a montage of kids acting \"precious\" (read: fucking shit up), there is paint splashing everywhere, urinating into plant pots. It's the sacking of Rome, writ small.\n\nCuba Gooding Jnr continues his self-destructive downward spiral into fiery oblivion, it doesn't even appear that he's trying to do an Eddie Murphy impresson. He merely looks like he's doing an impression of a man who isn't imploding in on himself into a black hole of irrelevance, and he isn't doing a very good job of that.\n\nCuba and some fat guy who is playing Jeff Garlin's character but not actually bothering to be the same kind of character that Jeff Garlin tends to play (which is always the sign of a good sequel), not only do they not look like the right characters but they don't even act like them!\n\nLochlyn Munro plays some rich asshole who bullied Cuba as a child and wants to buy out Cuba and not-Jeff Garlin's old childhood summer camp, in an act of petty vengeance Cuba and not-Jeff Garlin buy a share in the camp and are left to run it when the former owner, the always reliable Brian Doyle-Murray, hauls ass out of the camp and out of the movie like the wise man he is.\n\nNow, Munro was a damn legend in Dead Man on Campus, so I give him a free pass for being here, and that's more than he deserves. Nobody else gets a free pass here.\n\nPredictably the camp needs a little work, there is a methane problem in the bathoom, and apparently that manifests itself with mysterious farting noises coming out of the pipes. Does methane actually do that? I'm not a scientist, so I wasn't aware that farts could just happen without any biological function to facilitate them. These phantom farts are probably the most fascinating concept in the entire film, but all it serves to do is set up a predictable toilet explosion scene later on, so the mystical ghost flatulence is squandered with an easy joke. I expected so much more from thi- OK, I can't finish that. Sarcasm only stretches so far before it snaps back in your face and lacerates the surface of your eyeballs.\n\nAfter some haphazard maintenance is carried out on the camp, they are ready for business, and out roll the children. Aww, look how sweet and smart they all are, right? Full of personality and spunk! What little treasures...\n\nLittle fucking bastards, they are!\n\nThere is nothing that makes me want to wield a shotgun in a public place more than kids trying to talk like adults, or in this films case; retarded adults.\n\nLines such as \"Watch the merchandise, dude!\" and \"Call me Mullet, business up front, party at the back, baby!\" make me desperately yearn for new technological advance that allows me to physically slap the characters on screen.\n\nThere is also a ginger fat kid with an overly aggressive attitude, ginger kids usually turn out to be dicks in films and TV shows (we all remember Ferguson from Clarissa Explains It All, right? Right? Hello?), I'm sure that is some kind of racism but who cares? They're just gingers.\n\nAnd they are ugly, ugly children. I have never seen so many hideous children in all my life. Their parents should be ashamed of themselves for spawning these little shits. Especially the parents of that ginger ogre and the mulleted hillbilly rodent. The parents of these creatures need to have their tubes tied, which links back to my calls for a government controlled breeding program.\n\nCuba bathes his child in tomato juice, for some reason, during one scene. Was that established in the first film? Seems a little unwholesome to bathe your child in orange shit in the yard.\n\nMunro's evil rival camp challenges them to a sports contest, as evil rival camps tend to do, but Cuba declines at first, incurring some attacks in the form of paintball ambushes from the bitter rivals camp. That really isn't safe at all, where is the health inspector while all this is going on? So Cuba calls on his dad (a Colonel in the army or something) to help \"motivate the troops\", and instead he employs said troops in a retaliatory gunk bomb attacks using water balloons filled with what I can only imagine is a mixture of vomit and menstrual fluid. It's probably something more clean and family friendly but I'm at a loss to figure out what it is or where they found it.\n\nEventually Cuba accepts the rival camps challenge. You can probably imagine how it all plays out from there, fair play, the importance of teamwork, father/son relations, unspectacular children exceeding their expectations, montages, inspirational swelling music, etc...\n\nAround the halfway point I decided to begin rhythmically punching myself in the balls to make the experience more enjoyable. I threw up once as a result but that did provide me a moments respite from the film before resuming viewing. Vomit and bruised balls go hand in hand with Daddy Day Camp, put that on the DVD cover, please.\n\nIf this film has achieved nothing else, and I'm fairly sure it hasn't, it's finally offered that moment where Cuba Gooding Jnr has hit rock bottom. That look in his eye at numerous points in this film is clear that the last glimmers of hope have finally died. I can only hope he receives the help he needs and make amends for all that he has done.\n\nUntil they offer him a role in another Daddy Day Blank movie, that is.\n\nPerhaps Daddy Day Cruise, where he and a man replacing not-Jeff Garlin buy a boat and take kids out into international waters where they are free to urinate and vomit on whatever they want, and also encounter Somalian pirates! Oh boy!\n\nOr Daddy Day Kart, where Cuba and not-not-Jeff Garlin buy a go-kart track and are challenged to a racing tournament by a rival go-kart track and the winner gets the loser's go-kart track and the evil rivals cheats by employing the skills of whatever NASCAR pro has outstanding gambling debts that need paying off, and so agrees to star in this movie.\n\nOr Daddy Day Court, where Cuba and not-not-not-Jeff Garlin (not-not Jeff Garlin quit due to a pay dispute) are put up in court before a judge after one of the kids from his Day Care/Camp/Cruise/Kart venture accuses Cuba of putting his fingers up the boy's butt. In a farcical twist the defendants are represented by a smart talking 7 year old in a suit and the jury are populated by an evil rival jury that want to see Cuba and not-not-not-not-Jeff Garlin (not-not-not-Jeff Garlin quit halfway through production) go to prison.\n\nOk, I'd probably want to see that one.\n\nYou can see after watching this, that there's no real surprise Eddie Murphy walked away from this and Cuba Gooding Jnr walking right into it; Cuba Gooding Jnr isn't even on Eddie Murphy's level. He doesn't have the range necessary to play five people in one movie, he lacks the options open to Eddie Murphy, which may only currently extend to racist stereotypes and people in fat-suits but it is more than Cuba Gooding Jnr has right now.",

The first 30 minutes or so is AWFUL! Horrible attempts at jokes, not even funny, like you feel embarrassed for the characters, and awkward sitting in a theater when no one is laughing at anything in what is supposed to be a comedy. The beginning just felt terrible. About halfway through, the movie actually improved, a story line emerged, you could start relating with the emotions of the characters, and the focus seemed to be less on trying to be funny, and more on addressing the family/social issues, and I actually thought they did that quite well. The beginning was so horrible, I could easily give this a zero, easily the worst 30 minutes of a movie I have ever seen. However, parts of the end were pretty good, so I think it deserves a 2 or 3.

Simultaneously, it does not help that former \"Wonder Years\" star Fred Savage was sent in to direct this horribly childish comedy, and this remains Savage's only directing credit. I can't believe Cuba Gooding, Jr. would even think about coming to act in this movie that would literally be better as some Cartoon Network show than a movie. Cuba Gooding, Jr. just basically destroyed his own career. Good comedian, bad movies. The rest of the actors are unsurprisingly not well known. This movie also does not do anything good, for or with the children. Lots of slapstick, gags that could get some children hurt, and one kid vomiting for some of the most stupid reasons ever. In one scene, it was nothing but some Capture-The-Flag game that children would play that has no business in some theatrical release movie. Please, save yourself from this movie, and watch some other, better comedy. There are many of them out there. However, this comedy is out of the zero list because of some bonus points for Richard Gant, who played Grandpa Buck, who was a caring, actually loving grandfather. Richard Gant, you're a good comedian, much like Cuba Gooding, Jr., why do you have to be in such crap movies? The aftereffects of this movie: Kill some good actors' careers. Geez.
