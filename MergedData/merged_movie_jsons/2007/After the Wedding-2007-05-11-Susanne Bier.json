            "content": "Efter brylluppet (2006), written and directed by Susanne Bier, is a Danish film shown in the U.S. with the title \"After the Wedding.\"The film is like a jigsaw puzzle that has been started but not completed. As the story progresses, pieces are added to the puzzle one at a time. There are secrets upon secrets, and memories upon memories. Only one character knows the entire story, and he is hiding a secret of his own. The film begins in India, and the footage shot there has the ring of truth about it. Most of the film concerns wealthy people living in Denmark. The contrast between the poor in India and the wealthy in Scandinavia is immense. (Actually, it's more than that--it defies description.)The person who travels between India and Denmark--Jacob--is the link between these two worlds. He works in an orphanage in India, and he is sent to Denmark to convince a billionaire businessman to fund the project. The plot unfolds slowly, in a subtle and unpredictable manner. There are many ambiguities, and not all of these are sorted out by the end of the film. The acting is extremely good, with outstanding lead actors and an excellent supporting cast. If I had to single out one actor for praise, it would be the extraordinarily talented Sidse Babett Knudsen, who plays Helene, the wife of the wealthy business man. Ms. Knudsen turns in a nuanced and satisfying performance that is a pleasure to watch.This exceptional film was appropriately nominated for an Oscar. It's certainly one of the best movies of 2006, and deserves wider distribution so that more people can see it.",

            "content": "If you are looking for a movie that confirms preconceived notions, don't go to this one. Rather than trotting out a character as a rooting interest in the second or third scene, the film presents four individuals who are definitely worthy of your interest and compassion.The two men in this drama, Jacob and Jorgen, are each powerful in their own ways. Jacob in the power of his convictions, Jorgen in the power of money and commerce. The two women, Helene and Anne, and the decisions they make, are the characters that move the story and set up the very real personal tragedies that ultimately unfold. Rather than a recanting of the general plot, my recommendation is to go into this movie as cold as you can. There are twists to be resolved and lives to learn about -- they are not aided by hearing about them beforehand.There are no special effects, no flashbacks, no grainy images, and resolution is provided without the use of gun-play. (When was the last time you saw a movie that didn't have a gun figuring in the outcome.) Like real life, it takes a while to learn who the characters are and confirm that first impressions may (or may not) be correct. The pacing of the movie seems to be a primary criticism on the message boards but it seemed to move at a breakneck pace to me. I was very sorry to see it end.This is a human drama that the \"old\" Hollywood once made by the boatload. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 31 films I saw there this made my top 3. Mads Mikklesen received the festival's Best Actor award for his role as Jacob, a man who runs an orphanage in India. Jacob's been there for 20 years and is quite content in never returning to Denmark. A wealthy Danish businessman (Rolf Lass\u00e5rd) has contacted the orphanage expressing a desire to donate a large sum of money to keep the orphanage going. Jacob is led to believe that if he flies to Denmark and presents his business plan it will be a shake hands-smile-done deal and he will return within a week. J\u00f8rgen, the businessman has other plans however for Jacob. Sidse Babett Knudsen is J\u00f8rgen's wife Helene who has something in common with Jacob. Stine Fischer Christiansen is Anna, the daughter of J\u00f6rgen and Helene who is getting married to Christian (Christian Tafdrop) who is employed by J\u00f6rgen's company. Jacob is encouraged to attend the wedding and the real reason why he's been summoned to Denmark begins to unravel. Following the success of 2002's Open Hearts and 2004's Brother writer/director Susane Bier again collaborates with screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen in this emotional drama. Efter brylluppet (After the Wedding) has been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards but I would believe that El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) is likely the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar. This is Denmarks 7th nomination for Best Foreign Film since 1956 and it's first nomination since 1989. Denmark has won two Oscar's for Best Foreign films in 1987 for Babette's Feast and 1988 for Pelle the Conqueror. This film is good enough that it has a chance but it would be an upset. This is a very good story and beautifully photographed by cinematographer M\u00f8rtin Soberg. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it.",

            "content": "As may be expected of Susanne Bier, and as may be expected of Scandinavian films in general if you ask me, this film is really great. The acting is so good it's hard to call it acting. Mads Mikkelsen (Jacob) puts up a terrific performance with acting that is as credible as it is subtle. Not the over-the-top stuff that we are familiar with from Hollywood, but acting that actually makes you think \"yes, this is how real flesh and blood people would react\". I was also pleasantly surprised by Sidse Babett Knudsen (Helene). She has a lot of scenes with little or no dialog, but the way she tells everything with subtle face expression is simply mind blowing. And let's not forget Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (J\u00f6rgen) and Stine Fisher Christensen (Anne), who both remind us what real flesh and blood emotions look like in a way that really hits you in the face.Anyway, I'm a fan of Scandinavian films for reasons mentioned above, and I'm almost ashamed to say that in that light this film was really nothing new, and luckily so: just more of the same wonderful stuff! What really stuck with me about this film however is the story. It is so ...human in all aspects. I won't reveal any spoilers, but as the story unfolds, it just gets so much more complex than you expect at first. In the first 15 minutes, I expected the movie was mainly going to be about the struggle between J\u00f6rgen and Jacob. The struggle between these two \"stereotypes\" really... one being the cool business man who solves everything with money, and the other being the idealistic but clumsy social worker. I was pleasantly surprised however that it got even better after that. What I mainly like about the movie, is that it doesn't offer any simple solutions. In the end, there are no perfect happy endings that solve every puzzle; the main characters have to make decisions, but it's not all black and white like we see in a lot of other movies. People have to do things they might not have done initially, but in the end, there may be upsides as well. You know... that sounds an awful lot like real life, and that's a good thing for a film if you ask me.",

            "content": "I knew nothing about this film before going to see it except that it was Oscar nominated and starred Bond's 'Casino Royale' foe Mads Mikkelsen. But I'd heard good things and despite it being a day so sunny in April that you should really spend it in the park I ventured into the dark cinema. All I can say is that I am so, so glad I did as this has to be one of the best films I have seen this year. Jacob (Mikkelsen) runs an orphanage/school in India that due to funding will have to close if they don't do something quickly, cue a phone call from Denmark where a millionaire is looking to invest some money in a good cause and Jacob has no choice but to go home and try to win over the mystery funder. Cut to Copenhagen and the very rich living of Jorgen and his family, a self-made millionaire Jorgen is preparing for the Wedding of his daughter and as his family gather round the mansion we see that he has a pretty good life. Cut back to Jacob who after living in squalid conditions in India for so long is struggling to understand the swish hotel he's been booked in for his visit. When the two meet to discuss the investment Jacob is over enthusiastic but Jorgen is nonchalant and pre-occupied with the weekends approaching festivities, so much so he decides to conclude the deal on Monday and seeing as Jacob is here on his invitation with nothing to do all weekend he decides to ask him to attend the wedding. So far so seemingly normal. It is at this point that the film takes some dramatic turns and through a series of unexpected events, a few skeletons in closets, the past and emotive performances, becomes a really deep and moving piece of cinema. I don't want to spoil it by saying anymore about it except it's nothing short of brilliant. I haven't seen a film for ages that deals with such negative and positive issues with such compassion and integrity without being hammy or over the top. The direction is flawless, the music is fitting and the cinematography is almost dogma in style but with a certain crispness to it. The performances are outstanding and it's not hard to see why it was Oscar nominated and won countless awards. The way the script is superbly written it reminded of 'Secrets and Lies' by Mike Leigh in the way it captures humans acting realistically in real situations. By the time the film starts to conclude the tissues were coming out to wipe away the tears of sadness and joy, which is a very powerful position to be in for any film, and the audience left the auditorium into bright sunshine glad like me that they'd had chance to see this amazing piece of cinema.",

When Jacob is invited to travel to Copenhagen to meet the wealthy businessman J\u00f8rgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) that intends to donate a large amount to the orphanage, the reluctant Jacob is convinced by the director Mrs. Shaw (Meenal Patel) that he must travel for the good of the children, and he promises to Pramod to be back on his birthday on the next week. Jacob has a meeting with the self-made tycoon that promises a donation of one million-dollar and is invited to go to the wedding of his daughter Anna Hannson (Stine Fischer Christensen) on the next day. In the wedding, Jacob sees J\u00f8rgen's wife Helene Hannson (Sidse Babett Knudsen), who had a past with him, and discovers a family secret that will affect his and the Hannson's lives.\"Efter Brylluppet\" is an intense and engaging family drama. The beginning (and the end) of this movie discloses the poor conditions of people in India and gives the false idea that the plot would be about the social differences between India and Denmark. Then there is a twist in the unpredictable story focusing serendipity and the personal dramas with many other discoveries of the lead characters and the masterminded plan of the clever J\u00f8rgen. All the characters are believable and human supported by magnificent direction of Susanne Blier that plays the emotions and feelings of the viewers; an awesome screenplay and top-notch performances. Sidse Babett Knudsen and Stine Fischer Christensen are very beautiful women and I really loved this feature. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Depois do Casamento\" (\"After the Wedding\")",

            "content": "Mads Mikkelson plays Jacob--a man who has spent much of his adult life working with orphans in India. However, his program relies on money from some benefactor back in his native Denmark. Inexplicably, this benefactor insists that Jacob come to Denmark personally to talk over future funding of the program. This really makes no sense, but Jacob has no choice but to go.Once Jacob meets J\u00f8rgen Hannson, he is surprised by two odd things. First, J\u00f8rgen isn't that interested in discussing the project--even though Jacob came all the way there just to discuss it. Second, inexplicably, J\u00f8rgen invites him to a wedding. It seems that J\u00f8rgen's daughter, Anna, is getting married. Again, this is odd because Jacob doesn't know any of the people who will be there...other than having just met J\u00f8rgen. When Jacob arrives at the wedding, he realizes something is afoot. It turns out J\u00f8rgen's pretty wife is Jacob's old girlfriend--a woman he hasn't seen in about 20 years! What is going on here? Surely this is not just some coincidence. What is J\u00f8rgen trying to do?!I could easily say more about the film but this would ruin it. Suffice to say that when Jacob learns what's really afoot, it's a major kick in the head!!Like so many of the films coming out of Denmark recently, this one seems inspired by the so-called \"Dogma 95 movement\". It's an agreement by several young filmmakers. While director Susanne Bier is not officially a member of the group (at least according to the research I have done), the film fits into their goals--such as the extensive use of a hand-held camera (I hate this myself...not that this matters), natural locations instead of sets as well as contemporary stories. So what did I think? Well, as you can see above I didn't like the 'unsteady cam' look of the film. But, that withstanding, it's a terrific film. It's because the writing is superb and the acting is very, very nice. It seems very believable and the story sucks you into it. All in all, I can easily see why it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It lost to \"The Lives of Others\"--which would seem to indicated that it is an even more amazing film--which is hard to believe! I guess I'll have to see that film soon.",

            "content": "\"After the Wedding\" (2006) begins on the streets of Mumbai, India, where several orphaned, homeless children are queuing up for food, courtesy 'Anand Orphanage and School', assisted by Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) who has taken up the cause. He teaches in the school attached to the orphanage, and is a favorite with the children there. The initial scenes make one wonder if this is yet another 'poverty porn' focusing only on the dirty underbelly of India and projecting it to be a country worse than it actually is (Think \"Slumdog Millionaire\"). But any negativity formed in the beginning is quickly quashed with what follows.The orphanage is clearly falling short of funds. A silver lining is seen, as some tycoon in Denmark, by the name of Jorgen Hansson (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), has agreed to offer a huge sum of money as donation to the orphanage, but only on the condition that Jacob travel to Denmark personally, meet with Jorgen and then return with the necessary funds and paperwork. This tiny detail offered in the beginning, highlights the whimsical nature of the wealthy businessman's offer, and immediately hints at a catch, so we begin to brace ourselves for an early twist. Any surprise quotient, then, is automatically reduced to half.Jacob travels to Denmark, leaving behind his shanty life, albeit promising one of the orphan boys, Pramod (Neeral Mulchandani), who he has brought up and loves like his son, that he would be back in a week. Once in Denmark, Jacob is given red carpet treatment; a personal airport pickup, a luxury suite in a posh hotel, and later a meeting with the man himself; who takes a look at the project put together by Jacob (a videotape detailing the activities of the orphanage), but seems to be more interested in having a drink with him. Jorgen turns off the tape halfway, leaving Jacob stumped and disappointed, but proceeds to invite Jacob to the upcoming wedding of his daughter Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen). The unsuspecting Jacob accepts the invitation and shows up at Jorgen's plush mansion, the venue of the wedding.But a series of startling discoveries at the wedding and after it, make this visit to Denmark, a life-changing experience for Jacob\u0085..Writer-Director Susanne Bier's screenplay shows great promise, at least in the first half, thanks to the periodic revelations. Some dark secrets are revealed at regular intervals, and thus the pace is well maintained 'til then, although the film revolves only around four major characters. There are great moments of power-packed drama, sometimes intense, sometimes warm, sometimes awkward; mostly the uncomfortable encounters between characters are very naturally captured; it couldn't get more real than that. The director knows exactly how the characters would emote under the circumstances, and thanks to the terrific actors, it's all well done and earnestly acted. The cinematography is somewhat grainy, mostly devoid of the usage of special lighting, and is shot on a hand-held camera, reminiscent of the style of the Dogme 95 movement first initiated by Lars Von Trier. It is no surprise that the filming of the entire wedding sequence very much reminds of that in Von Trier's \"Breaking the Waves\".It is the extreme close-ups of eyes, lips, hands, and even some facial hair that come across as an eyesore. There are way too many close-ups that just weren't required and suit neither the genre, nor the subject matter. In fact they take away from the scenes somewhat, by not showing us the visage of the actor during a scene, when his/her reaction or emotion is vital to the scene. It is in the latter half, that the drama begins to shed the subtlety, when the most important twist of the story is revealed, and the film dips into mawkish melodrama giving rise to histrionics and gawky over-sentimentality! The major twist is itself a clich\u00e9 and a bankable ingredient for a weepy soap opera. But there are other events that follow, and at such timings, that you can't help but think that the screenplay is taking an emotionally manipulative direction, by forcing some events that just weren't necessary, but used merely because they, somehow, serve as good excuses to make the proceedings sappier! That said, it is indeed noteworthy, how almost all the characters are very well written; they have a lot of depth and more importantly, the initial impression that is created about them, takes a drastic turn in some key events, and we are forced to see them in a different light. Of course, the convincing dynamics of the characters, are owing to the choice of actors that are immensely talented. Mads Mikkelsen brings a range of emotions to the otherwise stoic Jacob who is taken aback when he first learns of the shattering truth that hits like a bolt of lightning. Ditto for the mixed emotions and the inevitable awkwardness he displays, later, in one of the best directed scenes of the film. Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd is brilliant as the drunk, but loving father and business tycoon, whose real intentions, and hence the kind of person he is, becomes clear only later. Stine Fischer Christensen is cute and does a commendable job as the daughter Anna who gets a double whammy of deceit. And then we have Sidse Babett Knudsen as Helene, who finds herself in an extraordinary situation, by a twist of fate, following a seemingly strange coincidence, and a past that refuses to let go. It is a classy performance indeed.What \"After the Wedding\" needed was a steady grip and restrained tone, that it maintains in the first half of the film, despite the plot contrivances, after which it nosedives into unnecessary melodrama and starts to come undone. Too bad, really! Score: 7/10",

The film moves slowly along and where the story is going to take us isn't revealed for a while. It's like peeling the onion but with rewards in each layer. I was thinking about differentiating here but, as does the onion, this film also brings tears.I liked the way we find out that our protagonist is from Denmark and has a past that drove him away and into a new life. He is certainly more of a giving human being that when he left the country. The story then follows a course that to a large degree his former life created.One of the aspects I especially enjoyed in the film is the use of some Dogme 95 rules. It's not a Dogme film but the director makes good use of many parts of that approach. The camera is hand held and it's use here made me feel more involved with the characters. The use of available light made the film much more beautiful and warm. One of the good results of the Dogme use here is that the director has made a film that, even for its' slow pace, dispenses with non-important fluff that would most certainly have been added if it had been made in the USA. There was a reason for every scene.So be prepared for a slow paced film loaded with beauty and revelation. You'll be rewarded with a wonderful film experience. Prior to seeing it I had thought Pan's Labyrinth would win an Oscar, but not anymore. Then I saw The Lives of Others and moved both of the films down a notch. They were my top three films of 2006, in fact none of my top three were American made. What a year for imports!",

What I found so touching was how essentially good almost all the characters were.The central character Jacob Pederson (Mads Mikkelsen) despite a nearly constant scowl on his face or a look of deep concern and perhaps worry is a man who really cares about right and wrong and other people. This is a sharp change from his misspent youth when all he cared about were...well what many of us cared about, having a good time. Now he runs an orphanage in Mumbai.While Jacob is the central character the most interesting character and the one with the biggest heart is the very rich Jorgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassgard). Jacob has gone to Denmark to convince Jorgen to support his orphanage. It isn't clear that Jorgen will do so. He has choices for charity. But when Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughter's elaborate wedding, things change.I won't say any more about the plot since it is such an interesting and surprising plot. What I will say is that when Jorgen learns who Jacob really is in relationship to his family (and vice-versa!) he does something so caring, so surprising and so correct and so magnanimous that it will warm the cockles of the coldest heart and bring to tears the most cynical of viewers.And then we are back to Jacob and how he deals with what Jorgen has concocted. And he too does the right thing even though it completely changes his life and costs him something dear to his heart..I wish I could be more concrete. But see the film and I think you'll agree that this is the kind of movie that will make you feel good about people. It's a shame that it's rated \"R.\" Perhaps if you have a tweener or even a bright 10-year-old you can watch it together. And you can talk about it. It is a great relationship film, and a great film for teaching young people about the real choices in life that can come up The acting was excellent. Mikkelsen brought the strength of character and a justified pride to the role of Jacob while Lassgard was warm and real and smart as Jorgen. Both Sidse Babett Knudsen, who played Jorgen's wife, and Stine Fischer Christensen, who played the bride, were intense and so vivid I felt I could touch them. (The intense close-ups on the eyes and faces\u2014and I mean intense\u2014made the actors almost leap off the screen.)

(I wasn't the only one scrubbing my face dry in the bathroom. I had PLENTY of company.) The movie. It was tender heartwrenching angsty cinema that you'll never forget if you see it. From the big eyed orphan waif in India to the Danish billionaire and his family, every cast member was perfect for their part. Mads was alternately driven, grieving, heartsore and furious and then committed to helping a person he'd never expected to have to. He was lured from India by promises of money to fund an orphanage. While most women are going to be thrilled by the beginning sequences and scenes (flashes of sensual dreams and a barechested Mads wandering the night, worrying), by the end they will be entirely caught up in other characters altogether. Yes, you NEED those Kleenex.Rolf Lassgard who plays the billionaire Jorgen has a fine deep booming voice with a persuasive quality that has you agreeing that yep, here is a man who WOULD be a billionaire. He's decisive and forceful, motivating people with every means at his disposal.I particularly liked the way the director framed the events and depicted the mood in the movie with the use of stark visuals. Pay attention to the director's use of eyes. It's all linked in a meaningful way. Though the movie is slow moving, it is like a deep river.

            "content": "Who said secrets aren't fun? Susanne Bier's After The Wedding reveals a deliciously profound and emotionally-impacting conundrum that draws the audience into the story early on. As a film technique, Bier's method of storytelling is effectively engaging. In fact, it's the director's ability to manipulate our emotions as viewers that makes this film so wonderfully unique. With the inclusion of a cross-cultural perspective not typically seen in Nordic film, After the Wedding is one of the more important films to emerge from Denmark in recent years.One distinct aspect of the film is its use of raw emotion, a factor rarely seen to this extent in traditional Hollywood films. Much of this quality can be attributed to the film's actors and actresses. Mads Mikkelsen does a superb job playing Jacob, a man who's past roots entwine with the other characters in the film more heavily than he previously assumed. Situated in India, Jacob leaves for Copenhagen to meet with a wealthy man named Jorgen, played by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd, to receive financial aid. To help get accustomed to Jacob and facilitate his trust, Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding that evening. While there, the audience learns of a particular secret that turns out to be an emotional bombshell for both Jacob other members of the wedding. The film really shines in its use of emotion to drive the story. Indeed, the most powerful moments of the film do take place after the titular wedding. Jacob, who was previously committed to returning to India to partake in his surrogate son's 8th birthday, must make difficult choices in lieu of the truths revealed at the wedding. Jorgen's wife Helene, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, must conflict with her husband's consistent nondisclosure of the truth. Jorgen's daughter Anna, Stine Fischer Christensen, learns many of the hardships of marriage and commitment. Each of these instances are linked with a particularly poignant and powerful scene that draws the audience into the situation. One scene in particular pulls at our heartstrings, as we uncomfortably watch the previously indomitable Jorgen collapse in a fit of weeping and screaming. Bier manages to successfully make the audience empathize with the characters in the story, a difficult task and something not common in Hollywood convention.Another element where After The Wedding succeeds is in the portrayal of cross-cultural experiences. Jacob's character is defined by his commitment to social justice. His motivations are clear from the beginning - he desires additional funding for his orphanage. After the wedding, when facts change, Jacob's moral obligations keep him in Denmark to continue doing the morally right thing. Without revealing too much of the film's plot, Jacob evolves into a morally capable character who satisfies the role he was presented. As it turns out, there is a strong Scandinavian presence in many social projects across the globe. It was refreshing to see this illustrated in Jacob's character.The film also utilized unique techniques to achieve its desired emotional response. Many of the tense moments employ a cinematographic technique where the camera zooms in on a character's eyes with a shallow focus. While not practical from a storytelling standpoint, the viewer is immediately linked to the deeper thoughts and emotions of the character by focusing on the eye. Some say the eye is the gateway into the soul, and Bier clearly understood this concept. Another technique that impacts our emotions is the use of unusual jump cuts within the same shot. Often, Bier will reveal emotion by showing instead of telling. These jarring cuts indicate that something is wrong without explicitly stating it though dialogue. One could make the argument that this style of film-making is unique to Beir as a female director. It's interesting to witness character development through a female lens as opposed to the traditional masculine one. More time is spent on character relationships and action implications than a Hollywood film, which would either spend the time attempting to add humor or driving the plot forward with melodramatic instances.After The Wedding is unlike other films in that it manages to hook the viewer in an emotionally engaging way. Through its unusual but effective camera and editing tricks, refreshingly realistic perspectives of Scandinavian archetypes and a compelling storyline, Susanne Bier has produced a wonderful piece. Don't let this film be a secret.",

            "content": "Mads Mikkelson is dazzling as Jacob, a Bombay orphanage worker, in \"After the Wedding.\" He's so good here I'd love to see him in a more complex film. Sidse Babett Knudsen is fetchingly pretty and natural as Helene, a rich man's trophy wife, though she isn't given much to do except be pretty, supportive, and an occasional sex object. I'd really like to see what Knudsen could do with a role in which she exhibited some agency.Other than their fine performances, though, \"After the Wedding\" is a melodrama with a plot so implausible it's virtually impossible to be deeply moved by the movie's many crashing cymbal moments: Terminal illness! Reunited relatives! Big-eyed, Third World orphans! Cheatin' spouses! Billionaires! Slum dwellers! Drugs! Sex! Captive deer! Long lost lovers! Secrets! Lies! The only plot elements missing are a Holocaust survivor and a child's puppy getting run over by a car (driven by that child's long lost father, who donated a kidney to the puppy - or something. Maybe that will appear in the sequel.) Sure, these moments are often quite effective for their shock value, and for their ability to draw a tear from the actors on screen and viewers in the audience, but there are so many of them, some of them apparently having no relation to whatever the overall point of the movie is, that, at the end of the roller-coaster ride, you've left pretty empty. The movie purposely ends abruptly, without providing any answers to its biggest questions; this is a cheat. The filmmakers are very good at foreplay, but lack what it takes for follow through.",

            "content": "Sometimes some films go unnoticed. Either because they come from countries we don't exactly positioned on the world map, or because those gems are directed by none mainstream directors, or maybe because those films don't have a wide distribution and sometimes because the title or the story's pitch is not that engaging\u0085 \"After the Wedding\" might has gone unnoticed for all these bad reasons so let's first clear them up.Denmark is in northern Europe, capital Copenhagen. This country gave us the 1987 Oscar winning \"Babette's Feast\" by Gabriel Axel and the 1988 Oscar winner, \"Pelle the Conqueror\" by Bille August. As per Susanne Bier who directed \"After the Wedding\" if she is not a mainstream director she also is not exactly a junior director. In fact she already directed a dozen of films, all emotionally engaging like Br\u00f8dre (2004) aka Brothers or Sekten (1997) aka Credo.In the city I was leaving in at that time only 2 or 3 cinemas were showing \"After the Wedding\". And quite frankly when I first red the synopsis I thought the movie would likely be a bore fest: a manager of an orphanage (Mikkelsen) in India is sent to Copenhagen, Denmark in order to discuss sponsoring with a billionaire (Lassg\u00e5rd) but what he discovers is a life-altering family secret. Fortunately my better half convinced me to go see this complete cinematic experience in which the depth of the characters, the originality of the scenario, and the outstanding acting concur to make this film one of the greatest films of 2006/07 and a true emotional experience.The strength of \"After the Wedding\" resides in its dynamic based on our faculty to extrapolate and judge promptly. Indeed the film first 20 minutes builds stereotypes only for us to pull them down in the last hour and a half\u0085terrific\u0085Do you know what realistic acting is? Well after witnessing Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd answering, analyzing each other you'll understand what true acting is. The kind that feels so real you think you are witnessing stolen slice of life on screen. If those two actors really epitomized great performance, Sidse Babett Knudsen as Helene and Stine Fischer Christensen as Anna deserve a mention.But a well directed well played film does not necessary triggers emotions. \"After the Wedding\" does. The film moves you in a way few films do. We don't identify but we relate and as the gap between the protagonists shrinks, the distance between the audience and the characters fades away. Profoundly \"humanist\" the film proposes another definition for the word \"Gift\"\u0085The gift of oneself, the ultimate Love. Susanne Bier succeeds in triggering this Generosity not only on the screen but also in our soul.",

            "review_title": "Powerful relationships in After the Wedding",
            "content": "I am not a huge movie watcher, and I don't tend to fall in love with the films that I do see, but After the Wedding might be my favorite film of all time. It has everything necessary to draw an audience in: a slightly unbelievable (and unpredictable!) premise, family tragedy, scenes in India, and a great ending that left me in tears. While I thought everything about the film, including the acting, directing, and cinematography was phenomenal, what really makes this film stand out is the variety and depth of the relationships found between the characters.The first characters we get to know in the film are Jacob, a middle-aged but still very attractive Danish man living in India, and Pramod, a seven-year-old boy who lives in the orphanage/school that Jacob has helped to establish. Jacob has developed a deep relationship with Pramod, who has lived at the school since infant hood, and Jacob serves as something of a surrogate father to the boy. When Jacob leaves for Denmark to search for more funding for the school, Pramod makes him promise to return by his birthday. Jacob agrees, but their relationship becomes complicated as Jacob is detained in Denmark, missing Pramod's eighth birthday and breaking his trust. At the end of the movie there is a break in their relationship which causes Jacob a lot of pain, but is unavoidable.Another interesting relationship explored in After the Wedding is that of Jacob and Anna. Through a series of coincidences, Jacob discovers that he has a twenty-year-old illegitimate daughter in Denmark who has been raised by her mother and stepfather, Helene and J\u00f8rgen. J\u00f8rgen is a wealthy man and is considering giving Jacob money to fund the school. He encourages Jacob to build a relationship with Anna and to reconnect with Helene after so many years. Anna knew that J\u00f8rgen was not her biological father, but she loves him as if he were because she has lived with him her whole life, and she is not sure what to make of Jacob. Jacob is furious that Helene never told him that she was pregnant, but also seems unsure of how to act around Anna. One scene in the film shows them sitting together somewhat awkwardly over dinner while Anna shows Jacob a photo album that documents her childhood. Jacob seems sad that he missed most of her young life, but you can see that he feels more of a connection with Pramod, the surrogate son he left in India, than he does with his biological daughter. She is an adult and has had J\u00f8rgen as a father figure for most of her life, so there doesn't seem to be a place for him.The most complex and tension-filled relationship in the movie is between J\u00f8rgen and Jacob. At first, it seems as if J\u00f8rgen holds all the power: he is older, wealthy, and apparently figures out exactly who Jacob is as soon as they meet. Jacob, on the other hand, is just trying to appease J\u00f8rgen so that he can get the funding for his school. J\u00f8rgen is extremely manipulative, detaining Jacob in Denmark when he obviously wants to get back to India, and eventually stipulating that Jacob must relocate permanently to Denmark if he wants to get the several million dollars that J\u00f8rgen is capable of donating. We find out later that J\u00f8rgen is terminally ill and is only trying to assure that Helene and Anna will have someone to care for them after he dies, but until that information was revealed I was very suspicious of J\u00f8rgen's motives. Jacob realizes that he is being manipulated and is frustrated by J\u00f8rgen's behavior, but cannot bring himself to turn his back on the money that will save his school.For me, the most moving part of After the Wedding was finding out about J\u00f8rgen's illness and understanding his motives behind the manipulation of Jacob. I was afraid that he meant Jacob ill or that he was going to do something bad to him, but in the end he just turned out to be doing what he thought was best for his family. Whether or not it truly was the best thing to do is open for interpretation. Watching J\u00f8rgen deal with the reality of his illness and sharing it with his family was one of the most powerful things I have seen in a film. It was jarring to realize that he had had pure intentions the whole time, was really a good man, and was going to die anyway while his family went on without him, possibly with Jacob in his place. After the Wedding is a refreshing reminder that there really are good people in the world, and that they will do almost anything to protect those they love. Great film!",

            "content": "Bombay. An orphanage, filled with rambunctious kids. The striking face of Denmark's biggest star, Mads Mikkelsen, is among the few adults. His character, Jacob, has been working in humanitarian efforts in India for the past twenty years but is in desperate need of funds from Denmark in order to prevent this orphanage from closing. Much to his disliking, he must return to his native country to secure the future for the beloved children. One of the orphan boys who Jacob considers family, Pramods, asks Jacob what the Denmark is like. He replies that he does not like the people because they are all rich. If he were rich, Pramods says, then he would be happy. The scene shifts suddenly to a man in his car listening to the American hit, \"It's Raining Men,\" instantly shifting in tone from humility and worry to one of confidence and security: he is carefree. We soon find out this man is Jogen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), one of Denmark's wealthy businessmen. Jacob's idea of selfish and coldhearted rich people, however, is soon contradicted, as Jorgen reads goofy stories aloud to his sons and then playfully slides into his wife's bubble bath, fully clothed. He appears not to be a ruthless egomaniac, but a loving father and husband. When Jacob leaves for Denmark, he plans to be business partners with Jorgen, promising Pramods that he will be back in Bombay in time for his 8th birthday. Due to a few unexpected plot-twists, however, Jacob finds himself much more intertwined in Jorgen's life than he ever imagined.When Jacob meets Jorgen about funding the orphanage, Jorgen is completely disinterested and interrupts Jacob frequently to ask if he wants a drink (he supplies one even after Jacob replies, no). After their rude meeting, Jorgen insists that Jacob comes to his daughter's wedding the following day, a strange demand seeing as they had never met before this brief interview. At the wedding, Jorgen's wife, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen), sees Jacob enter, and a look of disbelief and dread fills her eyes. Directly after this, the first plot-twist appears, undisguised and melodramatic: Jorgen's daughter Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) is not his biological daughter. We instantly understand the meaning behind Helene's troubled gaze: Jacob is Anna's father. Director Susanne Bier's determination to make films that both utilize artistic methods and entertain is evident as she weaves together an engaging plot with symbolic images. Using extreme close-ups on the actor's lips, eyes, and fingertips, she is able to communicate the subtle nuances in the characters' expressions and movements. When Jacob bursts into Helene and Jorgen's house, demanding to talk to Helene about Anna, even the animal heads on the walls get a close-up, staring knowingly as though they have overheard each and every secret in this grand estate. After confronting his ex-girlfriend, Helene about her deception, Jacob threatens to tell Anna if she does not. Soon after, Jacob opens his hotel door to the doe-eyed Anna, waiting to come in. Finally reunited, they begin to get to know one another and it appears as though After the Wedding will be a story of how to overcome deception and begin anew. However, Bier has another trick up her sleeve. We witnessed Jorgen become more and more embittered as the film goes on, guzzling down alcohol until he is hopelessly drunk. Helene, a compassionate and strong woman decides after a particularly nasty argument with Jorgen that something is not right and decides to investigate. She opens his hidden safe to reveal a stash of prescriptions. Jorgen is dying. Suddenly the images of dead flowers and the glazed eyes of the animals mounted on the wall take on an entirely different meaning. They have been symbols for the death by which Jorgen is constantly surrounded, as he puts on a show for the sake of his family. Knowing that Jorgen has brought Jacob back to Denmark to replace himself when he dies, the characters must decide what their definition of family is and what duties are implied with it. Jacob is torn between his new daughter, Anna, and his family back in Bombay, Helene and Anna maneuver a changing mother-daughter relationship while coming to terms with the looming death of their husband and father, respectively. Stine Fischer Christensen's raw performance when Anna confronts her father about keeping his illness a secret is phenomenal, second only to Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd's heart wrenching scene when Jorgen breaks down from fear of dying, collapsing in sobs and throwing his body on the floor in a disturbing defiance, while Helene keeps her arms around him, powerless to ease his pain. This crushing moment puts in the hearts of everyone watching the question of how one can live nobly and fully. Jorgen's selflessness shows Jacob that the line Helen spoke to him early in the film, \"you don't have to be poor to be a good person,\" is undeniably true and that there is often more than just one honorable choice. Before his premature death, Jorgen leaves Jacob with the choice to return to the children in Bombay or to live in Denmark and support his own daughter, Anna and former lover, Helene while funding the orphanage from afar. The question After the Wedding raises is, ultimately, what is family? And How far would you go for yours?",

He is lured back to Denmark on the assumption that he is going to raise money to the orphanage by a very wealthy business man who has expressed a desire to donate money but he has also made it an explicit condition that Jacob has to show up in Denmark to close the deal.We don't understand why and this is the first condition out of many that the business man - Jorgen - is demanding of Jacob. So we are kept in the dark as to why Jacob keeps running into obstacles to close the deal and this of course adds to the overall suspension but it also makes you less critical of the way the story unfolds as you don't know what motivates Jorgen. My point regarding this is, that if you think the story through after you fully understand his motives, then the story will appear somewhat odd. To me it seems that Susanne Bier has made a movie with the main concern of creating scenes with highly charged emotions in at the expense of a credible story. Let me exemplify (spoiler); Jacob is invited to Jorgen Daughter's wedding (by Jorgen) and during this he realizes that Jorgen's daughter actually is his own daughter. The scene where he realizes this is of course very moving but how can you possible explain Jorgen's motivation in inviting him? I can't come up with any. It is an extremely unpleasant situation for Jacob, which is to be expected - so who gains from this? You could of course argue that Jorgen didn't know that \"his\" daughter would hold a speech wherein she would address the theme of who her father is, but then again he couldn't be sure that Jacob wouldn't learn one way or the other as it apparently wasn't a big secret that Jorgen wasn't the real father. I think that if you can't follow Jorgen's motivation in this - as well as other - instance(s) then the drama is all of a sudden a melodrama.If Jorgen's agenda was to be a background factor in getting Jacob to take responsibility for his daughter and former girlfriend then this seems, at best, very unlikely. Could the family not continue without a father/patriarch (Is it really so horrifying to raise children without a father - especially when you are filthy rich)?? If not, why in heaven make use of such drastic measures? Maybe Jorgen's actions regarding bringing Jacob together with his daughter is plausible; he seems like a man that are very used to taking charge and make things happen. But still it makes the whole process suffer that it is his own project and I think that if realism was favored more then we should have been shown more feelings concerning embarrassment and awkwardness.Personally I was totally exhausted at the end of the movie and could not bear to watch and listen to grief, crying, shouting, yelling and arguing any more.Regards SimonPs.

Behind this there is decision to take, promises to be be crushed and hearts to be melted. Following a story of Jacob, who has to travel to his native Denmark to grant funds for his orphanage in India, he is unaware of disturbing coincidences and hidden secrets he would be compelled to stand against. Jacob played by Mads Mikkelsen is at his dramatical best playing the sober guy who thinks he has moved on from his past transgression. His congruous portrayal is deeply underlined with afflicting past which he quite blissfully conveys with those emoting eyes. I will be seeing more of himI have seen only one other Susanne Bier movie and can safely identify the type of cinema related with her. She often construct the story of ordinary humans with plausible but stimulating situations with even more thickening emotions. The aspects where she lingers on the close shots or the sporadically encouraged eyebeaming. The movie does have some overly melodramatic scenes portraying the confliction but efficiently and brilliant in some other more subtle scenes. There is the also the story of Jorgen played brilliantly by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd who is up for a race against time, he may seem a antagonist at the first but his complex characterisation and agonisingly superb acting renders us a portrayal that in few scenes overpowers the main character. The wife Helene and daughter Anna played by Sidse Babett Knudsen and Stine Fischer Christensen respectivley does put in lot more efforts in contributing to the story.The movie is quite bravely handled and is very much a good watch if you are hungry for some foreign cinema(forgive me). mindbugged.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Danish director Susanne Bier has signed the Dogme pledge of purity in film-making and here she sticks to the rules, intermittently anyway. The camera-work is just about all hand-held and the lighting \"natural\" which means most of the interior shots are suffuced in a yellow glow. She also has a liking for very close-up shots of people's faces at random moments which can be disorientating, but overall this is not an excessively dogmatic Dogme film.The story is really a bit of mainstream soap, with an improbable plot, characters who are more caricatures, reliance on co-incidence and plenty of sentimentality. However the understated and powerful acting by all the principals makes what is rather a silly story work. The story might be silly but there is not a wasted moment in the film. The scenes in the Mumbai orphanage are meant to contrast with the high life in Copenhagen, and they do \u0096 Bier is anxious we get the point. The co-incidences seem over the top at first but then we suspect their may be more to it. Jacob the protagonist seems heroic and selfless to begin with, but later it seems he is somewhat of an under-achiever as a hero. The caricatures become more characters than we thought.Mads Mikkelsen is a superb actor who would be my choice to play a Danish Christ and as Jacob, the orphanage manager and supplicant for funds, he does everything right here, transcending the material. He gets good support from Rolf Lassgard as J\u00f8rgen the putative philanthropist \u0096 a full-throated performance, and from Sidse Babette Knudsen as Helene, Jorgen's wife and old flame of Jacob. This isn't \"Hamlet\" but you feel this troupe could make a fair fist of it. (Come to think of it a Danish \"Hamlet\" would be quite a cultural experience). There's still something soapy about the whole thing, though, and I think Bier was lucky to get a nomination for the 2007 best foreign film Oscar right up there with \"Water\" and \"Laberinto del Fauno\". But it's quite watchable and the acting justifies the price of admission.",

            "review_title": "A Deeply Superficial Movie",
            "content": "Susanne Bier's After the Wedding (2006) is a film that wants to be more than it is. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, After the Wedding (original title Efter brylluppet ) follows Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen), a Danish man who helps run an underfunded orphanage in India. Reluctantly, Jacob is sent back to Copenhagen in the hopes of securing a large donation from the wealthy businessman Jorgen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) only to slowly realize that Jorgen has singled him out for a specific--and personal--reasons. Ultimately, it's a superficial movie that tries its best at playing deep, a film that never quite achieves the emotional impact for which it strives. After the Wedding starts off being a movie about how Jacob can't stand rich people. When told that their teacher is going to be sent to the rich-in-comparison land of Denmark, the children at Jacob's orphanage note his distaste of the wealthy. One boy says to Jacob, \"Is it because the houses are far apart and the people are far apart?\" This is about as profound as the film ever gets. When Jacob arrives in Copenhagen, the film shifts from being about the political to being about the personal. Jacob meets Jorgen, who at first seems to represent the sort of suave, detached rich man that Jacob despises. However, as the film lumbers forward Jorgen turns out to be a less sinister yet also a less interesting character in an almost lazily written transition. Jorgen is not the manipulative businessman looking for an easy way to buy some publicity, but, in fact, the husband of Jacob's ex-girlfriend, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and the man who raised Helene and Jacob's daughter (Stine Fischer Christensen), a child Jacob never knew existed until he attended her wedding at Jorgen's invitation. The film meditates on these messy familial relationships for a hot second before revealing what the audience has already guessed fifteen minutes ago, that Jorgen is actually dying and has called Jacob back to Denmark to take his place as the man of the family. The main weakness of After the Wedding is its thin script that presents a variety of familiar (dare I say clich\u00e9) themes without fully delving into any of them in a way that elevates them from mere banality. For instance, the idea of a man meeting his daughter for the first time after 22 years, the agony of a father organizing his life in preparation for his own death, the tenuous rekindling of a romance with the one that got away, and the struggle to provide aid and resources for underprivileged children are all perfectly fine topics that get thrown together and promptly skirted over in this film. Rather than taking the time to develop any of these themes with any sort of nuance or inventiveness, Bier simply plops them down into the movie and moves on to the next thing as if the audience is expected to have some sort of emotional reaction at just at the mention of these \"serious\" topics. Instead of communicating heart wrenching truths through the sort of strong writing that paves the way for arresting acting performances, Bier scrounges for emotion in a never ending stream of close-up shots of both human and (yikes) dead animal eyes. In a word, there's a lack of depth and artfulness to the screenplay and the film as a whole. It's a shame that Mads Mikkelsen's stoic stare isn't put to better use. That's not to say that After the Wedding is a disaster. There are some charming moments that arise from Bier's use of parallels in the movie, for example. In one such moment, the camera lingers on Jacob's nervous habits, (wiping the scuffs from his dress shoes, shifting his feet, hand tapping) and then closes in on similar anxious tics expressed by his daughter, Anna, thus visually portraying their heredity. Moreover, another parallel occurs when the camera pays special attention to Jorgen zipping up the coat of one of his young sons, only to show Jacob doing the same thing later in the film after Jorgen's metaphorical passing of the torch has been made clear. Sure, maybe these parallels could do with a bit more subtlety, but they're just clever enough that they inspire confidence that Bier at least has some sense of direction for the film. However, these strong moments are not enough to tip the balance in Bier's favor. All in all, After the Wedding is an unremarkable film bogged down by mediocre screen writing and an overeager desire for a quantity of ideas over quality.",

The answer appears when Jorgen Hansson, a rich Danish industrialist offers to fully fund the orphanage. But Jorgen stipulates that Jacob must fly back to Denmark personally to meet Jorgen and close the deal. At first Jacob refuses because he is reluctant to leave the children, especially Pramod, a boy he has raised from infancy and who looks to Jacob as his father.But the need is so great and Jorgen is adamant, so Jacob finally acquiesces and flies to Denmark.Once he arrives, Jorgen begins a strange game of manipulation. He requires Jacob to attend his daughter's wedding before finalizing the deal. At the wedding, Jacob realizes that Jorgen's wife is actually is long-lost love, Helene, and that he is the father of her daughter, Anna, who is getting married.Jacob is furious and confused. Once Anna finds out the Jacob is her biological father, she insists on meeting him and the two form a close bond.After further mysterious machinations by Jorgen involving Jacob, Helene, and Anna, Jorgen finally sits down with Jacob to finalize the deal to fund the orphanage. But rather than the original one million dollar offer, Jorgen wants to set up a 12 million dollar joint trust fund to be controlled solely by Jacob and Anna, with the stipulation that Jacob must reside in Denmark rather than India.Jacob is once again furious and storms out of the meeting. Jorgen runs after him and confesses that he has been wrong to be so manipulative and stubborn. Jorgen reveals that he is terminally ill, and that he wants Jacob to take his place as head of his family after his death. Stunned, Jacob simply walks away, unable to absorb so much crucial information at once.When Anna's new husband, Christian, is surprised by Anna's coming home and finding him having sex with his former girlfriend in her own bed, Anna seeks refuge with Jacob, and he realizes that he must indeed stay in Denmark to care for his daughter, Helene, and Jorgen's two twin boys after Jorgen dies.In the final scene, Jacob returns to India and the orphanage to visit Pramod and offer to take him back to Denmark to live.

            "content": "For a Nordic film, After the Wedding unexpectedly opens in the colorful, bustling streets of India. Then again, with international stars such as Mads Mikkelsen, one never really knows what to expect. Immediately setting the film in a global context, this diverse opening scene plays a crucial role in establishing the motivations behind Jacob, played by Mikkelsen. A Dane living abroad, Jacob directs an orphanage that is starved for resources. Changing into the role of a businessman, he looks back to his home country for funding, however uncomfortable the part may be for him to play.Dressed in suit and tie, Jacob meets with the wealthy J\u00f8rgen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) to discuss his program as a candidate of a charitable grant. Jacob becomes discouraged, however, when J\u00f8rgen's attitude is less than entirely sincere towards the benefits of the program, and more focused on implementing the program for program's sake. The next day, Jacob is invited to the wedding of J\u00f8rgan's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen). He accepts, and returns to his extravagant hotel room to consider the day's events.Arriving late to the ceremony, Jacob stumbles in and sits in the back pew to witness Anna's marriage, yet his focus strays from the events at hand to Anna's mother, and J\u00f8rgen's wife, Helen (Sidse Babett Knudsen). When the two speak afterward, it is immediately apparent that the relationship between these two characters reaches back into previous lives. Later, and after a remarkably honest and unexpected speech from Anna at the reception dinner, Jacob learns that he plays a part in the family more important than he would expect, and that his visit to Copenhagen is about more than funding for his orphanage.Director Susanne Bier does a remarkable job at creating characters that truly matter to the audience. After the Wedding isn't about what's happening plot-wise, it's about the relationships the characters have with each other, and how prepared they are to see those relationships change through new events. The diversity of actors in the film is also top notch. Mikkelsen plays a character who is naturally calm and seldom over-emotional, though he is never seen as cold or unloving. Christensen's Anna character on the other hand is a young girl seeking what it means to love in the midst of familial and relational turmoil, making her emotional character the perfect complement to Jacob. The ability for these characteristics to change and adapt to the happenings in the film is also incredibly admirable, and a great pleasure to watch.The film comments on the state of Denmark concerning both the nature of its society as well as the country's responsibility in global relations. While the Danes are eager to help the struggling orphanage financially, it remains unclear whether this action is exercised in sincerity, or rather from a sense of social responsibility or duty. The scenes in India, on the other hand, consist of more genuine-feeling relationships, especially between Jacob and eight-year-old orphaned Pramod. When Jacob finds a genuine relationship with Anna in Denmark, his opinion on his country turn upside down, and he is forced to make the decision concerning where to spend his time.The film gives Jacob the opportunity to have the life he might have had if the birth of Anna was not hidden from him. To accept this new life would change his very character, and likely affect his work in India\u2013positively through added funding, though perhaps negatively without his continued presence. Jacob must decide whether to continue serving others or to finally live life at least partially for himself. After the Wedding considers the choices one man has to make in a situation with no right answer, making a film that is both entertaining and morally challenging.",

            "review_title": "More Tears After the Wedding",
            "content": "After the Wedding is excellently directed by Susanne Bier. Bier was born in 1960 in Denmark. She was brought up in a Jewish family and studied art and architecture originally at a Hebrew school in Israel. She embraces the Dogma 95 movement but doesn't believe that all of the rules must be followed. Many of Bier's films focus on families and the relationships within them. After the Wedding received a nomination for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars in 2006.As is true with so many of Bier's films this movie is all about relationships. There are several relationships that are intertwined throughout the movie and each is important and interesting. The first relationship that we see and in my opinion one of the most important is that of Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) and Pramod (Neeral Mulchandani). Jacob is an aide worker in India and helps run an orphanage for boys in addition to distributing food to other children in need. However, he needs money to keep the orphanage running and it is then that he goes to Denmark to find the help he needs. Enter J\u00f8rgen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) and his family. Relationships two and three. Jacob appeals to J\u00f8rgen for the money he needs, but J\u00f8rgen evades the point and convinces Jacob to stay to his daughter's wedding. Once we learn a little bit more about the people in J\u00f8rgen's family we see the real reason for his keeping Jacob around. J\u00f8rgen's wife, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) happens to be Jacob's old girlfriend and she thought that he had died in India; something doesn't seem to be adding up at this point.I think that as a viewer we see J\u00f8rgen's offer/plan has good intentions at the beginning, however, as the plot thickens I changed my mind and thought that J\u00f8rgen's using Jacob was unacceptable. Is it ever okay to use a person as a means to your own end? I vote no. But Jacob does get what he wants too in the end and that is the money for the orphanage. I think that if J\u00f8rgen had told him his whole plan from the start we would have both a very different view of him and the movie would have been much shorter. There would not have been a need for Jacob to rekindle his old ties with Helene and find out that he has a daughter (the bride).As the movie moves on more relationships are formed and one thing that runs common through all of them is that they are not as perfect as they seem. There are broken relationships that seem calm on the surface but as they move forward things are not as they seem. The most obvious is between the newly wedded bride and groom. Within a week he has cheated on her and she moves back in with her parents. J\u00f8rgen and Helene are not as happy as they seem on the surface and when J\u00f8rgen's illness gets the better of him we see some of the rawest emotion I have ever seen in a film. J\u00f8rgen admits to Helene that he is scared of death and breaks down into tears (and he lets it ALL out) and in my opinion it is one of the most true and heartfelt emotional scenes in a movie ever. I think that if this were an American film we would not see the level of emotion that we do in this scene, it would be more glazed over and instead of being five minutes it might be 30 seconds.The film itself was shot beautifully in my opinion. Bier has extreme close-ups throughout the movie of people's eyes. I think that by doing this she is showing us how the character really feels. It is easy(er) to hide emotions from afar but when you are close up and all you see is an eye it is almost impossible. It allows us as an audience to really see how the character feels. Aside from the extreme close-ups the lighting also does a good job of enhancing the feel of certain scenes (bright during the reception, dark during the cheating scene, etc). The same can be said of the music.Returning to Pramod and Jacob. At the end of the movie Jacob asks Pramod if he wants to come live in Denmark with him. Pramod responds with a \"no.\" Some may say that he is saying so just for the sake of the movie. However, I think that he really has changed his mind about Jacob and when he has all of the new things at the orphanage he obviously wants to stay. His friends are in India, the life he (may or may not) love is in India but he is happy there regardless at the end of the movie. This is one of my new favorite movies because it gives us so much to think about with regards to the human race and family dynamics.",

            "content": "\"After the Wedding\" is a very well done Danish film with strong acting and a story that moves along at a crisp pace while managing to introduce new twists throughout without allowing the plot to become lost in a muddle. The first two thirds of the movie or so is a sort of mystery as we wonder why Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) - a very wealthy Danish businessman - has asked Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) - who runs an orphanage in India - to come to Copenhagen to meet him. Ostensibly, Jorgen wants to make a large donation to the orphanage, but everyone knows there's got to be more to the story than that. It becomes clear, for example, that Jacob knows Jorgen's wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and a rather startling secret comes out at the wedding of Jorgen's daughter Anne (Stine Fischer Christensen). One assumes that secret is going to be the key to the movie, except that Jorgen has one more secret to come out, which leads to perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie (Jorgen's last scene) which is powerfully raw with emotion.Essentially, this is good all the way through. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language film, and certainly deserved the nomination. The quick pace slows down a bit once all the secrets are out but that really doesn't detract much from the story. The ending (revolving around Jacob's relationship with Pramod - an 8 year old in the orphanage who Jacob has cared for since birth) left me a little bit dry to be honest. All in all, though, I thought this was a very good movie, and even the subtitles didn't bother me too much. 8/10",

            "content": "After the Wedding (Efter brylluppet, 2006) seems like it should be a large movie\u2014it begins internationally, depicting issues like poverty and homelessness that affect millions around the globe. Quickly though, the focus zooms in on several people who are very closely connected though somewhat of an odd history, forcing the viewer to examine what exactly is required to love someone. Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) manages an Indian orphanage, but is called back to Denmark by a businessman to try and secure more funds for the orphanage. He is offered the funding, but of course there is a twist, made clear following a series of big reveals; J\u00f8rgen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), the businessman, requires Jacob to remain in Denmark and begin managing some of the company. As Jacob is actually the biological father of J\u00f8rgen's daughter, J\u00f8rgen wants him close by to care for the family following his impending death. The film explores the ideas of control, love, and doing one's duty with an interesting take on what constitutes a family.There are several aspects of control seen throughout the film. J\u00f8rgen, as a powerful businessman, is used to having people do his bidding. He also knows that he is dying, resulting in his necessary composure despite such unfortunate circumstances. Troubles arise when he tries to extend his control to Jacob, a man who is used to being independent. Jacob resists, feeling that J\u00f8rgen is trying to buy him, but gives in when he discovers the exact nature of the request. Helene is also trying to control the situation\u2014she is understandably mad at Jacob for cheating on her, and initially tries to restrict his contact with the family and herself. She eventually sees his value though, leading to the next theme of the film: love.After the Wedding contains numerous interesting relationships, mainly ones that aren't necessarily seen in many other contexts. In India, Jacob is especially close to one of the boys at the orphanage. He acts as a father figure to the boy, but is ultimately forced to leave and has to go back on promises made. The dynamic between the adults in the film is what is the most fascinating though; Jacob is Anna's biological father, from a previous relationship with Helene. Helene then married J\u00f8rgen in part to secure a future for Anna. J\u00f8rgen is dying though, and wants Jacob to be around to support the family. Jacob's connection to Anna is apparent, although awkward at first. When they first talk in his hotel room, the tension between them is almost painful to watch. Anna begins to open up to Jacob though, which eventually causes Helene to realize that she does still care for him. While she never answers the question about whether or not she'll get back together with Jacob, it's clear that the family cares for him and he is present in their lives. The final theme is an exploration of what it means to do one's duty, especially in keeping with promises that were made. Jacob is the primary vehicle through which we explore this. He is forced back to Denmark to secure more funds for the orphanage, despite a strong desire to remain with the children. Once there, he puts up with a seemingly distant and eccentric J\u00f8rgen in the hope of keeping the orphanage open. J\u00f8rgen's obligation to his family drives him to find Jacob in the first place, and admit to himself that he must take action to secure their future. The film makes use of many close ups, especially on the face and eyes. In a story so driven by emotion, it makes sense that this would be a focus. Frequently, the larger picture is ignored for a close look at exactly what each character is feeling at the moment. Their emotions are strong and complicated, so taking a moment to dissect them is really helpful. I enjoyed After the Wedding, but it didn't grip me as completely as other films I've seen. However, I think the suspense of the reveal was ruined by the strange actions of J\u00f8rgen that led up to it. There were also times where I felt the stony faced acting could have shown a little more depth. I was also ultimately unsatisfied by some aspects of the ending\u2014after so much build up, I feel the viewers deserved slightly more. The film presents interesting ideas, but the lack of resolution means that some of the impact is lost. It's worth a watch, but not one of my favorites.",

This version, and the actors, poured their hearts and souls into these characters, and it paid off big time. There's a genuineness to it, a spirituality, if you will, that the remake, by comparison, didn't manage to capture. This version clutched at my heart, and the casting was remarkable, they all seemed so natural, no \"acting\" anywhere to be seen, and the emotional outbursts, whether fear or anger, were of a nature born in reality, not meant for the camera or an audience. You felt as if you were that mouse in the corner, observing the true lives of others, not sitting on your sofa eating popcorn and staring at a tv screen. So, bottom line, even if you saw, and liked the more recent version, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the real thing.",

            "content": "Sweet sorrow permeates through Susanne Bier's Oscar nominated \"After the Wedding\", a quietly testing film that tepidly breaks free from the shackles of the Dogme manifestoes to deliver an incredibly subtle celebration of family. Paternal pacification is as good a reason as any to explore with overwhelming and eloquent sentimentality when Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is arm-twisted into returning to his native Denmark to seek out funds for his orphanage's young charges in India. He meets with the seemingly magnanimous Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard, filling the screen with his sheer presence), a millionaire that invites him to his daughter's wedding and in the process sets the wheels of redemption into motion. Bier's most prominent work thus far is also her most joyous when she bravely evokes the goodness in her characters, working the circumstances to peel away the layers of tacit human desires and destructive pride. Blessed with superlative performances across the board, a particularly inspired turn by Mikkelsen serves as Bier's dramatic lynchpin for her film's gentle twists and turns. But even its sudsy plot developments work well in Bier's kinetic and expertly crafted dreamworld, which despite its otherworldly state still manages to disclose the bare and conspicuous design of mortality and compassion.",

            "content": "Susanne Bier first came to my attention when her \"In a Better World\" won Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards in 2011. I haven't see that one but I did see her \"Serena\", starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. I only now got around to seeing her Academy Award-nominated \"Efter brylluppet\" (\"After the Wedding\" in English).The focus is Jacob, a man from Denmark running an orphanage in Bombay. With the orphanage running short of funds, a Danish company offers to donate money to keep it open, provided that Jacob returns to Denmark to collect it. It's while he's in Denmark that the plot begins to unfold, as events there connect to Jacob's past.If you've seen any Scandinavian movies, you probably know that they tend to have a gloomy side (ironic for the region known as the most pleasant part of the world). This movie is no exception. The interactions between the various characters elicit all sorts of unpleasant memories. One might say that the conversations are a form of brutality. The wedding might be a happy event, but there's a lot of things that Jacob, J\u00f8rgen, Helene and the others have to work out in the meantime.Since I haven't seen most of Bier's movies, I can't compare this to them. All that I can say is that the movie hits you like a kick in the gut, so I hope to see the rest of her movies. There are some outstanding performances here, both in terms of dialogue and how the facial expressions sometimes tell the story. Mads Mikkelsen, Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Stine Fischer Christensen, and the rest do a fine job. I recommend it.",

            "content": "A Danish orphanage worker outside Mumbai, India, is summoned home to receive a large donation from a wealthy industrialist in this intensely acted 2006 drama that seamlessly melds Douglas Sirk's hyperbolic melodramas with Ingmar Bergman's more austere sensibilities. Directed with panache by Susanne Bier, the result is really an involving soap opera given greater texture and surprising plot turns by Anders Thomas Jensen' dexterous screenplay. 2006 was obviously a fertile year for world cinema as this emotionally vibrant film competed against Guillermo del Toro's Gothic fairy tale \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and the winner, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Cold War thriller \"The Lives of Others\", for the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.The story's protagonist is Jacob Peterson, a taciturn man dedicated to the orphanage he runs in India, so much so that coming back to Denmark holds little interest for him other than securing the funding he needs from a multinational corporation headquartered in Copenhagen. The seemingly avuncular CEO J\u00f8rgen Hansson just wants to shake Jacob's hand for his humanitarian work. When Jacob arrives, however, it becomes clear that J\u00f8rgen hasn't quite made up his mind about the gift much to Jacob's consternation. It seems like a good omen when J\u00f8rgen invites Jacob to his daughter Anna's lavish wedding at his palatial home, but then Jacob meets J\u00f8rgen's comely wife Helene, who turns out to have known Jacob years before. The story peels off one revelation after another, sometimes with subtlety and other times with the forceful contrivance of a sledgehammer. Each of the major story developments hinges on a secret that a principal character is forced to reveal, most often with devastating consequences.Looking a bit like Viggo Mortenson's recessive brother, Mads Mikkelsen (almost recognizable as the nasty banker Le Chiffre in \"Casino Royale\") portrays Jacob with haunting power, though sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively. For instance, we don't get a deep sense of his inner struggle over saving thousands of children in India since he lets his pride stand in the way when it becomes convenient to the plot. Rolf Lassgard manages to capture the bluster and increasing desperation of a man used to having his way but unable to cope with the inevitable. When his character's motivations are slowly revealed, his performance starts to unravel into excess, especially in a no-holds-barred breakdown scene toward the end. As the wife with the complicated past, Sidse Babett Knudsen is genuinely affecting, as is Stine Fischer Christensen as the waif-like daughter caught in the middle.Bier's idiosyncratic film-making style can be seen in the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the actors' eyes during the most tense and cathartic moments. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras. Neither a commentary track nor a making-of featurette are included, but there is a reasonably insightful twenty-minute interview with Bier conducted by Danish film critic Morten Piil. Also included are the theatrical trailer and eight deleted scenes which Bier explains to Piil were cut because they either detracted from the main storyline or made a redundant plot point with little additional benefit. Looking at them after seeing the film, I would agree with her assessment. It's a very well crafted piece of work and certainly provides enough dramatic fireworks and moments of true insight to make this worthwhile viewing despite the occasional plot contrivance.",

It is a film that raises difficult questions and situations and somehow pulls us into a world of damaged people about whom we genuinely care.Jacob (a stellar performance by Mads Mikkelsen) is a solitary soul who has found a niche in India as a teacher and caregiver in an orphanage. When he is informed that a wealthy donor is considering being a benefactor, Jacob leaves the children he loves to return to his native Denmark to the home of the potential donor J\u00f8rgen (another fine performance by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) and his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen): in Jacob's past he had been lovers with Helene while both were in India). A major event is in the offing - the marriage of 20-year-old Anna - Stine Fischer Christensen - (J\u00f8rgen and Helene's daughter) and feisty Christian (Christian Tafdrup). The only character who does not seem to have a secret is J\u00f8rgen's mother (Mona Malm) who suffers from mild dementia. It should be a happy occasion, but after the wedding old wounds are uncovered, long secrets are discovered, and nothing is as it seems. Jacob, now confronted with strange realities, longs to return to his Indian orphanage, but J\u00f8rgen manipulates his gift of money in a way that uncovers even more secrets. The multiple surprises that occur rapid fire keep the plot and character development spinning until the film closes with such grace that the audience is left stunned.As the current barrage of summer movies assault our senses, making us wonder about the mental hunger for films less than challenging, along comes the release of this magnificent work and reassures us that the era of superb cinema has not dissolved into cartoons. AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",

            "review_title": "A Powerful and Moving Film from Denmark",
            "content": "Susanne Bier depicts the story of an orphanage manager living in India and a wealthy Danish family in a powerful and moving film that addresses a number of aspects of human relationships. In her film, Bier provides an authentic portrayal of love within individual relationships while examining the nature of control and choice. After the Wedding follows a Danish aid worker, named Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) who runs and orphanage and provides for under-privileged children in India. Jacob is also the surrogate father of Pramod (Neeral Mulchandani), a young boy who lives with him at the orphanage. When the orphanage requires funding, Jacob must travel to Denmark to meet with the benefactor, J\u00f8rgen Hannson (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), a confident self-made billionaire. J\u00f8rgen's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen), is getting married to Christian (Christian Tafdrup), one of J\u00f8rgen's employees, soon after Jacob arrives and J\u00f8rgen spontaneously invites Jacob to the wedding. Jacob runs into his former lover, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) who happens to be J\u00f8rgen's wife. As the celebration unfolds, Jacob learns that Anna is actually his own daughter, and J\u00f8rgen's intentions may not be what he expected. Love is emphasized in a number of relationships between the characters in After the Wedding. Perhaps the prominent example of love is seen between J\u00f8rgen and Helene. Unique about the portrayal of this relationship is its realistic quality. The love between J\u00f8rgen and Helene is seen throughout the film. Their interaction at the beginning of the film in the bathroom establishes the positive tone for their relationship and continues to the end with their genuine happiness together at J\u00f8rgen's birthday celebration. But Bier also illustrates the conflict and tension between the couple. The scene in J\u00f8rgen's office is a prime example, demonstrating a degree of frustration between them. Ultimately, what is seen is a relationship that is not perfect, but realistic, marked by a wide range of emotion, both positive and negative. The result is a natural portrayal of love between J\u00f8rgen and Helene, highlighting its strength and ability to transcend the minor conflicts in their relationship. The recent marriage of Anna and Christian exemplifies love in a contrasting light. Christian's adulterous affair exposes a common harsh reality of love, and the emotional effect when it is lost. J\u00f8rgen and Anna demonstrate the reciprocal love between father and daughter. Evidence of this is seen in J\u00f8rgen's joy during Anna's wedding and reception and, in an opposite sense, Anna's grief following the discovery of her father's terminal illness. After the Wedding presents love as a diverse emotion and rather than a superficial portrayal, love is depicted in a raw and natural fashion. The film's natural portrayal of love is a result, in part, by the brilliant performances by the leading roles. Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd stands out in this regard, with a superb ability to portray the confidence and power that is such a part of J\u00f8rgen's character. His final scene is the most raw, unrestrained display of emotion I have seen in a film. In addition to the outstanding acting, a number of filming techniques contribute to this film's strength. Bier utilizes extreme close-up shots, primarily of the characters' eyes, providing the audience with a more intimate connection to the character and their thoughts and emotions. Bier also includes a number of similar shots focused on the eyes of dead animals in J\u00f8rgen's study, as well as shots of dead vegetation, a unique and chilling method of foreshadowing. The music used enhances the emotional effect on the audience, specifically in the final scenes. A song by the Icelandic band Sigur R\u00f3s is used in the final moments of the film to produce one of the most moving scenes I have experienced in film. The filming style uses many natural elements, including natural lighting and the use of hand-held cameras, providing a human- centric perspective of the scene. In all, these techniques form a simplistic and tasteful style that puts the focus on the characters and their relationships.After the Wedding not only examines love through relationships, but also the significance and nature of control and choice. Bier addresses control most prominently with J\u00f8rgen and Jacob. J\u00f8rgen, the self-made billionaire, is accustomed to high degree of control and power over many aspects of his life. However, control over his life is lost with the onset of his terminal illness. J\u00f8rgen notes on man's inability to control everything, which has recently become a very harsh reality for J\u00f8rgen. In his loss of control, J\u00f8rgen makes an attempt to control what he will leave behind, though not maliciously by any means, rather to ensure the well-being of the family he loves. Jacob is J\u00f8rgen's primary focus, but even as J\u00f8rgen attempts to control him, Jacob remains in control. Though Jacob eventually fills the role as a fatherly figure in J\u00f8rgen's family, as J\u00f8rgen had intended, Jacob's decision is independent of J\u00f8rgen's incentives and reflects Jacob's realization of his responsibility to care for his daughter and her mother. The film presents the idea that control and power does not always lie in the hands of those one would expect. In addition, Bier addresses choice most prominently with Jacob. Jacob is left with an extremely difficult choice. He is divided between India and Denmark and must choose to sacrifice his established life in India and his fatherhood of Pramod, in order to become the father figure J\u00f8rgen's family. After the Wedding is an incredibly powerful and moving film, which is accomplished through a filming style that highlights characters and their relationships, and the authentic portrayal of love and raw emotion. Through this film, Bier not only provides an insight as to the nature of love and relationships, but also to that of choice and control in way that leaves the moral judgments of the character's choices in the hands of the audience.",

            "content": "From Denmark comes \"After the Wedding,\" an unusually rich and complex human drama, marked by superb performances, insightful writing, and stylish direction by Susanne Bier. Nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Foreign Language Film of 2006 (but not released commercially in the U.S. until the following year), this is one of the true unheralded movie gems of 2007.Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is a dedicated social worker from Denmark whose orphanage in India has caught the eye of a Danish philanthropist named Jergen (Rolf Lassgard), who summons the young man to Copenhagen to discuss his plan for donating a substantial sum of his own money to the project. While in the city, Jacob is invited to attend the wedding of Jergen's adopted daughter, Anna, only to discover when he gets there that Jergen's wife is, in reality, his old girlfriend, Helene, and that Anna might, in fact, be the child he never knew he had.With a screenplay by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, \"After the Wedding\" transcends the \"soap opera\" nature of its premise to become a deeply moving study of the compromises and sacrifices all of us are forced to make throughout the course of our lives. The characters the writers have come up with are admirably complex, credibly three-dimensional, and never all that easy to peg. With his somber, deeply lined face masking the emotional turmoil within, Mikkelsen gives a darkly brooding performance as a man who finds it easier to give of himself on a grand scale - i.e., trying to save the world - than to make a meaningful connection with any single individual. Sidse Babette Knudson is poised and lovely as Jacob's deeply conflicted former lover and Jergen's wife, while Lassgard hits amazing dramatic heights as Jergen, who is, in many ways, the most enigmatic of the three main characters. For much of the film, we are left to ponder whether Jergen is a genuinely good man or merely a world-class manipulator who enjoys playing god with the lives of those around him. Finally, Stine Fischer Christensen delivers a deeply touching performance as the vulnerable young woman whose wedding serves as the catalyst for much of the drama. There are no heroes or villains in this piece, only flawed but well-meaning and believable individuals whom we come to care deeply about throughout the course of the film.In her direction, Bier brings a great deal of texture to the work, focusing on the subtle details of the scenes and boring into the very souls of the characters through intense close-up concentration on the actors' pores and eyes. The music by Johan Soderqvist is subtle and haunting and adds tremendous flavor to the drama.\"After the Wedding\" is a beautiful film that sweeps us up in its story and characters and makes us intimate participants in the world it is showing us. It is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking in roughly equal measure - and what more could one ask of a movie?",

Filmed in India and Copenhagen, Denmark, it is a film about conflicting demands for compassion and how to best meet the needs of others. Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) runs an orphanage in Mumbai for Indian children who otherwise might end up on the streets as child prostitutes. Jacob has very expressive eyes, especially when he looks at eight-year old Pramod (Neeral Muchandani), a boy that he has raised since infancy. Secrets and lies play a big role in the film and Bier's camera provides us with extensive close ups of people's eyes that hint of hidden stories in their lives.When the orphanage runs into financial trouble, Jacob learns about a Danish industrialist's offer to donate a huge sum of money to the project. His boss, Mrs. Shaw (Meenal Patel), tells him, however, that the financier, Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) insists that he go to Copenhagen to work out the details of the grant in person, a city he has not visited in twenty years. Reluctantly he leaves, telling Pramod that he will be back within eight days for the boy's birthday but the look in his eyes suggests that this may not work out. The focus of the film then shifts to Jorgen, a heavy set businessman whose aggressive personality seems to portend another stock character. However, as we get to know Jorgen and his family, a tender, more human side emerges.As he prepares for the wedding of his daughter Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) to a company employee, Christian (Christian Tafdrup), hints of his controlling nature are shown but we also see him in a happy relationship with his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and his young children Martin (Frederick Gullits Ernst) and Morten (Kristian Gullits Ernst) to whom he reads bedtime stories. After their first meeting, Jorgen invites the Orphanage director to Anna's wedding the following day and we sense that the film has many surprises in store for us. When Jacob and Helene's eyes meet at the wedding ceremony and Anna gives a toast revealing that Jorgen is not her real father, it becomes clear that Jorgen's insistence that Jacob come to Denmark has more than a business motivation.Ultimately, through many plot twists and turns, Jacob must face an agonizing choice about how best to meet the needs of others. After the Wedding reveals fascinating layers of character detail for both the idealist and the pragmatist and raises interesting questions about personal responsibility, but the film ultimately sinks under the weight of too many contrivances and movie \"coincidences\". While it is a sensitive film that shows the need for compassion for all people regardless of their economic status, I found it to be too carefully plotted to be genuinely moving in spite of its dominant performances and the lovely music of Sigur Ros.",

Even though some plot twists are a tad too melodramatic to my taste, the actors' strong performances never let the emotional scenes slip into uncomfortably obvious tearjerking territory. Despite the technical quality of the film, I couldn't quite get involved in the characters' crises as closely as I have done with some other films. Friends of powerful character studies may still want to check the film out; it may well be more fruitful for people in different life situations.",

A Danish social worker in India, emotionally connected to a group of orphaned boys, one of whom he treats as a son, returns home to seek financial support for the orphanage. As if by chance he discovers a second connection, one he never knew, disclosed after the wedding of a rich industrialist's daughter. How an apparently sensitive, altruistic man and the manor-born family he meets deal with self-discovery is the premise. From these characters, we might expect sensitivity, caution, prudence, a willingness to work carefully and maturely through pain -- in short, a drama of manners. What we get, however, are mostly melodramatic gestures -- an overturned table, uncontrollable sobbing, a take-it-or-leave-it donation, a casual infidelity -- in short, a series of emotional reactions without dramatic underpinnings. And so, for me at least, the interest that builds in the first half of this film dissipates in the second. What could have been a deeply affecting ending tends instead toward sentimentality.",

            "content": "\"After the Wedding\" epitomizes everything that's wrong with the conservative committee that picks the Oscar nominees for Best Foreign Language Film. This year, not only they didn't give the statuette to Guillermo Del Toro's fantastic \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (the rest of the Academy awarded it in 3 other categories, though), but nominated this \"After the Wedding\" over Pedro Almod\u00f3var's superb \"Volver\". The winner? The well-made, interesting, but a little too prosaic \"The Lives of Others\". Every year is the same story: they nominate insipid movies over daring, original works (remember they didn't nominate \"City of God\" in 2002 because apparently it was too violent for their tastes; since Fernando Meirelles's movie officially came out in the US in 2003, it could be nominated in 4 other categories the following year, showing that the Academy still has some common sense).\"After the Wedding\" is not a bad movie, although rather underwhelming. It starts intriguing, a seemingly unlikely cross between \"The Constant Gardener\" and \"Festen\" (a fabulous Danish film overlooked by the Academy in 1998), but it becomes just a mediocre melodrama. The excessive use of close-ups is somewhat cheesy, but Susanne Bier extracts solid performances from Mads Mikkelsen (Jacob) and Stine Fischer Christensen (Anna). I haven't had the chance to check Bier's previous works (\"Pensionat Oskar\" aka \"Like It Never Was Before\" looks very interesting and I've been looking for a copy for years now) or the new \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" (her first movie in English), but in spite of this disappointing experience, I'm still curious about her other films (2 of her previous films are being remade in Hollywood right now - yeah, they will never learn...). Unfortunately, her most acclaimed work so far is a perfect example of how the senile committee from AMPAS still has to learn to appreciate daring cinema over more-of-the-same flicks. 6/10.",

Viewed at 2006 Rome film festival.image1.jpegSusanne Bier's Danish drama, \"After The Wedding\" (Efter Brylluppet) is another milestone in the filmography of one of Europes top female directors and also one of Europes best actors, both Danes. Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) an ex-pat Dane works in India taking care of homeless orphans. He has a particularly close relationship with a boy Pramod (age 8). His Indian overseer receives an offer from Copenhagen for big money to assist the project. This will require the mysterious ex-pat to return to Kbh after a long absence of many years to negotiate the transaction. He goes, very reluctantly, but not before solemnly promising the boy that he will be back for his birthday, only eight day away. In Copenhagen he meets the millionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgaard) who invites him to his daughter's wedding party. It turns out that Jorgen's current wife, Helene, (Sidse Babett- Knudsen) is an ex-flame of Jacob's. At the wedding party the young bride announces to the jolting discomfort of all that Jorgen is not her real, genetic father. It now turns out that she is actually the offspring of Jacob and Helen's affair many years before. This is most disturbing to Jacob who did not know of the existence of this now full-grown daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen), who has been raised by Jorgen as his own -- not to mention the daughter herself, who feels betrayed by everybody. This leads to severe complications, confrontations and soul searching by all involved. Jorgen, nevertheless, offers Jacob the sky -- and a fund in perpetuity in his name and that of Anna, his new found daughter. One condition: Jacob must remain in Denmark and not go back to India. Jacob is highly suspicious of the Millionaire's motives for all this unexplained and seemingly paradoxical generosity. The kicker is that Jorgen is dying but has revealed this to no one until now. What should Jacob do? -- accept the offer which would save all his young Indian charges from a life of depravation on the streets, or turn the offer down and go back to Bombay where he promised Pramod to be back in time for his birthday. Jorgen dies after a heart-wrenching last scene with the guilt feelings beset wife. Sob-sob. Funeral.Jacob back in India offers to take Pramod back to Denmark where he would lead a life of luxury. The kid refuses. He wants to stay with the people he knows best. Sob-sob. This is a very high-style sob-story that is also very depressing but, indisputably, an \"auteur film\" all the way. Susan Bier is one of the foremost female director's at work in Europe today and makes glossy, high concept, slick psychological studies with excellent actors. I know this was a very good film but I was in so much pain watching it that I couldn't wait for it to be over. Alex in the press room, Rome.

Ignoring the inevitable middle-age spread that comes with aging and enjoying life? Not the junk that Hollywood puts out with actors tearing each other's clothes off. Rarely does lovemaking happen that way.This is where the billionaire Jorgon finds himself when diagnosed with a terminal illness at 48. To all unwitting parties he tempts the reluctant Jacob, whose been running a failing orphanage in India, to come to Denmark for a large charitable donation. While there, Jacob attends the wedding of Jorgon and Helene's daughter and discovers the daughter, Anna, is actually his own child, born from a love affair with Helene in India twenty years before. When the anger, denial and rehashing of the past is behind them all, it is clear that Anna's loving step-father has been hatching a devious but unselfish plan all along; for the honorable Jacob to resume the responsibility of his family when he's gone, including young twin boys.AFTER THE WEDDING had me sobbing midway through the film and I didn't stop until the end. The story is perfect, the acting packed with emotion. I kept waiting for the moment that would be too much, Helene and Jacob in an embrace before Helene's poor husband was even in the grave. It didn't happen. The writer was wise enough to let us imagine it on our own. In the meantime Helene suffers along with Jorgon as he mixes alcohol and Morphine, occasionally showing his less-than-perfect side before he leaves her.The ending had to be. Jacob didn't leave India, India left Jacob, in the form of a child that preferred friends and home over moving to Denmark with him and, in doing so, set Jacob free. Free to run a multi-million-dollar fund for for the children of India but (a demand from Jorgon) from Denmark.Don't overlook an older film.

This is truly a 'world' film, not just an international production. It is a film, not entirely unlike \"Babel\"(2005), which escorts the viewer through three clearly portrayed worlds. The world of the Indian (Third World) poor, the world of the well-meaning Westener, the world of the self-satisfied Western rich. Mads Mikkelson, as Jacob, is riveting with his frozen anger and stoicism. Rolf Lassgard, as Jorgen, plays the complex magnate who is invulnerable, wily, and eventually unraveled by his impending death. Sidse Babett Knudsen, as Helene, portrays the poor girl who marries the wealthy Jorgen for love, not passion. She carries this wonderfully by easily drifting back and forth between her root personality, the hard girl of hard times, and her adopted self, the wealthy paramour to Jorgen, the corporate king. The film has the flavor of a cultural morality play without being moralistic. It is, in my opinion, an example of evolved art, firmly seated in cultural and personal realities with archetypal characters and themes. Just brilliant.

Practically every single character is keeping a secret from their loved ones and as each secret is revealed the consequences are felt full force by the audience. You are genuinely made to feel for the principle characters. It is true that in life keeping a secret is sometimes worse than actually revealing it and getting it off your chest, the secrets in this film and their after effects do not do this. Each revelation is a crippling blow to every character involved, and requires immediate and possibly drastic change to their lives.Mads Mikkelsen shows that he's more than just a blood-weeping Bond villain as he portrays Jacob as a strong-willed, compassionate and genuinely decent man who has put his dark hedonistic past behind him (or so he thinks) and only remaining fault seems to be that of being a little naive. He is a man of very few words and he makes an effort to hide his emotions from his fellow Danes, whom he doesn't trust or particularly like. The love for his Indian orphans however cannot be denied. Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd's J\u00f8rgen is a larger-than-life, jolly, wealthy man who has a clear abundance of love and adoration for all his family and friends but is plagued by what first appears to be a simple drinking problem but later reveals itself to be much, much more. About half way through the film he becomes the main focus of the story as every thing around him collapses and Lassg\u00e5rd delivers a harrowing powerhouse of a performance.At some points it does get a bit overwhelming as almost every thing that can go wrong does go wrong and Jacob's stubbornness does get on your nerves a little, but all in all this is a fantastic, powerful heart-breaker of a movie.

It is recommended not only the be rather high rating it received on IMDB but also by the fact that the screenplay is written by Anders Thomas Jensen, screenwriter and director himself of some very interesting films I've seen lately, and especially since one of the main roles is played by Mads Mikkelsen, one of those actors who never seems to make a mistake in choosing his roles and who raises the level of any film in which he is acting. For the most part, 'After the Wedding' lived up to my expectations. It is a combination of melodrama and social criticism film, an emotional human story filmed with artistic means inspired by the Dogma movement (but without abiding ... dogmatically by the rules), with an extra touch of Bollywood. Mads did not disappoint me, but the weak point of the film seemed, surprisingly, in the script.'After the Wedding' begins and ends in India, but most of the story takes place in Denmark. The film's hero, Jacob Pederson, runs an orphanage in a large Indian city. His life is dedicated to this philanthropic activity and to the children he cares for. When he is obliged to travel to Denmark to ensure continued funding, he does so without enthusiasm. But life has a big surprise in store for him. The wife of the rich man on whose support everything depends is his younger days sweetheart. Moreover, when invited to the wedding of the daughter of the rich family, he discovers that he is ... the father of the bride. We are dealing with a story of forgotten love, with a clash between the classes of the rich donors and of those who need their help, but also with a confrontation of characters. The rich Jorgen has plans and conditions and will put Jacob in difficult dilemmas.I liked the style of filming with the use of the hand-held camera, always having the heroes with their feelings in the center of the frame. Scandinavian morality, which is very evident in many of the films made in this part of the world, is approached here in an original way, which rejects the Manichaean patterns of class differences. Jacob is played by Mads Mikkelsen and the combination of principles and errors, steep sincerity and social clumsiness that characterizes the character is very well captured by this wonderful actor. Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd nuances the difficult role of the rich J\u00f6rgen Hansson. Sidse Babett Knudsen, an actress I do not remember having seen before, manages to shed light on the character of the woman in the lives of the two men. The script sometimes fails to avoid tones of soap opera, thus wonderful scenes alternate with clich\u00e9 dialogs and situations. However, the surprising turn that the story takes at one point is well justified. I understand that in 2019 a remake was made after this movie. I did not see it, but I read that, as in many other cases, the American version fails to reach the emotional intensity of the European original. This does not surprise me. Despite its shortcomings, 'After the Wedding' is a film with many qualities, honestly and well done. It's hard to believe that Hollywood can beat it.",

A lot of film promises a shocking revelation, but rarely delivers. Most of them merely force either a banal conspiracy or a twist for the sake of twisting down your throat. Efter brylluppet, on the other hand, give me a predictable revelation that somehow makes me care even more. The cast is extraordinary. The most noteworthy is definitely Stine Fischer Christensen, who is now one of my favourite actresses of all time. The ability to portray vary array of emotion is a requirement for any good actress but Christensen took it further in Efter brylluppet where she demonstrated the ability to look with both the most believable loving eyes, and the heartbreaking sorrowful one. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to agree with the director Susanne Bier and the cinematographer Morten Soborg. Yes, hand-held camera and such has its power and it is a nice parody with the script but certain scenes, I believe, would improve greatly if they were filmed by a proper camera.

The acting and direction are superb in this soap-opera like story with the director using a lot of close-up shots to reveal to us what the characters are going thru as all these revelations unfold. The main character is brought from a family he inherited thru his hard work to his real biological family whom he was left out of by his ex when she originally left him. He is not really given a chance to choose between the two, but instead is given an offer he can't refuse(in a major manipulated way) that helps the orphanage and puts him back with his real family. Everything works itself out in the end, and we're given a wonderful ensemble of actors to observe as the story works itself thru. Another excellent movie from our European friends!!",

However, I thought this movie could be something special, otherwise they probably do not show it around Europe. (I am watching it in Amsterdam.) I like the plot. To me, it is not so common like other Hollywood movies. It is a story about life, could be from the neighbors or somebody we knows. There are several scenes that remind me of my life, or from somebody I know. How the director filmed the movie is also quite special, with all the facial expression. Also the music in the beginning is very sad and sweet. The only thing I do not like is why the main character could not speak Indian, while he has been living there for more than 15 years. It just does not make me believe in the bond he has with the Indian boy. Though the movie shows several scenes how he missed the little boys when he was in Denmark, but strangely it does nothing to me. I am more convince in the bond he has with his new daughter. However, it is a recommended movie from me, and I think it has a bright future in the Oscar.",

Most noticably, it has abysmal editing, many scenes are fine, but there are many scenes in which the shot cuts are very often, every 2-4 seconds and they cut at very unattractive moments, like for example the character starts the sit down then it cuts to him sitting already and then it cuts ti him eating. The editing is truly off. The story itself is over-the-top. Characters get histerical often which is fine, but they made it a bit too extremely shall I say. There are twists in the story that some characters do some decitions, but some feel out of character and unnatural. Still, even with the very flawed execution, the idea is there. I especially love the moments in India, too bad movie does not really revolve around it. It is a similar case in another movie from the same writter In a Better World, there some scenes take place in Africa and those moments are wonderful, but that film also does not revolve around that.",

More importantly, it allows the actors to non-act and yet complete a film. Key moments are lost and it seems you are watching a film synchronised on a different frequency of projection. I have no idea what the director could've been thinking of. India is again stereotyped, which is the usual story with the West. Granted that the poverty of Bombay exists, yet if you mention that, you need to also mention the liberty from the grind of materialism that India provides, even to the poor: especially when the protagonist of your story has decided to live all his life in India. Why? Simply ideals to help people in \"another part of the world\"? Overall, an avoidable film, and with a lot of formulaic flavour.",

            "content": "Please, before watching After the Wedding, have a box of Kleenex ready. Take my advice or you will be that annoying person in the room that is trying to muffle their sniffling and casually looking down to pat away their tears at the end. That or everyone in the room will be affected the same way and there will be no need to hide. I'd say the latter is more probable After the Wedding follows Jacob Pederson, played by Mads Mikkelsen, a stoic, somber and dedicated social worker in his late 40s that is an ex-patriot of Denmark living abroad in India. He is working at an Orphanage that is severely in need of more funding or it is threatened to shut down, leaving hundreds of kids alone on the streets. He is sent to Denmark to meet J\u00f8rgen Hannson (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), a philanthropist billionaire looking to support different charity project to present his case and take home the money. The audience is made to think that this is going to be a one-week case closed deal, however upon arrival it is obvious that J\u00f8rgen has different motives. It just so happens that on this weekend his 20-year-old daughter is getting married and Jacob is invited. At the wedding, a twist is revealed and his daughter reveals that J\u00f8rgen is not actually her birth father. Not the speech I would have included in my wedding but hey, it's a vital part to this film. At this point, J\u00f8rgen's wife, Helene, realizes what's up and is deeply affected by Jacob's presence; here the real reason that Jacob is in Denmark begins to unfold .However beautiful this story may be, I have a couple of problems with some of the key themes and morals of this movie. It seems that the main message is that everyone is replaceable in life; if one person cannot be there, there is always someone else that could do equally as good of a job. The second moral that seems to be a little off is that the problems in third world countries can be solved with merely a check. J\u00f8rgen essentially sends money to India and takes away the helping hand that really was changing lives. You cannot replace the service work of anyone with a couple million dollars, and I think that this movie shows the audience that all we REALLY need to do is send money. Stay home and be with your family; those starving kids in India don't need it that much .This also brings up the character of J\u00f8rgen, and the struggle with the audience's opinion about him. On one hand he is a philanthropist and any giving to people in need, no matter what the motivation, deserves praise and recognition. However, in this movie the audience is made to question whether or not the ulterior motives to helping people make a gesture of giving $13 million dollars more or less respectable. Do we consider J\u00f8rgen to be abusing his power in money and commerce and playing God for those who are less fortunate than him or do we respect him for being so self sacrificing and leading those who he loves down a path where they will be happier in the long run? Watch this movie and decide that for yourself.With that being said, this film is still a favorite. It pulls at the heartstrings so much because it is a true display of raw human emotion. Each character displays an altruistic side of them, showing the viewers what it is like to be self-sacrificing and what it feels like to love someone so much that you would give up everything for them. Like most of these low budget foreign films, the high budget special affects or the fancy sets or even the big name actors do not distract us. Instead we are able to concentrate on the relationships between actors and learn to relate and sympathize with them. The director, Susan Bier uses a softened version of Dogma 95, not adhering to ever rule in von Trier's book, but bringing the essence and feeling of dogma to international audiences.After the Wedding is no ordinary foreign film. It brings human emotion, weddings, deaths, children and families into a very real setting. Bier uses a story of heartbreak and love to leave the audience in tears and pondering what truly is important in life. And seriously\u23afdon't forget the Kleenex.",

            "content": "After the Wedding is a testament to the power of non-verbal acting. This film tells so much story without feeling the need to over-explain anything. We see faces and expressions and we know exactly what is happening. This economy of story-telling is admirable, and I love that Susanne Bier respects her audience enough to believe we can understand the story being told without needing our hands held as it is explained. I suppose this tactic wouldn't work if you didn't have such a marvelous cast who can express so much with just their faces. Mads Mikkelsen is perfect, and I have yet to be disappointed with any of his performances. Here he carries us along on his journey, and we are able to share in his joy, frustration, and confusion. Likewise, Sidse Babett Knudsen is brilliant in the film. She has to bring a great deal of the emotion to the story, and I think she does that quite well. Her pensive stares are downright haunting in this film.The enigma in After the Wedding is Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd. He plays a rich businessman, and we are not clued in to his thought process, so we are left to wonder whether his motives are pure or not. I think that's the most satisfying aspect of this film. It has a mystery quality to the story, and the truth of what is happening continues to be revealed one little piece at a time. When all the cards are on the table, it proves to be an intriguing family drama, and it made me question what is the right thing to do in this situation. The conclusion of the film felt a little too convenient in some ways, but I appreciated that it wasn't all a storybook ending. I've often said in the past that one of the best things a movie can do is get me to a place where I want to know what happens next after the film has ended, and that's what After the Wedding accomplished. It's both a heart-warming and heart-wrenching film that I will immediately recommend to others.",

            "review_title": "Plot Info and Personal Opinion of After The Wedding",
            "content": "In Susanne Bier's Film After The Wedding, the use of secretiveness and outstanding acting allows for the viewers to really feel like they are sitting in the room, as well as take sides with many of the characters. Currently I am enrolled in a Nordic film class where we have watched many of the most popular films by famous directors such as Lars Von Trier and Kristian Levring. This film, without question, was my favorite out of all the films we have watched thus far for many reasons.After The Wedding is a film about a man, Jacob Pederson, who runs an orphanage in Bombay India, where he has built a strong relationship with his favorite orphan Pramod. Jacob has made many unsuccessful attempts at organizing projects to gain funding for his organization that is slowly becoming on the verge of bankruptcy. Jacob then learns that there is a business man in Denmark who is greatly considering making a large donation to the orphanage, but he must go talk with him face to face before receiving such funding. Jacob boards a plane to Denmark where he meets Jorgen, a multi-millionaire, who is considering making a substantial donation. Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughters wedding where he is reacquainted with Jorgen's wife Helene who was his ex-girlfriend. During the toasts at dinner, Anna, Jorgen and Helen's daughter, makes a toast where she says that Jorgen is not her real father, even though she loves him so dearly. This is when the story starts to turn and become a little faster paced and energetic as Jacob starts to wonder if Anna is actually his daughter.As the movie continues and both Jacob and Anna find out from Helene that they are indeed father and daughter, there is a better connection between all of the characters. The story then takes a huge twist, as we find out that Jorgen has an incurable disease and won't be alive much longer. Jorgen had the intention of bringing Jacob into the family so that he would be there to support Helene, Anna, and the children after his death. While it is hard for the family to accept Jorgen's fate, we see the relationship with Jacob and the family begin to really build a foundation. Jacob ends up receiving millions of dollars in a foundation from Jorgen that he has agreed to run side-by-side with Anna, due to the fact that as part of the agreement he had to live in Denmark. After Jorgen's death, we see how close the family is to Jacob as they all embrace him and hold hands with him at the funeral, which I personally never thought would happen prior to the learning of Jorgen's disease. In the end of the movie, Jacob returns to India to ask Pramod to return to Denmark, but he refuses because \"the people are all rich and mean there.\" In my opinion, After The Wedding was an outstanding film, with only one thing that I would have changed. I personally thought that the film was dragged on just a bit too long, but not enough to the point where I was waiting for it to be over. If I had to cut out a scene, it would be the scene towards the end of the film where Jorgen has his birthday party. I would cut this out because I felt that there was nothing major revealed at the dinner, which was not what I thought was going to happen. I thought that Jorgen was going to reveal that he had an incurable disease, however, all he talks about is the future of his company. That is why I believe that this scene could be cut from the film. Otherwise, I thought the use of camera angles, plot twists, and choice of characters made this film an excellent one. Thus, I rate this film a 9 out of 10 stars.Looking more into detail about why I liked the movie, I thought that the choice of camera angles in the film really made me feel like I was in the room when they were talking, or sitting at a table during the wedding ceremony. Two specific scenes that I thought were excellently shot were the scene where Jacob and Helene were basically trying to start their friendship over again at the kitchen table. Bier used over the shoulder angles and one light source, that being from the window, which made me feel like I was sitting right there with them listening to the conversation. The other scene that I thought was shot spectacularly, was the scene towards the end of the movie where Jorgen is in the bedroom with Helene and he starts to cry out that he \"doesn't want to die.\" Not only was the acting phenomenal in this scene, but the use of medium close-up and high angle shots, makes the viewer feel like we are standing there watching Jorgen cry. Again, I thought the acting was outstanding throughout the whole film, but this scene in particular I could feel the raw emotion being relayed from the actor to the viewer.Overall, I would rate the film After The Wedding a 9 out of 10 stars and would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in watching an outstanding foreign film. Like I said before, the use of camera angles, the acting and plot twists really made this movie stand out from other foreign films I have watched in the past. To conclude, if this movie were to be re-made in English in America, with famous American actors, I believe that it would be a huge hit in the United States.",

            "review_title": "After the Wedding digs deep into life's moral dilemmas",
            "content": "Embrace yourself for a heart-wrenching, roller-coaster ride of emotion as director Susan Bier brings you deep into thought about real life issues. The protagonist, known for his role as the villain in Casino Royale, Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) plays quite a different role than in Bond. In this story he operates an orphanage in India that will soon be unable to provide for its children. Jacob travels to Denmark, where he is originally from, to convince billionaire J\u00f8rgen Hannson (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) to choose his orphanage to donate to. J\u00f8rgen is exactly what I picture a billionaire looking like \u2013 a large man in stature with a deep and powerful voice. Jacob expresses his extreme compassion for the many children in need back in India, but J\u00f8rgen couldn't care less. We automatically feel that J\u00f8rgen has an agenda that is much more important to him. At the conclusion of their meeting, J\u00f8rgen invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding where the drama begins to unfold. We find out at the wedding that Jacob strangely knows J\u00f8rgen's wife, and during the unconventional toast by the bride we discover that J\u00f8rgen is not actually her father. At this point the film's plot seems to be following that of a common soap opera, but the movie continues to unravel into a genuinely unsettling struggle for the Hannson family.Susan Bier positions the viewer under the impression that Jacob is only going to spend a week in Denmark, not only in the place but also with the people he loathes. At first glance, the struggle between the social worker Jacob and the powerful businessman J\u00f8rgen seems to be the only problem, but after the wedding catastrophe ensues. Bier does an excellent job at effectively connecting the audience to the characters in her movie. This task is not done just through a script or direction, but through the choice of cast as well. Jacob plays a fantastic role as the somber character, uttering only few but powerful words. J\u00f8rgen is the epitome of a billionaire who brilliantly demonstrates his power over the other characters, leaving the audience curious as to what motivates him as his hidden agenda is revealed. The superb acting does not end here \u2013 the movie benefits greatly from the supporting actors the mother Helene (Sielse Babett Knudsen), and the daughter Anne (Fischer Chistensen). These influential characters are the catalysts that make this movie much deeper than the contract between Jacob and J\u00f8rgen. Anne, at first glance, seems to be a minor role playing the immature daughter getting married too young, but we see her role become larger as the movie progresses. Her character is responsible for some deep issues that she quickly matures and responds to. These roles are played so well that we feel like we are experiencing emotional, real life situations that are easy to relate to.Perhaps the best part of this movie is that we are not given a happy ending to the story. However, its ending is entirely fitting because of its attempt to portray real life issues. Not everyone's life is perfect and not all problems have simple, clear-cut solutions. For once I did not leave a movie discussing my favorite joke or action scene; instead, I finished the movie considering the moral dilemmas that the characters went through and how I would have handled them if I were in the same situation.I was surprised by my feelings near the end of the movie \u2013 I found myself feeling more pity for the billionaire family than for the orphan children in India. This may sound heartless, but I think that other viewers might agree. The children of India are there for each other just like they are family; they not only live in close proximity, but they also benefit from having close, intimate relationships with one another. Jacob reiterates to Pramod that people in Denmark are so far from one another. The Hannson family becomes so disconnected due to J\u00f8rgen's hidden agenda. He does what he thinks is moral, but he is only thinking about himself.Biers different camera uses force the viewer to pay attention to detail, and she even uses Dogme techniques like utilizing the scene's natural lighting and taking advantage of the unique qualities a hand-held camera can contribute to the depiction of the setting and storyline. These techniques add to the authenticity that she is trying to portray through these characters. Jacob is often found deeply immersed in his thoughts and as an audience we are capable of understanding how serious he is feeling during these instances. One scene in particular that comes to mind is when Jacob is in a state of profound contemplation and the only camera view we are given is a close-up shot of only his face \u2013 we watch how his cigarette slowly burns and how the seriousness of his eyes sink into a murky glare. It is through these small and simple details that the story develops into a more realistic, relatable and thought-provoking experience.After The Wedding is a picture that truly deserves its accomplishments in the film industry through the many nominations and awards it has received. Susan Bier showcases her gift as a director in this magnificent depiction of the terrible series of events that occur within the Hannson family. The film would not be as successful, however, without her great cast of actors who were able to so seamlessly complement one another. These actors were able to make us question the morality of many situations in life. After The Wedding is proof that great movies can be made without forcing the clich\u00e9 of an ending where the characters go on to live \"happily ever after\".",

            "content": "This close to reality drama directed by Susanne Bier tells the story of a Danish orphanage manager, Jacob, who is requested by a wealthy Danish citizen to leave Bombay, India and the kids he has become so close with only to return to Denmark to discuss the possibility of funding. This wealthy citizen, Jorgen, provides the best accommodations for Jacob and even ends up inviting Jacob to his daughter's wedding. It seems out of sheer chance that Jacob runs into a woman, Helene, with whom he had a romance with 20 years ago, and she also happens to be Jorgen's wife and the mother of the bride. The bride, Anna, consequently makes a speech during the dinner that confesses although Jorgen is not her biological father, he has been present for her entire life and has supported her dreams. Jacob immediately realizes there is a big chance Anna is his daughter. After Helene's confirmation, Jacob begins to get to know his daughter while Jorgen seemingly stalls the funding process for the orphanage. We soon find out exactly what Jorgen's intentions have been all along. I give this film such a high score in regards to stars because of the purity and realistic nature of the acting. The plot and story even felt as though it could have been taken from real events. Mads Mikkelson (Jacob), Rolf Lassgard (Jorgen), Sidse Babett Knudsen (Helene), and Stine Fisher Christiansen (Anna) all provide performances that are credible and subtle. The acting found in this film is not acting that would be found in the typical Hollywood film where over-the-top is generally celebrated.The theme of fidelity and infidelity is visited many times in After the Wedding. 20 years prior to the time this film takes place during, Jacob cheats on Helene, which resulted in her leaving him. Mirroring the circumstances of her mother 20 years prior, Anna walks in on her new husband having sex with a friend of hers. We see the devastation that Anna goes through as well as the devastation that Helene remembers from 20 years ago. The only faithful man in this film (among the main characters) is Jorgen, who ends up sacrificing himself somewhat in order to provide the best life for his family after he is gone. As for cinematic techniques, or rather themes, there were countless extreme close ups of eyes. Not just eyes of living characters, but also of mounted taxidermy animals on the walls of Jorgen's house. It is entirely possible that these close ups are used to show the deep emotions that are being felt by these characters, but why the taxidermy animal eyes? It may be an image that connects both life and death, which is what Jorgen is struggling with. It could also be more literal in the fact that eyes are always watching a person and their actions. This still remains a mystery to me, however.Philanthropy and the good will of people come through this film as well. Jacob was originally a free-spirited drunk which is referred to many times, but it seems as though his philanthropic deeds have saved his life (as well as others). The children at the orphanage and those that work there are portrayed as being good, honest, humble people that are not tainted by drama. The children are a symbol for all that is innocent in comparison to the themes of infidelity and non-truths by the Danish characters. After the Wedding is a fresh look at the differences between the haves and the have nots of society and the problems that plague each of them. As Jorgen leaves this world, he gives his money to those that need it in addition to taking care of his family. Towards the beginning of the film, Jorgen doesn't actually consider the reasoning to donating his money other than to bring Jacob to Denmark. Towards the end of the film, the viewer is able to see Jorgen realize how precious life is when he breaks down into the arms of his wife on his birthday in their bedroom. It can be seen that Jorgen only then truly understood the value of life and of the life he has given to have nots in India. He pleads and doesn't want to die, but I do think it is at that moment he accepts his fate. Through his death, many, many children were able to live their lives in a stable environment away from the kind of dramas the family faced through the film.",

This was nominated in the best foreign movie category in 2007 wherein it lost to the Counterfeiters, a much superior film. The film is well made and brilliantly acted. But the script does not offer anything shattering which is what its synopsis on IMDb promises. The viewers of Hindi movies have seen countless films like this although the story hasn't been lifted so far to make an \"inspired\" copy. There is only one scene wherein one of the lead characters reacts about their impending death which has not been used by Hindi cinema.

Don't read any reviews which might include plot revelations prior to viewing it.This is a film-lover's movie. It covers a wide range of emotions from start to finish. It's not your typical happily-ever-after story. The layers that are peeled back over the first 3/4 of the film are pure enjoyment. This movie is terrific--acting, storyline, directing, pace.If you like it the first time, watch it again. Once you know all the plot details it's fascinating to go back and see why certain characters say and do what they do, and why Ms. Bier films the way she does.The acting is beyond superb. Some have called the movie too much like a soap opera, but I would say it's more like the emotions of real life ebbing and flowing throughout.In a time when social justice is the topic of the day and wealthy capitalists are hated, pay attention to how the poor who are without hope of even something as basic as a meal, let alone an education, have their day-to-day lives improved by the benevolence of someone with great wealth. Maybe money isn't such a terrible thing after all. It can do a lot of good for those who are needy.Enjoy!",

            "content": "After the Wedding: An Unexpectedly Touching Familial Drama \"Every acquaintance, every friend, every person who has a place in your heart, it is the time with them that really means something. Nothing else matters\". These words, spoken by the masterfully played J\u00f8rgen (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), sum up the main message of the Danish, Oscar nominated film, After the Wedding. In the hands of a director less skilled than Susanne Bier, After the Wedding may come across as an overblown, soap opera-like melodrama. Instead, Bier uses these cutting emotional moments to develop her characters and their motivations. After the Wedding explores the relationships between wealth and poverty, what it means to be a family, and the individual's role in a larger picture.The film opens with a stoic as ever Mads Mikkelson playing Jacob, the closed off but compassionate manager of an Indian orphanage. Jacob must face the grim reality that without proper funding, his beloved orphanage will close, and the only way to secure the money is for Jacob to travel back to Denmark to confer with a potential benefactor, J\u00f8rgen Lennart Hannson. J\u00f8rgen promises to consider funding the project\u2013but only if Jacob agrees to attend his daughter's wedding the next day. Why did Jacob leave Denmark 20 years ago? Why is J\u00f8rgen orchestrating this event? \"Too much fits together too well,\" comments J\u00f8rgen's wife (and as we soon find out, Jacob's ex-lover). The audience is inclined to agree. But what follows is a touching exploration of familial ties.The initial scenes of Copenhagen provide a stark juxtaposition between Denmark's wealth and the abject poverty of Mumbai (all of the orphans could live comfortably in Jacob's hotel room). The audience instinctively sides with Jacob and his feelings of disgust with his own country. The bright colors of the city contrast with the poverty in which most of the residents live. But despite their lack of wealth, the community cares deeply for its members. Jacob has settled into a niche here, formed a cobbled together family with the young orphan Pramod, who he has raised since birth.Initially, Jacob is loath to leave the warm family he has created, believing his home country to be full of disinterested and disingenuous people (\"Is it because the houses are far apart that the people are far apart?\" Pramod asks Jacob before he leaves). Things become far more muddled when Jacob discovers that he isn't as alone in Denmark as he thought, and the wedding to which he was invited is that of the daughter he never knew existed. But as Jacob begins to embrace his new family, his personal ties to India began to disintegrate. Perhaps most significant is when Jacob, instead of returning to Mumbai by Pramod's birthday as he promised, spends the time in Copenhagen, getting to know his biological daughter, Anna (a moment when they flip through her old photo album together is especially touching).J\u00f8rgen, the man that Jacob instinctively despised, was the driving force that brought him and Anna together. J\u00f8rgen is at once dominant, manipulative, and as likable as he is infuriating. As the film progresses and we understand his motives, we began to sympathize more and more with him. J\u00f8rgen's character raises the question of how much money can buy. Can a person with money and ideals exist? \"I'm buying remission for my sins,\" J\u00f8rgen says of his bargain with Jacob, a bargain that would force Jacob to remain in Denmark to serve as the patriarch of J\u00f8rgen's family. Though Jacob initially refuses, he begins to question his decision, especially when Anna finds herself lost and alone after her new husband cheats on her.What is more important to a cause, a man, or his money? At one point, Jacob is even directly asked: \"think of how many you could help, won't you sell yourself for that?\" Ultimately, he does, and discovers that he is somewhat dispensable. Upon returning to India, Jacob invites Pramod to return with him to Denmark, but Pramod refuses. Things are looking up for the orphanage, and remaining in the now well functioning institution with all of his friends means more to him than beginning a new life with Jacob somewhere else.My one complaint is that India seems to play more of a vibrant and exotic backdrop in the film more than anything more substantial. As soon as Jacob arrives in Denmark, it fades into the distance, save for the occasional glimpse of a sad eyed child on the video Jacob brought with him. A place that a person spent 20 years of their life building wouldn't disappear so easily. If the film had a few more scenes exploring the complexity of Jacob's cognitive dissonance and his ties to India, it would pack an even larger emotional punch.",

            "review_title": "Family Relationships Including Cross-Cultural Perspectives",
            "content": "The Danish film, After the Wedding, directed by Susanne Bier is beautifully formulated to make you cry, laugh, think, and cringe. This film includes several multifaceted characters that constantly keep you guessing as to who they are as a person. Jacob, the main character, lives in India and works for an orphanage, he travels to Denmark to meet with a millionaire, J\u00f8rgen, in hopes of getting a loan to keep the orphanage from shutting down. J\u00f8rgen is married to Helene whom has three children, two younger boy twins and a daughter whom we assume is in her early twenties. The daughter, Anna, gets married to Christian early on in the film. After the wedding, as one can presume from the title, everything in this family dynamic changes and secrets from the past begin to unfold. The audience soon finds out that Jacob is Anna's father and Helene's past lover. The rest of this drama filled film deals with the themes of family relationships and morality, while the director Bier implements extreme-close ups in order to expose the characters raw emotions. The director of this film, Susanne Bier, is known for her somewhat obsessive interest in family relationships. After the Wedding, seemingly deals with every kind of family relationship one can think up, even those that are not related by blood. Relationships between parents and their children stand out at the most important and loving aspect of this film. During the first ten minutes of this film both Jacob and J\u00f8rgen are introduced by showing their love toward children. Jacob has somewhat adopted an Indian child, Pramod, who he raised since he was a week old, when Jacob must leave Pramod for Denmark you can see the love in his heart for the child. J\u00f8rgen is first introduced as he reads a children's book to his twin boys and impersonates the voice of a duck. It is clear from the beginning that both of these men would do anything to help these children and that is why this film is so special and heart wrenching. At Anna's wedding it is announced in her speech that J\u00f8rgen is not her biological father, but that still loves him just as much. This idea of being a parent to someone who is not your biological child comes up in this movie from both Jacob and Jargons point of view. Other types of relationships are also portrayed however, such as struggling marriages, indefinitely, death and jealousy. Through all of these intermingled relationships a sense of maturity and calmness resonates over a majority of the characters. J\u00f8rgen is secretly dealing with his impending death, but other characters such as Jacob, Anna and Helene all figure out how to work with the situation they are dealt with while exuding love as much as they possibly can. In some ways this film is a lesson to all about how to deal with adverse situations. The morality of this film struck me due to the fact that this film lent no easy choices or happy endings. Constantly the characters had to deal with situations regarding right and wrong. Jacob, who loved India, had to make the decision of weather to save the children of the orphanage that he loves, or to live in Denmark, which he despised. J\u00f8rgen had to make the decision to help the orphan children financially and how to protect his family after he has passed away. Anna had to decide weather or not to accept her new father into her life. Helene had to deal with the implications of telling her daughter about Jacob, and also weather or not to tell Anna about Jargons illness. It always seemed that one of these characters was going to be morally corrupt and end up disappointing the audience. But I never felt that way, which surprised me because in the end I sympathized with ever character, apart from the cheating groom Christian. Jacob kept asking J\u00f8rgen, \"Why are you doing this?\", \"What do you get out of this?\", \"What is in this for you?\". Although the audience did not find out until the end of the film that J\u00f8rgen was going to die and that he wanted Jacob in Denmark to take care of his family, he also donated over 12 million dollars to the orphanage. You could sense that J\u00f8rgen was a good person; he was just dealing with dark burdens inside that made him seem insincere. Was it wrong for him to donate the money out of selfish reward? Maybe, however all parties involved benefited and some hope remained for the grieving Danish family and the impoverished Indian orphans. That is always Susanne Biers goal, to implement very intense story lines that deal with many uncomfortable situations, but in the end leaving the audience with hope for the future. Some believe that all of ones emotions can be seen through their eyes. After the Wedding in every single scene includes an extreme close-up of characters eyes at pivotal emotional times. Whether it is that a character is tearing up, concerned, happy, or confused, the close-up camera shots are able to force the audience to feel their emotions. An example that includes all of the main characters is when Anna is making her emotional wedding speech; a close-up of her eyes shows her love towards her parents, as Jargons eyes are beaming at the kind words. Jacobs's eyes are in panic as he figures out that Anna is his child, while Helene's eyes show sorrow, as she knows that everything from that moment on would change. Even the foreshadowing of J\u00f8rgen's death includes the dead fox and deer eyes. This technique, following Bier's interest in Dogme 95, is instrumental in depicting the characters raw emotions as opposed to relying on background special effects. This excellent film will make you think hard about life, as it is universally relatable.",

In the movie, every main character Jacob, Jorgen and Helene made decisions that change or would change his/her life, and also told lies that change or would change the life of people around him/her. The audience probably finds it quite easy to find himself connected to the plot and imagine being at the crossroad. The movie is silent as to whether those lies and decisions are right or wrong, which is good, because similarly, life will never tell you really whether you were right or wrong to have made a particular decision. Underneath all these dramatic twists and turns of plot the main theme seems to be that after whatever happens, family is what you can and should count on. Just as the Indian kid chose not to leave his home at the very end, and that Jacob finally chose to live with his family in Denmark and surrender his career.Good Danish drama knitted by brilliant actors who did a classy job in giving flesh and blood to the interesting plots and scripts. Would have been better if Jacob spoke Indian instead of English in India so as not to make himself a complete odd-man-out who does not seem to have genuine interest in helping poor Indian orphans.",

He is successful, because his plans do work out and because of that he is used to his total regime and nothing but. A brief moment of nervous breakdown of him would theoretically seem logic yet somehow doesn't feel right at that moment for the character he has shown so far. The main moral of the movie is a horrible one, which is: each person is replaceable for another stand-in. Equally horrible is the secondary moral: the lives (inclusive personal relationships, feelings and body of work over long periods of time like 20 years) of people in the first world is way more personal and valuable and therefor to be protected than those of people in the third world, which is so obvious that even those concerned in the third world do agree to it and suggest those kind of solutions. All they ever need is money, if they can get that \"everything is so nice\". The movie is successfully pushing all emotional buttons (inclusive the little big-eyed Mowgli-character full of wisdom), by halftime probably 90% of the audience plans to pack suitcases to start aid-organizations in India, by end of the movie all those imaginary suitcases will be unpacked and put back into their first world attics (and aren't we glad in the end all we have to do really is send a donation and there will be no more problems?), and 100% of the viewers will be in tears (bring tissues along!). However, real life is different and the results of the story for each portrayed person is, thank God, highly unlikely.",

            "content": "Susanne Bier in \"after the wedding\" reveals a deliciously deep and emotional enigma of big impact that attracts the audience from the start, Bier's storytelling technique are in fact engaging.It is the skills of the director to manipulate our emotions as viewers what makes this film so wonderfully unique in my opinion, With the inclusion of a cross-cultural perspective not typically seen in Nordic cinema.A distinctive aspect of the film is the use of raw emotion, a factor rarely seen in this way in Hollywood movies for example, Much of this quality can be attributed to the actors and actresses of the film. Mads Mikkelsen did a great job interpreting Jacob a man who left his orphanage in Copenhagen (which he owned)to meet with a wealthy man named Jorgen, played by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd to receive financial aid for his orphanage situated in one of the poorest regions of India.Jorgen then decides to invite Jacob to his daughter's wedding which takes place the same day at night. While there, the audience discovers a special secret, which turns out to be an emotional bomb for both Jacob and to other members of the wedding.The film really shines in its use of emotion to drive the story. In fact, the most intense moments of the film take place after marriage. Jacob, who previously intended to return to India to participate in the 8th birthday of his adopted son, is faced with the need to make tough decisions ...After the wedding is different from other films because the viewer can connect in an emotionally engaging way. Through its unusual camera work, but mostly through effective and wonderful editing tricks, \"After the Wedding\" becomes a refreshing film with interesting perspectives and with a compelling plot, Susanne Bier produced a wonderful piece. Do not let this movie be a secret, See it. My Vote is 8.Title (Portugal): Not available",

            "content": "The title says it all: the original is better than the Hollywood remake.I totally get why some countries prefer a more localized version in their own languages, and non-native English-speaking countries have been making remakes of Hollywood movies for years, but it still staggers me when I see remakes that fail to improve on the original.In 'After The Wedding', the synchronization of the plot is key to the emotional impact of the movie and if you take away a piece of this jigsaw puzzle then it could jumble up the logic, as in the remake that decides to use a female in the lead role instead of a male. What this original movie relies on is your ability to feel the natural emotions of the father for his newly discovered role as a parent, but also, not necessarily able to understand why events are turning out the way they do, until we get to the twist at the end that makes it logical and plausible. In the remake, which is actually quite well made, the emotion is largely absent because you don't really understand or feel the emotion that the protagonists are supposed to convey through their feelings for each other; for example: the mother had abandoned her daughter after birth, which means that the relationship between them when they find each other after 20 years is already broken instead of being a surprise and a new discovery for both of them. It makes no sense that the daughter wants to immediately connect with the mother instead of feeling angry at her for being abandoned all those years ago, which is not what happens in the original - there is no abandonment, but instead feelings of wonder, mild embarrassment and shame after discovering each other. None of it makes sense in the remake in the way it feels so natural in the original. The daughter is betrayed by her husband in the original movie, but in the remake simply reveals that she no longer wants to be married, another emotional letdown that makes for poor drama and unnecessarily twists the original plot.If you're thinking about watching this movie, rest assured it's worth it based on the fact that Hollywood decided to remake it with a weirdly skewered plot as perhaps some type of modernist or feminist version with lead female actors and submissive males, it's an odd decision to comprehend, or just that people have to make everything their own instead of directing a clear translation of something that requires no major overhauls.As a case study, it's worth watching both, but the original (this version) is much more satisfying, realistic, emotional and tense.",

Getting a call from Denmark, Jacob discovers a wealthy business man is, for some reason, interested in making a large donation to the orphanage. The businessman, Jorgen, wants to personally met Jacob and insists he come to Denmark to meet and discuss funding the orphanage.Upon Jacob's return to his homeland, he discovers just how small this world can be.While in Denmark, Jacob attends the wedding of Jorgen's daughter, Anna, and is shocked to discover Jorgen's wife is Jacob's ex-lover, Helene. The next week spirals out of control as Jacob, Jorgen, Helene, and Anna learn dark secrets about themselves, each other, the past and the present. Everyone has secrets but the characters of After the Wedding are rocked as one secret after another unveils itself in the two hour film. Jacob is shocked when he finds out Jorgen is married to his ex-lover Helen. Because Jorgen called Jacob and his orphanage out of the blue, Jacob can't help but to wonder if Jorgen's real purpose for calling Jacob to Denmark was to expose Jacob to Helene's new life. Helene confronts Jorgen and demands to know why he \"did this to her\" by inviting Jacob to the wedding. Jorgen claims he didn't know Jacob was that Jacob. To Helene, Jacob and audiences it seems unlikely Jorgen was truly unaware of who he was bringing to the wedding. This is the first of a series of events that starts to portray Jorgen as manipulative and controlling. While Jacob is at the wedding and gets his first glimpse of the bride, Anna, he can't help but to notice her age. Anna's wedding speech reveals that on her 18th birthday she was shocked to learn that her parents had kept a secret...Jorgen was not her real father. Upon hearing this, the wheels in Jacob's head starts turning and he can't but help to think it's just too much of a coincidence. After confronting Helen, Jacob is shocked to hear he is Anna's real father. Again, Helen and Jacob can't help but to wonder why Jorgen insisted on bringing Jacob to Denmark, the wedding and what is true intentions are.What's more important about these secrets is the aftermath of their exposure. Jacob goes to Helene and demands to know why she didn't tell him she was pregnant. They discuss the past and what could have happened if they had been honest with each other. Jacob would have come home and taken care of his daughter. What would life have looked like? Would they be happy? Are they happy now? At the start of the film Helene, Anna and Jacob appear happy with their lives. Jacob works hard to make at the orphanage and is passionate about making life better for the children. Jorgen and Helene have a playful, intimate moment together and Anna is glowing with happiness as she prepares for her wedding. After these secrets are exposed, however, we see Jacob struggle with the life he missed out on, Jorgen's aggression towards his wife and Christian's (Anna's new husband) fascination not with Anna, but Jorgen. While the family is working to dissect, understand and heal from the newly exposed truths, we find the characters dealing with addictions as well. At several points during the film, Jacob's past is mentioned; including his past alcohol use, drug use and frequent unfaithfulness. Helene describes Jacobs as drunk and on drugs all the time and will f*&^ anything that moves. We often see Jacob with cigarette in hand and a drink, but never have the substances caused him to lose control of his behavior or inhibit him in anyway. We can see that Jacob has learned to deal with addictions and to curb his desires to healthy levels. Jorgen is also frequently seen with a drink in hand. He, however, cannot control his desires and often drinks himself into a rage. His rage causes him to embarrass himself in public and to become verbally abusive to his wife. Even Jorgen's mother, a minor character, shows she is struggling with addiction. Her few and brief appearances have to do with how much she is losing or winning in on-line poker.Even though her role is limited, it is clear she is struggling with a gambling addiction. Though it's not the case in After the Wedding,secrets and addictions are closely linked together. People with addictions generally work hard to keep their addictions a secret. Those who have dark secrets can become addicted to them and find themselves consumed and obsessed by the secret they hold. After the Wedding is an immensely complex film with so many deep messages and themes. Although it's a complex film, the excellent writing make the film feel effortless and allows the story to flow and fall into place. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants insight on addictions,secrets, healing, motivation and human responsibility.",

            "review_title": "Acting quality and drama save this film from soapy plot",
            "content": "Efter brylluppet (After the Wedding) was directed by Susanne Bier who had directed Br\u00f8dre (Brothers) two years earlier and would go on to direct the Academy Award-winning H\u00e6vnen (In a Better World). After the Wedding is all about human beings reacting to the dramatic circumstances around them. If that sounds like 99% of all films ever made, you're probably right, but as with many other Danish films, there is a certain affinity with human drama and 'realism' present here that can often found to be lacking in Hollywood dramas. Here, it definitely ups the relatable human drama factor, but can also occasionally make the film feel a bit like watching a soap opera.After the Wedding is centered on a number of characters. Indeed, there is no real main character which is a strength of the film, but also a weakness. We begin in an orphanage in India where Jacob (played by the ever understated Mads Mikkelsen) works. He works hard to care for the children there and has a particularly close friendship with Pramod. However, there are money troubles. Then, out of nowhere, he is told that a company in Denmark is willing to provide him a donation if he is willing to close the deal himself in Denmark personally. This annoys Jacob as he dislikes the all too comfortable Western way of life. He agrees however, thinking he'll be back in India before he knows it. He says goodbye to Pramod, goes to Denmark only to find out that the CEO, J\u00f8rgen, is still on the fence whether he'll donate the money or not. This surprises Jacob. J\u00f8rgen however invites him to his daughter's wedding as if nothing's wrong. There he discovers in a tense scene that J\u00f8rgen's daughter might be his. He thus realizes he was brought here on purpose by J\u00f8rgen and his wife, Helene (who is also Jacob's former girlfriend), to reunite him with his daughter. This triggers an array of wonderfully dramatic confrontations where, among other things, Jacob must decide whether to stay with his 'real' family in Denmark \u2013 even though he's never spoken to his daughter \u2013 or return to Pramod in India with whom he is so close he might as well be family. The film is thus basically interested in the definition of family. The scenes where the daughter is torn between her strange, newfound feelings for her 'real' father and her long-established feelings for the 'father' she's known all her life are good examples of how After the Wedding explores this theme.Like I said, the main appeal of this film are the scenes where two or more characters talk with or confront each other. There is one between J\u00f8rgen and his 'daughter', one between Jacob and Helene, etc. These scenes where seemingly 'real' characters react to one another feel very real and intense and it is these scenes that form the core of the film and the main reason why you should watch it. That said, it's precisely these scenes that \u2013 despite the acting quality displayed by the cast \u2013 can make the film feel like a soap opera, one melodramatic scene after the other. One scene in particular featuring J\u00f8rgen suffers from this.I also had some problems plot-wise. Spoilers ahead. Because Jacob goes to Denmark and becomes increasingly conflicted whether or not he should stay in Denmark or go back to India and Pramod, I got the impression that whatever decision he makes will have major consequences as to how other characters will think of him. How would his daughter feel if he went back to India? Also, staying in Denmark would devastate Pramod. This, combined with the film's penchant for drama, made me believe tragedy would be in store for me. In the end, however, this is all resolved surprisingly easy, so much so that it makes me wonder if the film laid enough of the groundwork that it deserves its 'happy ending'. Jacob stays in Demark and with the help of J\u00f8rgen's money financially supports his orphanage in India where he meets Pramod again. Jacob invites him to live with him in Denmark, but Pramod refuses since Jacob used to rail against the easy, Westernized way of life. And then, the film ends\u0085.what? This brings me back to how the film can sometimes feel like a soap opera. Yes, there are wonderful and satisfying dramatic scenes, but in the end, what's the point the film is trying to get across? To show that one's 'real' family (your own blood) is more important in one's life than one's other 'family' (Pramod)? Pramod reminding Jacob of his old ways of thinking seems to suggest a political, Anti-Western point of view, but the rest of the film doesn't support this. Questions, questions\u0085 The anti-climax doesn't help matters either. In the end, the film can feel like merely a collection of dramatic scenes that resolve themselves in the end without a lot of collateral damage. Then again, when the drama is as involving as seen here, these criticisms can easily be cast aside.",

            "content": "Covering the full spectrum of human emotions, After the Wedding is an intense film about rebirth, lost love, and mortality. The film is thought provoking through its explorations of power, greed, and charity. Not only that, but the film's style creates an instantly relatable experience for the viewer to connect to at least one of the characters in the film. Power is perhaps the strongest element in the film. We follow the successful businessman Jorgen as he attempts to make a decision about donating to a charity. What we initially view as an act of altruism soon shows the ulterior motives behind choosing this particular charity. The man running the charity, Jacob, is his wife's ex lover and his stepdaughter's real father. His motives are made clear when he reveals that he is dying and wants Jacob to care for his family after he is gone. Thus Jorgen delivers an ultimatum; in order for him to fund Jacob's charity, Jacob must stay in Denmark.This creates a powerful image of helplessness in the film. Jorgen, a man who has everything, is completely helpless when faced with death. He pleads to Jacob to help him care for his family when he is gone. What is interesting here is the choice of charity that Jacob makes. He is focused on helping those less fortunate at his orphanage, but should he turn his back on someone just because they are rich? The film reaches its climax when Jorgen confronts Jacob and asks him if he needs to be halfway around the world to get his help. We also see Jorgen as a very powerful character early on, but it is soon revealed that he is too weak to confront his impending mortality. So instead of telling everyone outright that he is about to die, he hides is illness for as long as possible. This adds to the human nature of the character as no matter how rich and powerful he is, he is still human and all humans are afraid of mortality. On the flip side of the decision, we have Jacob who needs to make a decision about selling out. He knows he can do more good by being at his orphanage then being in Denmark, however, he also needs Jorgen's money in order to keep the orphanage operational. What this creates then is an intense internal struggle that we can all relate to. Money talks, and no matter how deep your convictions are, if you need money, those with the money have the power. So just as Jorgen feels helpless caring for his family, Jacob feels helpless caring for his own \"family\" back at the orphanage. Jacob also has to make another important decision. In his past life in Denmark he has left behind a daughter, who he never knew. So his decision of whether to stay in Denmark is clouded as he must make the decision to stay and care for his own flesh and blood or travel back and try to help those he has no relation to. His daughter is well off but the emotional impact of learning of her father shows in the film. Is emotional well being of his daughter just as important as physical well being of the kids in the orphanage?Another crucial aspect of the film is Jacob's rebirth. When we first meet Jacob he is portrayed as entirely selfless with only the thoughts of helping the children on his mind. But on his return to Demark, we find out he has a dark past of substance abuse and adultery. This adds a powerful layer to Jacob's character. What was the true purpose of going to a far off land to help the less fortunate? Was he truly altruistic or simply running away. We can see from the film that he hasn't dealt with the issues of his past life until his return to Denmark. The overall style of the film also adds to its humanist qualities. A very slow film at first but as the film progresses we peel off the outer layers of each of the characters to reveal the chaos of their emotions. The film is straightforward and avoids the use of any post-production special effects. What we are left with is a very human story. The acting itself feels very personal as you are peering into these people's lives and viewing them at their most intimate moments. The film excels at exploring each character's depth of emotions as they have to make some of the most important decisions of their lives. The film was quite enjoyable. It allows us an intimate glimpse into the world of four characters that are as multidimensional as anyone who we would encounter in real life. My only complaint of the film would be its pacing as it is much too slow in the first hour of the film, but once the drama climaxes, pacing is no longer an issue. As a whole, I would recommend this film",

This is a rare movie with sympathetic wealhty characters, which makes it a bit more interesting.The movie itself is good, not great.

            "content": "Movies that are plain bad can't hide this for longer than ten minutes. This movie it took longer, which shows that it has good sides as well. The premise is introduced well enough and it wasn't until a long way in the first hour that I first suspected something was going wrong. From that point on, it was like a large pudding that steadily but hopelessly collapsed. In the mean time, the odd good scene restored hope for a brief moment. Jacob (Mikkelsen) was alright, and so were most of the other actors, but actors couldn't save the movie.Sad thing that in the end I couldn't feel along with the characters (even the little orphan boy). And believe me, I am not immune to manipulation of emotions and I am very willing to surrender to even some good tear jerking.The flaw of the plot is that at a certain point, we are expected to view a certain character in a different light. But this unexpected turn simply does not work on an emotional level. We no longer believe the character and cannot feel along with him/her. Hiding and revealing crucial information certainly is an essential narrative tool in crime stories/detective-like plots. However, we are dealing here with drama/tragedy. In this genre one wants the viewer to feel along with the dilemma's of the protagonist and antagonist. And this is not the same as to merely make the viewer understand - in retrospect - a character's behavior. It is too late for emotional involvement at that stage and we shrug our shoulders.And by the way, close-ups are nice, but the 31st time I saw Mikkelsens mouth or Stine Fischer Christensen's eyes screen wide, it got a little boring.",

Bier's film starts as a common controversy between restrained idealism (excellently represented by Mads Mikkelsen) and the mephistoic-friendly super-capitalism which seems to confirm the squalor of our modern profit-oriented society and then, in the second part, escalates to the personal tragedy of doomed J\u00f6rgen (performed with an impressive physical presence by Rolf Lassagard) who uses his wealth to secure his family and whose parvenuish manner shows true desperation. There are some extreme-extremely emotional moments, such as the last scene of J\u00f6rgen and his wife in the bedroom (it felt like a dagger slowly piercing through my chest) or Anna's heartbreaking reaction to J\u00f6rgen's confession. Now, when I think about it, it's a perfect companion to the film above.",
