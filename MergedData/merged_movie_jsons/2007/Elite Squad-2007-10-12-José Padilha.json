            "content": "In 1997, before the visit of the pope to Rio de Janeiro, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) from the elite squad BOPE (Special Police Operation Battalion) is assigned to eliminate the risks of the drug dealers in a dangerous slum nearby where the pope intends to be lodged. Captain Nascimento is trying to find a man to replace him because his wife is pregnant and he intends to quit the command and become a trainer of the new recruits. Meanwhile, the two idealistic friends Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) join the Military Police force expecting to become honest policemen and fight the criminals. However, they see only corruption, lack of competence and efficiency, manipulation of data and stupid bureaucracy in the Military Police, and after a serious incident in the Morro da Babil\u00f4nia, they decide to join the BOPE. The lives of Capitain Nascimento, Neto and Matias are entwined along the next months, first in the tough training period and then in action against drug dealers. Nascimento believes that Neto could be his substitute, but his impulsive attitudes jeopardize his choice. Later, the intelligent Matias seems to be the correct choice, but he needs to prove that he has heart.\"Tropa de Elite\" is the most impressive and realistic movie I have ever seen about the police forces in Rio de Janeiro and the role of the society in Brazil. In a city surrounded by more than seven hundred slums, actually lands without law and ruled by drug lords, this movie depicts the corruption of dirty policemen, the incorrect behavior of part of the society and the importance of the BOPE, a team of well trained men that can be compared to the American SWAT. The narrative in off of Captain Nascimento follows his saga, showing an obstinate man divided between his professionalism and love for his career and his family; Neto, an impulsive and honest military policeman, but not smart to be a leader; and Matias, who is studying in law school and is very intelligent and also honest, but is not totally committed with his responsibilities of policeman. The story is so realistic that seems to be a documentary with scenes very well choreographed. The direction of Jos\u00e9 Padilha is simply outstanding, using a magnificent screenplay and excellent actors and actresses. In an inevitable comparison with \"Cidade de Deus\" (\"City of God\"), these movies complement each other. \"Cidade de Deus\" discloses the lives of criminals, and \"Tropa de Elite\" of policemen and part of the society. This movie should be nominated to the Oscar, but unfortunately what the Academy usually selects does not correspond to the best of the cinema. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Tropa de Elite\" (\"Elite Squad\")Obs: (a) On 29 September 2007, I saw this outstanding movie again with a group of friends and family. (b) \"Tropa de Elite\" was awarded with the Golden Bear of the Berlin Festival on 16 February 2008.(c) The DVD is scheduled to be released on 28 February 2008.(d) Many expressions used in this movie (\"Aspira\" (\"Ensign\"), \"Bota no Saco\" (\"Put in the Plastic Bag\"), \"Pede Para Sair\" (\"Ask to Get Out\"), \"Voc\u00ea \u00e9 Moleque N\u00e3o \u00e9 Caveira\" (\"You Are a Kid, not a Skull\") etc.) have been incorporated in Brazilian Popular Culture.(e) \"Bota no Saco\" (\"Put in the Plastic Bag\") the Brazilian Commission that has not selected this movie to dispute a nomination to the Oscar in the Best Foreign Language category.",

            "content": "ELITE SQUAD is another top-notch Brazilian thriller following in the footsteps of CITY OF GOD (the two films share a writer, I believe). Although the storyline is completely different, the two films share plenty of stylistic similarities: the gritty, on-the-streets style filming, the realism, the multi-layered storytelling, the realistic and sympathetic characters, the hectic pace.Needless to say that this is an excellent film that offers a thorough exploration of policing in Brazil and all of the violence and corruption that comes with it. ELITE SQUAD does tackle the menace of drug gangs and the like but that's not the sole focus here; instead we learn of the everyday corruption present in all aspects of the police force. The dialogue crackles with electricity and the performances are exemplary, particularly from Andre Ramiro, who plays my favourite character, a naive law student drawn into a dark and murky world.Fizzing with energy and loaded with brutal violence, ELITE SQUAD is as good as it gets for a contemporary thriller and it's also one of those films that educates as well as entertains. Be warned, it pulls no punches. A sequel, ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN follows, and inevitably I have to track it down.",

This movie is just insanely good.If you live in a developed country you'll probably think this is just another thriller. For anyone living in a 3rd country it's way more than that: it's a brutal picture of our degradation and corruption, a revelation that runs over you like a truck.The most striking aspect about the movie is how clearly it shows how everyone is at the same time guilty and victim in the whole war against drugs: the do-gooders NGOs, the politicians, the corrupt police and the not-corrupt but truculent \"Elite Squad\". It shows it precisely but with sense of humor and very smartly. In this war, everyone that proclaim to have moral and values is actually hiding skeletons in the closet. It's all a story of gangsters against gangsters in a degraded society.",

            "content": "Having seen \"Cidade de Deus\" and thoroughly enjoyed it (though it is a grim tale), I was at first having high hopes for \"Tropa de Elite\". Then I thought that it could never reach the same high standards, and my hopes were lowered a great deal.About 3 months ago I happened to see about 15 minutes of the movie, and that lowered my hopes even more. How wrong I was to judge such a great movie on what must have been an unfortunate 15 minutes.I won't go into detail about the story, but it is both believable and compelling. Like \"Cidade...\" this is no fairy tale. It's the world as it is. No more, no less. Of course, there might not be that many guns blazing in reality, but I'd reckon this isn't very far off.We feel the pain, the lack of morale and the despair and hopelessness. Photography is spot on, the acting is both fantastic and realistic. \"Tropa de Elite\" never went into the big theaters here in Denmark which is rather unfortunate, since it's a true gem. Instead we get loads of mainstream crap. Not to sound arrogant, I watch loads of mainstream movies too (voluntarily, even), but it's movies like this that made me love movies as fondly as I do.Do yourself a favour. Get this on DVD. See it. Feel the pain. Immerge yourself in the desperate world. Then, after it's all over, enjoy your life, a life that will seem much, much brighter after this.",

            "content": "Tropa de Elite is an amazingly good film; by turns brutally real and horrifyingly hilarious.It claims to be based on a true story and I find that sadly believable. The main plot revolves around the captain of an elite police unit trying to find a replacement for himself, while dealing with the birth of his child and the horrendous stress of his job, and a mission to clear out a dangerously violent slum.There are no wholly good people in the movie, and it's frighteningly easy to compare some of what goes on to things happening in the USA (and other places) today. That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket. Not for the weak of stomach, and you may find yourself greatly disagreeing with the ideals of various groups portrayed (which I believe is part of the point), but I would be enormously surprised if this movie doesn't make you think and give you something to talk about.",

            "content": "\"Tropa de Elite\" isn't merely one more Brazilian film on urban violence; it's a cathartic socio-cultural phenomenon of almost unprecedented proportions in Brazil, the omnipresent theme on TV talk shows, newspapers articles, bars and dinner tables. Prior to its theatrical release this October, \"Tropa\" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was \"2 Filhos de Francisco\" with 5,5 million tickets sold).The reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since \"City of God\" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the \"unorthodox\" methods used by BOPE (the self-called \"incorruptible\" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. Director Jos\u00e9 Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary \"Bus 174\", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In \"Tropa\", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.Nascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and \"truth-puker\". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent, revenge-based, lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.\"There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people\", used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s, and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at \"humanizing\" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! All the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical \"narrator/observer\" (like Buscap\u00e9/Rocket in \"City of God\") is the idealist, Foucault-reading aspiring police officer Mathias (though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school). But Mathias, too, is finally co-opted by the brainwashing \"Full-Metal-Jacket\"-like BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.Padilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster, and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a \"hero\" and BOPE as a \"model\" institution have caught him by surprise -- oh, really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic, naive or silly: everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over (and co- writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed, stating the \"Tropa\" is clearly pro-BOPE). The graphic, sadistic scenes of torture -- supposedly meant to inspire disgust -- make the delight of a large vigilante-minded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary, scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling: we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson, Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cult-following, with BOPE's logo (a skull pierced by pistols and knives) reproduced on t-shirts and underwear, BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored \"glory\", and young kids (from all social classes) mimicking the film's \"bag-in-the-head torture\" as a new bullying style. Militarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film; militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue (legalization is not even mentioned as an option). Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multi-fingered interconnections, the zillion-dollar, highly organized international business involving farmers, money-washing executives, chemistry labs, gun-runners, bankers, politicians, accountants, lawyers, transport systems, etc. Nor in showing the real victims: the majority of the favela inhabitants, who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules, mere \"extras\" whose fate (in movies and in real life) is to be used, humiliated, segregated or, worse, wounded/killed by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. \"Tropa\" is a must-see film, but it's misleading and entrapping: by opting for an \"open\", \"what would YOU do?\" ending (probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of \"Paradise Now\"), the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very, VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of. \"Tropa\" is cinematically dazzling, but so physically and ideologically nauseating you'll need an antidote -- be sure to also watch the faceted, influential documentary \"Not\u00edcias de uma Guerra Particular\" and be aware of many other angles to a terrible reality that plagues not only Rio, but most of Third World's chaotic, no-man's-land, way out-of- control big cities.",

            "content": "Remember Cidade de Deus (City of God)? Well I think that if you saw at least one time that 2002 film, is for sure that you remember it so here is a new film that works on the same level, comes and is about the same place, of course, and that you will never forget. With this sort of introduction you may think that Tropa de Elite is another Cidade de Deus but now from the side of the police and in a way you will be right but at the same time you will not because Tropa de Elite tells a story that involves and shows different points of views, acts and, the most important thing, how different parts of the society works in a delicate but real problem in Brasil. That story has in Capit\u00e3o Nascimento (Wagner Moura) our narrator and the experimented one who knows how everything works in the criminal side of Rio and who works in the BOPE (Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais), the elite group of the Military Police. The situation in the film is the visit of the pope Juan Pablo II to Rio in 1997 and we are going the story before this visit through the eyes of different parts of the society: the police, the drug dealers and people from the favelas, part of the high class young and of course the BOPE. The friends Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Andr\u00e9 (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) are the other important characters in our story. They are new in the business and because of their honesty soon they will understand how everything works inside the police and how they will end fighting not only against criminals but against the entire police system where everybody steals from anywhere. With Andr\u00e9 a part of high class young will enter to the story, when he start to study at one of the best universities of Rio, but of course first they don't know who is really Andr\u00e9 so they can act in their regular way when the party time begins or when they visit the favelas in order to satisfy their addiction and their own drug business. Now you can suppose how this can end, with corrupt cops making business with drug dealers and two honest cops trying to stop that and without real hopes. Here is when the BOPE enters, the elite that is respected by the drug dealers and the one that the police goes when they can't deal with a situation inside the favelas, which is always. And here we have a fantastic character study with our narrator. The situation is that he is going to be father and his beloved retirement of the BOPE is near but only if he can find a perfect substitute. Apart of this we have the terrific and probably realistic view to the BOPE itself, showing the impressive training in order to be a Skull and their philosophy that confirms that the BOPE is only for honest people with real skills and desires to end with the crime so weak and corrupt cops MUST and will stay outside. Well the great story makes me write more about it than any other thing but is easy to describe the rest because is perfect: the setting, the impressive camera work (I believe that some scenes are stronger than any of Cidade de Deus), the direction, the research (although the film is based on the book Elite de Tropa) and of course the powerful and, for me, unknown cast (in Mexico the Cinema of Brasil, as any other except the one from Hollywood, is difficult to see on theaters or to get on DVD so personally and sadly this is only the second film from Brasil that I have seen but hell I love both a lot). Conclusion: Tropa de Elite won the Golden Bear (the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival 2008) and even I'm not the kind of viewer who cares about prizes, that sometimes are unfair, I do know how an important prize help in the distribution of a film but is true that if a film won at the most famous festivals (Venice, Berlin, Cannes, Toronto, etc) but is not at the Oscars (the case of Tropa de Elite) that film will not have any or the same attention in Mexico and of course in the US. So knowing that is very difficult to see a film from Brasil on theaters and knowing the amazing quality of Tropa de Elite, is a shame that is not having a response in my country and is far of the popularity of Cidade de Deus back in 2003. Anyway, the only thing that really matters is the fact that Tropa de Elite is by far the best film on theaters right now (in Mexico City), the best film that I have seen recently and probably the very best that I have seen this year. So this film is the film to catch this year when it arrives to your city. A MAGNIFICENT PICTURE!",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Elite Squad",
            "content": "I just love a good ol cops and robbers movie, and Elite Squad shows that it indeed is a generous cut above the rest, and along the way had snagged the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. If you're in for some gritty looking no holds barred movie that reflects the dangerous occupation of honest cops making a living in what's technically a war zone with the criminals, then look no further than this movie.The movie works itself on many levels, having its narrative flow giving equal opportunity to each of its subject matter. On the surface, it looks very much like Hollywood's SWAT, but only much better, with its induction and training program where rookies get groomed from the mediocre to the cream of the crop in their attempts to join the BOPE, and on another level it tells of the friendship between two newcomers to the police force, where they're face with 3 options in an organization where corruption Is rampant \u0096 join in, turn a blind eye, or wage war. An additional level which held the movie throughout its different subplots is that of the headache when it comes to management succession.When you're doing a good job, you find it difficult to either let go, or if you've come to terms with the inevitable of leaving the job that you like, finding someone appropriate to take over. It's like a father who intrinsically almost always disapproves of their daughter's boyfriends. Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) has this dilemma, being the leader of the crack Alpha team, he found that for the good of his family he has to leave the highly dangerous job where death is just around the corner each time they go on their missions. But in order to do so, and to ensure his men have someone able and competent to step up and replace him, he has to find new blood.Thus the story of two rookies, Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Andre Matias (Andre Ramiro), who are best of friends, but whose characters are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Neto's a hothead and acts on impulse, qualities not befitting of team players, but you cannot discount his courage. Andre's a lot more calculative and restraint, but in dwelling too much on decision making, might not be able to act decisively. These were the two options best left for Nascimento, given the rest are either corrupt or inept to have made it through the tough training.Between Neto and Andre, the latter has a lot more pathos crafted into his character, such as his ambition in being a lawyer after his uniformed stint, and this character was also based loosely on the consultant for the movie. What I particularly liked his character was how he subconsciously turned into the stereotypical view the citizens have of the cops \u0096 of being violent, unreasonable and corrupt, that save for the latter, he unwittingly becomes transformed into that mold, a disillusioned turn against his idealistic viewpoint of what a cop stands for, of becoming one of many misunderstood, honest cops.The BOPE are no angels, and are quite heavy handed in their ways, though one could also argue that extreme methods and operations are totally justifiable when in a \"war zone\" dealing with criminals armed to the teeth who have no hesitation to shoot first and to kill. Simon Yam might have left a memorable impression with his repetitive bitch slapping of a gangster at an arcade in PTU, but here, such slapping gets ten times worse with the hairdryer effect too. The BOPE officers knows no gentle negotiation techniques, with arsenals such as the use of deadly force, interrogation through the use of incessant slaps and the plastic bag for suffocation, and if the suspect still doesn't crack, there's still the good old broomstick shoved into the rear.Action junkies would find that Elite Squad has no lack of set action pieces, though you might find yourself clamouring for more. These guys are highly trained and bears no qualms in exercising deadly force with no remorse, and when their skull end knives emblem comes rolling around, criminals flee in fear. Given that this is set in the gritty streets of Rio de Janeiro, the shaky cam seems impossible not to be utilized, so if you're those who feel nauseous at the erratic movement of the camera, you might want to take the necessary precautions.For me, it's not often always to have a movie like this work on all fronts, from acting to action to a tightly designed and layered narrative. If I were to recommend a movie about cops, then Elite Squad would join the ranks of personal favourites like PTU and Heat. Highly recommended!",

The photography is stunning and the action is extreme and realistic. You have to see this movie more than once because there is so much going in terms of plot and action that you might miss it. The story is well put together and the acting is as good as any, but what I liked the most was the sense of dread BOPE was able to inflict on the minds of criminals and corrupt cops.

Checking for non-Horror LA titles, I spotted a 2007 Brazilian Action Thriller I had picked up years ago,but never got round to seeing! Finding a best films of 2007 about to take place on ICM,I felt it was the perfect time to at last join the squad.View on the film:For his first non-documentary title, co-writer/(with Braulio Mantovani and Rodrigo Pimentel) director Jose Padilha retains the rawness of documentary, by closely working with cinematographer Lula Carvalho to stylishly grind saturated colours over the blunt-force actions of BOPE and the gangs. Having to get the cops involved when a van with 90 firearms (30 real and 60 prop guns) were stolen from the set, the intensity off-screen feeds into the outstandingly ferocious atmosphere on screen.Tracking BOPE down each drug lord-run slum, Padilha weaves fluid, shaking camera moves up close and personal to each cop, with the lone times Padilha holds the camera from flinching being the ruthless action scenes, which are stripped of stylisation in exchange for horrific, short blunt shootings and beatings, burning with over saturated red.Basing BOPE members Matias & Nascimento on their own time in BOPE, Padilha,Pimentel & Mantovani's adaptation of the novel by Andre Batista,Pimentel and Soares, the writers dissect the layers of ritual and corruption around the gangs and BOPE with a matter of fact documentary manner, taking the idealized wide-eyes of the potential new recruits, and choking them out with the entangled balance of force and back handers balancing control of the slums held by BOPE and the gangs.Adding Nascimento's narration (a terrific, gruff Wagner Moura) at the last minute, the writers superbly use the narration to enter the group-think militarism of BOPE, where the humanity of each member turns into a dim light as they each become a killing machine for a elite squad.",

            "review_title": "...Brilliantly fleshed out characters lifts the film from being trite after the 1000th gunshot.",
            "content": "Kinetically filmed, \"Tropa de Elite\" reaches the dizzying heights of Fernando Meirelles' \"Cidade de Deus\", as not so much as a photocopy but more as a cinematic twin brother. Film focuses on the brutal, abet necessary foundations of Tropa de Elite, a one hundred strong company of men who swings into action when normal police gets held up themselves. Intense amount of corruption and violence is present here, however brilliantly fleshed out characters lifts the film from being trite after the 1000th gunshot.The film being presented in two parts, we are indulged into an extended prologue to get acquainted with the protagonists: Captain Nascimento, feeling the stress as a 0-1, is on the lookout for a substitute between Andr\u00e9 Matias, a law student cum policeman struggling with his own identity and Neto, the ideal candidate as his replacement who's violent and relentless to a fault. Accompanied by a sometimes distracting voice over, the audience is given proper time to find themselves immersed in the narrative and characters. Even if the film's screenplay explodes every second of its almost 2-hour running time, personality development is not left on the back seat, to much relief.Andre Ramiro's performance as Andr\u00e9 Matias is pitch perfect. Practically the film's moral backbone, he elucidates the distinction between pretending to know and knowing. The best scenes in the picture not involves scenes of brazen violent explosions but his rationalizing and character driven moments. The film uses his character to deter the judgmental audience from pretending to know but reminds them they know nothing.Padilha is in control of the film until its very last shot; able to summon his own elite squad of cinematographers and sound technicians. The production values are top notch indeed, as the cinema also explodes with every bang and boom. Filmed in cinema verite, it gathers up inspiration from previous war-themed films \u0096 from the tones and hues of the mentioned \"Cidade de Deus\" to Alfonso Cuaron's blood splatter on the screen technique from \"Children of Men\". With the sound and images pushing the audience to its nauseating edge, full immersion is delivered without breaking a sweat.Comparison to \"Cidade de Deus\" should be complementary, as \"Elite\" tackles the impotent depiction of policemen by the former. In fact, it acts as its contemporary, acting as if it exists on the same universe. It demands merit in its own right though, as the film is well staged like its depiction of training the elite, making it an involving exercise, not seen since Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\".Immersive, hypnotic and engaging, \"Tropa de Elite\" guarantees Padilha to be noticed on a more mainstream circuit. Previously delivering \"Onibus 174\", also tackling the same themes of nurture and consequence as a catalyst to violence, he is able to comment on sensitive themes without being too preachy and also able to wrap it in a well produced package. Film is definitely an above average fare and is essential to be experienced on the big screen, just for its sound design alone.",

The cast is great and the cinematography is excellent. Caio Junqueira and Andr\u00e9 Ramiro are great in the roles of Neto and Matias.Andr\u00e9 Ramiro is excellent in the role of Matias, his character development is particularly interesting.The training was presented as particularly brutal and one of its purposes is to eradicate the corrupt and weak at the start.

This story has emotion, feelings, twists, action, romance and even comedy for those who understand Portuguese I would say \"Bota ai na conta do Papa\" is a real funny statement. One of the things I loved about this movie was the acting, where Wagner Moura does one hell of a job, as a Captain trying to find a substitute so he can leave his job and be with his family. I wouldn't say I'm surprised because Brazilians are great actors, but still, I loved it.In conclusion, if you like action, and like City of God, then you should definitely watch this movie.",

Although an admittedly reactionary and authoritarian BOPE member, Captain Nascimento, narrates it, the film's primary criticisms are regarding low pay for police, systemic corruption, and, the middle class's irresponsible consumption of drugs.

Cinema at it's best. Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani, from City of God, wrote the screenplay and Daniel Rezend, also from CDD, is the editor (Both nominated to the Oscar).Above, one article about the film: \"WASHINGTON (Reuters Life!) characters lie dead in the street within minutes of the opening of Brazilian director Jose Padilha's new film which he hopes will shed new light on gang violence and police corruption in his country.\"Elite Squad,\" which Padilha wrote with former Rio police officer Rodrigo Pimentel, follows two young Rio de Janeiro police officers as their fantasy of implementing law and order disintegrates into bloodshed and corruption.It details night raids through the makeshift homes of the city's hillside slums known as favelas, as well as the stark class differences that feed an appetite for riches among many of its poor residents.Padilha, 39, said he had originally hoped to use the information he received from Pimentel for a documentary but quickly realized that it would not be feasible.\"How would I do this, go to corrupt cops with cameras?\" he asks. \"If I tried to make this film as a documentary, it would probably get me killed.\" Padilha, whose highly-acclaimed debut film \"Bus 174\" about a real-life bus hijacking in Rio was released in 2002, has strived to make the film as realistic as possible, shooting much of the film on the favelas' narrow streets.\"Elite Squad\" is based on Pimentel's account of his tenure as captain of Rio's elite police force which has come under attack by Amnesty International for brutality.Like \"Bus 174,\" it exposes the darker elements of Brazil that contrast vividly with the nation's colorful, extravagant Carnival celebrations.\"",

Written by the same screenwriter, the Oscar-nominated Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani, this movie shows the seedy side of Rio de Janeiro from the cops' point of view, particularly BOPE, an elite squad created to intervene when regular cops can't cut it. Basically trained soldiers acting as policemen, they're methodical and ruthless, but apparently also the only ones really committed to cleaning up the streets. The rest of the police force are jut happy taking bribes and helping criminals whenever they can.The movie follows Captain Nascimento's search for a replacement. He's had too much, has a pregnant wife and the horrors of his work are making him crazy. Wagner Moura is a revelation here. The reach of his performance will probably be lost on non-Brazilian or non-Portuguese viewers who've never seen him on dreadful soap operas. One look at the hardened, melancholy, weary face of Nascimento and you'd never believe this actor plays romantic leads for a living. Nascimento is not a nice man, he doesn't like the choices he has to make to do his job.So he finds a way out on two new recruits, Neto and Matias, two disillusioned regular cops wishing to have a more active role in fighting crime. Matias is a brilliant young man, studying to become a lawyer, whereas the thick-headed Neto has more guts and skills with a rifle than most people. Seeing the corruption within the department, they're quickly seduced by BOPE.Although not as a graphic and technically impressive as City of God, this is still a pretty amazing movie. It's more conventional, more straightforward, but with a vision of Brazilian society as unflinching as Meirelles' masterpiece. The director, Jos\u00e9 Padilha, tackles touchy subjects here, from police corruption to police brutality to the role society has in funding drug business. It's an unpleasant movie, but most good movies tend to be.",

Wagner Moura (\"God Is Brazilian\"), one of the most versatile Brazilian actors of his generation, delivers a bravura performance as Captain Nascimento, who wants to quit his job in order to dedicate himself to his newly-born son, but has an important mission before that: finding the right replacement. \"Elite Squad\" is not as stylized or visually compelling as Fernando Meirelles/K\u00e1tia Lund's \"City of God\" (the comparison is inevitable), but that's not a flaw. The movie is violent but realistic, far from sheer Hollywood gore-fest (i.e. Scorsese's over-hyped \"The Departed\"), and offers some extremely provocative discussions about Brazil's social chaos - and also a disarmingly blunt, love it or hate it narration. Surprise winner of the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival (competing with other strong titles, including Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant \"There Will Be Blood\"), \"Elite Squad\" is a must-see. 10/10.",

Despite all of the frenesi it's causing all around, it has a good storyline, excellent screenplay and a brilliant performance from all the cast in the movie, especially Wagner Moura who deserves all prizes he can get for this great performance.Basically the movie explores the fight between drug dealers and corrupt cops against the good policemen's, some of them from the military police force and most of them from BOPE. That's the way the director Padilha's sees this fight which is not entirely true. Although it shows how the corruption of the Military Police Force works out in Brazil, how the system is used against itself and how the bureaucracy makes everything so difficult that it's almost impossible for honest people to deal with their own personal issues without dealing with corruption. And by the way, that's entirely true.The baseline of the movie is the story of Nascimento's, who is the captain of BOPE (Special Forces Operations Battalion) which can be compared to SWAT. Nascimento needs a replacement and he needs to find the right person, someone who has all of the qualities the job demands. Two guys come up to be this person but none of them have all it takes. Neto has the attitude, the heart, but he's not smart and centered as he's best buddy Matias. The only thing they have in common which is mandatory for the job is the honesty and the will of changing things for the better.The movie has all the elements that makes us go to a movie theater. It has a storyline, it has action thriller, and it has a great performance from the cast, all of them.If you are planning to spend your money in another blockbuster, don't do it!

Several good thriller movies plenty of violence and shootings scenes have been produced in the last couple decades. But one thing is to inject a lot of money to make a movie on gratuitous violence and rely on special effects to make it get good critics, which then bring the desired money that moves the cinema industry. This is Hollywood, and this is definitely not what Elite Squad is about. The movie has raised and keeps raising important social questions among Brazilian citizens. The way the director tells the story without taking part in any side is genial; contrary to most north American movies, there's no good or bad guy in the story, the situation got to a point where things simply are the way they are. No particular point of view prevails and the viewer gets out of the movie with mixed sensations about what to think about all he sees. Victims of Brazil violence praise Captain Nascimento character to a level of national hero, whereas he ends by being hated by many others who dispraise his ignorance on human rights. There's also a thesis in the movie sustaining that all the violence is fruit of drug commerce, which would exist because the middle and high Brazilian classes buy the drugs to sustain their hedonistic life style. These are the same people that frequent movie theaters in Brazil, create the public opinion, and constitute the Brazilian intellectual society. Therefore \u0096 independently of the thesis being right or wrong \u0096 the movie somewhat also points the finger to the audience and blames it for all the violence. I think this is also genial, but one has to live there to really feel the whip of this blaming (again, one must have a bit of Brazil culture to really appreciate this movie). While you sit with your popcorn and hope for watching a good thriller, bear in mind that the violence you are seeing in Elite Squad is happening at this very moment, and this is what distinguishes this movie from other violent movies you saw.",

Greed Money Power all follow in the drugs footsteps as they follow in other criminal activities. The Film is not as visually stunning as say city of god but the cinematography is still rather good. The story is well paced and always moving and the acting is good although its harder for me to tell when i do not speak the same language. The script and direction was excellent so i'm sure any actor would have looked good but this wasn't about grand performances this was about the nitty gritty. I don't know how much of what is saw is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but i do know that the issues covered are very true for people in certain parts of Rio. Can I say that Naciamento is a Fascist at heart or is he a product of his environment. I think the Film explains this on the whole when describing what he needs as a replacement. Which was another great thing about the film, the narrative was telling the story but without being condescending to the audience. It was giving you all the information you needed to know without telling you the whole story. A lot of this film is about reading between the lines but you can also just watch it as an action flick with plenty of violence (I am sure this is what 12 yr old boys would see), It even has quite a few MTV moments which I am sure would please the masses (not that i am sure if this film will ever reach the masses). Either way the execution was good and while not perfect it was still the best film I have seen this year. While I did find that certain methods in the film were a little gratuitous towards the violence element. I am sure this is the sort of film that can entertain you while at the same time raises questions and also emotions from disbelief to anger to fear to sadness e.t.c.

Sadly, profit-seeking films increasingly replace human beings with cost-cutting special effects in tune with our age of technological brainwashing. At least in \"Elite Squad\" human beings still feel human, however unpleasant they might be. The central figure is Captain Nascimento who has no qualms about torturing or killing criminals and corrupt cops are especially not safe from him. He sees himself as the ideal leader but he is disintegrating under stress and has a glorified vision of his powers which he cannot quite reproduce with his wife at home. Human rights groups will have a field day listing all the violations - but survival is crucial in the nether world, be it Rio or any other place on the planet.

            "content": "From October 2nd to October 6th 1997, Pope John Paul II visited Brazil for the fourth time. Since his first visit in 1980 the social inequality has grown exponentially and the safety conditions deteriorated. But as we all do, Rio de Janeiro tried to show itself in better light. Homeless families and children have been temporarily cleared off the streets and Pope's safety was entrusted to more than 20,000 detectives, military police officers and soldiers, amongst whom were the members of Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais (Special Policial Operations Battalion) better known as BOPE. BOPE is a special unit of military police concerned mainly with battle against organized crime and famous for its incorruptibility unlike the rest of the police.Nine years later, and just a few months before the new Pope's first visit to Brazil, sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two BOPE officers, Major Andr\u00e9 Batista and Captain Rodrigo Pimentel, have written a semi-fictional book talking about preparations for Pope's 1997 visit and called \"Elite da Tropa\". In 2007 director Jos\u00e9 Padilha, with the help of screenwriter Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani, adapted the book into a movie called \"Tropa de Elite\" (\"Elite Squad\"). It draw controversy for its portrayal of BOPE as a brutal and uncompromising force and police as being corrupted on every level.Movie is narrated by Captain Roberto Nascimento, a member of BOPE who must lead his men to clean the favelas (slums) before the arrival of the Pope. It's his last assignment before retiring so he must also find someone to replace him. Along Nascimento, we follow two candidates for his position, young police recruits Andr\u00e9 Matias and Neto Gouveia. While Andr\u00e9 is studying law, and believes in peaceful solutions and good police work, Neto is honest but short-tempered and rash. Discovering how corrupt the police force is, they decide to register for BOPE.Although the movie is narrated by a member of BOPE, it takes a fairly distant approach. It is so because Nascimento himself tries to quit BOPE. His wife is pregnant and he got sick of his work which is why he's looking for his replacement. The methods his team uses are troubling at least. They are ready to torture and kill anyone they assume might be connected with the criminals and show almost no compassion. The methods they use are problematic and discarded as savage and immoral by Matias's colleagues at the law school, whom Matias then accuses of being ignorant to true problems and theorizing and criticizing from their privileged positions without true knowledge of the situation. It is interesting because it gets you thinking. All of us criticize something from time to time without knowing a lot about the subject. We criticize politicians for how they run a country, football players for how they play, heck, I criticize movies although I've never learned how to direct or act, and don't really know how the whole movie-making process feels and works. Knowing theory is good, but it isn't enough. Sure BOPE's methods are morally wrong, but the situation isn't black and white. It never is.The way those problems and dilemmas are shown is great. Mantovani did a fantastic job with the screenplay, probably helped by the great source material. The story is simple yet effective. It makes us think and also gets us emotionally involved. The camera-work is superb. Scenes showing the moving of Nascimento's squad through favelas are exciting and suspenseful and the movie for most of the time makes you feel like you're watching a documentary. Padilha did a great work. The actors are also fantastic. Wagner Moura as Nascimento and Andr\u00e9 Ramiro as Matias did a great job showing us troubled characters, as did Caio Junqueira as resolute Neto and F\u00e1bio Lago as cruel leader of the gang, Baiano, to point out just a few.Rarely a movie functions on so many levels as is the case with \"Tropa de Elite\". It's a personal story, a great action movie, a display of the problems that social inequality creates, an introduction to a debate about moral issues and limits of law enforcement, and much more. I've watched it for four times now, and I can't wait to watch it again. You should do the same.",

            "content": "If there hadn't been City of God, then Elite Squad might have made even more impact. But although it milks similar roots (the violence of Rio de Janeiro's poor areas), it at times feels as if it is doing just that \u0096 milking it \u0096 even if the details have been meticulously researched and re-created.Prior to the visit of the Pope, the Rio authorities try a clean-up operation so there is no danger to his holiness (who wants to stay among the poor). Ironically, the Pope's visit thus engenders a spate of violence as gangs battle with the elite 'BOPE' police squad. BOPE has additional problems with the regular police, who are endemically corrupt and keep the peace through a system of gentle bribery. Given that a policeman earns about the same as a bus conductor, the 'bribery' is arguably less awful (for the most part) than it sounds, especially when kept within decent levels.It should be added that the drug squads who run the slums not only police the slums (by and large) more effectively than the police do the regular areas, but are largely beneficent \u0096 for instance paying hospital bills or doing other kindnesses. They have only two rules \u0096 don't sell drugs on my patch and don't do anything to arouse police attention (such as mugging tourists in the slums). Many slums are therefore safer than the main tourist areas like Copacabana, and this is both from my own observation, visiting Brasil for many years, and from the accounts of people there. It is a two tiers society that, for the most part, live entirely separately. But, \"when honest cops go into the slums, bad sh*t usually happens.\" (The main city, away from slums and tourist areas, is much like any other modern metropolis for safety, facilities, the arts and business.) It is perhaps no wonder that, however accurate the film is, it has aroused the ire of independent filmmakers in the famous carnaval city. As I sat in a restaurant on Copacabana beach, two independent filmmakers explained at length how they deplored the image that such films pumped out at the world (Elite Squad did rather well at the Berlin Festival). It is a far cry from the more balanced, but now dated, look of such films as Black Orpheus. As most people are unaware of the richness of Rio, it might be compared to making films exclusively about Bronx violence if no-one knew of the greatness of New York City.Further ironies go unmentioned. The 'drugs problem', seen by westerners as stemming from South America, is seen by Brasilians as an American one (caused by American user demand). In Rio, American guns are traded for Colombian drugs. Neither are of great interest to Brasilians. And although the country is predominantly Roman Catholic, the papal visit to the slums can also be seen as an attempt to make inroads on the (more) indigenous and non-proselytising religions like Candoble that survive in such areas. Operation Holiness is 'plain foolishness.' One policeman says he would rather use his own money to pay for a good room for the Pope in Copacabana than protect him in the badlands.One of the good moral points the film makes rather well is how rich kids who deal in a little weed are ignored. Whereas those in the slums are brutalised. The disparity is highlighted by a classroom discussion.Elite Squad is a gritty, realistic action-heavy fight between 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. A lot of ordinary people in both camps get murdered and tortured along the way. The problem with Elite Squad is not the authenticity of what it includes but the relevance of what it leaves out.",

            "content": "From Brazil with fury: Tropa de Elite shows us, with realistic violence, all the horrors of the drug war in Rio de Janeiro \"favelas\" (slums). Many other movies shows us the violence and crime of Brazil, first of all the pulp masterpiece \"City of God\". The same authors of that movie, in this case, explore the world of police. The movie is narrated by Capt. Do Nascimento, a real officer (with a fake name). He's an officer in the elite military police Corp, the Bope. A black uniform with a skull as its symbol (two elements that remind Fascism) to fight the crime. They don't make interrogations: they torture suspects to obtain informations. They don't arrest: they just have to kill. This Corp is employed for extreme emergency, in the most dangerous areas where the police is armless. 1997: before the visit of Pope John Paul II in Brazil, Bope is deployed in favelas, cleaning them from criminals. The violence of special forces is needed\u0085 if you want the Pope live and able to speak about peace and fraternity to Brazilian people. In that period, Do Nascimento explain us the career of two Bope's volunteers: agents Neto and Matias, from their beginning in the regular police to their initiation in Bope's parallel universe.SPOILERS -They can't make a career in the regular police because they are too honest to accept all the corruption and the compromises inside it's hierarchy. And so, they have to turn violent and enter the Bope to fight the crime seriously. This is a personal trail full of sacrifices. Neto loses his life in action. Do Nascimento destroys his family. Matias loses part of his humanity: his love affair, his promising career in law. Finally he loses his sense of pity. And he becomes a real war machine. Those sacrifices are inevitable in an uncompromising World in which you have only to choose between criminality and repression. Because all the other rings of the chain are corrupted. Intellectuals preaches theories against an abstract \"repression\" and they don't understand the crime. Social workers are compromised with criminals (violently punished by them if they don't obey) and they simply can't do the good for society. Regular police (the State) is itself corrupted by criminals. And then: only brute force (with all its horrors) can fight the crime. Tropa de Elite is not only a good movie about Brazil. Its message is universal. Those who repeat that \"in real World white and black don't exist, there is only Grey\" are wrong. Padilha show us how criminality oblige us to make a radical choice. A choice not easy, not at all.",

The movie is shot like a documentary, many times in fact I felt like I was intrigued and interested on how and what the police does to get around the city.It is basically about the two main characters working their way up the police academy in Rio until they reach the BOPE unit. The training is shown to be very harsh, sometimes even dehumanizing. The movie depicts life of police men in the city and what they do to overcome the unfortunate bureaucracies. I will try hold myself to not say anymore because I do not want to spoil it for you.This movie is violent. It is not unnecessary violence, because its depictions are said to be accurate. (Rio politicians have spoken about its veracity).Even the production of this masterpiece was bounded by violence. While in production, part of the crew was kidnapped. An unedited version of Elite Squad together with dozens of fake weapons were stolen as well.You will be amazed through out the whole film, thats a promise.",

            "content": "Brazilian cinema is for me another almost completely unexplored territory. Have I ever seen a Brazilian movie before? Probably not, maybe a couple of documentaries about Brazilian music. Director Jose Padilha's Elite Squad was for me as big a surprise as it must have been for many of the viewers at the Cannes festival a few years ago. Settled in one of the many 'favelas', the bad-famed suburbs of Rio, it describes in a non-compromising manner a sick society faced with such a level of violence and corruption that it seems to make any tentative to reinstate law and justice a risky and Utopian endeavor. And yet this is exactly what the team of policemen in the center of the film tries to do, and the principal heroes are a couple of recruits trained into becoming some of the most efficient (and most violent) cops to fight organized crime.The action formula with a police school sub-theme works, the story is extremely well paced, realistic, even if sometimes cruel to the limits and not completely avoiding (because of the rush) to create some confusions. Overall, because of the sincere acting, and the unusual setting Elite Squad leaves the impression of bringing fresh air in the cops vs gangsters genre.Acting is good and the characters are well-drawn. We understand well their motivations and their relationship with the environment in which they live and they fight. I liked the film, and my only concern was that I read that after a few years a sequel was made. When an original story in a refreshing environment is repeated, there is a high probability to be turned in a tired formula. I hope to be wrong.",

It could have been a good character driven movie about the social misery the poor people are suffering from in these slums of Brazil, but instead the viewpoint from the corrupt violent police is being taken. Violence reigns over character development, that's my biggest gripe.Solely judged as an \"entertaining\" movie, it is a suspenseful, though somewhat chaotic action movie, with some character development, yet barely enough though to be able to really sympathize with either one of the characters.The story: a continuous police terror raid on the poverty stricken slums of Brazil. Extremely violent, to the point where so many people get killed one after the other it becomes numbing. Still quite impressive in a grim, violent way.",

            "review_title": "Elite Squad is a remarkable film. The film opens up the brutality practiced by both sides, police and bandits, becoming even more frightening",
            "content": "Based on the book written by former officers of BOPE (Battalion of Special Police Operations) Andr\u00e9 Batista and Rodrigo Pimentel and anthropologist Luiz Eduardo Soares, the feature portrays the situation of the police of the State of Rio de Janeiro seen through the eyes of Captain Nascimento (Moura), on the occasion of Pope John Paul II's visit to Brazil, in 1997, a famous visit by the camp mass at Aterro do Flamengo, made for 2 million people. Through an ingenious stitching of the script, which starts from a shooting in the same block where Rap das Armas plays, the text pauses and presents us with events from months before, highlighting Nascimento's personal life, his refusal to talk about problems personal relationships, his relationship with his wife and the nervous crisis caused by the increase in responsibility for the \"mission of the Pope\" and the proximity of the birth of his son.Along with Nascimento's story and his opinions about \"The System\", his narration about corruption within the Police and what he, at BOPE, has done to change this reality, we see a bifurcation in the plot, which fits in a way that doesn't quite fit organic and to the detriment of the presentation of other problems in the Corporation, which would bring much more benefits to the film, the aspirants Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) and Neto (Caio Junqueira) both in excellent interpretation. With different behavior and worldview, united by a childhood friendship and the fact that they are honest policemen, Matias and Neto are highlighted in the script as the possible substitutes for Nascimento. A moral triad is then erected that meets the taste of different groups that assist the work.The film does not present itself to us in the form of escapist entertainment. Wagner Moura's off-screen narration from the first minute gives the certainty that the story that will be told was not necessarily built for immersion in fiction, but to illustrate a reality. A reality that is closer or more distant from us, depending on who watches, but still an undeniable reality. Elite Squad already starts (pardon the pun) shooting all over the place. I can't stand the rhythm, the lyrics (?) And I don't even consider music, but it is undeniable that opening the film by letting go of funk was a more than right choice. Especially because it places the people in the armchair and opens up the reality of Rio's favelas. The opening with part of the credits follows, rescuing a hit from Tihuana and then, my dear, you already realize that the success of this production is not a matter of chance. It is a masterpiece. Changing the chronology and playing with time as the plot unfolds is nothing new. City of God used the same resource, but it shows that there are Brazilians who know how to make films out of the standards and with quality.In favor of the narration in off, it is worth saying that it is not limited to verbalize the scene that is shown.Nascimento is yet another commentator on the action: the film opens with a disastrous entry by the Military Police at Morro da Babil\u00f4nia, an invasion that triggers exchange of fire with the traffic and forces BOPE to intervene. Wagner Moura hasn't even shown his face in the film yet, but we already know what he thinks of the situation - \"if it is to do it right, let BOPE do it alone\". Nascimento preaches the dominant philosophy within the Military Police Special Operations Battalion, an independent division of the Military Police: Rio de Janeiro is at war, and in wars no prisoners are taken. The book on which the film is based, Elite da Tropa, by Andr\u00e9 Batista, Rodrigo Pimentel and Lu\u00eds Eduardo Soares, mixes the experiences of a BOPE officer, Pimentel, with analyzes of the situation of drug trafficking in Rio. Therefore, Elite Squad does not (and would not) disseminate the worldview of the officers who make up the guard.How, then, can the \"humanist\" viewer buy Nascimento's speech? Director and screenwriter Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani draws a very clever nonlinear maneuver. As the shooting opens the film, it is therefore assumed that it will end as well, with a good climax and a good flashback. It turns out that the case of Babylon is resolved in the middle of the film. From the middle, as if Elite Squad started again, we follow how two other PMs, Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro), central in the Babil\u00f4nia subplot, will join BOPE. There is no way to reject Nascimento's philosophy, particularly from the perspective of Neto and Matias, because Jos\u00e9 Padilha establishes a relationship of gratitude between the three protagonists. Neto and Matias got into trouble in Babil\u00f4nia and Nascimento went up to save them. It was imagined (at least I imagined) that the shooting at the funk dance would conclude the film, but deep down the case of Babil\u00f4nia is just the trigger. The logic is absolutely brilliant in his Machiavellianism: when Nascimento, personifying the Battalion, extends his hand to Neto and Matias, a commitment is made there. The two idealistic policemen, who spent the first third of the film in the midst of stranded paperwork and vehicles, become the Faustos (particularly the rational Matias) of the powerful Mephistopheles that is Nascimento. There's nothing to discuss: as opposed to PM's purgatorial paralysis, BOPE's discipline is a hot show from hell.Another point worth mentioning is the figure of the antagonist, who does not exist. The villain is the situation that the protagonist finds himself in. And the captain's voice off reminds the viewer right from the start: \"... it either gets corrupted, or it goes to war.\" There are many gems in the film and all, without exception, make you dive into the underworld of corruption in Brazil. Because the film portrays the police in Rio, but mirrors an endemic situation in the country. The issue, for example, of the coexistence and - also involvement - of upper-middle-class students with drug trafficking has given rise to a good discussion. And when it reveals the thinking of young people in a Law course, criticizing the police for their actions, it shows the inversion of values that is the square root of an obtuse vision that society - in general - has of itself. Whoever corrupts is a bandit. Point. And Captain Nascimento thinks so and \"passes the finger\" on whoever helps drug dealers to arm themselves.The film grows up with a good dose of exploitation and activates discussions that, if they were already controversial in 2007, would become a social issue, with political representation in turmoil and polarization of opinions in the following years. The way in which the NGO is presented, the not necessarily formal line of the script on the so ironic Human Rights in social application - seen through a work on Foucault's Watch and Punish -; the tone of Nascimento's speech (which, obviously, analyzes the issue of banditry through the eyes of those who are charged with confronting it) and the violence shown served as ingredients for countless debates about Public Security, dealing with drug trafficking and endemic corruption in official media, something that in Elite Squad 2 would become even more evident.Partially shot in the hills of Rio de Janeiro, Elite Squad has an impressive tone of veracity - and the logistics involved in the filming of a long shooting sequence in the favela certainly must have represented an operational challenge for the production worthy of the BOPE missions ( and the sound design of the feature is brilliant, as we can easily see in the tense battle between police and drug dealers). Likewise, editor Daniel Rezende does another magnificent job not only in intensifying the confusion and despair of those involved in the shooting (including dozens of civilians caught in the crossfire), but also in the rest of the narrative, which finds the right rhythm so much by becoming slower to focus on character development as it focuses on the long and absurdly draining training that Neto and Matias are subjected to. In addition, by employing frequent dry cuts during the dialogues in the same scene, Rezende creates a constant tone of urgency and nervousness, which is fundamental in a story like this.Depicting the violence of his universe without making concessions, Elite Squad opens up the brutality practiced by both sides, police and bandits, becoming even more frightening when we realize that we are witnessing recreations that, despite being dreadful, probably still pale in the face of that really happens in that war. On the one hand, it is impossible to ignore the stupidity of the methods of Captain Nascimento and his men, who beat suspects and do not hesitate to smother them with plastic bags in order to obtain the information they want; on the other hand, it is chilling to note the unspeakable cruelty of the traffickers - especially in a shocking sequence in which we witness two executions that well reflect the reality painted in Not\u00edcias de uma Particular Guerra and which rivals the unforgettable scene that shows the death of a boy in Cidade de God.Serving both mass cinema and denouncement cinema; opposing those who find it another film that sees it as a way to problematize violence, its causes and consequences; Elite Squad is, without a doubt, a remarkable film. The many forms of violence and the veracity with which they are treated end up having an approximation effect for us through fear and identification, because even if we do not experience the situation of the hills on a daily basis, we know that the tentacles of urban violence seep from the places where it really explodes and end up reaching everyone, from the exempt who marches for peace but buys merchandise from bandits, even the drug traffickers and addicts who, despite everything, remain in power, supporting and increasing laws that guarantee that almost nothing of this scenario changes .",

Caio Junqueira (Neto) and Andr\u00e9 Ramiro (Matias) are also fantastic as well as Fernanda Machado (Maria), whose extremely easy on the eye with her natural Latino beauty. The cinematography and screenplay is fantastic. This movie is a must see for pretty much anyone (unless you only like comedies or something).Some people (human rights activists and critics mostly) have attacked the film for not portraying the truth about BOPE, and for glorifying violence and \"fascism\", but I don't think that is the message here. First of all it works both ways; the higher society crowd are portrayed far more angelic and innocent than they really are. The upper society brats do not just use marijuana as seen in this movie, they abuse cocaine and heroin as well, and some of them are even worse and more twisted than the drug dealers themselves. But this isn't the point, so there was no need to put it in.I also loved how this movie does not take the easy way by showing monstrous acts from the villains such as rape or senseless random murder in order to make the \"good guys\" look better or justify reprisal. There are no good guys in this movie, only the law and the criminals, and even then they both get mixed up a lot. Things always happen for a reason. That's what sets \"Tropa de Elite\" from the rest, especially that MTV movie S.W.A.T. although it would be unfair to compare directly as they are of different genre imo. Tropa de Elite has its \"MTV\" moments but IMO it doesn't glorify it at all, it is merely used to keep you interested so it doesn't pan out like a documentary.On a final note, thank you Jos\u00e9 Padilha for delivering this fantastic movie!

The ending is so abrupt that it mirrors horror films in its' inability to provide any scenes of epilogue, which might have provided commentary instead of endless killing.That being said, it is an important movie that gives you plenty to care about. Our Captain Nacimento is our man in the middle and easy to relate into. The tourist attraction of Rio de Janeiro is hidden from accessibility here.

In a city (Rio) where drug dealers rule the slums and cops are mostly on the take, the only hope is this group of seemingly insane special police, BOPE. The story is about two recruits, Matias and Neto--two regular policemen who are sick of the corruption and are eventually recruited by BOPE. The leader of the group, Capit\u00e3o Nascimento, looks to one of these men to eventually replace him because the job is literally driving him insane.If you are looking for a nice film, then DO NOT watch this film. \"Elite Squad\" is gritty, nasty and very, very violent. Although the film is rated R, I think this rating is actually deceiving, as the film is more intense than most R films--with a lot of violence, torture and an attempted rape near the end that is horrifying. It is NOT a film for kids and it is hard to watch. This being said, it IS a well made film--sort of like a non-stop roller-coaster of a film. Realism...gritty realism is what makes this an excellent (but nasty) film. If you can handle it, then by all means watch it. Just don't say I didn't warn you.The last three Brazilian movies I watched were \"City of God\", \"Central Station\" and \"Elite Squad\". Is it any wonder, then, that I plan never to visit Brazil?! I have no idea if these films are exaggerations of the cities, but all three depict a hellish war zone--not a place I'd ever want to see for myself. And, if the films ARE accurate, then I can't believe that the Olympics are going to be held there very soon! You think I am overreacting? See the films for yourself!",

            "content": "When rating or reviewing an American movie, the process is simple: Decide how much you liked the movie in a scale of 1 to 10. Usually this pertains to how much you enjoyed the story, or the style of filmmaking, or the actors. Most American movies are made for mass consumption.On these terms, \"Elite Squad\" succeeds because it's a well-told, fast-paced story, told with the simplistic, high-on-adrenaline documentary style of filmmaking. There are a few good shots, but mostly the director just cares about getting in the face of the viewer, and quickening their pulse. For the most part, he succeeds.But, this being Brazil, we must also look at the movie from another perspective: What is it trying to say? For certain, you can just ignore the politics of the film and focus on the gun battles, but there are long scenes of cops with their wives and girlfriends, or going through training, which for the \"Squad\" of the title, is really more like boot-camp.I don't live in Brazil, I have never been to Brazil, but from my perspective the politics behind the film are shockingly naive. The characters claim to be fighting this great evil, slowly caving under the pressure of being the best cops in their nation, surrounded by corruption and dishonesty on all sides. And at the same time, they routinely lump in hard drug users, pimps, pot-smokers, and abortionists in the exact same category, while ignoring blackmail, bribery, and having beers after work. The film is not trying to say something about these cops-- it agrees with them, the protagonist spending the entire film training possible replacements, speaking passionately about the top two candidates via voice-over narration, as he hopes and prays the new squad leader will run the squad in exactly the same way as it was before.If Brazil is this conservative from top to bottom, no wonder it's falling apart. \"City of God\" made us look at the favelas, the type of life their residents live in every day, and how hard it is to escape. It made us feel, and made us sympathize. In \"Elite Squad,\" there is not a single redeeming character, and every male in it destroys countless others for his own selfish needs... while each and every woman and child is just there to get in the way, or else serve as punching bags.The criminals are psychotic, the cops equally so, with innocent bystanders caught up either in the middle, or ignoring things from the sidelines. If director Jose Padilha is trying to tell us anything, it's \"Brazil is an awful place, populated by awful people.\" I'm sure that's not true. But as long as the body count keeps stacking up, why would the audience care?Filmmaking: 8/10 (its current IMDb average). Politically, 4/10. Bill O'Reilly would love this movie, because its message is even more idiotic than any movie Michael Bay ever made: \"If we can only arrest or kill every pimp, every pot-smoker, every prostitute and every person who has an abortion, the country will be great again.\" Not only is that an impossible goal, it's the statement of an insane person. Compared to this, \"Transformers\" is positively intellectual.",

            "content": "Excellent and thrilling film based on real events . 1997, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Mouraw , this character was based on screenwriter Rodrigo Pimentel) has to find a substitute for his occupation while trying to take down drug dealers and criminals before the Pope comes to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil . On the streets of Rio only the elite survive . The movie deals about BOPE , a Special Operations Squad similar to American SWAT and their fight against factions in Favelas Rio Janeiro . Nascimento have to choose a replacement between Neto (Junqueira) and Matias (Andre Ramiro , this role was based on screenwriter Andr\u00e9 Batista , former members of the BOPE squad) who leads the dangerous assignment to take down the drug-lords . This stirring film has breathless , brutal scenes , a gut punch of an action film . It concerns on a special unit of urban combat taking on the daily challenges of dealing with pressure at home and fighting an unnamed war on Rio Janeiro slums . Interesting and brooding screenplay from the Academy Award nominated writer of City of God . Many critics have considered as a tremendous movie , on the level of some of the Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola pictures . A must see, a cross between the Departed , The Wire and City of God . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of an Elite Squad , about police corruption , and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro , plenty of drug-lords , burglars and assassins . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and for that reason isn't boring but it's entertaining . The picture grossed at box office , it had a total public of 2.4 million paying viewers while playing in theaters in Brazil , in addition to the estimated 11 million who watched the bootleg copies and got a final version slightly different from the pirated one. In fact , this film was already a best-seller almost three months before its official release . Illegal copies of what the director called the \"3rd cut\" flooded the streets of all major capitals in Brazil, for the equivalent of five dollars a piece . The characters are based on actual people , as Andre Matias was a member of BOPE and was a honest man who finds himself torn between his life as a BOPE member and his life long dreams of being a lawyer . Exciting as well as moving musical score . Composer Pedro Bromfman is the man behind Padilha's critically acclaimed sensation \"Elite Squad\" and the smash hit sequel and he's re-teamed with the filmmaker for \"RoboCop\" .Direction by Jose Padilha is awesome , stylish , and overuse Steadycam ; this award-winning Brazilian filmmaker directed this \u00a8Elite Squad\u00a8 and sequel , the smash hit followup , \u00a8Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\u00a8 both of them have been monster hits in his native Brazil and beyond . Director Jos\u00e9 Padilha claimed that this movie ends his trilogy about urban violence in major Brazilian cities . The first one, \u00d4nibus 174 (2002), was a documentary meant to explain how the state's indifference towards poor people can lead to the formation of violent criminals . The second, Elite Squad (2007), meant to explain how the state's indifference towards law enforcement agencies will often result in police brutality and corrupt officers . And finally, the last movie deals with the reasons behind the state's choice to ignore the poor and the police . These movies were Brazil's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Academy Awards . These films had a lot of box office , about 11.1 million paying viewers made it the most seen movie in Brazilian cinema history . It also became the highest-grossing film of all time in Brazil, beating Avatar . The first feature film in English for this director resulted to be RoboCop , making his Hollywood debut , and inventively breaks down ,reconfigures and soups up the core half-man, half-machine cop-hero conceit.",

But his final operation requires him to take down drug dealers & criminals in the slum area before Pope's arrival in Brazil.Co-written & directed by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, there isn't much wrong with the singular aspects here for the direction is pretty good, screenplay does put up some interesting characters on screen, and its raw handling of its subject matter does evoke a gritty feel but what the film lacks is a proper presentation for the whole picture has a messed-up structure which makes it very difficult to follow.Set pieces & locations do give this story the atmosphere required to set the desired mood, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a crude, unrefined layer but its poor execution of hand-held camera-work does hurt it at times. Editing is another major disappointment for the plot completely lacks a streamlined flow & is far more fragmented than required, and the only thing that leaves a mark is the strong performances by its cast.On an overall scale, Elite Squad could've been one of the most captivating examples of its genre but thanks to its lack of refinement, no sense of direction, messy plot & bewildering narration, it misses the mark by quite a distance. Every aspect does have a few things that are impressive, but it fails to seamlessly integrate into one engaging motion picture. Still for its unflinching portrait of crime, corruption & police brutality, Elite Squad is worth at least one shot.",

And Neto - hard man, yes sir, no sir tough lead in the squad, spilling lots of claret around the slums.

            "content": "Thought provoking, highly charged, and just about damn near pitch perfect, Elite Squad is a document about what goes on day in, day out in the \"war\" between the elite BOPE forces and the drug cartels, dealers,and dare I say, addicts within the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. BOPE are the elite, tactical unit of Rio's police department. Highly militaristic, highly trained, and highly duty bound, the BOPE share much in common with the most elite counter insurgency or counter terrorism special forces units in the world such as the US Navy SEALs, the British SAS or the German GSG9. But what separates BOPE from these units, is that BOPE is the police, not the military. And this raises all kinds of flags. You see, BOPE's ends may be just, but their means are absolutely ruthless. Throw your Miranda Rights out the window kids, they DO NOT exist in Brazil. BOPE will shoot first and NEVER ask questions. They will torture to get information and then swoop down like ninja packing state of the art firepower and overwhelm their enemies, the drug gangs of the Rio slums. And they will do so without any apparent oversight.Who do the BOPE commanders report to? We don't know. We see BOPE through the eyes of Captain Nascimento. The good captain believes that everything around not BOPE is utterly corrupt and beyond redemption. That includes other cops that are not BOPE, the gangs, the addicts, and the government. But what's interesting is that Nascimento wants out. He's seen enough. Apparently he's got too much blood on his hands. Or maybe its the fact that his wife is pregnant with their first child, a son. Whatever the reason, Nascimento is deeply troubled as he goes into battle fighting back the shakes, fighting back what is apparently PTSD. He can't bring himself to tell the psychiatrist that he's seeing what's really troubling him. Nascimento though figures he'll have to get himself a replacement so he can get transferred out of front line duty. Well, his replacement candidates are a couple of young rookies from the local PD, Neto and Matias. Both are eager and have not yet been tainted by the lure of corruption in the service. The film paints a portrait of a police force where cops screw each other over for bribes and territory all the while consorting with the drug gangs (the very enemy of the BOPE) and shaking down the citizenry for protection money. Neto and Matias want to do the right thing and be model police officers but that isn't going to happen unless they get away from the cops around them. So Nascimento, after rescuing them from a shoot out between the cops and gangs (and other cops), selects them for BOPE training. Both go through the HELL of training and these sequences rival what you've seen on the Discovery Channel of soldiers trying to make elite military units like the SEALs. Matias is also trying to get his law degree and make something of himself outside the police force. He falls in with the wrong crowd though--a bunch of rich college kids who use drugs and consort with the gangs and their bosses. You know this is going to have a bad ending. And it does. But not in the way you expect.The telling thing here is that Matias' friends are all part of the problem. They hate the cops and the BOPE especially but they are all breaking the law one way or another and supporting the very dilemma that plagues Brazil and every other country--illicit drugs. Yet, they don't think twice about the corruption around them or the cops who try to keep the city safe. It's a dangerous combination. They need the police and the government to ultimately keep their lifestyles going. Crazy, isn't it. That's what's so fantastic about this film. This isn't a Hollywood cops and robbers blockbuster or a buddy cop movie. This is a police procedural which shows you how things happen in the real world, for better or for worse. Definitely, for the worse. BOPE is nothing more than a death squad. Nascimento is a father figure to his sons, Matias and Neto, pointing them in the right direction to become like the predator he is. Nascimento believes in the law more than anything. He's moral and upright, yet at what cost? Certainly he is no hero gunning down teenagers and torturing women all in the name of justice. He's a wolf, like the other BOPE soldiers, and everyone else are sheep. The wolves hunt and kill with impunity. That's what they do. I was thinking about Mamoru Oshii's award winning anime, Jin-Roh, while I was watching Elite Squad. Oshii's Kerberos Panzer Cops are like the BOPE, elite law enforcement officers who go around handing out justice at all costs. But Oshii pointed out that once a man becomes a wolf what becomes of his humanity? He sheds it of course,like hair. The BOPE are a dehumanizing death machine when its all said and done blowing away bad guys in a broken, busted world. And that isn't something you're comfortable with as you watch this film.",

BOPE is judge, jury, and executioner. Suspects don't have the rights and protections that they do in the US.The narrative style and direction strongly resemble the films of Martin Scorcese (Mean Streets, Goodfellas).

            "content": "Being Portuguese, I believe that I know the realities of Brazil reasonably better than most foreigners. After all, historical and cultural ties connect the two countries to this day. For this reason, I am not at all surprised by the portrait that this film leaves us, about a world that rarely appears in the tourist magazines of Rio de Janeiro: the poor areas that, from the top of the hills, observe the noblest neighborhoods of the city.I could talk a little more about these slums, called \"favelas\", but the truth is that I don't know much about them. Until the first decades of the 20th century, the visitor walking the streets of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo or other cities would observe that the poorest generally lived in very compartmentalized buildings, called \"corti\u00e7os\", scattered throughout the old neighbourhoods of the city. From the middle of the century, however, we witnessed the renewal and gentrification of the urban centers, with the demolition of large degraded areas and the building of modern structures and even skyscrapers. Pushed to the periphery, the marginalized ended up building their homes freely, without a plan or project, using leased or unowned land, giving rise to chaotic and disorderly urban tissues that climbed the hills. Total poverty, which has always driven Man to crime, was soon associated with drug trafficking and consumption, and other crimes such as illegal gambling, arms dealing and prostitution, and led to the birth of criminal mafias, heavily armed, which took advantage of the geography and difficulty of entering some of these \"favelas\" to transform them into fortresses, where not even the regular police dare to enter.Thus, the issue of favelas was, and still is, a serious social, urbanistic and human problem for Brazilian cities. I don't have reliable data, but as far as I know, there is a long way to go to solve issues such as the lack of infrastructure, the lack of security of the land and the construction of houses in unstable lands. I know that measures have been taken to resolve them, and above all to combat crime (the film reveals this, taking advantage of Pope Benedict XVI's visit), but to what extent are they effective? What I can say is that, for now, Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo are off the list of the most dangerous cities in Brazil, but there is much to be done in other cities such as Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Fortaleza, S\u00e3o Salvador or Natal.In this film, we follow the journey of two recruits on a course for an elite police force, trained to intervene in the most complicated scenarios: the BOPE. Each is guided by their own reasons, but they are united by a feeling of weariness at the impunity of criminals. The head of the recruit, Captain Nascimento, is also at the center of the plot, as he is discreetly looking for a replacement in order to retire and be able to dedicate the rest of his time to his family, and the little psychological sanity he has left. It is a very raw portrayal of the extremely violent training of these units which, however, prepares them for the authentic urban warfare they have to face. It also lets us foresee a little of the gravity of the problem itself: armie-like bandits who commit brutalities without thinking twice, and a police force that could go to war if needed.With this film, Wagner Moura achieves one of the most outstanding and important works of his career. He was not, until this film, one of the great Brazilian actors, one of those that we always remember when we think of Brazilian drama. However, I had already been appreciating his quality in some TV works he did, and even so, it was quite impressive to see him here. And although the film features other talented actors, such as Andr\u00e9 Ramiro and Caio Junqueira, it is Moura who stands out and dominates the film. I also liked the work of Fernanda Machado who, in a much more discreet way, shows the somewhat utopian and dreamy way in which upper-class youngsters seek to cultivate a sense of social justice without knowing, however, how to solve the problems at their root.Technically, the film stands out for its enormous realism. It's a work of fiction, the characters and situations are invented, but everything was thought to seem true and authentic as in a documentary. We observe this, for example, in the enormous amount of profanity and slang used in the dialogues, or in the careful selection of the filming locations used, which include some \"favelas\" in Rio. Another point of praise is the quality of the action scenes, worthy of a big-budget American film and filled with good special effects and sound. It is a film inappropriate for children or to watch with that narrow-minded granny, but very good, one of the best films that Brazil managed to export internationally.",

We race through, seeing with a certain narrative eye that tries to make sense, so let's see a few observations made by that eye.It lambasts several worlds. The world of corrupt cops who take bribes to do their job and still more bribes to look the other way, seen as ignorant bureaucrats or yet another gang. The world of privileged university kids who like to harp on about power structures but become unwitting cogs in the chain of abuse when they go to the barrio to score drugs for their socially conscious lifestyle. The world of drugs, of course, with petty chieftains ruling their own tribes of hapless kids.It's an angry film; angry at what it sees as the competing selfishness of different tribes only looking to please a narrow self interest. It begins with two rookie cops who it presents as extraordinarily competent and who just want to do work that untangles knots, but become stifled by bureaucracy and ignorance. They finally enlist in the special ops squad to come out on the other end as merciless rambos as the only way to get something done; direct action the only way to cut through the ambiguity and indifference.It doesn't shy away from showing horrible police brutality and not the Dirty Harry cartoon. Kids are beaten, suffocated with plastic bags, and almost raped with a wooden broom to spill the beans. The point here is that it could have airbrushed this view but didn't and chose instead to confront the reality. Had it come out in the US, it would have been the most controversial films that year.But just as we think that in their frantic chase to restore order they end up brutalizing an innocent kid, torture leads them to the right place. In the end this eye comes with its own blindness. It's all a bit of a mess apart from this like we're seeing parts of different episodes of a season of crime TV.",

            "content": "'Elite Squad' always seems to be compared to or mentioned in the same breath as 'City of God', but they are at heart very different movies, with 'Elite Squad', despite the merits of the other is the more challenging and gripping feature. The Brazilian police force due to their brutal treatment of slum dwellers and rampant corruption have a terrible reputation and Elite Squad makes no attempt to hide this. What it does do is show the reasons why the low paid regular policeman will find life quieter and more profitable if he colludes with the criminals and dealers. Then again, the main character of the movie Captain Nascimento is not regular police - he is part of the military style Elite Squad BOPE who are used in the most dangerous situations and has more contempt for the corrupt regulars than the armed drug dealers he has to fight. At the other end of the moral scale is Fabio, who the two rookie policemen Neto & Matias are initially placed under. Fabio's main concern is making as much money as he can from various rackets and he's exasperated when he discovers his new officers actually want to fight crime. While Neto is hot headed and eager to use violence, Matias is calm & intelligent and has the wish to become a lawyer. It is at law school where he keeps company with a group of rich 'playboys', but he does not reveal he is a policeman and turns a blind eye to their copious drug intake, something that has tragic consequences later in the movie. Despite being a huge hit in Brazil, many critics in the USA & Britain slammed the film for its perceived glorification of police brutality. But was the true reason for their antipathy to the movie the fact Elite Squad paints an unflattering image of the upper and middle classes? In 'City of God', the problems resulting from the drug trade are depicted as only affecting the slum dwellers. The middle class characters appear as kind and helpful and at the conclusion of the movie, the main character Rocket announces that he has become one of them. In 'Elite Squad', the upper classes are depicted as idle hypocrites who pour scorn on a police force that isolates them from the violence of the slums and the main consumers of drugs coming out of from there. More anger seems to directed at them by the writers of the movie than either the dealers or the corrupt police. Considering the movie was destined to play to art-house audiences outside Brazil, this was a brave stance to take. As Nascimento says during the movie commentary 'I often ask myself how many kids we lose to the drug business just so rich playboys can light up a joint'. 'Elite Squad' is a definite must see movie, but avoid the dubbed version at all costs.",

            "content": "2286/5000\n\"Tropa de Elite\", the purest and crude record of Brazilian society, hypocrisy, profit, partiality and innocence, where policemen mistreat \"innocents\" to arrest bandits, and rich people finance crime and indirectly kill police with a pacifist speech. A script that talks about traffic, crime and favela by a different angle, the angle of the police, more specifically the BOPE, a special regiment of the military police, who tells us the story is Captain Nascimento, who mixes with the story of Mathias and Neto, young honest police officers who seek to fight organized crime, the elite troop script is accurate, but not perfect, it has many parallel plots that end up not being deepened, but it has a great construction of characters besides being brutally honest , even sometimes abusing scenes and phrases of effect - which eventually made the movie explode on its release. The morale of \"Elite Troop\" is that we are all wrong, there is no cure or a solution, no matter the side, any action taken ends up being harmful to someone, and often, to someone you want to help, before exploding the fashion of polarization in Brazil, the Padilha film already discussed concepts that are now completely disturbed, Jos\u00e9 Padilha directs using techniques of Martin Scorsese, sometimes even better than the American director himself, with scenes of incredible shootings and absurdly verisimilitude, German of a camera use without tripe magnifico, not to mention the great narrations in off that serve as a perfect support for the script, not to mention the precise and striking soundtrack, which reflects in an accurate way what is the long. The film is also very well acted, with main highlights for Wagner Moura and Fernanda Machado, besides the sober and mature performance of Andre Ramiro. Tropa de Elite is the movie that opens Jose Padilha to the world, the good and competent director is released to the Holywoodian market, where he ends up not doing well, but ends up finding his talent again when directing series for netflix. \"Tropa De Elite\" is not perfect, but it is a film that exposes much of Brazilian culture to the world, not only negatively, precisely because of this, \"Tropa De Elite\" is difficult to be seen by foreigners because the film is very, very Brazilian.",

So, following the positive comments, I decided to watch this movie despite the fact that I live in a very remote country (Bulgaria) from Brazil and I am not very familiar with the problems taking place there.Well, I can say, the movie is EXCELLENT\u0085. and not only in the more specific and technical aspects of a movie (screenplay, acting, directing, storytelling etc.) but also it looks very real and plausible. It makes you feel as an accidental witness and observer of what is wrong in the thorough system of Brazil. It is like you are watching a live footage and everything that is happening on screen is actually happening\u0085 it is real. Another great key point that adds to this feeling is the way that the actors are presented, the way they act, and the great way they are developed. None of the characters looks as a specially selected nice-looking actor with tones of make-up to make him look authentic. They all look like real people, they are believable and interesting. Almost any of the main characters goes through a development through storyline which is another sign of a high-quality movie. The action sequences are also very well-crafted and most of all believable. The way that the Elite Squad operates looks very original and interesting. To summarize, \"Elite Squad\" is a very interesting, dynamic and though-provoking movie. In my opinion, its only weak point is the little bit confused storytelling.",

When all is said and done, though, will we be happy with all we've accomplished?Working as a police officer surrounded with gangs and crime is a daunting task. Knowing tomorrow could very well be your last day is a fact that will haunt your personal life and remain with you while on duty. Then realizing your own fellow officers and superiors are supporting corruption is an even harder pill to swallow. Frequently we risk our lives fighting for the good cause; attempting to preserve peace in a land filled with turmoil. Sometimes it's hard to discern which side is doing that. BOPE is an extreme special forces unit of the military police designed to handle conflicts with lethal measures. Every day these officers, who are parents, spouses and siblings to others, risk their lives and the lives of others in the name of justice. After extensive fighting and anguish, it comes to a point where you question the efficacy of your work. All the lives you have permanently altered, loved ones you have taken away and the effect this has had on your own family. Whether BOPE or a more rudimentary strategy to decrease crime rates is better is subject to debate for another discussion, but the impact BOPE has on the lives of innocent civilians, both positively and negatively, is remarkable. At the end of the day, after all is finished, will you have fought the good fight? Was there a better, more effective, approach? Tropa de Elite is an enlightening film, not for the violent tactics used or exposure of urban warfare in favelas, but because it reveals the lives of those involved and how they significantly influence each other.",

It shows the corruption within the police and why a special squad called BOPE was formed for stopping the violence in slums. I was astonished to see the corruption in the police and cannot imagine a situation without the BOPE.The movie greatly portrays the activities of the BOPE which is highly strategical. I liked each and every frame of their activities especially the training of the new recruits, that shows why they are so tough.Storyline is a narrative type narrated by Capit\u00e3o Nascimento(Wagner Moura) who is the captain of the BOPE and a very good fighter and seeks a replacement. Wagner Moura did well in this movie.I liked the portrayal of the story which starts from the middle, go to the start and move on to the end of the movie.One thing i cannot understand is that the BOPE just go and shoot or threaten to kill people and raid innocent peoples house without any law. They work independently, and it is portrayed in the movie that they can do whatever they want without any permission or laws. I don't think it is possible. But still i think we can justify their activities, because without such powers BOPE cannot fight against those heavily armed slums.The camera and lighting's are very good.It gives a real effect to the movie.There are a few shot from the sky showing the slums which is excellent.Anyway it is a must watch movie.You will surely enjoy this movie.If you have seen City Of God and liked it i am damn sure that you will really love this movie as i do.It is like City Of God taken from the other side(law enforcement side).You must really watch this movie, or else you are gonna miss something great.",

These stories are set in Rio's notorious favelas -- a violent world governed by drug dealers, policed by corrupt cops and home to the impoverished. The favelas are a visually stunning real-world setting: overcrowded, decrepit shanty-towns, chiseled into the jagged outcroppings of Rio's coastal mountain range and in stark opposition to the natural beauty of the surrounding forest. It's not that these stories set in the favelas aren't well done --most of them are-- the problem is, every one of these stories looks as if they'd all been shot and edited by the same personnel. And when Rio's favelas showed up in one of Hollywood's biggest summer blockbusters, there was little doubt this trend had reached critical mass.Tropa De Elite (translated: The Elite Squad) picks up on this trend, but does nothing to improve upon it. TDE tells the parallel stories of three cops and how their lives converge and ultimately effect one other's fate. TDE never measures up to its predecessors as a result of a distracted story line, one unsure of where it wants to go and how it wants to be told. While the three central stories seamlessly mingle with one another, approximately halfway through the film, TDE veers off on an awkward tangent, attempting to incorporate the Elite Squad's boot camp training into the story. The storytelling never recovers from this detour and as the first and final acts are stitched back together in the final minutes, TDE simply runs out of steam, exhausting its audience with overkill.",

It just is amazing the reality we face throughout the movie, the bitter realization of the lives of everyone involved : the people on the 'favelas', the trafficants, the drug-using middle class, the dirty cops, the honest cops, and mostly, BOPE.\"Tropas de Elite\", or \"Elite Squad\" is the story of Capit\u00e3o Nascimento - a BOPE Captain decided on leaving the Brigade after his wife got pregnant, but before he can do so, he needs to find a replacement, someone that can manage and cope with the responsibility and pressure of being a BOPE Captain. Two \"rookies\" pop up, sharing his desire to do good, and the will to really annihilate the drug dealers from the favelas, Matias is intelligent\\clever but lacks the 'strength' to deal with those issues, and Neto is just the opposite : strong and decided, but lacking the sense and intelligence to cope with the situations. It all converges on the Pope's visit to Rio de Janeiro, and his decision to stay on a favela.No sugarcoating, no comic relief, no misleading facts, just the cold hard story, and all the thrills it brings along. The BOPE incursions through the favelas on the movie are the most realistic and nerve wrecking images i've got to see in a movie on a long time. It's also very thought-provoking due to the way we're shown the corruption of the system (in Brazil as it is on several other countries...), and the difficulties honest people (police in this case) have just with dealing with their own problems and situations.A MUST SEE for everyone that's into good movies.

After seeing it, I am sort of surprised to see Brazil still as a whole but not in pieces.While the Rio dirty streets are filled with street gangsters equipped with better firearms than police forces, the government gave such a solution--eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, gun for a gun. So there we have Tropa De Elite, which is a special police force with the trademark of a skeleton. In the beginning of the movie, you will just see what this force is meant for and how all the other people fear and hate them because their license to kill. In this story, we saw the reality going on two ways. One is from the formal captain Nascimentos who is tired of all the killing and wishing to retire for the family.This character is well developed and acted into the depth. You see him beating and interrogating people despite they are woman or child, and you also see him tremble for a sad mother who just lost his son. Nascimentos has to find a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or a new captain. So we have the storyline of two friends from normal police force, who is Matias and Neto. Both of them were chosen out of policemen to be BOPE troopers and both were considered new captain. In a corrupted police circle, Neto already believed that without killing there would be no peace, while Matias was still fighting in the university to be a lawyer, until their fate were twisted by Matias' classmates' drug lord friend in the Rio......And the rest of the story is how a man once pursuing peace become one believe in killing. Deep story? Huh? But to me, City of God is simply more shocking and visually stunning. And all the characters are better binded together in one story.Still worth a node. 8/10",

What we watch in it is our everyday... violent events we see on the news and sometimes, unfortunately, we may experience such events in person... or hear them from friends and relatives.It's not just an action movie, it touches deeper trying to show what leads characters to the events depicted in the movie. Jose Padilha (director) successfully presents us stereotypes in such a complex way that they look more than just stereotypes (like \"hey, I know a guy just like that character\". But maybe it's just because I'm Brazilian).The movie (thanks to Padilha, very well developed) starts with distinct stories about 2 friends just graduating from the police academy, corrupt police officers, wealthy college students and a police elite squad named BOPE (Batalhao de OPeracoes Especiais, Special Operations Battalion). They all relate to each other lightly, but their strong bond is the crime in the city of Rio de Janeiro.The story is narrated by Captain Nascimento, an honest and incorruptible commander of a BOPE battalion. Under his point of view (but enough elements are presented, so viewers aren't restricted to Nascimento's point o view), he describes how the poor, the rich and the corrupt keep spinning the wheel of crime and how endemic it is in Rio de Janeiro.The plot is very well structured and filled with nice subplots (BOPE military training, Pope's visit to Rio, action scenes, drama scenes, twists...), this is a very nice way to see Brazilian's society... not because it's complicated, but because sometimes it's just this simple.The actors in this movie are very good too, it's worth mentioning how Wagner Moura is outstanding as Capt. Nascimento.And the action scenes are very nice too, seems very real.Probably one of my favorite movies.",

The first part of the film is focused on the presentation of the famous system in which moral boundaries between drug gangs and local police generally don't exist. The police is extremely corrupt, inefficient, and deeply rooted in the criminal system at all levels, particularly in the poorest parts of the country, the favelas. We are introduced to the system through the eyes of two young and honest police officers, Matias and Neto who quickly come into conflict with a corrupt police officers. After that they decide to apply for a special police, BOPE, under the authority of captain Nascimento who is in the process of seeking his replacement because his personal life is suffering. Meanwhile BOPE are on a special mission of cleaning favelas because of arrival of the Pope who insists on residing in their vicinity. Almost every aspect of this film is flawless. The acting is perfect, while documentary directing fits the story perfectly and looks incredibly realistic. Visual impression deserves admiration because of the relative low budget of only 4 million dollars, which, fortunately, has conditioned shooting on real locations in Rio de Janeiro. Excellent soundtrack is also one thing that needs to be singled out. Rap das Armas stays in your ears for weeks after the movie. On first viewing it could be difficult to understand complete story, especially because of huge number of characters from what majority is transient, but non of them are unneeded. Second viewing definitely ensures complete pleasure in superb cinematography but also a creeps because of the reality of system from which most of us are perhaps far away, but it is very much real. Because of the better effect on story, special police is portrayed as completely pure and invincible what is of course far from the truth. However, activities and training of BOPE is accurately shown. Black uniforms, skulls, cruel training, methods of cleaning the favelas and the fear that they inspire are reality that is perfect for the big screen.",

And I back then I liked it a lot, this time, I loved it. Its a rough and realist depiction of the inner Rio de Janeiro, where cops and drug dealers take part on a never-ending war for the favela's dominance. Within the law enforcers side we are presented to three major characters - Captain Nascimento (played by Wagner Moura, the best Brazilian actor from my point of view), and the both aspirants to be cops Neto and Matias. Nascimento is the main character of the two movies and he couldn't be played by a better actor. Moura delivers a performance of a troubled anti-hero, who wants to retire from BOPE (Brazil's special law enforcers) to spend more time with his wife and his future son. Moura is so believable and real that we all tend to love him, despite some of the dubious actions he performs throughout the story. He's a conflicted man, who just leaves when he feels his duty is fulfilled. \"A given mission, is an accomplished one\". Neto (played by Caio Junqueira) and Matias (played by Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) are also deeply explored on the plot, with the first being a younger version of Nascimento, reckless and motivated by his sense of justice and duty, while Matias is a young man split between two worlds - the one of the law enforcers and the one of the drug dealers. The directing of Jos\u00e9 Padilha really leveled the movie up. The sense of tension and pressure is present in the way he shoots the scenes, with the use of over the shoulder angles and a bit of shaky cam on some chases. The firefights are perfectly shot and Rio is showed at its best and worst. The film was produced by the Weinstein brothers which solely gives it distinction amongst other productions.A must-watch.",

The action sequences are great and look so real. I found excellent how the movie ended with that final scene because of its meaning.On the other hand I found the characters of Neto and Matias very naive for being surprised that there was such a level of corruption in the police at the beginning. Yes I know that that was part to see the transformation of their characters but they shouldn't have been so nice at first.This movie is about how two honest rookies policemen, who get in a special police unit that attacks drug dealers in the favelas in Rio de Janeiro, and the police who is going to be their boss in this \"tropa de elite\".I recommend you to watch this film because is entertaining and maybe you will learn some things that you didn't know about our societies.",

            "content": "First of all, I do not agree with the idea of comparing this movie with \"City of God\", which has a completely different message and focuses on a different angle of things. Just because the two of them have a geographic common-point and are made by Brazilians is irrelevant. That's like saying all American-made movies situated in New York are all the same (e.g. Gangs of New York and Maid in Manhattan). This movie does not deal exactly with corruption per Se, which has a secondary role in the picture. It has to do with how someone with a strong sense of honesty and justice can excel and be heard in a system so intrinsically rotten without being chastised. In addition, it also analyzes how middle and upper-class kids get involved in the world of drugs just to be cool or fit in, and what the repercussions of this are. One of the strongest messages in the movie was: \" How many children have to get involved in drug trafficking just for a teenager to be able to roll a joint?\". This goes along with the scene towards the beginning in which the BOPE captain rubs the rich kid's face in the bloody bullet hole in the drug dealer's chest and asks \"who did this?... You did this, you finance these people by buying their drugs and get them killed.\" Even though I never experimented with drugs, I felt ashamed to be middle class, I felt ashamed of my colleagues who innocently smoke pot or whatever... our culture sees these people as the curve-setters of coolness, but we fail to see what allows this to happen... there is a tragic reality backing this apparently innocuous habit. But there is an even more powerful message in the movie, one that has made me think just as much as the first one. In spite of all the garbage that goes on, there are still people who are willing to fight for what they believe is right, without resources or support, earning minimum wage and risking their lives for a principle. This may not mean a lot to most people, but it struck a cord with me. Members of the BOPE are rigorously trained, withstanding a brutal amount of punishment and humiliation in the process, but come out with a rock-solid sense of discipline and justice. I do not know if this status is still a reality, but just the fact that it was at some point is inspiring. I'm not going to emphasize the clich\u00e9s that everyone usually puts out, like \"this movie is not for the faint of heart\". This movie reflects reality like few movies do... it is exactly like life... sterile, cold, efficient, and merciless. Drug dealers and police officers are at war, they take no prisoners and feel no compassion for the enemy. It's not like a hero will come flying in to save the good guys in the end... there is no hero, only ordinary people, just like life. This movie also made me hate Hollywood flicks and celebrities even more... prefabricated sewage that we pay to see, conforming to our emotions to make us feel better about our own apathy. Some scenes will stick in your head over days, such as the guy being burned alive trapped in the middle of a stack of tires (this is called a \"microwave\", something I actually had read about in a news magazine a few months before the movie was made) and the way Matias shut up that class full of rich snobs. Anyway, I have rambled enough... sufficient to say this movie was phenomenal and achieved a new level of film-making. This movie is for everyone, not just for those with intestinal fortitude. We all share the same world, and it's about time we took the blindfolds off and realized that we do indeed have a role in all the filth we so cavalierly critique as someone else's problem.",

            "content": "Although I enjoyed this film very much, I can understand why foreign viewers are dismissing it as a piece of cheap gratuity.I have to say this is not a film meant to be seen outside. It was originally made (and sometimes \"enhanced\") as bleak critic of current state of affairs in Brazil, more specifically in Rio de Janeiro.The city, once Brazil's best feature, has now become some kind of no man's land, with social distortions that you would seen only the worst places of earth. To acknowledge the fact, it takes more than \"Cidade de Deus\" - a flick that shows violence the way we want to see, as a social cause of poverty, as closed question. But that's not all of it.Elite Squad (\"Tropa de Elite\") made its point, when its author accurately detected that the violent law enforcement agents, the messed up soldiers of the film, are only translating what a major parcel of the population desires. And deconstructing this rationale have put in motion one of the most passionate social debate that fiction work ever inspired in Brazil's cultural scenario.But that's it. It's not a cultural universal. It's characters are not made to be believable for other audiences than its aimed audience. The possibly loopholes it contains are there because, for the most of it, a Brazilian spectator won't need further information. He or she knows by heart what they are seeing because that is part of their daily newspaper pages.What's portrayed on the screen - without subtle innuendos or softened undertones - it is not what it seems at first glance, a \"caricature\" of the reality. It's the reality filtered to the middle through the TV news, or the unfiltered reality on the streets. Most of the living characters of the film came to say about it that it is indeed a accurate portrayal. And that's scary.Not the violence in the film scares us, but the fact that a nation became a caricature of itself.The director could not capture more accurately the national sentiment - a mixed of confused feelings towards the poor that urges a undeclared class war. The director takes on the duty to reveal the ugly face of violence - the one that is hidden inside of each inhabitant, from higher classes to the lowest - their desire for a punitive state, their acceptance of violence if it to serve the purpose of \"break\" the criminal homogeneity - and it's comprehensibly unbelievable by the foreign eye that Brazil's, as a nation, has come to this.The very matter-of-factly way that the director chooses to tells the history is something awfully engaging for those who live or are in touch with the facts portrayed in the screen. This \"in-your-face\" approach will be only fully understood by intended audience.By no means this is a universal flick, but - quite contrarily - is particular and regional as it can be: it doesn't explain its historic context, uses fast-paced slang-dialog, subtly uses social stereotypes that are only common consensus considering Brazil's social archetype.It only makes matter worse that the final cut was released with a change of tone of the narrator, being he the only guide through the whole mess, I lowered my rate of the film because of that. The director in the last minute tried to made the film more palatable for the general audience and weakened a, otherwise, very fine work.",

The problem of the violence is show by the perspective of Capitan Nascimento, how is the narrator of the movie. Some people may complain of the single point of view, but in my opinion that was the objective of the movie: show the problem by the eyes of these men. This is why I have given a 10 to this movie. If the scenes of torture don't look like some thing too bad, it is because that's the the way they see it.The plot is also very good. Nascimento is the capitan of BOPE, a special force in the police. Close the become a father, Nascimento is looking for someone to take his place. Two friends show as possible choice, both have shown to be honest, willing to change things for better and courage, but for Capitan Nascimento that's not enough. The movie show the transformation in the personality of these two young man while working in the police, until they become what Nascimento expect.

Although it shows how the corruption of the Military Police Force works out in Brazil, how the system is used against itself and makes everything so difficult that it's almost impossible for honest people to deal with their own personal issues without dealing with corruption.

Acting as judge, jury, and executioner is the only way to ensure a safer tomorrow for the innocent. Everything about the situation is absolutely maddening, living in a constant state of fear and agression, and Moura (the captain) perfectly portrays the mental toll the role can have on a person. It's a gruesome story fueled with such intensity that doesn't make me envy anyone on the screen.One possible complaint is that the movie has no likable characters, but several of them were very relatable as trying to make the best of an awful situation. My biggest complaint was the constantly shaky camera. It was better by the final act, but it was really distracting for the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the movie. In hindsight, I think it might have been intentional by the director, growing more steady as the two recruits solidified their BOPE mindsets. If that was the intention, it's a very neat concept, but it was way too much and seemed unnecessary at first.",

What the movie \"accidentally\" forget to mention is the fact that, nowadays, the individual on which Nascimento's character was based on is facing charges in Rio de Janeiro's Corregedoria da Pol\u00edcia, the institution that deals with policemen that have broken the law. The allegations against him are not little: he have presumably facilitated and/or lend the 'caveir\u00e3o' (bulletproof terrestrial vehicle, much like an armored cargo van) to drug dealers. The movie would be harmless, given the fact that is a mediocre movie; in terms of cinema, i'd give it a 5. Would be harmless, though.

However, he needs to find a replacement and with the pope coming over to pay a visit in just a few days time, pretty darn snappy. There are two candidates, Neto (Caio Junquiera) and Matias (Andre Ramiro) idealistic young men who want to make a difference but who are quickly disillusioned when they see the brutality and corruption involved. Neto finds himself torn between the law he's vowed to serve and his college friends whose lifestyle conflicts with the job he wants to do.The gangs, guns and drugs problem in Rio is something most people at least have an inkling about, but only through news sources and documentaries they may have seen on TV. With Elite Squad, I was expecting a documentary style zoom in on the problem and what I got instead was a hard hitting, powerful but fictional account from the front line, or what we're told is the front line. The BOPE is basically Brazil's answer to the FBI, a tough squad of men (and women) who want to make a difference on streets ravaged by crime.But the focus isn't all on the nitty gritty stuff. There's some decent human drama too, with believable characters facing the sort of dilemmas and challenges any one else in the world could face, mainly in the Neto character, forming a character at war with the stern, no nonsense authority he's sworn to enforce and the free thinking idealism of those he learns around. The film as a whole manages to entwine the two and make a compelling film out of it.In the end, it's not quite what I thought it would be, but it's a rewarding experience nonetheless. ***",

The protagonist is one of the commanders of the BOPE, a special operations battalion that is like a \"death's head unit\" of the police force in Rio de Janeiro, functioning outside the normal chain of command and used for special, super-dangerous missions. Our hero, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura), who narrates the film, has served as a BOPE officer for many years, cracked a lot of heads, and is ready to retire. His wife is pregnant with their first child, while he is suffering from depression and fears he may be losing his mind. His eye sockets are permanently dark from worry and exhaustion. Still, the rules of the outfit are clear: if you want to leave, you have to find a replacement. He sets out to find one, and is surprised at the qualities displayed by his new picks. The movie is ultra-violent, showing BOPE's unorthodox interrogation methods, including \"bagging\" (putting a plastic bag over a suspect's head until he starts to suffocate), but what is most frighteningly effective about the movie is that\u0097despite their unquestionably fascistic appearance and methods\u0097the BOPE officers have the audience's sympathy by the end. The unit is made up of unprivileged men, and as BOPE officers they function in a world in which \"enlightened\" left-wing rich kids mix with drug-dealers in the slums. These spoiled brats form a socially-conscious NGO with the help of a local politician, and proceed to promote an image of the police as responsible for everything that is wrong in Rio's society. Predictably, their attitude results in tragedy, and the men from BOPE spring into action to set things right. The film is supposedly based on real events in 1997. The Pope, on his visit to Brazil in that year, announced that he wanted to stay with a bishop whose residence abutted one of the most dangerous slums in the city. BOPE was then called in to clean out the mafia elements and make it safe. Very much worth seeing.",

It's a Brazilian film and is it possible to be reminded of Brazil without CITY OF GOD being mentioned ? In fact the whole opening sequence is very similar both aesthetically and structurally as Fernando Meirelles 2002 film with a flashback opening set in the slums of Rio Thankfully this is a little bit more than an urban cop thriller that could easily have been set in any inner city of the United States . Amnesty International isn't too keen on South American police squads that sometimes cross the line in to becoming death squads ridding the streets of \" undesirable elements \" . In other words fascism sometimes rears its very ugly head and perhaps mindful of this the producers including Harvey Weinstein has made a film where the good guys tend to bend the rules for the greater good . It might be fascism but it's all done for the greater good and the eponymous elite squad bending the rules are morally stand up characters who are incorruptible and never brutalise an innocent person . Like so many films with these type of brutal crusaders with a police badge one wonders how the characters would react if just for once they caught a totally innocent man That said it's not a film that paints the ordinary flatfoot of Rio in a good light . The everyday policemen are either corrupt or have an abdicratic attitude to their work . What stops the film attaining true greatness is the fact the first third of the film takes up too much time showing the often banal apathetic routine role of the police . The film also has a scathing cynical attitude to the bourgeois liberal middle class who are often hypocrites . One wonders if this is a misanthropic point rather than a political statement ? Of course the film doesn't suggest that if all drugs were legalised then perhaps the drug gangs would become somewhat disenfranchised In summary ELITE SQUAD is a gritty hard hitting police thriller where the audience are asked to side with violent people almost entirely down to the fact that they're principled .

The story of warring factions within a police force, battling for control of the pay-offs available from street criminals and legitimate businesses alike, is unique and interesting - more so than Nascimento's search for a successor and the conflict of interest of one of his possible replacements - and culminates in an incredible shoot-out that even leaves the movie's street gangsters bewildered.",

I must say that I don't do drugs, even so I don't agree with the movie's point of view. I think that it makes apology for violence, as if it were the only way to fight the traffic. And also put the blame on the drug consumers, saying that traffic only exists because they pay for it. But the movie simply doesn't discuss all the angles of the problem. Drug consumption always existed before traffic; the traffic only began because of the prohibition. Therefore, the consumption, actually, is not the real cause, since it came before. And they just don't bring up to discussion the possibility of all that terrible violence caused by the traffic, and showed in the movie, could be avoided or finished if the State legalized the use of drugs. I argue this prohibition, which started long time ago for economic reasons and purposes, is nonsense nowadays, and very hypocrite, since everybody knows that alcohol, for example, changes the mental alert state of one's mind much more than marijuana, and nicotine from cigarettes has more power to let someone addicted than most of illegal drugs, however they both are legal ones.

I can not get in when he tells me a voiceover instead of the movie.The actors, I do not know if they will all be professionals, but if you believe them, although I do not believe that the bad guys are not worse in reality.Lighting is not bad, but it should be better. Get in more fully.The director, I do not like it. Sometimes I do not see what happens, because of his camera. Not by moving it faster is given more rhythm. He can not catch me and I have a movie left over.Let's see how the second part is, but I'm afraid it will be worse.",

Its realism and honesty about one of the most hopeless tragedies on earth is extraordinary.The nightmarish \"Catch 22\" Rio DE Janeiro is plagued by has never been so well exposed. The police are corrupt! They have little choice. The drug dealers are the police in the favelas. Of course since the police don't police them. The innocents suffer. As always.

And from Wiki: Tropa de Elite (English working title, Elite Squad) is a Brazilian film released on August 24, 2007. The movie is a semi-fictional account of the BOPE, or Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais (English, Special Police Operations Battalion) of the Rio De Janeiro Military Police. It is the second feature film and first fiction film of director Jos\u00e9 Padilha, who had previously directed Bus 174. The script was written by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani, based on the book A Elite da Tropa by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two former BOPE captains, Andr\u00e9 Batista e Rodrigo Pimentel.",

This film is the story of a couple of cops that chose not to ignore what they saw and went to war. The atmosphere is at times suffocating, you feel there's no way out. Not only for the two cops (Neto and Matias) but also for Nascimento. The acting, script and directing were very good. You get into the story easy and hope for a good way out for your favorite characters. I also liked how the film shows the hate they all have (from the people in the slums to the rich people in the city) for the cops in general (the corruption helps a lot here). The hypocrisy of rich people getting upset on the cops for the necessary body check-ups at the check-points, while they themselves buy and use drugs (thus entertaining the drug business and therefore the guns of the drug-dealers and so the necessary body check-ups) is well depicted here. If City of God showed now way out, Elite Squad is certainly presenting one, even though a hard one.",

Maybe the sub-titles don't do justice to the subtleties of Brazilian invective, but even allowing for that, it's pretty basic, and often ludicrous.Still, it's exciting,and in some respects, if you can judge by the comments from Brazil, it tells the truth. The police ARE corrupt. The drug gangs ARE the only authority in some of the favelas. Both corrupt police and drug gangs are sometimes, though inconsistently and infrequently, looking out for the welfare of the teeming masses they exploit and persecute.Poor Captain Nascimento,the 'hero' and narrator, is suffering from stress (not surprisingly) compounded by a bad, but rather unspecified, drug habit. He sweats a lot, is irrationally violent with suspects and colleagues alike, and 'freezes' in critical situations. (Films noirs like 'The Big Heat' handled this kind of thing better more than 50 years ago.)He's got to get out of the front line, because now he has a baby boy, so, after slapping his wife about a bit, he tips his red and yellow pills down the sink and goes out on his last mission. He commits his chosen successor to the job by forcing him to blow their prisoner's head off, (he's a scumbag who deserves to die: it saves time, and Nascimento hopes it will teach the candidate to give up all those moral and intellectual pretensions, which were the reason he was chosen in the first place) It's silly, but it's all good dirty fun, the sound track goes straight to the gonads and Rio looks fabulous.

However, due to the uneven pacing and the inconsistent plot, these aspects are neglected in the latter half of the movie - leaving the viewer with some thrilling action scenes and middling character drama.

If you have the chance, watch this movie, is the perfect retract of the really true of the \"favelas\" from Rio, and it's a great description of the great police force of BOPE.It's a chocked movie, but the true need come up to everybody can see. Watch this movie, I watched 6x times. It's really amazing.So great like SWAT, Israel Army and the another Top forces of the World.The best police movie of the history.",

            "content": "This is without.The story is super complex and depicts very well Rio de Janeiro in 1997. How the police, government, slums, corruption and dealers are all interconnected in a very expansive system that covers the entire city of Rio. Their relationships and how each other affect them in a long term chain it's amazing to see as the story develops in the next 2 hours or so.The characters are many but are we can grasp the personality and traits of the main ones, which reveal their intense stress factors around their work but also how it affects their personal lives as police.The acting is superb. You can clearly see that the actors feel the anxiety and stress related to what they are living. They understand how critical each scene is and they also act accordingly to local customs and traditions.Pimentel, the policeman that inspired the original Capit\u00e3o Nascimento, mentioned that 90% of the background story is true, which gives a rare felling of high reality on a film like never seen before. It feels like a real movie, with perfect accurate scenery and assets that depict what Rio de Janeiro was like in 1997.This movie is masterpiece because it doesn't appear to be a movie, it actually appears to be a real story with a magical camera that was able to capture everything.It's a 10/10. It's a truly amazing work of art.",

A mix of S.W.A.T, Bad Boys, and City of God, Elite Troop, or \"Tropa de Elite\", is one of the greatest movies of all times. Brilliant acting and scene, it portrays the life of a member of BOPE, a special tactical team like America's SWAT, which is in charge of confronting the drug-dealers when the city police can not control them.I strongly recommend this movie for everyone who enjoys real action movies. I recommend however, for everyone to see it when the dialogue is understandable, therefore with subtitles or similar.Enjoy!",

            "content": "The concept, plot and writing is amazing, and even the production values are surprisingly mostly really good, but the cinematography and camerawork is honestly terrible, that's why i recommend cropping to 2.21:1 or a similarly wide \"cinematic\" aspect ratio that hides the flaws of the camerawork and choreography, and makes everything easier to follow. For this movie in particular it makes up and down movements less noticeable and gives the cinematography a much smoother look and makes focusing easier for the viewer. There's a reason its so widely used in hollywood, and It's honestly necessary to enjoy this movie, the original aspect ratio that is about 16:9 is almost nauseating, it has a lot of up and down movement, and camerawork is messy and extremely hard to follow. Stuff that is very mitigated when cropping to 2.21:1, which is the aspect ratio I used, I cropped using VLC, you just press C till you find the right aspect ratio. If you do this, the movie becomes better than 99% of hollywood movies, a masterpiece, it just needed some polishing up in regards to cinematography that can be easily done by us viewers if we use VLC or any other way of cropping.I also recommend watching this and the sequel back to back, both are equally amazing, again, given that you crop the image to mitigate the bad camerawork.",

The movie tells the raw reality of the city of Rio De Janeiro and the form that the State allowed a parallel government's installation in the slums. The most beautiful city of the world lives together the largest contrast of the earth, wealth and poverty side by side. The fight to maintain a subtle balance in the daily of the people, that some times support other times rejects the form of performance of the police in agreement with your personal interests.",
