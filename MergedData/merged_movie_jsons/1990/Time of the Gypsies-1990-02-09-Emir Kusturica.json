            "content": "There is no other movie that has made such a big impact on my life as this one. I remember well the anticipation and excitement I felt when I sat to watch it for the first time, that grey day in March 1989. Upon it's release \"Dom za vesanje\" was received with rave reviews in Yugoslavia, deemed as the most important movie of the Yugoslav cinema by many. And in many aspects it is. Ironically it's a gypsy movie, one of a kind in former Yugoslavia. Gypsies have been principal heroes before in important movies as \"Skupljaci perja\" and \"Ko to tamo peva\", but there never was a gypsy epic like this one before. Or after.The story begins in Slovenia, the year is not given but since the movie \"Breathless\" from 1983 is shown here, it must be mid 80's. The main character is a young gypsy (we later find out that his father was a white Slovenian)named Perhan. His family consists of the wise and shaman-like grandmother Hatidza, who is played very well by Ljubica Adzovic, hard luck gambler of an uncle Merdzan and his sick sister Danira. We follow Perhan in his quest to win the beautiful Azra, girl from the neighbourhood. Since her mother thinks little of Perhan and calls him a bastard, Perhan decides to do anything to prove himself worthy. His chance soon comes in form of a big time gypsy hustler, the so called Champion Ahmed Djida. Ahmed and his two brothers, Zef and Sadam, cruise around gypsy settlements looking to recruit potential thieves and hustlers and make money on them. Perhan is chosen because he possesses telekinetic powers and his charming character falls to Ahmed's liking.The character of Ahmed is perhaps the most interesting and complex one. First he is shown as a rogue with a heart of gold who takes Perhan under his wing and becomes like a father Perhan never had. He even offers to get Danira into a hospital and pay for her treatment. Later as we follow Ahmed and his sordid family we find out that they are nothing more than a gang of crooks looking to take advantage of the first naive youth with no money.Perhan is soon attracted to the world of petty crime and starts enjoying its' advantages. In not too long, the poor gypsy with a less than impressive appearance is turned into a fancy-looking player and charmer. When he returns home however, his grandmother is appalled at the change she sees in her beloved grandson. He has changed and it is apparent also in the way he acts towards Azra. He suspects her of whoring after he finds out that she's pregnant, even though he had slept with her before that. The splendor of their wedding is therefore shown in a negative way. Now that he has become more than accepted by everyone in his community, especially Azra's witchy mother, he is not satisfied anymore. The dream he had has vanished.He therefore decides to return to Ahmed, together with Azra. This is where everything goes wrong. No matter how much Azra tries to convince him that he is the father of their child, Perhan won't have none of it. \"We'll make our own child\" he responds harshly. All this pushes Azra over the edge and she dies after giving birth to their son in a visually overwhelming scene. Perhan casts himself into the abyss of self destruction and he doesn't even know what becomes of his son. He spends his days drinking and Ahmed shows concern, the last time we see him do this. Soon thereafter, Ahmed has a heart attack. Not long after his recovery, he vanishes and takes Perhan's share of the loot. After finding out Danira is still not cured, Perhan seeks revenge over Ahmed.One of the most touching moments is when Perhan meets his son, named after him. Acting by Davor Dujmovic is really top notch here and it's a wonder how this 19-yearold could have displayed such maturity on screen. It is a real tragedy that Dujmovic never got the chance to build a stable acting career, instead being tossed crumb parts after this. It is a mystery and a disturbing thing that such a talent could have gone neglected since. Bora Todorovic is also marvelous as Ahmed and steals most of the scenes he's in. Sinolicka Trpkova as Azra also does a fine job as well as Husnija Hasimovic who plays Merdzan.This movie is a feast for the eye for it contains a good deal of interesting and spectacular imagery and dream scenes which rank up with the best ever filmed. My favourite is Perhan's first dream, where he dreams about Azra and himself getting married. Some of the motifs are clearly borrowed from Tarkovski's \"Andrey Rublev\", yet the music and the scenery are incredible and carry a distinctive gypsy feel which is magic. That is what makes this movie a standout, for there has rarely been done a movie about gypsies in such a stunning way. Some critics have since proclaimed \"Underground\" as Kusturica's best work, but I have no doubts that this is where Kusturica topped. It was his last picture made in the former Yugoslavia and as such a magnificent farewell. The way this movie ends is really heartbreaking and leaves little hope to the viewer. But I guess Yugoslav movies rarely ever did.",

So powerful with symbolism and story telling, \"Time of Gypsies\" delivers amazing performances on acting, settings, musical scores, and overall directing.In year 1988, this movie was one of the most awaited films in the Istanbul International Film Festival. I was one of the lucky ones who had a ticket for the film. When the show time arrived, it was obvious that there was a problem since the film did not started. A lady from the festival committee came to the stage announcing their appology and explaining what the problem was; they were expecting the copy of the film from the its distributor in USA. Unfortunately there was a logistics problem, so they had to get it directly from Yugoslavia. When the festival organisation put their Yugoslavian translators at work they did not understand which language it was! And a cleaning lady, who was an actual gypsy figured out that the movie was in Gypsy language. So it was not possible to translate it for the festival.So they offered an apology and refund in case anybody did not want to watch it without subtitles.Nobody left the theatre. We watched the movie without understanding a word. But, at the end there was a standing ovation at the theatre went on for a couple of minutes.",

Emir Kusturica's storytelling requires some talent, intelligence, and flawless attention to follow and understand correctly, nonetheless it's absolutely unique and fantastic. I would never ever have thought I'd enjoy seeing the world through Yugoslavian gypsies' eyes, but it turned out to be possible so long as it's Kusturica who opens the window. Goran Bregovic's adorable tunes suit the movie perfectly fine too. This movie was one of those that strengthened my opinion which states European movies are a billion times better than American movies. Thanks to Kusturica and Bregovic for producing such a beauty. A perfect 10 for the cast as well.",

            "review_title": "\"Dom za vesanje\" is not worse than \"Karmelita\"",
            "content": "In Russia we have a fine 300 minutes (without kidding) DVD release of the movie (the \"director's cut\"?). It has its moments. The first part is hilarious and witty. The second one is absurd and insane. The third is depressing and scary. The forth is enterprising and weird. The last one is violent and tragic. To crown it all, the only reason that this feature is an outsider (it is not in IMDb top 250) seems to be the following: not many people saw it.It doesn't look like fiction. It feels quite gritty and has very adult topics. The Gypsies look and act like Gypsies (well, at least to my taste and knowledge). There was once a serial on Russian TV called \"Karmelita\", where the Gypsies were shown civilized, snobbish, stylish in their dressing, good-looking, etc. They were talking and talking (in pure Russian, of course, phonetically perfect), showing a little bit more emotion than lamas (sorry my exaggeration). Personally, very thankful to my relatives that they did not spend their precious watching that never ending fiction. The title song in that \"Gypsy\" serial was sung by Mr Nikolay Baskov (a real \"Gypsy\" with blond hair). It lasted as long as 200+ parts mixed with good portion of commercials. Instead of prolonged showing of the \"epic\" \"Karmelita\" our TV should have shown \"Dom za vesanje\". On the other hand, they would have spoiled the whole movie by pushing commercials into it. So, let the matter rest.The only really bad thing about \"Dom za vesanje\" movie seems to be the way of its DVD presentation: after the end of each part there is a kind of sketch of the next one before the credits roll over. These spoilers are not enjoyable.Still it also has some minor drawbacks. To me they are camera-work and the absence of powerful scenery shots, i.e. the lack of the contrast and the ability to see what happens in good detail.An 8 for this poesy of human existence in hellish surroundings will do. Thank you for attention.",

            "review_title": "Romani, Open Cities... Filling Glasses and Bleeding Hearts..",
            "content": "A civilization is a tree whose branches expand to the world while deeply rooted in the motherland, the one place where we cease to be a stranger. But there are eternal strangers who never belong to the place they live in, we call them Nomads, Romani or Gypsies. They have a culture, a language, a music (and how!) and while there might not be a place, there will always be a \"Time of the Gypsies\". On Youtube, an Internet user said about that scene where a devastated Perhan drowns his sorrow in booze and music: \"I don't understand what he's singing but it's like I understand everything.\" That's exactly how emotionally affecting Emir Kusturica's movies are and his 1988 masterpiece that won the Cannes Prize for Best Directing is no exception. Kusturica's movies are culturally specific but universally cathartic. Universal to a certain extent... even if it's set somewhere in Yugoslavia, this is a film about the gypsies, perhaps the most misunderstood if not disdained people on Earth, connected to many infamous caricatures from stealing chicken to prostitution.And it says a lot when the main character is the fruit of the passion between a Slovenian soldier and a gypsy mother who died after giving birth to his sister a few years later. Perhan, to name him... and to call a spade a spade, is a bastard, but Kusturica almost gives this word a touch of nobility, as if it captured the existential status of gypsies, they have traditions and pride but they don't know where they're from, they belong to the present, and their greatest tragedy is to keep on longing for a past so unknown and so far it is deemed to carry a shadow of mystery. Perhan is mysterious in his own way, a young and nerdy insecure boy with a talent for accordion, a turkey for a companion and a telekinetic power. He was raised by his grandmother, the kind of stereotypical gypsy woman whom you'd give her palm and trust whatever she says about your future but there's nothing clich\u00e9 about her, she's perhaps one of the most loving and endearing mother figures from any movie, she drinks, she smokes, forgives her depraved son and love her grandchildren. Ljubica Adzovic gives the kind of performances that always gets Oscar nods, it's a disgrace that she didn't win anything at Cannes, or maybe she's just too authentic for that. Still, she's as pivotal to the film as she is in Perhan's life. Perhan who falls in love with Azra but can't marry her because her mother wouldn't give her daughter's hand to a bastard. This prompts Perhan to become someone and he promises the mother that she'll soon kiss his feet. Circumstances help him when the grandmother cures the son of a rich man named Ahmed (Bora Todorovic, the band leader in \"Underground\"). Ahmed promises to take Perhan under his protections and takes his sister to a hospital in Slovenia, so she can be cured from a severe leg condition. But the film isn't much about that story than it is about the young boy who encapsulates the exhilaration and tragedy of being a gypsy. As a bastard, he's twice an outcast and ostracized in his own community, forcing him to resort to crime in order to win quick cash and become respected. And with his glasses and nerdy smile, Dujmovic bears a striking resemblance with Dustin Hoffman in \"Papillon\" or \"Straw Dogs\" while as the film progresses, his hair grow and he looks more like Hoffman or a Pacino in their prime, with that intensity in the eyes and that oddly charismatic vulnerability.The actor committed suicide in 1999, was it drugs? The Yugoslavian tragedy? Or some secret demons he took to the grave? Whatever it was, I suspect he carried that early enough so it could translate into this performance, one of the greatest performances from a relatively unknown actor, and perhaps the most intense performance in any Kusturica film. Dujmovic is the first reason to enjoy the film or perhaps the second after the music, I saw this film 25 years ago, and I remember I was mesmerized by the themes from Goran Bergovic. I never forgot the scene where they were all floating in the river, following some ancestral ritual and the one where Perhan got drunk after realizing he would also have a bastard as a son. These two emotional peaks illustrate gypsies' predestination for parties because there's so much melancholy and sadness one would rather try to forget them. And yet the film doesn't sugarcoat the other aspects such as prostitution or human traffic, it exposes them with some sort of cynicism on the surface but in reality a way to show that once you don't have rules, you do with what you have at hands and you're the one to set your own limitations or code of honor. The film doesn't show gypsies enjoying begging or stealing or selling children, but it finds a way to show that pride is a variable parameter, a bit like in \"The Godfather\" when you disdain Mafia but you understand why it exists. And for a culture torn between the European accordion and Oriental tunes waltz (I come from North Africa, I can tell you their dances isn't different from ours), nothing surprises me anymore. That's who the Gypsies are, people at the crossroads of the Western and Oriental world, a marriage never bound to happen but worthy of a celebration, the film opens and ends with Kusturica's iconic leitmotif of a wedding leading to a tragedy, and yet a rebirth, a symbol reprised in his \"Underground\". Kusturica has a unique talent to immerse you into the depths of a civilization, as if we were the objects Perhan could move with his simple wizardry, this might be an allegory of Kusturica power. It's all about moving us and making us move at the beat of a trumpet ... or fly like his smiling brides.",

It's amazing to see how talented these amateur actors are and how beautiful the mis en scene is. I always thought about Time of the Gypsies as a kind of answer to the Latin American Magic Realism. Kusturica seems to know which subject requires which specific aesthetic style.The Gypsies in Yugoslavia live in their traditional world as they live in the bizarre modernity of European reality. The clash of these two worlds is what so many so called European auteur directors thematized since the 1960's. Kusturica seems to be very conscious of these art cinema tradition, but he knows also which people he portraits. The East European Gypsies are in a very essential way still nomads, constantly shifting between different realities:the world of dreams, their own traditions, their myths, rituals and beliefs and the hybrid spaces of European criminality. Kusturica portrays these Gypsy worlds with a story that is both modern but also almost like a fairy tale. It is this very mixture that makes this movie brilliant and a must see.",

It is one film containing many simultaneous films (a gangster film; a surreal road movie; a romantic comedy; a rites-of-passage; a Christian allegory).

            "review_title": "Tears of blood and song, joyful",
            "content": "In 1933 Spanish poet and theater director Federico Garcia Lorca gave a lecture in Buenos Aires titled \"Play and Theory of the Duende\" in which he addressed the fiery spirit, the 'duende', behind what makes great performance stir the emotions: \"The duende, then, is a power, not a work. It is a struggle, not a thought. I have heard an old maestro of the guitar say, \"The duende is not in the throat; the duende climbs up inside you, from the soles of the feet.' Meaning this: it is not a question of ability, but of true, living style, of blood, of the most ancient culture, of spontaneous creation.\" So okay, Kusturica has mostly come and gone by now. But for a while he really tapped into a valuable duende. I don't know how much of that translates overseas as anything more than feisty craziness, but for those of us here at least he stirred passions that go back in time. He communicated something of the very fabric of our world.So yes, a living style. Spontaneous creation. Meaning an exaggerated depiction; but one rooted in a recognizable reality, in ancient culture. Reckless people, who consume their beings with spontaneous love or song; the Balkans, meant broadly as a peoples whose common life and toll under Ottoman rule brought them so close, wrote ourselves into this worldview long before Kusturica. Like Goran Bregovic collected old folk songs into new renditions for these films, Kusturica merely translated into cultural images. But oh so well.\u03a4his is why Kusturica really spoke to common people here. He reminded them, yes with so much feisty craziness, about a struggle - not a thought - about a life they instinctively have known from blood; so hard that sometimes it makes the eyes well up with tears of joy. About a woe so deep it can only be expressed with dance or a burning cigarette to the arm. About something inexplicable that turns the soul upside down.Two paths in life then as I see it, both valuable; we should strive to be either Zorbas or Buddhas. That is to say, to either grasp life till it hurts or dispassionately let go. It's about living life fully in the flow of it, and we either vigorously swim or we observe how it all flows away. Everything else is really half-assed stuff, merely trying to stay afloat. Kusturica made films about Zorbas.All this is well. But if we have perhaps invested part of ourselves in cinema, the images behind, Kusturica, especially here, is a real joy to behold. There was Tarkovsky, who inspired him so much; his stare was austere like those lean Christs we find in Orthodox icons. With Kusturica, Tarkovsky's camera becomes magical song, embodying with ardor of life the joyous sadness of a world turned upside down - so much in the film is about things askew, a house suspended in the air, a man hanging himself from a bell, the image of an inverted Christ in the end. So one masterful touch is the cinematic flow. The other is how the flow encompasses an entire life; we have a kid who grows up to see how everything in life breaks, a grownup - as this kid - who has already resigned himself to the fact and is broken himself beyond salvation, a young mother who gives birth and dies like the dead mother who is only hearsay now, a second Perhan who will grow up with only hearsay of that young mother but with a father who came back to him. Fascinating stuff, most importantly because the symbolism is not a full circle, neat, precise, but messy, rugged with life.This is good stuff. It is just not-important enough - in the academic sense - to be really beautiful, and just incomplete enough to allow ourselves to pour into it.",

I remember films as a dynamic experience. The best ones are not a simple thing but an ecology of concepts and emotions that evolve in the 90 or 120 minutes that I commit to. What matters is how far from home they take me, how effectively they go under and around the blocks I set to attempt to define myself. When I write a comment \u2014 even an engaging one \u2014 I am reducing the river to a photograph. As films are a shared experience, some readers may be able to view that photograph and recall the actual experience. But there is a sort of pain in the pretense that you have reduced a living universe to a few static phrases.I'm particularly aware of that penalty in this case. I've seen most of Kustarica's other projects. They simply have too much story for me to fall into the flow: too many boats to see the water. This has a story too, about a boy, a people and the concept of justice. It helps that in this case, the filmmaker invested nothing in the story. Oh, it is engaging because the notions are simple and the characters endearing. But it just provides an excuse for a cinematic flow.And what a flow! There are so many cinematic ideas here, so many notions of visual narrative, so many concepts of integration that you want to go over and over. The eye can gather so much information, orders of magnitude more than we can handle in the mind. The sense of sight is the only one that has evolved an extra layer or pre-mind before the brain gets things. The optical nerve is part conveyance and part processor. It has an eidetic memory that helps with dynamic composition. It is that perceptive mechanism that I think is exploited, no celebrated here.The opening scene by itself is an introduction: a disastrous wedding, the establishment of a whole world of caprice and the selling of a soul all happen in one continuous shot. Along the way, you have some set pieces that you just do not want to leave. There is a celebration of Saint George's day on the water that you will remember all your life, and possibly relate to your first love and the creation of your child. Fire, water, languid seduction, flow and constraint. We cross over into the world of the gypsies, here being a world where morals and laws are as elastic as anything else. From any other perspective, these people are parasites on the main engine of civilization: thieves and beggars. But from the world we comfortably inhabit in the film, they are whole and the world and values are vague. The title is not about A TIME, but the sense of time.Sons and mothers, mothers as fathers. Perhaps there is no more common bridge among worlds, but here it is repeatedly dissolved into the background, as ephemeral as the flows of geese that are the clouds in this sky. I really have no idea how the filmmaker wrangled all these animals to behave so precisely. Even with the risky and difficult long pans there are often perfectly timed actions with animals, mostly birds.See this, my friends. Celebrate Saint Georges day, wade in the water, remember your loves and resist the temptation to freeze it into a memory. Let it flow.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Time of the Gypsies",
            "content": "The Yugoslavian film Time of the Gypsies from director Emir Kusturica tells a truly fascinating story about a young gypsy boy named Perhan, and the ordeals he goes through trying to help his sick sister. What makes Perhan such an interesting character is his telekinetic powers, his somewhat lack of moral, and rich dreams. Not only is the protagonist a vivid character. The entire film is filled with amazingly beautiful scenes and a tremendous soundtrack.Emir Kusturica's take on the gypsies is a most interesting one. Not only does he portray them in the dirtiest, gloomiest, and most unpleasant place in society. Even though they reside in the slum area they seem to be unaffected by their fate, and starts playing on the accordion whenever life seems unfair.It is an interesting concept that the film both starts and ends with weddings, although perhaps not in the exact way one may expect. Both the story arch and Perhan's character arch are just as moving as they are strong. The transition Perhan goes through, from an innocent boy, whose best friend is a turkey that he seems to be able to communicate with, to a slave trader who deals with children, is very gripping. Just as the story starts out in true Shakespearian manner as a comedy, and ends in a tragedy.There is also a reoccurring theme of betrayal throughout the story. Perhan's mother was betrayed, his uncle was cheated on for his mother's attention which went to Perhan instead, and Perhan himself was betrayed several times, which ultimately made him betray people. Emir Kusturica uses this disillusionment to show that although they are living in this world with instances of magical realism; they are humans as well, fully capable of being broken, flawed, and cruel.Emir Kusturica creates a universe that is vast, colorful, and contains many magical things. All masterfully presented in a natural and fully believable way. Not only do we have Perhan's psychic abilities, but his grandmother possesses certain abilities as well. Perhan's relationship with the turkey, a white veil flying in the wind, and several dream sequences, one which takes place on a river, are some of the most memorable in the entire film.This film is one of the very few made with the authentic Romani spoken language in the majority of the runtime. Just this fact alone is worthy of more attention than received. All in all it is just a phenomenal film in its own category without comparison. A must see.",

Totally deserved, because this surreal drama is probably his life's achievement. The somewhat fairy-tale atmosphere of this movie totally hypnotized me and over two hours flew by in a moment. A special acknowledgment should be given to the cast, as its major part consists of amateurs with only a few professional actors. In particular, I have to single out the scene of St. George celebration on the river, which is one of the most impressive movie scenes I've ever seen in my life, and which would probably have provided Academy Award to this film, if it was an American movie.10/10",

And eventually you find that they were quite good just the way they was. And so is this movie. What it wants to tell you is not the story it tells - a story which you may find uninteresting, longish, alien, of no matter to you.

Of course, Yugoslavia under Milosevic's Nationalist fervor would also make the production of this film unlikely.

            "content": "The film \"Time of the Gypsies\" is quite entertaining, but is too lacking in direction for my tastes. This movie starts out as a dark comedy starring a \"bastard\" misfit boy of a gypsy community named Perhan. The teenage boy is first shown as quite innocent and naive, taking everyone for their word. Throughout this film the viewer watches helplessly as Perhan changes from the young innocent boy into a conniving untrusting thug.Perhan goes on a mission with the gypsy hustler \"Ahmed\" who promises he will take Pehan's handicapped sister to a doctor at his own expense. Of course Ahmed lies to Perhan and sends him through a series of transformations by forcing Perhan to join his group of gypsies that expose the young teen to acts of thievery, prostitution, and deceit. This character transformation is convincing and unfortunate, but was the only redeeming factor in this movie for me.I usually prefer movies that don't stick to a specific genre, but instead use whatever elements of each genre to make the best movie possible. Unfortunately I didn't like the genre mixes in this film. The first 1/4 of the film is a dark romantic comedy. Perhan chases a girl and wins her heart, but when he cannot win her parents approval, he attempts to hang himself. I found this scene more disturbing than humorous which I think it was meant to be. The rest of the film is a tragedy with Perhan's spiraling downfall into a life of lies and crime. Random magical elements are introduced along the way such as Perhan's telekinesis that is only practically used once in the film.I felt like the mixture of so many elements did not turn out as well as the director imagined they would, and it became a messy storyline that I found difficult to take anything away from. Overall, the film is entertaining, but I felt as though it didn't have enough redeeming qualities for me to recommend it to anybody.",

            "content": "Based on a 1985 story about the kidnapping of hundreds of Gypsy children by Yugoslavs who sold them to Americans and Italians, Emir Kusturica's The Time of the Gypsies is the story of an orphaned boy who leaves his home and falls prey to ruthless exploiters of children. The film was written by Gordan Mihic and photographed by Vilko Filac and contains an entrancing score by Goran Bregovic. It received a five-minute standing ovation at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival where Kusturica won the award for Best Director, yet unfortunately provides a view of the Romas that simply reinforces stereotypes about the culture.Perhan (Davor Dujmovic) is an idealistic young man who is adept at telekinesis (the ability to move objects without touching them). He lives just outside of Skopje with his grandmother Hatidja (Ljubica Adzovic), his uncle Merdjan (Husnija Hasimovic), and his sister Danira (Elvira Sali) who suffers from a bone disease. The film strongly emphasizes the traditional values of Gypsy culture personified by the warm and caring grandmother whose healing powers are well known to the village. The main theme of the film is the punishment meted out by the spirits to Perhan when he moves away from these values. Perhan is in love with a village girl named Azra (Sinolicka Trpkova) but his attempts to marry her are rejected by her stern mother because he lacks money, uncharacteristically placing material wealth over spiritual values.Determined to be considered worthy of marrying Azra, Perhan is easy prey for Ahmed, a criminal originally from the village, who has become rich by selling children to Italians and forcing them to beg and steal for him. Ahmed comes to his grandmother for help for his dying son and, when she restores his son to health, demands that Ahmed pay for a much needed operation for Danira. After he vows to pay for an operation and brings Danira and Perhan to Ljubliana, Perhan soon discovers his true way of life when Ahmed stops to collect young people along the way. The message that what appears good may be hiding darker intent is symbolized by Danira's vision of the spirit of her dead mother who has come to warn her of impending evil.At first unwilling to earn money dishonestly, Perhan soon discards his idealism for the pursuit of money and goes into business with Ahmed, recruiting children for sale and putting beggars to work collecting money. In the process, Perhan becomes as ruthless and unforgiving as Ahmed when, after Ahmed suffers a stroke, he takes over the business. I was drawn into the characters and identified with them, especially Perhan, but his abrupt shift into a heartless mobster seemed unmotivated and unconvincing. On a visit home, he rejects Azra for becoming pregnant while he was away, even though she insists that the baby is his. As Perhan continues to reject the values of the culture that he was raised on, his misfortunes multiply and the ending delivers a sad but inevitable lesson that does not leave us with much hope.Time of the Gypsies dazzles us with moving cans, and spoons climbing up the wall but left me with little true understanding of the Romani culture. Kusturica shows them as lying, thieving, and whoring, but never asks about the racism in society that led them to their way of life, or talks about the sixty to eighty percent unemployment rate for Gypsies in Central Europe. While Time of the Gypsies contains an often-enchanting magical realism and its story about the corruption of innocence has universal appeal, I left the film feeling empty and dissatisfied.",

'Underground' deserves its kudos - it is genuinely brilliant - but I found 'Black Cat, White Cat' and 'Arizona Dream' quite empty, more style than substance, and the latter quite pretentious.Unfortunately, 'Time of the Gypsies' falls more in the category of the latter two than of 'Underground'. Like those two this film is full of irritating characters, thus limiting your engagement level. Even Perhan, the \"hero\" of the story, isn't entirely likeable.The plot and editing don't help either. The film takes forever to go anywhere and when it does it's still not that interesting. For the most part the film just drifts.

In the Time of the Gypsies, a film which seems to pre- cursor such notarized films about third world countries in desperate financial means, like recent Academy Award Winner \"SlumDog Millionaire,\" shows how the simple life of a small town boy, can quickly turn into dreams of fortune only to be ruined through a life of corruption and disease. The central message conveyed in Emir Kusturica's picture is that simplicity is far better lived than the life of moral abandonment. Perhan played by Davor Dujmovic, outwits a wonderful performance as a young boy with dreams of marrying his loving youthful girlfriend Azra. Because he comes from a line of poor gypsies, his name is smeared and thus can't provide a fortune to the kin of his future to be wife. In a key scene, which shows the anguish of his pain that separates him from marrying her, is found trying to hang himself from a city bell. The bell calls out to all those in the town to hear of his cries, and to announce to the town that rather death than be separated from a world of love with Azra. Such a film about a boy who can dream of a future with his spouse and fortune is none other a better film with a combination of surreal landscapes. His dreams of a fire bred wedding on the river, while his wife lays flat in her canoe, breasts exposed, can only eroticize the day that comes when he can lay naked with her and make love to her on her wedding day. Soon we discover, this dream of seeding her for a future together could come crashing down at his own moral betrayal into a life of crime and deceit. His grandmother, played emotionally pitch perfect by Ljubica Adzovic, longs to have her grand-daughter's legs fixed just like \"Marilyn Monroe.\" After being born with crippled legs, the grandmother with all the money she had been saving, found the perfect opportunity to have her daughter cured. After curing the son of a gambler Amed, she begs to have her only son relieved of his gambling debt and her granddaughter taken into Milan to have her legs fixed. Soon the agreement is made, and Perhan goes along to accompany his young sister for the surgery. Soon it turns out that the young girl stays behind in Milan, awaiting surgery, while Perhan is taken to the streets to steal money. Through his crime work, Perhan is promised a new home and a sister with new legs, but in secrecy Ahmed has not made any of his promises kept. His sister has taken to the streets as a beggar, and a home has never been made. All along, Perhan finds himself at anger with how he could be betrayed and left for scum. A man whom he looked up to as a father, was none other than a selfish crime lord feeding his own personal wishes of fortune and satisfaction. Although the film can be defined as a tragic tale about the mishaps of money and power, and almost like the American dream of treasures awaiting, a picture like this is important for any audience member to understand how greed can bring about the death of the human soul. Dark and bitter, sweet only in the beginning, a film like such can only weave through a viewer a tale of innocence and hope turned to dust.",

As I write this, over seventy five percent of IMDb visitors to this film rate it higher than an '8', and not one of the reviewers on this forum gave it less than a '4'. Not that it deserves a 1,2, or 3 rating, but it just seems unusual to me. Maybe it's a cultural thing, or maybe I just don't get what Emir Kusturica is trying to say with his pictures. His \"Black Cat, White Cat\" struck me the same way, and I did only slightly better with \"Underground\". Like the first picture I mentioned, the characters here aren't very appealing, to the point of being almost annoying. None of them will be making the pages of Esquire or Vanity Fair anytime soon. And what's with the preponderance of waterfowl? There were plenty of geese in that one too. The hook for this story is the protagonist Perhan (Davor Dujmovic) having telekinetic ability, which he uses as a means to astonish or frighten others. It also proves to be his undoing in the final act, when he uses a flying fork to dispatch his uncle. Between the language barrier and somewhat disjointed scenes, I'm puzzled as to how this film cracks IMDb's Top 250 list, making it for the first time in 2020. I can't see it remaining there beyond a year.",

It's a drama, a comedy, a coming of age movie and even a crime movie. With all these multiple themes in it the movie still manages to feel as a whole, even when the main character himself ages and drastically changes, through the circumstance he has to endure.The movie focuses on the Gypsy life, which us outsiders never get to see or understand much about but it has all of the stuff in it you always hear and read about. It seems like an honest and true enough portrayal. The movie mainly focuses on one boy, who's life seems empty and meaningless and who is being somewhat forced to enter the criminal life due to the bad circumstances he lives in. When he is put outside of his 'safe' environment he starts to age fast and the movie becomes a real coming of age movie, in which the main character also decides to make his own destiny.Emir Kusturica seems definitely like a capable director to me, who's movies also always seem to have a surrealistic undertone in it. The movie is raw and gritty, also with its depressing settings, but still the movie manages to feel very lively. It makes the movie a real powerful and effective experience.The movie also has some great actors in it, who all seemed to be born to play these parts. Davor Dujmovic was a great leading man in this movie, despite of his still quite young age. In real life he actually ended up worse than the his character in this movie and he died in 1999 after suicide by a drug overdose.A really well made movie that makes this a great little movie to watch!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

While the movie does have some interesting scenes, it comes across as a premature draft of what could have been a superior film. This directorial neglect is best exemplified by the diligent detail that is placed in the river scene during Act 1, contrasted by the poorly rushed time lapses throughout the rest of the story \u2500 particularly a careless crunch of 4 years into 30 seconds during Act 3.However, given the fact the film falls into the category of \"Magical Realism\", it is debatable that these irrational loops need no justification within the realm of the story. But considering that the director takes full advantage of the unlimited freedom these \"magical\" elements provide, perhaps it would benefit him to pay attention to the basic details that might assist the \"realism\" elements as well.For those seeking to broaden their film literacy, this movie is worth watching for its peculiar characters alone (Ahmed's toddler dressed in his miniature fur coat carrying his musical Teddy bear will probably be the most memorable). Otherwise, it is perfectly acceptable to skip it.",

Before seeing this movie, the first image that came to mind when hearing the word \"gypsy\" was that of panhandlers, pickpockets and thieves. Perhaps because my one and only encounter with the gypsies, was that of having my wallet stolen in Rome. In \"Time of the Gypsies\" I got the chance to look at them with new eyes. While peeking into their world, I found myself celebrating, laughing and crying with them. I couldn't help but fall in love with Perhan (Davor Dujmovic), our protagonist. Perhan starts off as a goody two-shoes boy with funny glasses who plays the accordion and has a pet turkey. Oh, and let's not forget his telekinetic powers. It's not long before he sets his sights on Azra (Sinolicka Trpkova) and the two youngsters fall in love. A turn of events has Pelham leave town, in hopes of that his younger sister Danira (Elvira Sali) will receive the operation that will have her walk normally, free of pain. While away he becomes a \"businessman\" of sorts. Only to have us wishing he could return to the days of childlike innocence. I imagine it all occurs as dream come true for Perhan, at least at first. Perhan and the others are in for a roller-coaster ride, as are we. In fact nothing is what it seems. Kusturica enchants us with his touches of magical realism, pulling us into a world where we suspend all disbelief, where anything is possible and we can't help but go along for the ride. All in all \"Time of the Gypsies\" is a beautiful film. Bravo!",

Like the actual Romany culture that inspired it the film is often tragic and emotional, but at the same time filled with earthy humor and an unbridled, sometimes chaotic passion for life. Director Emir Kusterica shows an almost visionary sense of time and place, and within his sprawling, kaleidoscopic narrative are moments of breathtaking magic realism, including a stunning dream sequence (witnessed by the young hero and his pet turkey) above a wild, pagan wedding ritual on a faraway river. The film opens a window to an often grim and brutal but always exotic landscape, totally alien to outsiders but likely to appeal to the gypsy in all of us.",

            "content": "Time of the Gypsies was a good movie to watch because of its different genres, ranging from comedy to tragedy. It is not a movie I would normally want to see but I'm glad I was able to watch it. The movie is about a young innocent boy named Perhan who is in love with a girl called Azra. He leaves with a powerful man, Ahmed, who makes money off of crime. Perhan is a boy of magical power who then adapts to the ways of Ahmed. He makes money and comes back to his town to see that the love of his life Azra, is pregnant. However, he still marries her as promised even though he believes the child is not his own. Unfortunately, Azra dies while giving birth to who may or not be Perhan's son. Perhan had been promised a house from Ahmed that he did not get and had lost all the money he had saved up and therefore plans for revenge against Ahmed. He succeeds in killing Ahmed and his brothers only to be killed himself. The movie ends with a powerful scene in which we see Perhan's body in the coffin and his \"son\" stealing the coins off his body. This questions us as to whether he is Perhan's actual son or Perhan's uncle's son. This is not the point of the movie however, the point is to show us how simply a young man's life can be changed. The movie is cyclical, it starts off with Perhan being an orphan with magical power and ends with young Perhan being the same way. It shows that even though all this went on, there will always be innocent boys like Perhan and criminals like Ahmed. The movie gives an outlook to how the other half lives. The movie contains magical realism and approaches it in a realistic way. It shows real life situations with tragedies yet a touch of comedy. It is definitely an interesting movie that I enjoyed watching.",

The Director Emir Kusturica does a marvelous job in getting the audience to go through suspend of disbelief. We can go through the movie and really get into it as if it were real. For example one of my favorite scenes from the movie was when Perhans uncle goes crazy and literally suspends the roof of the house in the air! The cinematography was incredible, the rain in the scene really highlighted the effect on the audience. Perhan's character goes from a weird geeky kid into a being the head of a clandestine group who was lead by another gypsy who later becomes like the father figure Perhan never had. The story of an orphan Parhan repeats itself, elliptical pattern can be seen because towards the end of the film we go back to the beginning in a way. The light motif of the film can be the turkey, it reappeared in different areas of the film for example when Perhan dies. The turkey for Perhan was like the pet or the unconditional friend he never had. His life was full of let downs and bleakness that can be related to almost any teenager growing up. By Kustirica being so specific on one minority group it really led us to relate in the humanistic traits that we all have like unconditional forgiveness in the family that we can see in this movie. It seemed that the gypsy community really valued family togetherness, although they fight and do really crazy things to each other like steal, lie and betray one another at the end of the day they forgave each other which is something here in the US can be very hard to do. The film really captured the gypsy spirit in my opinion, the cinematography was what made the movie stand out, the magic realism was amazing. It was the rite amount for the audience to commit to the story. Overall the film was great, Kustirica did a fantastic job!",

This movie starts that way, but as time passes, it turns from a comedy into a tragedy showing how the search for wealth and power, no matter what heir reasons, ends up by corrupting them.In this coming of age tale, we follow Perhan, a young gypsy with telepathic powers whose ambition is as big as his misfortunes. Hoping for his disabled sister to get better care, he sets out on an adventure that brings him out of his secluded life in a gypsy camp in Bosnia and into Italy, where he starts to work for a \"godfather\" type figure, Ahmed, who only cares about earning as much money as possible having kids and cripples begging and stealing in the streets of Milan, and who keeps constantly betraying Perhan's trust. When Perhan, who thorough the movie turns more and more corrupt, becoming, in his own way, Ahmed's successor, finally reaches his boiling point. It is then that he loses what little innocence he had left and using his telepathic powers, which at the beginning seemed useless, he kills his mentor.Music plays an important part in gypsy culture and that is shown in Time of the gypsies, where Bregovic's amazing score sets the mood, creating incredible moments such as when a band sings while Perhan leaves his family in Ahmed's truck and we see how, on the way to Italy, Ahmed buys kids and disabled people to go work for him or the music played during the scenes taking place at St. George's festival.

            "review_title": "An ardent tragedy.",
            "content": "Dom za vesanje is a coming of age story in a destitute region of Yugoslavia. From the first scene where a disheveled man speaks directly to the audience, breaking the 4th wall (perhaps a tribute to French New Wave), it is evident that this movie is going to break up practical time, space, and reality.I adore this film for many reasons: the dream sequences, the symbolism, the leitmotifs, the life lessons, the music, and the focus on natural beauty. Kusturica tells a story that brings attention to a group of people commonly cast in a negative light.The scene in which the St. George's festival takes place is most important, and I believe that is why it is the scene in which Goran Bregovi\u0107's ardent Ederlezi is fully played. The scene symbolizes the loss of innocence and the destruction passion can bring. It begins with Perhan floating down to the water. This plays with the audience-unsure if he's dreaming. What I feel is being portrayed is the idea that sometimes it feels like we move from one day to the next almost instantaneously. One moment we are dreaming, and the next, we are somewhere else. Kusturica expresses this idea quite poetically through this transition. Because Perhan's and Azra's virginity is lost here, this scene signifies a major shift in the story. At the end of the film, we discover that it did happen for that was when they made love. The entire community is gathered in celebration, playing with fire, we see Azra burning Perhan's name onto the flesh covering her ribs, Haditza crying as she stares out across the water, and then Perhan and Azra floating carelessly and euphorically away as a fire burning on the water crosses our view of their raft. The latter is one of many foreshadows and symbols for what is to come because fire is a symbol of creation, sustenance, and destruction.The first use of foreshadow occurs at the very beginning of the film when a bride is unhappy about her husband being drunk, unsatisfied that her wedding did not turn out as planned. Discontent with plans going awry is one theme in the film. The biggest upset, central to the main storyline, is Danira's supposed trip to the hospital. Another example is when Perhan plans to buy his uncle a small television so that he can, 'have the world in his hands.' Later, at Perhan's wedding a sullen Merdzan is shown watching the television which plays static or what may be a screen test. It seems that nothing goes as planned-a life lesson for all. The second use of foreshadow occurs at the beginning of the film when a pregnant girl's mother confronts Haditza about her son Merdzan's promiscuity, 'he's sleeping with the whole town.' We are so wrapped up the hilarity of Haditza's response that we do not later recall this and stop to wonder what threat Merdzan's zany and, yet, distraught recklessness may pose to an absent Perhan. Merdzan's character is a foreshadow and a symbol. He represents the effect war, poverty, the loss of a spouse, and gambling can have on a person's rational judgment. The symbolism lies in the effect of war and poverty on all Yugoslav's. The foreshadowing pertains to Perhan's eventual loss of his spouse and his gambling with his sister's, and his own, life, in hopes of fixing his and Danira's life.Many facets of Yugoslavian life are symbolized within various leitmotifs throughout the picture. There are weddings, fires, veils, and box-like structures. An often overlooked leitmotif, and most telling in that, is the use of box-like structures: cardboard boxes, houses (which can be lifted as easily as cardboard), and the water closet. They are used for security, protection, games, and privacy. Yet, it is all an illusion. To live in that time and place was to be vulnerable.There is a sense of closure at the end of the film. When Perhan died, I did not feel as upset as when Azra died. Because her death was untimely and without emotional closure, it was uncomfortable and heart-rending. However, Perhan was able to tie up all of his loose ends. He came to terms with the fact that Azra was not lying. When he sees the veil around the lamp it feels like he recalls the vision of his mother and her veil, and so sees Azra as his mother and, therefore, Azra's child as himself. The way they look at each other as she passes away is evidence enough of this and did not require dialogue for clarification. Next, he rescues Danira and his son and sends them back home to Haditza. He, and the audience, further recognizes the child Azra bore as his son when the son makes a prescient statement to Perhan, indicating that he knows that he is not coming back and that he will not see him again. Finally, he uses his 'useless' talent to get revenge on Ahmed. Additionally, Perhan's son, also named Perhan, replaces his father. That and the agelessness of Haditza, Danira, and Perhan during the four years of his search are the strongest examples of a timeless quality within the film.There is so much more to be said about this film's brilliance, even that which was unintentional. It is, in itself, a foreshadowing of the Yugoslav civil war. One line, barely noticeable, struck me as a hidden criticism of the state of things. When Danira is being wheeled away at the hospital, the doctor says, 'comrade Tito will take care of you.' It is a haunting line. More telling of the problems with the living situations is that the only lucrative profession in the film requires reducing other Gypsies to goods, selling them. The characters must turn on each other to survive. After all, the literal translation for the title is A Time for a Hanging.",

Kusturica has done a fine job capturing the essence of various scenes and making them more interesting based on the camera movement. It is a movie that also changes genres in the middle of the movie. At first the audience would think it as a comedy, but as the movie goes deeper it can be viewed more as a tragedy. I thought it made the movie more interesting by changing its story. The audience feels more sympathy for the characters when at first we laugh with them, and then we feel for them at hardships because it brings us closer to the characters. Thr movie contains at different parts of the movie moments of fantasy that makes this story of Gypsies more captivating. When Azra gives birth for instance, it doesn't seem real, but more of a fantasy. The main focus deals with money and power, and how power can influence a person. There is always an endless cycle of means of gaining wealth through the generations, and this movie does a fine job capturing this on film.",

Even so, we are still left with this sort of continuous circle that we started on at the beginning of the story - will Perhan's \"son\" fall into the same trap as Perhan? Will someone replace Ahmed?Furthermore, the cinematography and soundtrack complimented one another so well in this film that every moment was absolutely breathtaking. For instance, the music playing when Azra (Perhan's newly-wed wife) is giving birth was an especially amazing moment. It is also worth taking note of Azra levitating in the air, which is another element of the plot that was cleverly weaved into the story in a way the film was able to retain its realist feel.

            "content": "This is a story told in magical realism about a group of gypsies' life in the splintered Yugoslavia. Pehran who possesses telekinetic powers, lives with his grandmother and his sister Danira. He wishes to get married to Azra but her mother won't allow him. When Perhan leaves to Ljubljana with his sister who must have an operation, Perhan is forced into the criminal world and goes to Milan without her, trying to earn capital so that he can build a house. Four years pass and Pehran finally returns home where he finds Azra pregnant with what he believes is another man's child. Azra on the other hand claims that the child is his. Perhan refuses to believe her and reject her in every way. When Azra give birth to the baby, she dies in childbirth. The movie doesn't explicitly suggest that the child is Perhan's, however, it seems to imply that this would be the case. Things such as the apples that were symbolically pointed out as a tie between Perhan and his grandmother in the beginning, now functions as a tie between the son and him. And maybe what is more important is that it doesn't really matter as this point. Perhan is suffering emotionally because of Azra's death and the many incidents that he has been through, and through his telekinetic powers he finally kills his uncle and short thereafter, he is killed himself. What's nice about this movie is that we can see beyond the surface of a people and their way of living. The story is absolutely wonderful, very humorous and at the same time incredibly tragic! It also has a very fine line between realism and fantasy leaning to magical realism. It has some radical transitions where we need to pay attention to what is going on. The progression of the story is very interesting. It starts out humorous and ends completely different, altering between realism and fantasy. In a way, the story itself at the end is back at square one which serves as a metaphor for that this story, which seems so unique probably been repeated generation through generation.",

Certain aspects in the film might give the wrong explanation to the viewers. For example, Perhan's ability to bend and move things with his mind might have viewers asking what is the point of his powers if he can't get his family out of the slums. I often confuse this film with Slumdog Millionaire, I guess it's because of the similar story about exploiting children. I wonder if they actually got the idea from Time of the Gypsies. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about. Before you see Slumdog, see Time of the Gypsies first. It makes you think of how we all live in this circle of life.",

            "content": "This movie has a very nice blend of comedy and tragedy. Often times Kusturica puts you in the position where you find yourself laughing at the irony of Perhan's misfortunes and crying at the beauty of his ambition. The story follows the path of a young boy's loss of innocence as he dedicates himself to the well being of his family and naively sacrifices his integrity for them. Though it is not entirely his fault, it is surely that naivet\u00e9 that is both the source of his folly and it's redemption. There are occasional moments of surrealistic events in which they unfold in a manner that leaves their existence ambiguous though later events support it. It's almost as if Kusturica combines reality with the character's imagination and the resulting product is the subjective experience of the character. These are probably the scenes that contribute the most to the movies replay value as it's becomes fun to decide what's real and whats in Perhan's head. While the ending kind of left me thinking \"Why? Perhan, Why?\" I still loved the movie as a whole and have been recommending it to anyone who loves movies.",

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypsies\" is a very effective film for a young person. It deals with the harsh reality that young people go through in life. Perhan has to deal with a difficult family life. His parent's aren't around. He's being raised by his Gypsy grandmother along with his younger sister. He has an uncle that the family can not trust. The uncle helps destroy their home. Perhan is given a turkey that he cares for. The uncle boils the turkey. Perhan is a also in love with a girl that the uncle ends up sleeping with. The girl becomes pregnant and Perhan suspects that the child is his uncle's. These are the kinds of issues that could trouble a young person. Young love can be a tough situation. The ability to trust someone is tested when young people fall in love. Perhan is unable to trust the older generation because they keep doing bad things to him. When his sister gets sick, the grandma has an idea to send them away. Even though the grandmother is the moral center of Perhan's life, her idea causes trouble for Perhan. It's Perhan's absence that leads to the girl sleeping with the uncle. Although he doesn't blame his grandmother, he could have. Perhan gets involved with the older Ahmed. Ahmed lies to Perhan about building him a house and taking care of his sister. It's another example of the older generation mistreating the younger. Young people often wish they had special powers. Perhan has a telekinetic power. He uses the power to get revenge on Ahmed and his henchmen. It's a young person's fantasy. However things take a turn for the worst. Perhan is shot and dies. The lesson is that even young people aren't invincible. Young people should know that they won't live forever and could even be killed at a young age. Perhan does not become part of the older generation. Instead he stayed a young man all his life. There's a dark theme that the older generation couldn't even give Perhan is own adult life. They mistreat him leading all the way to his own death at a young age. \"Time of the Gypsies\" has the theme that young people are not immortal. Perhan should of let his anger and emotions go and he would of still been alive. Young people can be stubborn and often pay the price for it. He's not able to experience the things that older people go through such as marriage and parenthood. Yet he was so close to experiencing those things. It's tragic. His young bride dies earlier giving birth. She's another example of tragic youth. There's a \"Romeo and Juliet\" influence over their love story. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is another tragic love story about young people and how the older generation attempts to control them. They both die in a tragic way. They aren't able to see their future together and they die young. It's very similar to what happens in \"Time of the Gypsies\".",

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypsies\" is, in a sense, a film about the loss of childhood and innocence, and the disillusionment with the world that inevitable follows--but it is so much more than that. Perhan is at first a young Gypsy boy with telekinetic powers and the kind of exuberance for life that only children seem capable of. He gets his first taste of disillusionment when is barred from marrying Azra, the girl he loves, because he is a poor bastard child who lives with his grandmother. Soon Perhan leaves his gypsy village and his home (or what's left of it after his drunken, gambling uncle goes crazy one night) to seek medical help for his sick sister and to try and make some money with the gypsy \"money king\" and his band of travelers.This is where Perhan's real disenchantment with life begins. After being forced to leave his sister in a hospital, witnessing things like the buying and selling of newborn babies like simple farm animals (not to mention being beaten senseless in the mud), Perhan is forced to accept the conniving and deceitful gypsy methods of income. After some betrayal and police intervention, Perhan even becomes the leader of this ragtag gang of beggars and thieves. He returns to his village as the hardened image he thinks a man should be. He finds Azra pregnant and refuses to believe the child is his own, blaming his own crazed uncle. Perhan states he cannot trust people ever since he started lying. He has money and marries Azra, but he is not happy. Life is now about finding midgets and cripples to start a new gang and start making money. Despite the spoiler warning, I don't want to give away much more of the story (this only covers the first half or so). Suffice it to say, things continue to go relatively poorly for Perhan as he is sucked deeper and deeper into the dark gypsy world of crime and deceit, completing his disillusionment with the world.What I love about this movie is how constantly engaging it is. The village feels like a real gypsy shanty town, it is the only movie made in the authentic language of the gypsies (Romani), and most of the actors were actual gypsies. The characters are all very real and complex and everything is simply authentic and absorbing. Even Perhan's powers (as well as his grandmothers')are treated realistically, as if it were perfectly natural for these mysterious gypsies to have supernatural powers and to question it would be simply ridiculous.I found myself fascinated by the entire gypsy culture presented, something I think most viewers will really appreciate. I absolutely loved Perhan, though he had his despicable moments, and viewers will find themselves cheering for him (or berating, but rooting for him nonetheless). Some of my favorite moments in this film were in the beginning, just watching Perhan and the rest of the village simply going about there lives, especially the parts with the turkey. \"Time of the Gypsies\" is a fantastic movie and you should see it. Amazing and unique story, though it can be a little slow in places, the gypsy music is awesome, the film is speckled with beautiful and humorous moments, and the cinematography is top notch, creating a real sense of mood and atmosphere. In a word, extraordinary. Go see this movie.",

The plot does meander around until the movie does the epic lifting of the house. At that point, I would be happy to find a simple conclusion after that climatic action but the plot keeps going. I wasn't sure about Perhan in the big cities. It's not the place I'm interested in but then the movie becomes a character journey for Perhan. His descend is heart-breaking and his declaration for his son is jaw-dropping. I felt my soul being ripped out. This movie has some of the most shocking turns.

A film that's going to resonate more with the demographic it captures a microcosm of than one with a global appeal. Still, the story tackles themes that are universal while offering an interesting insight into their life & culture.Co-written & directed by Emir Kusturica, the first half is all over the place and has no sense of direction. Too much is thrown on the screen in too little time, and the cheap production value, amateurish acting & lame attempts at humour don't help the cause either. Things however do get better during the second half which is far more focused, and dots do connect by the time it nears its end.At its core, the film is a coming-of-age crime fantasy about a young boy's journey from adolescence to adulthood, with superstitions, dreams & magic weaving into the narrative threads the same way these mystical elements are deeply entwined in the gypsy community's history & culture. The performances are inconsistent at first but the central drama slowly becomes more gripping as plot progresses.Overall, Time of the Gypsies paints a fascinating portrait of gypsy life on the film canvas but it takes a little while to warm up to it. Its 140 mins runtime is strongly felt during the first half but the longer one stays on board, the better the journey gets, plus the final act is riveting throughout. Definitely more geared towards the people it represents yet not devoid of pain & struggle that everyone can relate to, this Yugoslav classic is worth a shot.",

The gypsy concept is little awkward to accept and accessing the realism from it is even more difficult, but otherwise this film has been amazing throughout the narrative. This one is on a level of whatever classic crime dramas Hollywood has made and it comes with a very less budget and smaller industry comparatively. Well, that doesn't mean it is smaller at content or filmmaking, rather it gets even better with local talents. The film revolves around Perhan, a Romani teenager with telekinetic powers and his passage from childhood to adulthood which starts in a little village in Yugoslavia and ends in the criminal underworld of Milan. You see, the story is quite similar to any Hollywood crime drama or english novel but it has two things very different from others and that's the localism and the cultural references. I don't understand their language but that background score is still reviberating in my ears. See, that's the magic of quality music beyond the barriers of language. What a performance Davor Dujmovic has gave in the lead role. That continuous transformation of his characters was built so well and he acquired it so perfectly. I couldn't recognise if he was the boy i saw in first frame and then in the last frame. The entire acting unit of the film has given thier souls to the characters without any compromises. Director Emir Kusturica's brutal and realistic vision to explore the ugly world is unshakeable and uncompromised. He didn't hesitate to use vulgarity and brutality wherever it was needed and that's why this common storyline became a brilliant cinematic experience. Overall, a Classic Crime Film with the right balance dark and light both the themes.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

To start with, the portrayal of the Gypsy community is highly rich and detailed with authentic settings and emotional personages. The desperate longings of the teenage boy protagonist are mostly things that anybody can relate to, even as he is exploited by the unscrupulous Ahmed. What follows is a plunge into the dark world of crime, human trafficking and deception that ultimately results in the Pyrrhic victory of basic humanity. It is a multi-faceted film that does not fit easy categorisation into tragedy nor comedy, its emotional arc not easily described as uplifting nor disastrous, its effect not easily ascribable to any particular theme or factor. This film is a work of art in its most inscrutable sense.",

First and foremost it stigmatizes and confirms prejudice against the Romany people. In the second place it don't work in conjunction with the magical realism which normally is Emir Kusturica's strength.A few years ago I did like the ostalgia \"avant la lettre\" of \"Do you remember Dolly Bell?\" (1981, Emir Kusturica).

Kusturica has a very unique vision that I don't think you will find anywhere else. The soundtrack is also beautiful, and at times haunting. The use of non-actors is also really nice in this film. I really couldn't imagine it any other way. This film is probably one of the best examples of magical realism that you will find.

It is a testament to good story telling as it is over 2 hours in length yet you don't realize it. I'm always a fan of a movie where I don't have to say, \"I wish I had that time back\". I also noticed how Kusturica reaffirmed that everything has a purpose in a movie. One possible example of this is that Perhan's uncle has an affinity for imitating Charlie Chapman. At first this seems like a method of character development \u2013 basically showing that the uncle, through all his faults has a softer compassionate side. As the movie progresses Perhan and his uncle sleep with a woman and she becomes pregnant. My original thought was that the child must be Perhan's and all the talk to the contrary is just plot buildup to spur our hero along his journey. That is until the end of the movie, when the supposed Perhan offspring seems to conspicuously mimic Chapman. I'm not sure if that was the intent here but it defiantly got me thinking. This is also a movie where the soundtrack plays a pivotal role in the story. True to the gypsy persona Kusturica incorporates the music into the dialogue as a way to move the plot along and signal an emotional arch in a character. It is used throughout the movie and really pulls you into the world.",

Time of the Gypsies is a film from Yugoslavia that explores the life of a Muslim gypsy named Perhan. Kusturica's portrayal of the Gypsies is as relatable as it gets - the fundamental core of humanism is exposed to the audience. We see the theme of betrayal, morality and tragedy, which are all aspects of life that we, humans, go through.Perhan lives with his close knit family, consisting of his sister Danira, his grandmother Khaditza and his uncle Merdzan. Perhan is praised by his grandmother at first, however he becomes just like Ahmed later on. He begins to enjoy the advantages of stealing and subconsciously loses a part of his moral consciousness to make money. He loses his trust in Azra. He never planned to steal or murder, but feels obliged to in order to prove his self worth. Even at times when he was morally incorrect, I was still able to sympathize to his character. Why? Because we see both the good and bad qualities in him. The downfall of Perhan allowed me to see the flaws in humanity and identify with him.His relationship with his grandmother and sister intrigued me and they seem to serve the purpose of being the centre of his moral consciousness, which was extremely relatable to me. At some point in our lives, we have someone we confine to for moral judgment. His grandmother seems to know what's right and wrong. Unfortunately, the betrayal of Ahmed leads to his tragedy. He murders Ahmed on his wedding, which eventually results to Ahmed's wife shooting him to his death. For me, the most tragic moment was when Perhan's son warned him to not leave the train station - yet he leaves anyway. It made me question his morality. Did Perhan make the wrong choice of killing? Nonetheless, it was done for a reason, and I did not think any less of his humanism.One of the most unique elements in this film to me was its incorporation of magical realism. It was my first time seeing a movie that portrayed magical powers with no fantasy elements, but rather in a simple and natural way. When we see Perhan use his telekinesis power or his grandmother healing others, it feels natural and ordinary. This made the contrasting elements of magic and reality indistinguishable.Through Perhan's experiences, I was able to relate to him as a character. I enjoyed the perspective of the Gypsies shown this film as I was able to associate with them, rather than view them as a societal misconception of a minority group. He represented the Gypsy community with pure humanistic qualities in a way that the audience can't help but empathize. This made the message of the movie universal: Kusturica showcased the fundamental human relationships of family, lovers, enemies. He reveals the sacrifices, love, loss, tragedy and mistakes that inevitably occurs within those relationships. Like Renoir said, \"Everyone has their own reasons\". Mistakes are inevitable, and we act upon a reason, but the core of our humanity remains.",

            "content": "Kusturica's \"Time of the Gypsies\" is truly a film unlike any other. It is, for all intents and purposes, a coming of age story. However, due largely in part to the film's cultural context and use of magical realism, Kusturica manages to communicate a much more complex story.The film revolves around Perhan, a young Gypsy on the brink of adulthood with telekinetic abilities. His life is deeply rooted in struggles of poverty and family. Somewhat idealistic in nature, Perhan seems determined to escape these struggles, although he goes about it in a way that really only serves to perpetuate them. He doesn't know any better, and how could he? Herein lies one of the film's most devastating themes- even with good effort and intention, life has a cyclical nature. So, just as Perhan lives without a mother, so will his child- and worse. This sort of inescapable, cyclical fate is prevalent in the film and is, likely, a critique of life behind the Iron Curtain.The experience of watching \"Time of the Gypsies\" is akin to dreaming while awake, and not always in a pleasant way. The film's use of magical realism reflects the bizarre daily realities for Perhan, Azra, and the other characters- all of whom are struggling just to survive in the Third World. Kusturica's interesting juxtaposition of comedy, magical realism, and tragedy gives the viewer a taste of how confused and challenged these characters (and their real life counterparts) must be all the time. All things considered, this is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. It is not an easy viewing experience, as it requires one to endure brutal tragedy, betrayal, and loss all wrapped up in a dreamscape of magical realism. And admittedly, at times, it can be esoteric. However, I found \"Time of the Gypsies\" to be incredibly powerful and definitely recommend it to anyone interested in truly inspired International Cinema.",

As we follow Perhan, the protagonist of the film, through out his journey to make enough money to rescue his sick sister and marry the girl of his dreams, we witness just how lies, betrayal, and desperation can lead one who once had a heart of gold into losing his morals and sanity. Kusturica's use of magical realism gave this story such a lyrical, poetic and passionate feel, that at times I felt as if I was lost in a dream. Perhan's story is a prime example of how easy it is for us as human beings to lose our sense of morality when exposed to an environment so full of greed and corruption, and to lose a piece of our sanity in the process. This instantly made me relate to my experience in the music industry. At first, I entered a naive, oblivious, and anxious young girl ready to explore the world of music. However, after a short time my eyes were opened to the immorality and selfishness that completely dominated the industry. In the end, I decided that if I wanted to preserve my true passion for music, I would have to remove myself from this corrupted world before I became like them. I couldn't help but think to myself while watching this film that if only Perhan could have just recognized what was happening to him in his conquest for riches, and removed himself from the situation, things could have possibly worked out for the better.",

His disrespect towards his wife 2. Practically abandoning his child I think the theme of this movie, or at least one of them, is that revenge is not the way; especially for those who still have loved ones who they could or are leaving behind. Is it really worth it? Was he really trying to prevent his family from future harassment? Or was it a matter of pride? I suppose that is up to the individual to decide.

Even though these tangible elements are present; the plot, themes, spoken language, characters, and time period held true to realistic values. It was still established in a very controversial political time with the Yugoslavian war going on. With that said, I felt that it was extremely interesting while I was engaging in this film that the director sided with Serbia. I admired his exquisite artistic way of showing the humanistic themes of betrayal and love in an emotionally poetic way- giving the audience a deeper interpretation of human's most important experiences in a \"dream like\" stage.

Kusturica proves his brilliance in exploring the Romani culture by conveying the supernatural elements in the film in a believable, unextraordinary way- similar to the actual Romani beliefs regarding magic. Far from uplifting, \"Time of the Gypsies\" presents the gritty life of the Romani in an entirely realistic style, in a way that encompasses the good, the bad, and the inevitable aspects of life as a \"Gypsy.\" Though the style of the film (and certain attitudes expressed in the film) may seem eccentric if not outright bizarre, these strange aspects of the film only serve to enhance the experience of viewing the film. Moreover, Kusturica takes the viewer on a ride through an entirely different world, which would seem almost cut off entirely from the mainstream culture were it not for the fact that much of the film makes it crystal clear that many of the main characters depend on interacting with members of mainstream society without any desire of being a part of that world.

All the characters are very intriguing: Perhan, who goes from good to bad and then, possibly, to good again; Astra, who has sinned yet repents; Damira, who from a little insecure girl transforms into a caring and strong woman; Grandma, who is seen to be the moral center of the story but also makes decisions that dramatically change other characters' lives for the worst. We empathize with Perhan throughout his journey. Even though he has those magical telekinetic powers we treat them in a perfectly natural way. The romantic story between Perhan and Astra makes us very emotional, and it also contrasts with the cruelty of the world the characters are living in. The movie is cyclical: many times we see the same stories with different characters; all characters are connected in various unusual ways. Emir Kusturica's directing choices are very precise; however, all movie is ambiguous, especially the ending.

Even thought the main character Perham steals a lot during the movie, we still feel for him we understand that he has reasons for what he does and he just wants to survive.

When Azra tries to tell Perhan she is pregnant with his child he refuses to believe her and says once the child is born he is going to sell it. Grandmother is disgusted with Perhan and the person he has become she could care less about his riches. At the end of the movie it shows Azra giving birth in an open field, her body is lifted into the air and when the child is received she drops dead.

There are a few of those shady characters in the movie which suggest the other side of the spectrum in terms of anarchy.

I think in almost all movies governments are portrayed as ineffective, counterproductive, and deceptive. Time of the gypsies shows a fair representation of what anarchy is like on a small scale. Perhan's story is strange. It is like one of those stories where a grown up audience can say i have been there. This film is about two hours and Perhan is rushed from adolescence to death within that time frame. Time flys by in the movies just as much as in real life. I think this film puts that into perspective. In the course of a few years so much happens and then Perhan dies. It is similar to our adolescence experience. It happens then it is gone. So then we just continue on living and some people live through their children as suggested at the end of the film The music was captivating. The style of it was mesmerizing. It had elements of psychedelic music which was probably why it captured my attention in the first place. The music throughout the film brings the movie full circle. Their gypsy life style starts at one point and is continued subsequently by the next generation of gypsies. Overall the film was one which left me restless. It was beautifully filmed. The editing made the story flow nicely. The acting was believable to say the least. The music sold this movie for me as i am more of a music person.",

This film captures a profound poetic statement about the essential concepts in life: family, love, guilt vs. revenge, and death. It is one of my person favorite movies thus far, and for so many reasons. We follow Perhan, (the main character of the film) and witness his journey of deception, betrayal and desperation. Throughout the story, we begin to lose ourselves in the wistful cinematography that Kusturica had created. One important detail I must mention, that truly connected with me, was the music. This film has one of the most enlivening and stimulating soundtracks that I have ever experienced. While sitting in my chair, watching the film, I felt my body tingle throughout\u0085with each scene came a greater profound connection\u0085one that I never thought id experience when first the film began\u0085.it left me completely breathless.

            "content": "I see the journey of the protagonist as the culmination of the Edipic Complex. If we take into account the numerous similarities between Azra and Perhan's mother (for example the veil she uses, her innocence, the fact that she gave birth to a bastard son (at the end her kid was never recognized by Perhan, nor by his uncle), one with powers, and died in child labor); and the fact that the protagonist was raised by the mother figure of his grandma but always praised the innocence and kindness of Azra, characteristics kids associate with their respective mother, reinforces the connection between both Perhan's mom and Azra. We should now turn to Ahmed, the antagonist character in the film that nevertheless becomes a father figure to Perhan, the one he admires, aspires to become, and even fight for his affection (prior to discovering the lies he had told him regarding his sister and home). All in all he is the paternal figure the protagonist was so desperately in need for. In the narrative of the film, he and Azra marry, and he kills Ahmed using his telekinetic powers. Which, given the pararels I referred to previously, reminds us of the completition of the Oedipus complex: he ultimately ended up marrying his mother, and killing his father. This interesting parallelism makes me think of the need we all have for unconditional love (so often associated with the mother figure), and reassuring love that comes from a parental figure. A cyclical need, just as the Oedipus complex is thought of by many psychologists when stating that this complex is re-lived and re-solved in the adolescent years (and then lived through when one becomes a parent by the fact that the new members of your family would be facing this stage in their lives), that is in tune with the cyclical aspect of this film (as evidenced by the opening and closing scenes of the movie both being a wedding, by the always present father-less child, and the continuum poverty and love issues that hunts humanity).",

He starts out as a young boy, with not merely any responsibilities. Then things suddenly change when his sister becomes ill. He essentially matured what appears to be 6-10 years in the movie, as he becomes more of an inspirational character than anything. His tel-pathetic powers emulate the ending, as he goes to kill the one person who betrayed not only him, but his family as well.

            "content": "Emir Kusturica's \"Time of the Gypsies\" proved to be a one-of-a-kind, incredibly intimate, hard-hitting film. It takes place in a small, impoverished gypsy village in Yugoslavia. The film follows a young gypsy boy, \"Perhan,\" through his struggles with society and liberation into manhood and independence. From a narrative standpoint, the film is like a parody of a merry- go-round. In the beginning of the film we start with the wife devastated that her alcoholic husband has ruined the wedding; funnily enough, this is how the film ends. Kusturica appears to be making a statement about society.Magical realism sums up, embodies, and acts as the underlying synthesis throughout this entire film. According to film grammar, we would assume that the Feast of St. George, as Azra calls it at the end, would be a dream sequence. However, that notion soon dissolves when we see that Perhan still has his name written on his torso, which Azra had previously written on him in an earlier scene which would not be construed as a \"dream\" scene. Another example occurs when Azra dies. Her body begins to levitate in the air, almost as if to say to Perhan, \"Look, this is your son. He has inherited your genes\". These are only two examples, among many, of what makes this film so incredibly profound and intimate. Kusturica is trying to talk to us as the viewers, and he accomplishes this in an up close and personal, \"in your face\" manner. Cinematic and editing choices are fundamentally what made this film. At first, we assume that this is a movie in which we will encounter the odd \"magical\" or \"unrealistic\" moment. However, the editing choices made and Kusturica's dedication to preserve the idea that we are going to treat magical things in a completely naturalistic and plausible way is what mitigates our conception of what constitutes magic and allows for suspension of disbelief. In his choice to do these things, we choose not to question the so-called \"magical\" things that happen in this film but, rather, to accept them as what they really stand for in that moment. This is where we find the message in the moment, the symbolism. The bride dress floating in the wind suggests far more than its literal appearance. Only through his masterful cinematic and editing choices was Kusturica able to allow the narrative to serve his intentions.",

            "content": "Time of the Gypsies\" made life magical while still preserving reality. Unlike the \"Harry Potter\" films, this movie gave not only a message but a certain meaning to life. In life, people sometimes tend to lose themselves when they start to become rich. They lose their humanity, sense of love and family and the only thing that matters to them is wealth. This was the case with Perhan in the movie. This movie did not go on a moral crusade and trying to convince the audience what is good and bad. Rather the film reiterates the importance of family and being honest. Personally, I have always considered family to be the most important aspect of my life. Without family, one loses their most loyal companions, ones who a person can always fall back on in life. Through Perhan's success, he lost his humanity with his wealth. Only once his wife Azra died from childbirth did he regain his humanity. From my personal opinion, there is nothing more valuable to a person than his or her family. This film was made for everyone to understand the importance of family and remembering where one comes from.Another interesting aspect of \"Time of the Gypsies\" was the fact that through its magical realism, it showed the audience how magical life can be. Life is the most magical thing in the world. There are multiple reasons and each person can name his or her own reasons why life is magical to them. The point is that in everyday life, events occur that have a lasting impression on the person. Magic doesn't need to be telekinetic powers but rather the beauty in life itself is the most wonderful and amazing thing in the world. If one were to close their eyes they would miss the beauty in life. \"Time of the Gypsies\" showed how any kind of person, regardless of financial and personal issues, can find the magic in life. Throughout history, philosophers and the common people have always been amazed about life as am I. I for one am always amazed at the beauty that surrounds me. Life is indeed magical and \"Time of the Gypsies\" clearly displayed some of life's wonders.",

Perhan gets a taste of being the big boss only to be thrown out and left on his own. He expresses so many emotions in this film such as revenge for Ahmed for deceiving him the entire time and has no other choice but to kill him. I feel the music played a huge role in the gypsy culture such as when Perhan leaves with Ahmed, a band plays him a farewell song as he is driven away. The music expresses their emotions, lives and the events that happen in it such as the wedding and funeral at end. The music was beautiful something I had never heard before. The director did an amazing job at showing us the gypsy life. I felt he did not interfere with the story and kept it very real; That shows a quality director.

It is also the only movie produced in Romanie, the language of the gypsies (the language is almost extinct! so few people currently speak it). Kustrica manages to create a film that stylistically can be called none other then realistic fantasy. Kusturica is incredibly meticulous with the detail portrayed in each scene, and treats it in a very realistic way (a way that makes it quite possible that it could actually happen in reality). Its like magical realism, because it is obvious that there is more going on then meets the eye. Perhan has magical abilities, being able to move the spoon, it ironically becomes the mode of his revenge. The story was a little difficult to follow, as most movies that make you think and question are, but overall Kustrica does a great job-of showing the inside of a world most people do not know. The gypsies are a incredible group of people, solid and hard, they don't follow the normal rules that most people follow, but they do have a code all their own that they stick to. This movie does a good job of breaking all the stereotypes that most people have of the gypsies, and allows us to experience it in a way anyone can relate to; because at some point we all grow up and learn the difference between being a child and an adult. I do have to say I wish Perhan did not die in the end, it would have been nice if he could have lived and spent some time with his child (maybe that is just my happy Hollywood ending). The final look that Perhan and Azra share right before she dies, speaks a thousand words and then some! The love of his life, he questions and treats so horribly up until she dies, loved him and waited for him. Im glad that they got to share that look, at least they got to end with the same kind of knowing feeling together-they were so in love in the beginning of the movie. I did enjoy the turkey, maintaining a common theme throughout the movie, in the beginning it was Perhans friend/pet. In the end, it was what was showing him the way home.",

            "content": "The first thing I noticed about this movie was the tone with which it started. As you see the drunken man and the wedding scene at the beginning, I could already feel that this was not going to be like any movie I'd seen. The tone felt ambiguous \u2013as if I didn't know what was happening \u2013 and yet, I did know. It was part of what I now see as being that back-tone to magic realism: something strange and unusual \u2013 magical even, perhaps - that is just part of everyday life. And it is exactly this normal strangeness which will keep you, I believe, continuously interested in the movie. Even more, what add to the entertainment of this movie are its characters and the comedic relief that they add to this movie. Perhan with his turkey friend and his uncle lifting their house off the ground add incredulity to the movie. Yet, this astonishment at what we are seeing \u2013 probably heightened due to the fact that here in the U.S. we are not accustomed to seeing these kinds of scenes \u2013 melts into a smile as we begin to understand that for them, this is as normal as anything could be.But behind this magic and comedy, I could also see that this film did more than present us with a fantastical movie about a few characters that undergo some out-of-this-world adventure \u2013 say, like Transformers. Instead, this film lets us see the human side to these characters. Especially with Perhan, you can see that he does not have to be an invented character. He goes through falling in love, heartbreak, disappointment, joy, sadness, happiness \u2013 and they are experienced from events that many of us could have experienced. They are characters with whom we can connect, if only emotionally. More than that, one of the things that remain with you is the gypsy culture itself. I was so used to thinking of gypsies as transient \u2013 sometimes even deceiving \u2013 and very lively people that when I was done watching the movie, I realized that this was not true. We are just so used with only being exposed to what we see in our own cultures or in the movies that we see here \u2013 which are popular but never depict anything but the usual Hollywood plots and the stereotypes that Hollywood often popularizes about other cultures - that we fail to expose ourselves to foreign films. And when we do, I think a lot of us will be left with the same feeling I felt after seeing this movie, and that was that the Gypsy culture is just like our culture \u2013 except perhaps, with a small touch of magic, which many might simply see as magic realism. And perhaps what made me connect the most was that in my culture, as a Mexican, these kinds of events could easily be told within my family as well. Many Latin, or Hispanic, cultures live in this world of magic realism \u2013 where magical, strange, mythical things can exist just like in the books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. So, it might just be that seeing this on screen made me enjoy the movie even more.",

Full of symbols and telekinetic and healing powers, this movie still manages to feel believable. It toes the line between fantasy and reality very well as we see Perhan moving forks and such around with his mind. Kusturica masterfully tells the story through the eyes of the Yugoslavian gypsies we come to know and love. Though we see Perhan's flaws and sometimes wish he would make better choices, we come to understand why he and the others in the movie do the things they do. The most poignant example of this is right at the end when Perhan chooses to go back and kill Ahmed instead of going home with his sister and the boy who might be his son. I know that I personally wish he could have just let it be, but I understand that dignity and honor are important in that culture, and he wouldn't have been able to live with himself had he not settled his score with Ahmed. Overall, I loved the complex exploration of character in \"Time of the Gypsies,\" and how Kusturica didn't hide or glorify the dirty side of the story.

Fortunately, another villager finds Perhan and saves his life.Since Perhan is poor, he decides to leave the village with the richest man in the village who is the leader of a Gypsy gang in Milan, Italy. Perhan hopes to be able to return to his village as a rich man and marry his love, Azra.Perhan soon climbs up in the gang hierarchy. However, he is lied to and cheated on and eventually loses everything; his ideals, his dreams and his money.Now it's time for revenge! Director Kusturica is able to show his characters in many different shades. They are carefree, family-oriented, traditional and emotional but also vengeful, unforgiving, and dangerous to their enemies. Kusturica's amusing but tragic film tells a deeply moving story, full of poetry, melancholy, and human warmth.",

The structure of the film is very interesting it begins as a comedy and transitions into being a tragedy. Kusturica tells a story about a boy name Perhan who is the protagonist character that has telekinetic powers, he was raised by his grandmother and has a little sister; the audience follows his journey of his life experiences and choices . Magical realism is demonstrated through out the film, for example, when Perhan and his little sister are in the backseat of the car they look through the back window and immediately Perhan and his sister spot a wedding veil flowing through the air it seem as if the veil was traveling with them. Another example is after Ezra delivers their baby she dies but then begins to levitate in the air and it was symbolic because her levitation was giving the message to Perhan that he is the father of their child not Ahmed. In addition, it also seems as her levitation was showing that the baby possibly has magical powers as well. Something that is very interesting is the way the film ends, Perhan goes to Ahmed's wedding to seek revenge, which is him using his telekinetic powers to kill Ahmed.However, since he does kill Ahmed, it leads to Ahmed's wife deciding to murder Perhan which results in Perhan death. In contrast, in the beginning of the film it starts off with a wedding scene but the scene is more comedic; therefore, it was very interesting how Kusturica structures both scenes into being very dynamic.",

            "content": "I knew absolutely nothing about the lives and culture of Gypsies before watching this film. Funny enough, I always thought the the term Gypsy was a derogatory word to describe a group of people. It had always held a negative connotation, and I'm glad I was able finally have a better understanding of this group of people, even if the movie did have a magical and spiritual aspect to it. We watch the main character, Perhan, go from an innocent teenager into a corrupt business man during the course of the story. Sadly, it seems that all the characters are morally corrupt, save the Grandmother, and even that is questionable. It's a gritty look at the reality of Gypsy life, and the pursuit power and wealth. The main problem I did have was with the ending. I really wish Perhan had just continued back to his village with his newfound son and sister, and if he was going to go to seek revenge, I felt he had not yet crossed a irreversible line until he had actually killed with his BARE hands, and not just his telekinesis. When he used his mental ability to move objects with his mind to levitate the fork and kill that bastard of a father figure, I felt as though he still could have walked out of there relatively unscathed, but once he soiled his hands with physical murder there was no other ending to the film without his ultimate death, and that was heartbreaking considering he had just been reunited with his sister and his son. He made the choice to go back there, to the wedding to finish them off, and it was difficult to watch him throw that future away for the sake of revenge. There were no innocent characters, even the toddler son was a thief at his young age.",

There were many moments in the film that really spoke to me. One of the first things that you see in the movie is when it says something along the lines of how messed up the gypsies are and how God skipped over them. This was a very interesting quote to me because although they seemed behind in many aspects, they were advanced in the fact they had magical powers and it helped them in many parts of the movie. Also there were a lot of symbols in the movie. For instance, when Perhan was leaving his sister at the hospital for her treatment, he dropped the caramel apples, which was a symbol that something terrible was going to happen. Also, another symbol was his glasses. At the beginning of the film, he had glasses on. Once he went on to his new lifestyle, he took off his glasses and started living without them. The glasses symbolize perspective and once he changed his life, his perspective changed as well. I loved the whole storyline and I loved the character archetypes throughout the movie.

The character is even given a chance (warning)to stop at the train-station and he thinks about it and continues on his mission. I wouldve liked to see more of the final scene of the film.

He forgot who he was and ended up loosing everything he cared about because of it. I think the main turning point in his life is when he learned that his girlfriend had cheated on him and the the baby she was carrying could possibly belong to someone else. This is the first time we see him drink, and the first time we see him become cruel. I think that is was actually turned in from innocent to not innocent. He did steal and break laws, but it was for the purpose of helping his family and his girlfriend. But after he finds out the bad news, it became about getting more money and power.

            "content": "Translating the original title we have \"time for hanging\", and that really reflects Kusturica's work with Time of the Gypsies. Hanging in the movie means hanging in there in the attempt for survival. Perhan is our fallen hero that is as human as a hero can be. Although he has a good heart and is a smart boy, he suffers from the judgmental society he lives in. His family is criticized him for he is a bastard son of a soldier, having his mom die at birth and raised by his grandma together with his sister and a crazy uncle. This unusual family is somehow very united besides the madness of the uncle. The good hearted grandma is the equilibrium point for sanity within the family. Perhan is very responsible and always worried about his sister and the girl he loves and cannot be with for he is a bastard and the family has no money. He is a free spirit adolescent that celebrates the joy of being alive with his actions and the way he relates to the women in his life. The feminine figures are all the reference he has for relating to people in general. His grandma, his sister and his little girlfriend Esra are all really loving creatures so he grows his personality into a non harmful environment, different from the real world. The survival starts from a moment of loss of hope when he hangs himself in a suicidal attempt. The hanging happens after he is mistreated by Esra's mom because he does not have any money or conditions to afford to marry her. Our hero learns the hard way how people are not all good like his grandma. All the expectations he ever puts on something is taken away in a dry way throughout his experiences in the movie. The corruption of the environment Perhan is in slowly drags him into the underworld of lies and disillusions. That is the reality he comes to know and has to learn how to deal with and self protect in order to survive. His bad experiences turn him into a careless man that will do anything for money and although that is very bad, it is presented in a way that I could note blame him or judge him. He grew up a good guy and got corrupted by the environment and the people he had to relate to along his way and that's how things turned out for him.It is always easy to judge a people and to disapprove certain behaviors. However in an environment where having bad conduct is the only way to survive it becomes very hard to disagree with anything. The movie does a great job showing a society structure that might be unknown to western cultures and it is a life lesson for that reason. That makes Perhan a human hero of real life that learned to survive and adjust to his environment.",

I don't find it ironic because Perhan tries to hang himself, but because the actor who played Perhan recently hung himself. Emir Kusturica must have thought twice about that one.An aspect of the movie that truly stands out for me is its magical realism. Although Perhan's telekinetic powers would not make sense in real life, Kusturica expresses the powers in a very natural and vivid way that doesn't take the audience away from the picture. It catches the audience off guard a little bit, but the powers are not overused like any modern Hollywood superhero flick. As a matter of fact, the reason why the audience is able to relate to Perhan is because he is all too human.Perhan starts out innocent but the audience later finds him to be no better than his Uncle. At first he has the good intentions of riding along with his sister so that she can get an operation, marrying Azra, and buying a house for his family to live in. However, he betrays his sister, treats Azra much less than she deserves, and the house becomes an illusion of selfishness. Kusturica depicts that life isn't as black and white as it seems.",

He lives in a gypsy village along with his grandmother, younger sister, and uncle. We see young Perham grow up as we follow both him and his younger sister, Danira, through a journey to heal her crippled leg.It may be said that it is thanks to Ahmed that Perham turns out the way he does. Ahmed exposes Perham to the corrupt underbelly of the \"business\" world. This environment is vastly different from the one he was raised in with his grandmother. His grandmother taught him to have morals and be an overall good, honest person. Ahmed on the other hand teaches Perham to value the complete opposite values. Ahmed teaches him to lie, steal, deceive, and to use people to further his own interests.Only through this exposure is Perham able to realize that not all people are good and virtuous as he believed at the beginning of his journey. Through the disillusion he encounters at every turn, he becomes a product of his deceitful and ruthless environment. I believe that since we follow Perham from his innocent beginnings, we do not hate him for becoming such a corrupted individual. We may not agree with some of the choices he makes, such as practically walking into his death at the end, but in my eyes his intentions redeem him. The fact that he at least found his sister and his son, and sent them off back to the village for a better life not only redeems him, yet it also seems to restart the entire tale as we see Perham's sons antics at the end of the movie.",

He has many promises that he wants to fulfill to his mother. The biggest promise is the safety and health of his younger sister. Perhan's sister is taken by a neighboring friend of his mother to a faraway hospital to have surgery on her leg. The man who is responsible for taking the sister to a safe hospital is a dishonest and disgusting man with no moral values. He turns the sister into a beggar and Perhan into a professional thief. Emir Kusturica, the director, masterfully illustrates the life of a group of gypsies as they are constantly seeking ways to steal money to fulfill their greed. Kusturica, in this Yugoslavian film, captures the beauty of the Romany Gypsy culture by bringing the set to life with the use of vibrant colors and lighting. Kusturica creates a rich ambiance through the use of authentic settings as well as the actors who are able to bring to life the characters of this unique time and setting.",

As a people, gypsies are not well understood. Some may even argue that they are mysterious. Historically it is thought that they started in Romania and moved to other parts of the Europe (like Milan, and south of Spain etc), living on the margins of society. Kustarica seems to capture the essence of this culture in, 'Time of the Gypsies' through the use of magical realism. His artful and skillful use of magical elements and illogical scenarios in a normal setting, depict the Gypsies' timelessness.For instance when Kaditza ( Perhan's grandmother) instructs Perhan to show his telekinetic powers to Akemed, he throws the spoon on the wall and makes it move around a picture with his mind (while the house in the air). This makes no logical sense. Another example is when, Danira who is Perhan's sister, sees her mother's veil flying in the air. Later we see the flying veil before Azra gives birth and levitates. The characters make no remarks as to this being an unusual event.Finally, there is the beautiful river scene where Perhan and Azra lay naked in a boat. One is not sure if this was a dream, or if is how Perhan remembers how they made love, or when this took place, if it did at all.These examples show the how things happen in everyday life in 'Time of the Gypsy', yet defy explanation. Strangely enough, there are even boxes moving along the ground for no apparent reason through out the story. Kustrika had the technique and style to tell a story about a young man growing up Gypsy culture through magical realism. This was a genius way of portraying a people who seem to handle time and space much differently than other people of the world.",

It is sure that those brightly colors assist Kustrica's distinctive composition of each frame. Especially, in the last part of the film, Kusturica takes Perhan's profile in close-up when he is smoking. Though it is a close-up shot of portrait, Kusturica arranges the Perhan's face in the left side of frame, and the arranging of portrait is prominent by the remained part of the frame is fulfilled with whitened and faded background.

Among the things I liked about this film was that it better exposed me to the culture of gypsies, how their beliefs can clash with other Muslims, and how the film itself and the Perhan's increasing involvement with the criminal underworld were evocative of The Godfather.One qualm I did have with this film was the fact that Perhan never takes full advantage of the possibilities of his telekinetic abilities. While one could argue that magical realism was in effect here, in that everyone just brushes his abilities off, I don't recall anyone else in the film demonstrating any such thing, save for when Azra levitates as she gives birth to his child. On that note, why did Perhan allow that child to be sold even though he now knew it was his kid, rather than the result of Azra potentially cheating on him.Regardless, I felt as though the film was an enlightening demonstration of how we can fall from grace, and how the world can change you for the worse.",

Ljubica Adzovic who plays the grandmother is deserving of an Oscar nod, her performance is superb at being the rock of the family. The main protagonist Perhan is a young boy who is coming of age and is driven by love. When he asks his girlfriend's mother for her hand in marriage, the mother shuts him down because he doesn't have any money. Perhan's sister has a condition that leaves her bedridden and when given the opportunity to take her into a big city with the town's gangster, who owes Perhan's grandmother a favor, Perhan embarks on a journey where he leaves his small town as a boy and quickly has to become a man.This movie takes so many twists and turns and you honestly won't mind them because the filmmaker and actor's performances are so great, that it really doesn't matter. It's like watching years and years of their lives being squashed into a two hour movie but you will enjoy the journey. This is independent filmmaking at it's best and there is nothing about this film that feels contrived of pushed. Their family dysfunction is also centered around and filled with the love and togetherness that mold a family together. The score of the film is fantastic and really drives the emotion of each scene. This ensemble cast is so well put together you forget you are watching a movie. it's a nice take on the style of the film as opposed to feeling like you are watching a movie where there are actors driving the scene. You will never feel this way when you are watching this film. It's a true gem.",

Perhan's life is full of magic, violence, tragedy, love, betrayal, happiness, and death. Perhan comes from a lower class family whose grandmother is the town's healer. Perhan is a young man who is very humbled, innocent, and honest who has the ability of moving objects with his mind. Perhan has a sister who is crippled and needs an operation on her leg. Perhan decides to go to Italy and work with a gypsy leader named Ahmed. Ahmed promises Perhan to pay for his sister's operation, but he has to work for him as a thief. After working with Ahmed, Perhan found out that he was being used. Ahmed never payed for his sister's leg operation; instead he had her working as a beggar in the streets of Italy. This scene really had an impact on me because Ahmed took advantage of Perhan's innocence as a human being because he was working really hard as thief to pay for his sister's leg operation. I cannot imagine how there are people like Ahmed who just care about themselves and who take advantage of other people's vulnerability. Despite of Ahmed's betrayal, Perhan dedicates himself to look for his sister to save her from that miserable and unfair life. Once he found his sister he sent her back to his grandmother. It was really interesting to me how Perhan devoted his love to his family and who did anything for their well being.",

These people feed of each other's smiles and endless joy. As any nation and group of people, they are complex and sometimes dangerous to each other, but that is who they are. The movie does not only open a door into the Gypsy life, but it also introduces a magical realism genre.

One of the great things about the film itself is the use of the Romani language. As an English-speaking viewer, spoken language in foreign film serves mostly as an audible backdrop. Being familiar with the fact that this film had been done mostly in Romani upon viewing made this film spectacular. Language is so important to culture and is an overlooked tool in social life. The preservation and use of such a rarely heard language adds a level of character to this film that is not achievable visually. It serves to remind that film is an all-encompassing visual and audible art form.The film is gorgeously shot in all ts backdrops. The use of humor throughout is a very refreshing touch. While the film deals with some deep subject matter, it is never to weighty. It's long run-time is often offset by its poignant acting and witty dialogue, again beautifully transcending the language barrier.Many of the great moments came from watching the protagonist stumble over his encounters as any teenager would which helps remind me that we all started in the same place, no matter where we are from. We all have grown up dealing with the same feelings. We are all beings nonetheless and we will never forget what is was like to be a misdirected youth.",

After his obnoxious uncle loses money from gambling, he begs his mother for money but she denies him of any of it. In return, he literally takes the roof off their home. In order for them to afford a new home, the family meets with a man name Ahmed, who promises to give them a new home and fix the little girl's leg. Perhan agrees to travel with Ahmed to Italy until his sister's leg and fixed and his new home is finished being built. Perhan keeps money from Ahmed little by little throughout the years. Years go by and Perhan finds out his girlfriend Azra and now pregnant but he is convinced that the baby's father is his uncle. When Azra dies after giving birth, Perhan decides to accept the baby as his son. Perhan does not see his son after that night. Eventually, Perhan finds out Ahmed uses his little sister as a beggar and after four years, they are reunited, meeting his son, Perhan Jr., for the first time.At some point Perhan is found by his grandmother at a bar drunk and dancing with multiple women. She tells him that he was once so innocent and was a grandma's boy, but now now the same anymore. He had grown up quickly while staying with Ahmed. Kusturica put magical realism into this film, showing the magical elements that included Perhan's telekinetic powers in a realistic setting. His work on this film showed brilliance with the story plot. To turn away from the film for just a minute, you may lose sight of the story quickly. Davor Dujmovic, who played the main character Perhan is impressive and very authentic. Somehow I felt that he put some of his life experiences into his role. The theme of betrayal and loss in the movie may have reflected his real life. Towards the end of the film, Perhan wasted no time taking revenge against Ahmed by using his telekinetic powers but knew he would have to sacrifice his own life in return. The music that was playing when Perhan was shot and the scene where his funeral was taking place, stuck with me for hours after the film was over. The outcome of his actions resulted in tragedy as well as his death nearly 10 years after the film was released, leaving many to question his drug habit and life outside of the big screen.",

            "review_title": "Greed Is Bad, Ignorance Is Worse",
            "content": "\"Time of The Gypsies\", directed by Emir Kusturica is a film about a young man named Pelhan who hopes to earn riches with a child slaver name Ahmed. Yet, when Pelhan returns home to find his lover is pregnant, his home is not built as promised, and his sister has not had her legs fixed, madness and anger drive him to fix all of the problems he has created. After seeing Time of The Gypsies, I felt emotionally saddened that Pelhan, a promising and charming young man, had to suffer from the hand of poverty and ignorance. The director, Kusturica, does an excellent job in portraying his ignorance (Ahmed knows where he hides his money and Ahmed never builds his house or fixes his sister). These sad occurrences are the direct result of a stupid boy whom is raised fatherless and must fall onto the shoulders of an evil and manipulative man. Yet, once again, Kusturica twists with our emotions because the character of Ahmed is at moments caring and helpful towards Pelhan, and at other times, selfish and evil. This sense of moral ambivalence affected me emotionally because I was caught between rooting for the Ahmed, and hating his very guts. The same applies to Pelhan, because at the same time he goes on the road to earn money for his family, but at the same time abandons his sister whom falls prey to Ahmed's child slavery. I believe that the film is trying to tell us that while greed is bad, ignorance is worse. If Pelhan was an educated young man who had not grown up in an impoverished Gypsie town, he could have earned a decent job that would have payed for his sisters operation. Instead, he turned to a child trafficker that lies, steals, and cheats his way to riches. As well, the uncle, Merdzan, plays an important role because his addiction to gambling are the source of problems for the family; he falls debt to Ahmed, destroys the families home, murders Pelhans turkey, and has sex with Pelhans sworn lover. One might even argue that Merdzan is more evil than Ahmed. Maybe, Kusturica was trying to show us that those we hold close hurt us more than the real evil that is portrayed (Such as in the case of Pelhan being fatherless, the Uncle gambling away money, the Grandmother letting Pelhan leave without protest). In fact, most of the characters themselves are weak and incapable of voicing their opinions, leading to more doom and destruction, something that a blend of greed and ignorance will do to a person. The last note I have about the film is its sequences of magical realism. Pelhan, the main character, has telekinetic powers. Khaditza, the grandmother, can curse people. Perhans son can levitate his mothers body into the sky. While these moments may seem unusual and impossible, it is the way Kusturica directs them that makes the moments seem plausible, as if they are natural to the way of life. For instance, while Pelhan has telekinetic powers, nobody really cares about them because they find them harmless and a usual talent -- and in a way, we believe that it is possible, that this universe could easily be ours. What I am trying to get at is through Magical Realism, Kusturica allows viewers to step back and think about the world, and the magical places such as the village in \"Time of The Gypsies\" where witches and mind control exist. In fact, it almost seems impossible for it not to exist, for with the amount of weirdness in todays society, one should expect anything.Time Of The Gypsies is not a film for the average viewer. The pacing is slow at times, the language, is well, Romani, and plot has multiple instances of irrationality and impossibility. Yet, pacing and plot aside, the core emotions you feel, and the moral ambivalence that is is projected, overtakes the side steps and makes you think for once about the film you just saw. Who is the true villain, Ahmed or Pelhan. Is everybody set in stone as \"evil or good\". Watch the film to get a new taste of a new world. You won't regret it.",

The magic surrealist appearances throughout the movie does not interfere in the audience belief in the storyline, It is almost like a complement to the storyline.

However as we are introduced to the colorful set of characters that reside in this small town I quickly came to a new realization. That realization was that this place was magical. It was filled with the unexpected and the unexplained. Time of the Gypsies quickly swept me up and hooked me into an unforgettable story.This immediate attention grabbing story is greatly due to the main protagonist of the film Perhan. Perhan is the awkwardly lovable character that I felt was the greatest success of the film. Not to diminish the exhilaration the others brought but Perhan brought me on journey that made me ride an elevator emotions stopping on every floor. Having left the movie I found myself, at first, emotionally shaken. Time of the Gypsies blended multiple genres to create an emotionally rich experience. That is what struck me as the most powerful aspect of the film. It represented real life. It did this because in real life we do not ride a one track train of emotion, we do not go through our life always happy or constantly sad. We go through moments of joy and sadness, laughter and loss. The use of this blending of genre completely cured my suspension of disbelief and I felt myself not questioning any of the surreal or impossible acts in the movie. The film told an eye opening story of a lifestyle I may never have known about and hardships I may never experience. It accomplished this as well as at the same time enriching me into a fantastical story that captured me from the start.

I didn't even know what is Gypsy, so it didn't matter for me whether they are Gypsy or not. The movie is moody. The music that is played by an accordion, the grandmother with magical power, and flying spoons.Especially the boy's dream of the ritual in the river is the most beautiful and meaningful scene in this movie. The casts are mostly non-professional Gypsy actors; however, I didn't even imagine that because the characters are just fit for the environment. Everything is perfectly fit in the screen. If Kusturica used professional non-Gypsy actors, it might be awkward. We can say that this is realism, even though there are some supernatural incidents.",

There were a lot of significant things that had cherished Perhan like the apples his grandmother gave him and forming a bond with the turkey. There were a lot of sad moments in the movie. Leaving his sister at the hospital just fearing of what might happen to her. Perhan and Azra were finally together but their relationship had deteriorated after finding out that she was pregnant. Azra died while giving birth in the middle of nowhere that left Perhan to be a single dad. There were some parts of the movie that had unanswered questions. For instance, the 4 year gap between Perhan and his now 4 year old son. Perhan fought most of his life until he couldn't fight anymore. This movie is worth seeing again!",

I just wish it was a more watchable film.The truth is, I found Time of the Gypsies to be long and unbearable. While I am not one to support Hollywood clich\u00e9's as generally preferable to original story-telling, I found Time of the Gypsies frustrating for letting me down numerous times.After Perham works most of the film to get back to his true love, Azra betrays Perham by being pregnant (Though we are later toyed with by the idea the child could be his, we never really know). Then Perham's character renders himself completely unlikable by his cruelty to Azra and his serious plan to sell her bastard child. The scene where he tells her the plan is gut-wrenching and very hard to hear. It made me sad when Azra dies in childbirth. Finally, Perham's death comes so suddenly and without gravitas, it made the story even more pointless to me.If I believed in reincarnation, I might have looked at the film more favorably. The child at the end could be considered Perham reborn and able to start over. Unfortunately for me, I don't believe in reincarnation. I'll watching it again some day since I seem to be a small dissenting minority on my view of the film. Maybe I can appreciate it better next time.",

As Perhan faces new and different environments that effect his new outlooks on life, we are then constantly reminded through Azra, his grandmother and sister, how quickly we can all get caught into a world of greed and anger.

Another thing that bothered me about this film was the acting was all over the place, there were certain characters that played their roles effortlessly, but I remember while watching the movie that I was very distracted by the acting skills of some of the characters, it was very inconsistent in that regard. This movie is worth a few hours of your day, if anything you'll have the opportunity to try and open your eyes to a slightly different world than yours, but still have the ability to apply its message to your everyday life.",

Later in the movie he learns that just wanting these things is not going to be enough and Ahmed tells him that he has to make money to get what he want. He also tells convince him to make money in unhonest ways. At first he only agrees to this to make money for his sister and to marry the girl but after a while he gets a little bit greedy and it is really sad to see him so far away from his goals and yet he do not realize this himself yet. When Perhan returns to his home he is not the same naive boy anymore and he finds that even if he gets what he wants now it is not worth anything anymore. You sit through the movie and wish that Perhan could do the right decisions, wish that he could see what a dangerous road he is taking.

Kusturica's brilliant use of symbols is one thing that makes his directing style so unique. This \"coming of age\" film is about a young gypsy, Perhan, who tries to get his family out of poverty by becoming gypsy hustler, Ahmed's, partner in business. The constant tug of war between family and economic prosperity is a major theme in this film. Another important theme is the contrast between the simplicities of the traditional gypsy world and the complexities of modern Europe. Although this film has an overall earnest vibe, there are many comedic moments which make this film easy to watch and not too depressing overall. I highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "From a whimsical beginning \"Time of the Gypsies\" descends into a bleak look at innocence lost, corruption, and perhaps a special Gypsy fatalism. It's a powerful film that has haunted me since I first saw it. But what about it has haunted me? I think it's the extreme divide portrayed in the film of the state of innocence and innocence lost. We look back on the innocent incidents as from another shore as Perhan becomes more and more disillusioned and worldly.The structure of the film is artfully, subtly layered. For example, the film's original title is \"A Home for Hanging,\" and we see many different types of hanging: a nagging gypsy woman hung up on a pole by her husband as she comically continues to nag; our protagonist Perhan trying to hang himself in a romantic suicide because he will never be allowed to marry his love Azra; the hanging of Perhan's house in midair when his uncle unbelievably hoists it up with a rope and his truck. It is unbelievable and yet one can remember such moments of a meeting this destructive force for the first time, some adult set on destruction bringing violence or anger into the safe home of childhood. The grandmother says something to the effect of his corruption breaking the home. What is this moment in midair? We see it from its comic to its more evil range. A moment when all could change. I'm not sure yet what it means, yet I feel there's a contrast between the former examples of hanging to that of seeing Azra magically suspended in midair as she gives birth without any earthly rope or hook. Similarly the repetition of glass might show a moment where that potential is unloosed and one state or the other is chosen: Perhan's glasses are half broken in the beginning of the film. There is a significant moment where he has the dream of his grandmother saying \"come back immediately\" or he'll be subject to some silver toothed woman: he then breaks the glass of the bus to escape but doesn't go back home. It seems then he has chosen the life of crime represented by Ahmed and its attendant lies, distrust and exploitation. In anger he breaks a glass with his teeth when he says he will come back with money to be able to wed Azra, and his son also (who says he was angry with Perhan on the train) breaks a window before stealing the coins off the eyes of his corpse. This breaking of the glass is a powerful visual metaphor in its physicality as well, and you have the sense of breaking through to some other plane of life within life - which I think is powerful in that it makes something invisible in life visible. The breaking glass seems to represent a swinging back and forth between innocence and corruption, love and hatred. And the film contains it all and thereby a large slice of life it seems.One of my favorite scenes in the film in retrospect is the strangely paganistic Feast of St George held in the river, where Perhan and Azra may have conceived a son - there is something wild and yet sacred about it.The grandmother gives the most beautifully red candied apples, placed in a tin, to Perhan for his journey -- and they poignantly fall to the floor when he breaks his word and doesn't stay with his sister, beguiled by Ahmed. There is something very painful about this image of these tenderly prepared candies never tasted. It is perhaps this feeling which this film evokes that I find so haunting.",

Growing up in Los Angeles, I have been exposed to cinema that lacks variety and depth. Before being exposed to foreign films, my social conditioning was bland and one-dimensional. Time of the Gypsies was not the typical movie that I grew up to watching. In fact, I even found it difficult to take it for face value. The film was spoken in the Romany language which an extreme value of authenticity that i believe in missing in a lot of modern Hollywood films. I went into watching the film completely void of any knowledge of the Gypsy culture. Even though the movie delved into the depths of Romany culture, I still did not feel like I had the full picture. I was more engrossed in the journey of the protagonist Perhan. The sheer magnificence of the sudden progression into manhood that Perhan had to undergo. With the ultimate intention of serving his family, Perhan was taken under the wing of a crime warlord that was in the sex trafficking industry. Without giving away too many spoilers, I would also like to add the awesome nature of the symbolic images and cyclical character development throughout the film. The film exposed me to the Gypsy culture in such a way that it piqued my interest by only giving me a taste and leaving me hungry for more.

An ethnic minority in the Eastern European countries, they are ostracized for their dark skin, foreign culture and alleged supernatural powers. Kusturica created this dark, gritty magical realism film as an honest window into the everyday lives of these people, without bias. Perhan, the protagonist, is a young Romani boy with telekinetic powers. His grandmother is said to have the ability to heal the sick. She shows a favoritism for Perhan, even over her own son\u2014the destitute and degenerate uncle, Merdzan. Since Perhan's mother died in childbirth, his grandmother raised him, and Merdzan feels jealous for her attention and love.As a work of magical realism, these supernatural powers are viewed as mundane, as a part of life. No one takes notice when Perhan idly moves a tin can with his mind\u2014in fact, they tell him to stop using his powers frivolously and get a real job. The film is set in a dirt-poor Gypsy village in the former Yugoslavia. When his destitute and degenerate uncle Merdzan tears the roof off the family house in frustration over their poverty, his grandmother begs Perhan to find work and provide a steady income. A major theme is the corrupting power of money. It is clearly, in Kusturica's eyes, the root of all evil. When Ahmed, the richest man in town and a celebrity to its people, returns from Italy, he offers to take Perhan under his wing and make money to rebuild the house and support the village\u2014in addition to providing bone surgery for his lame sister, Danira. Once in Italy, we find out that Ahmed is a gangster. He teaches Perhan the ropes of organized crime\u2014and little by little, he loses his reservations against lying, cheating, stealing, and murdering for money. Even more shocking, we find out from Ahmed's brother, Sadam, that he lied about Danira's surgery. He wanted her for his own profit. Perhan feels betrayed, and we can see that he still has some feelings for his sister. Apparently, some humanity remains in him. Later on, he even rescues a kitten from a raging river to add to his sympathy. When he finally dies at the end of the film, he is unredeemed, but not disgraced. The entire town grieves at his funeral, but especially his grandmother. His life is an allegory for the entire Gypsy race: they try to empower themselves, but they always end up falling back. Even though it felt like a shaggy dog story to me, it ended on an emotionally vague note, as if there was hope for a new generation to bring these people into the mainstream.",

Though I watched it with English subtitles, the original language spoken in the film is Romany. A Gypsy boy named Perhan is the protagonist of the film, though it might be more appropriate to refer to him as an antihero. Perhan's character arc is a captivating and intriguing one, as we watch his transformation throughout the film.At the outset of the film, we see Perhan as an innocent and honest young man, raised by his grandmother who has telekinetic powers. He falls in love with a local girl named Azra, but upon requesting her hand in marriage, Azra's mother dismisses Perhan as unworthy. This drives Perhan to engage in petty crime with a local crime lord of sorts named Ahmed, who also agrees to take Perhan's sister, Danira, to the city to have a medical procedure performed on her to restore her legs to full functionality. Ahmed agrees to make sure that Danira is looked after in the city while she is in the hospital while Perhan engages in various petty crimes.Over the course of Perhan's criminal dealings he becomes disillusioned, losing focus of the reasons that he began engaging in crime to begin with. He seems to be stuck in a downward spiral and is no longer the same person he was. In an effort to keep this review spoiler free aside from a general plot synopsis, I will not delve into much detail on what occurs after what has already been mentioned.\"Time of the Gypsies\" left quite an impression on me.

Unfortunately he was thrown into this situation, and with his good heart chose the wrong path thinking he would do well, for his grandmother, his sister and for himself. He needed to find a new home for his family since his crazy uncle destroyed the one they lived in. He joins Ahmed thinking he would get that new home. He needs to get his sister treatment for her bad leg, he trusted Ahmed would help him if he worked for Ahmed. He also needed to make money to marry the woman he loves. The contrast of how he wants to do good for all these people and his plan of action, crime, is intriguing. Eventually the life of crime changes him to the point where even his grandmother is disappointed in him. He even somewhat despises the woman he loves. To be fair, she is pregnant and it may not be his, despite how much she insists it is, so maybe his anger is justified. The odd thing is that when he is betrayed by Ahmed he finally realizes what is going on and seeks to redeem himself. But by redeeming himself he seeks revenge and wants to kill Ahmed and his brothers, so is that really redemption? Personally I believe he once again picked that wrong path. He had everything finally put back together in his life, but he chooses the dark path that ultimately ends his life. This film talks a lot about choices in life and how one should carefully think about them. The film also has a sense of realism. What I mean is that the gypsies look, dress and act like gypsies. The locations used are also excellent. They live in a crummy area and it matches the characters. Then you see Perhan stashing loads of money from his time in the big city.

Pehran, the main character of this film, can perform magic tricks by moving objects with his mind. This film was one of the first films I have seen that introduced me to magical realism.Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was when Pehran moved away from his grandmother and left his sister in the hospital to make money. He was fooled by Ahmed and from there, he lives his own lifestyle and slowly climbs to the top of the food chain where then Ahmed appoints him boss. I enjoyed this part of the film because it shows the audience the daily experience and the daily life of Pehran. Pehran was my favorite character throughout this film because I saw how he started off in the beginning of the movie and how he progressed and became the man he did in the end of the film. It showed me what kind of person he became to be and how corrupted he ended up. Overall, this film was interesting and it shows the audience the changes a person can go through within their lives. I recommend this film to people who like to watch the experiences of a person and their living conditions.",

            "content": "A movie that gives you a sense of morals, values, and ways of life people grow so accustomed to. Perhan (Davor Dujmovic) is an idealistic young man who has the power of telekinesis, the movie is about his journey from a young gypsy to a man with struggles and convictions. The art of magical realism is embedded in the movie, (smoke coming out of ears, love interest Azra lifting in air,) perhaps most powerfully toward the last 5 minutes of the movie where Perhan, is able to almost harness all of his energy, emotions and feelings all onto the fork that finishes his task, going through hell and back. The movie contains relationships that we the audience can closely associate with either being the love from a sibling, elder parent, or companion. We see the young man tempted and actually fall into the trap of living a life of dishonesty, and manipulation, however after he sees first hand how deceptive and evil that way of life can be, (house not being built, sister not fully healed), he realizes the folly in his actions. The movie sent me the message that life is what you make of it and the way you live it. You can either go about thinking you are happy doing unfavorable deeds and living lies, or you can make an honest living, with the power of love from family, and piece of mind from hard work. A movie with a great soundtrack that delivers powerful messages and harmonies. The thought you have of the characters often sway from the beginning to the end of the movie. So find yourself liking certain ones at one part of the movie then, 10 minute later hating their guts. A great example of suspension of disbelief, the film takes you through a journey that you are not sure where it's going, but your glad your on the ride!",

Life can be pretty repetitive and can just go around and around until someone makes a different decision. In this movie we see a young innocent gypsy who has no ambitions nor any idea of real malice. He is noble and always willing to help his sister and grandmother. He and his sister are orphans but their grandma takes good care of them. The teen begins to live his life and along the way he realizes and gets caught up in a world of ambition and temptation as in nowadays still seems to occur with our youth. Throughout the film there are occurrences that are just showing life repeating itself. Showing and demonstrating that we make our own destiny and a lot of people perhaps have done the same and will most likely do the same. In all honesty there is no revolutionary camera movements or any great styles of cinema involved but the film holds up in its message. The film is sincere and with magical realism makes a joy to watch. Nothing is exaggerated or seems totally out of place. Every scene is important to the story and just makes the film worth watching.",

Ahmed embodies an underdog heroin who over comes the trials of living as a thief, taken under by a villainous tyrant who steals from the rich and the poor.The one aspect that I truly loved about this film was its ability to turn the tables of genre and style so fast. At times you'd think the film was a comedy, but would then turn to a \"by the book\" tragedy. Also, as real as the characters and scenario were, an overlay of magic and fantasy was added by various characters. (Namely the women: Ahmed's grandmother and wife.) Time of the Gypsies embodies Eastern European cinema. It pin points the contrast of the poor and the rich. There's an allegorical message thats hidden behind this film about the evils of power and dominance. Whether Ahmed is commanding a group of people or his own wife, Kusturica exemplifies the dangers of it. Time of a Gypsies is a film that will stick to you as an audience member as it exposes you to oppression and corruption, a world that most people are never exposed to.",

I enjoyed how the film had many different genres from comedy to tragedy. One thing about the movie that really affected me was when Perhan had left his sister in the hospital because he truly trusted Ahmed. In my culture, family is really important and the fact that he left her after he promised he wouldn't, bothered me tremendously. A promise was broken. This film also helped me realize how good I have it and how I should appreciate the things I have in my life especially because in the film the gypsies had nothing but would celebrate life.

Also, a film looks mysterious and dreamlike through magical effects. This film is not the one showing a protagonist's tragedy.

There are several times throughout the film where Perhan, a young Romany boy with telekinetic powers, displays his abilities to defy the laws of physics. At one point in the film Perhan lifts up an entire home. He also uses his powers to show off to the girl he loves. Sadly, the allure of wealth draws him into a world of crime and filth where he is surrounded with the dregs of society. The story is one of redemption. Slowly but surely Perhan becomes disillusioned to the world he had misunderstood, he begins to see it all for what it truly is, a facade. His sister wasn't being cared for, she was being forced to beg for money to fill the pockets of Ahmed, his gangster employer. He wasn't getting a new home built next to Ahmed, it was a lie to give him a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to work towards. Possibly worst of all, once he finally forgives his wife, Azra and accepts that the child she is pregnant with is his, she dies in child birth. So he's left with no wife, a missing sister, and no new home to move his Grandmother into, basically it was all for naught. In the end of the film he exacts revenge on Ahmed by using his powers to do something good for once: kill Ahmed at a party by telikenetically stabbing him with a fork. At the end of the film though he could have easily thrown Ahmed's new wife away from him or at least taken the gun taking himself out of harm's way, but instead he chooses to take what's coming to him as a form of atonement for the corruption and greed he'd undergone.",

All the money, success, fortune etc in the world has no significance if you first of all don't have your family safe and sound. Swedish Proverb - Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow is half a sorrow. Without people we love surrounding us, we are only an empty shell, just a body walking on this earth. Perhan was exactly that when he for 4 years wandered around looking for his sister, we don't even get to see this time in his life because it has no value. Emptiness is all that was. I really got a reminder that maybe I should tell my family more often how much they really mean to me, life is harsh and you don't know what happens around the next corner. Even if you see yourself doing the same things tomorrow as you did yesterday doesn't mean it will. Perhan took for granted that Azra would live after the birth of the child, if he knew what would come to happen, he would never have treated her the way he did. Regret is one of the worst things in life, because you can never go back and tell someone how much they really meant to you.

The part that I enjoyed the most from this movie was watching his journey from boyhood to manhood, seeing him go from an innocent small town dork to a street thug looking for ways to get money.This film embodies what it is to be a foreign film; I strongly recommend it to people who have an interest in seeing life outside the norms of the suburban life.

The film tells the story about a young man, Perhan, in Italy with the special power of the Gypsies, handed down by his grandmother. He is able to use telekinetic powers, a power that gives you the ability to move objects from one place to another without touching them. The story follows his life as he falls into the world of crime in order to make quick money due to his struggle with poverty. He betrays his grandmother by involving himself in crime even though his grandmother never brought him up in that way. As many criminals, it takes loosing everything in order for him to realize that he is doing wrong. So he finally takes action towards all the betrayal involved with the crime scene. He uses his telekinetic powers to take revenge towards those who hurt him. Kusturica does a great job on introducing the Gypsy world to many people like me. Before watching this film I knew nothing about the Gypsies and now I at least understand the powers they contain. Kusturica also uses Magical Realism, the film technique that makes unrealistic things seem okay because it is part of the film's world, perfectly many times in this film. In example, early on in the story he has a tight relationship with his pet turkey. The turkey seems to understand everything Perhan says and all of Perhan's moods throughout the film. Perhan also moves objects with his telekinetic powers; even though it is obviously impossible you believe it can happen within the world of the film. This is a film that I recommend to all audiences.",

In a fantastic narrative, viewer follow Perhan, a Romani teen from a small village in Yugoslavia who is set upon a series of unfortunate events which lead him to follow a gypsy crime boss to Milan. The way in which Kusturica illustrates the tale of this teen's path to help his family is wonderful, the shots and camera movement is rather entertaining and aesthetically pleasing as it compliments the giddy mystical feeling the film's story give off. The aura of the little tricks and magic the grandmother and children radiate attributes to the wonderfully mystical feeling of the film, even through the rough patches on Perhan's journey I still manage to feel the style of the director and the upbeat tones that are present. The kooky unique ending filled with flying cutlery via telekinetic powers made me think of my childhood and wishing I could send items flying with my mind.

As this young man by the name of Pehran is shown to be in love with a young girl named Azra, he finds himself having to prove not only to himself but to Azra's mother that he can take care of Azra, while marrying her and being able to provide for her. Pehran quickly find himself with an opportunity to prove his maturity, as he tags along with a middle aged man Ahmed, who seems like a nice person, but there is more to him than meets the eyes. After several incidents, Pehran gains Ahmed's trust, which leads Pehran to change his whole personality and attitude. During this success, we see the aspects of dreams being unfolded thru the mind of Pehran, in order to let the audience grasp an understanding of his pain and love for his love and possible bride to be Azra. As the film unfolds, Pehran is betrayed by the deceitful Ahmed to conclude the tragedy journey of this film. Director Emir Kusturica does a great job to make the film go thru an epic journey, only to repeat itself in a cycle back to the beginning of the film. We also see the perspective between surrealism and magical surrealism within the film, as events happen where it is seen to be possible but are used as an expression of maybe it could happen. While we also see events that you cant see, that cannot really happen in physical life, in order to show us the fantasy by actually enabling the physical life to connect with the object life.

Not only does this movie tell you the story of a gypsy folk, but it reveals once again as so many movies do and did before, that our problems, though so specific to our culture and lifestyle, are universal after all.The movie is about a young boy, Perhan, and his story of growing up and finding his way. He grows up living with his old grandmother and handicapped younger sister - his mother died when giving birth to him, and his father is unknown (he was a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with his mother). Their uncle Merdzan also lives with them. Merdzan is the family's troublemaker. He is a gambler.Perhan has telekinetic powers, and his grandmother is a healer.Perhan's best friend is his Turkey. He mimics the turkey's sounds, and they seem to understand each other. There is also a girl Perhan likes very much: Azra. But, being the boy of an affair, the mother refuses to let him marry her daughter.One day, Ahmed, a wealthy \"Gypsie sheik\", comes to Perhan's village. Merdzan plays cards against him, but loses and comes home to look for money to repay the men. Not finding any, he accuses the grandmother of hiding it, and in his rage lifts the house's walls up. The following morning, when Perhan, his grandmother, and his sister return to the house, they find out that their uncle boiled Perhan's turkey.Perhan's grandmother gets called to Ahmed's house - she is a healer, and she is asked to heal Ahmed's sick son. She does so. In return, she asks for Ahmed to take Danira to a hospital in Ljubiljana to heal her leg and pay for it. Perhan comes along and promises his grandmother not to leave her, but ends up going to Milan instead because he can't stay at the hospital.Perhan begins working for Ahmed, and his quest for making money in an honest way soon dies and he begins stealing. Other kids work for Ahmed, begging for money on the streets. Eventually, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of his crew when he is double-crossed by his brother.Ahmed then sends Perhan on a mission to find children to work for them. Perhan returns to his old village, where he finds that Azra is pregnant. He still marries her, but only under the condition that she sell the child after its birth, not believing her that it is his. Perhan experiences further disappointments when he finds out that Ahmed is not as he promised building a house for him, and his sister Danira was not healed, but instead disappeared.Azra, still telling Perhan their child is his, dies on their wedding night after giving birth to a boy (while levitating in the air). It is Ahmed who leaves with the child.Perhan finds out that his sister is being used by Ahmed to work for him. He searches for her. After four years, he finally finds her in Rome. She leads him to Perhan Jr., whom he now accepts as his son. He takes both Danira and Perhan Jr. with him, but when boarding the train, tells them to go ahead without him. His son gets mad at him, telling him he knows he will not return, but Perhan leaves (\"Cross my gypsy heart\"), promising to buy him a present - but instead goes back to Ahmed's house to make him pay. Using his telekinetic powers, he kills Ahmed with a fork, but the bride Ahmed was just getting married to, shoots him.The movie ends with Perhan's funeral, and Perhan Jr. taking the coins off his dead father's eyes, and running away.Watching this movie was a mesmerizing escape into another world. It is a dark and harsh reality, full of poverty and crime, and people trying to survive - but it is contrasted by the believes and dreams, and magic, of its characters. Each character has his own special traits and adds to an interesting and challenging story. The movie started in a very light way, giving the impression of a funny story to follow - and ended in a tragedy.Not only the story is captivating - intensified by the magical realism, where things happen that couldn't possibly be true, but we are made to believe that it is the most natural thing that occurred - but also the soundtrack and the photography are absolutely stunning and fantastic!Watching this movie was a very emotional and intense experience. It takes you into another time and space, and lets you forget about your daily life, captivating you in the story of those beautiful yet tragic characters. It is a movie that makes you think about life, and about the power some people have, as well as the circle of life - the end of the movie, when Perhan Jr. steals the gold coins makes you feel that history will repeat itself, how Perhan's story seems to be the fate of his own son as well\u0085A brilliant movie!",

The depiction of how they live there lives was incredibly moving. Although none of them live in a fancy lifestyle, there spirits and character were high most of the time. I think the practice of tradition carries their spirit. The way the culture was captured was just remarkable. By the end you realized how limited by resources, communication, and education these people are. What made the film, carry such power, was its ability to touch on so many different genres. In the beginning it seemed to be more of a romantic comedy. Perhan's struggle to gain the respect of the mother to the woman he loved. And there was of course the comedic scenes with Perhan's Turkey. However, as soon as the Turkey was killed the tone changed to more dramatic and of course by the end Tragic. I wish more movies would take this sort of LIFE genre; completely unpredictable. Good and bad are no longer as distinct as black and white. Our protagonist, starts becoming a less likable character at some points. At the end of the movie you understand that this is a cycle of life, when you see his son at the end left fatherless just as Perhan was as a child. I think movies like these are important in looking at our own lives. Sometimes we must understand that to end a cycle for future generations we must make the choice to change. Think about the history of all the wars we have fought. Most of the time there is a great deal of pride that justifies the violence. Just like Perhan's pride, and greed he left no hope for his son who will likely follow in his footsteps. Tragic.",

Another thing that Kusterica did in this film was the use of magical realism, which allowed the audience to experience the magic aspects of life. The music in the film was also astounding in the way it shows the viewers a part of the gypsies' intriguing culture.

During the movie Perhan has telekinetic powers, which is an example of magical realism. I find the movie very intriguing because not only it describes about the lives of gypsies, but also how they were used to get money as victims of human trafficking. Also in the movie the turkey played an important role. Like Umberto and Flike in \"Umberto D.\", Perhan was attached to the turkey that his grandmother gave him. Even after his uncle slaughtered and killed the turkey. There were scenes that it looked the the turkey was keeping an eye on Perhan so that he doesn't cause trouble, even when Perhan dies the turkey is still with Perhan.",

It was my favorite because of the different ways the story could of unfolded. The style of this film is Magic Realism, and I recommended this film to all film lovers because of the unexpected images. It is a film that can be viewed and let the viewer be taken into the story, specially with the help of the music by Goran Bregovic. The music moved me in a way that I was able to connect with Perhan, the protagonist. It also added to the mood, and gave it an uplifting tone. This is a type of film that the audience has to experience watching it, rather than just reading about it because of the magical aspects that the characters endorse. The film conveys multiple layers of themes, throughout the whole film, and it is fascinating to watch it again a second time, because there is a better grasp and understanding of the culture, and beliefs of the Gypsies that Emir Kusturica has presented through \"Time of the Gypsies\".",

In the beginning, Perhan and his friendship with his turkey made brought me joy and laughter which reminded me of my great bond between my best friend and me. Later, the roller-coaster of sadness follows with Perhan leaving his sister at the hospital, Arzia's death and ultimately Perhan's death. Although the ending isn't the happiest one, we get a glimpse of the gypsies' life and though they had many struggles, they seemed to make the best of what they had. We also see the use of magic realism which was seamlessly incorporated by making me believe that powers like rising Azria into the air was a normal act. Although the gypsy culture was very specific, I saw many cultural parallels to my Persian culture. My mother's family in Iran did not have so much just like Perhan and his family but their family love ties them together and keeps them alive (but not in Perhan selfish case in which he chose to go back and get revenge on Ahmed). Overall this was a great movie which I would defiantly recommend.",

He goes so far as to attempt to kill himself when he believes he will never be able to marry her. This is in stark contrast to how he reacts when he returns from being under Ahmed's \"tutelage\".To me it felt like Parnhan's time away from home completely changed him. It made him realize that many things he dreamed of, like having his own house built and having a good future with Azra, were never going to happen.Towards the end, when he finds his sister and his son, it once again seems like there will be a happy ending where all the family will be reunited. Unfortunately, this does not come to pass either.For some strange reason, watching a movie that can give hope, only to crush it terribly , is really satisfying. Maybe it is because it deeply resonates with how our lives really are. Sometimes we are having the time of our lives and the next moment we are so down that we think we will never get up. Time of the Gypsies displays this throughout the entire film, and that it what makes it so great.",

I felt bad for Azra, Perhan never really gave her a chance when he found out she was pregnant and wasn't sure if it was his.

Perhan, the protagonist is playing with his pet turkey that he can communicate with, his drunk uncle is singing and his sister and his grandmother seem to have a very positive relationship. The movie however begins to take the viewer on a journey never expected., Perhan is set up as an innocent grandma's boy who wants to make something of himself. He wants to change his desolate surroundings and be able to provide for his family without sacrificing his morality. After Perhan's uncle destroys their house in a drunken rage his family has no one to turn to. When Ahmed, the town's \"big shot\" money man returns from Paris Perhan is granted the opportunity to make a living. In exchange for healing Ahmed's son, Ahmed has promised Perhan's grandmother that he would take Perhan's sister to a hospital to get her legs fixed and that he would teach Perhan how to make money. Perhan and his sister are suddenly taken away form their environment and forced to survive. This for me is when I began to get a feeling that something fishy was going on . The scene where Perhan and his sister begin to leave the town served as a foreshadow that represented what the movie meant to me. As a viewer the move told me that not everything is black and white and that our pursuit of material things can damage our relationships and moral values. Often when we society view things as right and wrong but this films poses the question of what is right and wrong. When we see Perhan compromise his morals and began to become Ahmed I questioned myself and asked was it necessarily wrong for Perhan exploit t other kids. From the beginning we I saw the disparity in his village. I knew that in reality being disconnected from the real he had no real chance in life. But then it made me realize how people often compromise themselves for material beings. I found that this compromise for material things made me a little angry. The anger came from the fact that people like Perhan who come from less fortunate backgrounds are often the ones who end up as victims in their pursuit for material gain.",

I believe seeing this as one entity would be foolish. Dividing it into two parts would do the movie more good. During the first half of the movie, we see Perhan living on the village side with his grandmother, crippled sister and his uncle. Later, more precisely midway through the film, we see the mood of the movie switch dramatically. It starts out as a light hearted comedy, but when Ahmed, the kind of Gypsies, drives through the town to collect crippled children and dwarfs, we see it switch to a more tragic and serious tone. This continues throughout the entire movie, as Perhan decides to Join the caravan, in exchange for healing her sister's leg. As excepted, it all unfolds as a lie story and tragedy- where no one keeps promises and friendship is built on lies.\"Time of the Gypsies\" is an amazing visual treat - it shows a healthy amount of surrealism of sound, element, scene and story. Perhan's adventures truly represent the nature of the human heart, a persons loss of innocence, the difficulty of growing up and losing dreams.Two specific parts that affected me very personally and emotionally in the movie, were the dream sequences that Perhan experiences. I believe \"Time of the Gypsies\" is one of the best movies to re create dream sequences in a realistic and believable way. The sheer beauty of the scenery and camera work can not be stressed enough. The first dream functions as a transpositions of images; so powerful that it could easily be the single highlight of the movie. The second dream sequence is scenery of madness, depravity and distance from his loved ones. A lot of times, it is very hard to distinguish the dreams from the actual movie, but that is what makes it magical and unreal.After watching the movie, I felt a little bit sad. I felt Perhan had been told throughout the entire movie that life is just a mirage. Maybe life is just a mirage, and what we do is pointless. But believing in making a difference is very important. I believe Perhan understood that at the end. If it was for the better or worse, would be up to the viewer to decide.",

I really enjoyed how the film didn't show a bias towards one culture or another, just the differences. In this film you see what greed can do to ruin you. I enjoyed seeing the main characters struggles with his moral values and what he eventually does to make money and \"fame\" from his fellow gypsies. I took it as a big statement of not letting material things change who you are. I really enjoyed the use of magical realism in this film. It was to the point of me having to discuss it with friends to really see how many instincts there were in this film. They really are very hard to realize once you get emerged with this movie. It was a great job, especially because it was one of the first films i personally have seen with the use of magical realism. Throughout the movie I felt as if I was putting myself in the same sort of position asking if in the same situation how would i handle it. I also liked the background love story, some may not see it as that, but i definitely believed that the reason Perhan changed so much was to win over Azra and her family. I also enjoyed the constant conflict form the uncle in the film and the face that it seemed to have little to no shock factor for the family.

We learn that the protagonist, Perhan, lost his mother at a young age and we soon realize the love of his life; Azra is the reincarnation of his mother. We know this because Azra's wind-blown veil resembles the veil that Perhan's mother wears when she comes to visit Danira (Perhan's sister) in her dream. Perhan's child, Perhan Jr., is in fact the reincarnation of himself as is Ahmed's child. When Perhan dies, Perhan Jr. starts the cycle all over again. This is evident in the last scene when Perhan Jr. hides under a box and runs away as did Perhan earlier in the film. One message that this film portrays is that life is a cycle that never ends. All the hardships and struggles of a generation don't just disappear at the rise of a new one. In order to survive in this world we must keep learning from our past mistakes.

Some of my favorite scenes that dealt with this concept were when Perhan's deceased mother visited his sister while they were on the road trip to the hospital and also the scene where Perhan's wife levitates after childbirth. The cinematography, especially of these two particular scenes, is stunning. The delicate white wedding attire and the gust of the wind give each scene a feeling of spiritual peace even though they both represent someone who is forever lost from the physical world; there are emotionally as well as visually intriguing. The ending, when Perhan decides to go back for revenge, was such a let down. I disliked how his greed overcame him once again, and how it ultimately lead to his death. I wish he could have just kept things simple and went home with his sister and son, to give the story a somewhat fairytale ending. Kusturica's ending of course was a lot more powerful and effective, but I really wished Perhan could have overcame this cycle of greed so that he could be there for his family.",

The message I received out of it was that life is a continuous flow of of events that is easy to get lost in. It is your challenge within life to not just go with whatever path life presents to you, but to instead take life within your own hands and to create your own path. To unconsciously go through life will lead you to subconsciously follow patterns of those who precede you, just as Pehran did. An example is that Pehran grew up without a father, and his son will grow up without a father as well for he dies at the end of the movie; he dies based on the path he allowed himself to get sucked into. It emotionally affected me because the director did such a great job in character development and gave you a lot of time to get to know them and create a connection with them.

            "content": "A wonderfully crafted movie, this film tells the story of Perhan, a somewhat \"touched\" young man who initially doesn't even seem to be the protagonist, but sort of an odd secondary character who plays an accordion and has the (somehow unimpressive to those around him) ability to levitate things. This magical realism colors the movie throughout and adds an otherworldly element to the otherwise impoverished, scrapyard world of the gypsies. Perhan begins very innocent and in love, and the film itself begins very funny and we think we are watching a light-hearted comedy. Maybe we are, but through many trials and turns, our young gypsy becomes a very disillusioned, bitter and desperate man, and we realize we are actually watching a tragedy. And then it gets funny again. It is a brilliant feat, interweaving these two disparate genres, but isn't that just like life? Quite equal parts comic and tragic, at least to those of us who are paying attention.The story itself is part coming-of-age, part revenge tale, part sit-com, part mystery, and all masterfully done. I can only assume that this film greatly influenced the likes of the Coen Brothers and Charlie Kaufman, who both have such an innate sense of that beautiful fusion of joy and despair. If you are fan of either of the above, I highly recommend Time of the Gypsies.",

You think that the movie is a comedy, but it takes you on many trips. Greed and corruption is a powerful thing even among family.The acting was very good and the story was unique. It was interesting discovering the different turns that the plot takes the audience. On many levels Return of the Gypsies is a everyday tall told in kind of a fantasy way.",

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypsies\" is a film about the life of a juvenile boy, who after life's events force him to leaves his small gypsy village for a darker world of crime and corruption.As Perhan is riding away in the car with his infirm sister Danira from the safe life he has been accustomed to, he looks terrified while his grandmother's candy apples drop to the ground as if signifying the end of his innocence and childhood, and the start of no-nonsense responsibility and virility. After Danira is dropped off at the hospital we are overcome with a sense of uneasiness, knowing that her fate lies in the hands of the sly and untrustworthy vagrant Ahmed. Perhan's naivete and virtues eventually start to crumble as he transforms under the dissolute hand of Ahmed and is thrust into a corrupt world of child beggars and prostitutes. Now a money-flaunting slick criminal, he returns to his village with intention to marry Azra who is now pregnant, which infuriates Perhan. Easily despicable, he has become a shadow of his former self, growing hardened and callous by the criminal underworld that binds him. Refusing to acknowledge his unborn child as his own, he no longer sees Azra as worthy and agrees to only marry her in order to get a profit for selling the child. After she dies giving birth, Azra's death reawakens his sense of integrity, leading him to go on a 4 year search for Ahmed to set things right and make peace with himself. However, after finding his continually debilitated sister and son who he now accepts as his own, it's not surprising to see him sacrifice the chance of reconciliation and the fresh start for a good life. The past few years have changed his priorities and set him on a path of burning revenge. This desire for revenge however is not entirely in vain; Perhan is aware he would have to eliminate Ahmed and his brothers sooner or later, as to prevent future harm to his sister and son. Nonetheless, it's distressing and perplexing to see him forfeit what we think is the ideal ending. Although Perhan leaves an orphan and family behind, the conclusion is somewhat jovial as Perhan dies feeling personally fulfilled by the expression on his face and the vision of his childhood pet turkey. It's interesting to note that no mourning for his death takes place; instead drinks are passed around in celebration of his life. Lastly, Perhan's son is drawn to the coins, which he symbolically steals in good humor- essentially confirming the legitimacy to Perhan, whos spirit will live on through his son.",

            "content": "So the 995th movie was 'Time of the Gypsies' - a classic from Emir Kusturica.The masterful ending wrapped up so many grand ideas and concepts in one carefully enmeshed serving that one would have a hard time believing if the underlying themes enthusing stories such as this film are capable of being consciously curated or if these underlying themes have an abstract existence of their own - as Dawkins' memes; only to find contemporary expression from time to time.It was a tragedy wrapped in a parody summed up expertly in Merdzan's confessional monologue at the end, which was comically shuttered when Jesus' cross fell back to its position before Merdzan had restored it. Though it was gravity that restored Jesus' cross to its upside down view of the world; in the context of the climax - it profoundly declared that Merdzan's crookedness also had a role to play and his evilness helped move the plot.The setting in the gypsy community was perhaps apt for the western lens to understand an amoral view of the world. The gypsies' reputation for not adhering to any modern notions of ownership and property rights, noted in Ebert's review - provided fluid grounds for the film creators to craft an amoral storyline that does not preach.The grand narrative kind of ties with the concept of 'Yin and Yang', and in the context of the film, an idea is pushed that evil drives one to understand the 'hero'. It was Joker who made the Batman. It was Kauravas who made the Pandavas. It was the Romans who made Jesus. It was Raavana who made Rama. You kinda get the drift what it alludes to considering the cultural politics of our times ( \ud83d\ude09 ).Fun fact: The characters were gypsy muslims, but the absence of imagery of the divine in Islam led to the director featuring the christian representation of divine. An imagery of the divine was crucial to act as divine imprimatur on the turn of events, including all of the good, the bad and the evil.",

It's extremely entertaining from start to finish and had me on the edge of my seat. The beginning of it was fun and playful, and contained humor. There were some cheesy elements in the film that fit right in and were really funny. For example, when our protagonist decided he would hang himself because of his lady friends mean mother, he brought his pet turkey with him. His turkey saw him hanging and calling for help. After changing his mind, like so many people do, his turkey went off to find him help; this is where it was really funny. The turkey presented itself to a man on the road, the man said \"what is such a beautiful pet doing out this late?\" then he followed the turkey and saved our protagonist's life. The style in which the turkey was shot, and the man's reaction was really funny.The story slowly took shape and evolved into a sad intense mood. Red flags went off in my mind when the gypsy gangster decided that he would help the protagonist's sick sister. I cringed when our protagonists discovered that his turkey was slaughtered and he found its carcass in a pot of water. The film had scenes that were hard to stomach when the protagonist arrived in Italy. The element of magical realism lifted brought some light into the film. It made me feel emotionally sad when our protagonist was shot and died in the end.Overall, Time of the Gypsies was entertaining, and artistic in both style and content. This film will pull at the strings of your emotions, as it did to mine.",

The story begins with a young boy named Perhan, whose story and character gradually shifts through out the film.First of all I could mention that I am familiar with the culture and people that are involved in this film. In my country, same as in many European countries we have Gipsys living in exactly same conditions as shown in the film. On one hand you feel sorry for the people and their terrible economical situation, but on the other hand you see them robbing people, selling drugs and doing any other crimes. This movie is exactly about that.After Perhan left his village, I realized that most likely he will join the gangsters that he is traveling with. Unfortunately that happened in the film. Actor that played Perhan delivered amazing performance, with shifting character that involved me in the story deeper and deeper. In the middle of the movie I couldn't take my eyes of because actions and decisions that he was making were so unexpected. Although their economical situation and harsh life, Gipsys enjoy their lives probably more than we do.Finally I would love to mention that this movie made me even more aware of the hard but on the other hand amazingly amusing life that Gipsys live. Sometimes you can feel angry because of the crimes they commit, but at the same time you realize that the life they live is not always as amusing as we see through out the film.",

He later finds out that he has been lied to by the boss and that there is no help for his ill sister. Through out the film, director Kusturica shows how this once innocent boy is corrupted by the people surrounding him and how he becomes evil person. Many of the moments in the film will make you think; \"why is it that someone like that be corrupted?; how is it that there are people who can just watch what is happening and do nothing?\" I was deeply moved by how this kid became corrupted. It's interesting to see how this boy acts when he has the power and makes you think that not many people would act any different. You can see how the environment influences people.

The story made me think about how there are people in this world who seem to have some type of \"other-worldliness\" about them, whether it be because of their profession or their accomplishments, or what they've seen and done in their lives, but in the end, they are still just human. We make mistakes, we feel loss, we act impulsively when we are angry or hurt, because we are human. And despite Perhan's \"other-worldly\" or \"super-human\" telekinetic powers, in my eyes, he was still just a boy who got lost on his way to trying to do right by his family. This story has it all: love, loss, family, friendship, betrayal, loss of innocence. Kusturica created an honest, noteworthy film that reminds us how easy it is to be seduced by temptations in life that could ultimately make us forget who we are.

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypsies\" is one of my first films watched by Emir Kusturica. Shockingly enough I was pretty surprised at the real meaning of the movie which is: A home for hanging. I still am some what confused on that. I wasn't sure at first if it was going to be something that I was going to like or not, but at the time there was really no choice, as I watched it for a film class. I found the movie to be very moving as it shows a culture that isn't very often looked at or talked about. It was a movie that was set in Yugoslovia, and was a take on reality, but fantasy as well. It represents broad humanism beautifully. The movie to me was about revenge, values, and love. When Perhan struggled over and over to get money, he forgot what was really important in his life which were the people he loved. Coming from nothing and living with his grandmother and sick sister, he was basically the man of the house. But he was in constant conflict throughout the movie which also keeps it interesting. The roles of different women in Perhans life I found to be interesting as well, and they some what pieced his identity together. These relationships I found were very influential throughout the film. He had his grandmother that loved him unconditionally no matter what. Especially being he was originally an orphan because of his mothers death during childbirth. It seemed as though he could do no harm in her eyes. Then there was his sister Danira that was very sick and looked to Perhan as hope, hope that he would help cure her sickness and always stick by her. It gave him something to live for. And the third female in his life was his love Azra. She symbolized love and innocence. He would have done anything for her and loved her with all of his heart. But she betrays and lies to him, and that's where I felt he kind of lost his mind a bit. Magical realism played a big part in the movie as Perhan had telekinetic powers to move objects. It showed at the beginning of the film that he had these powers, but they didn't seem important until the end. I will keep that for the viewers to see why. Overall I thought \"Time of the Gypsies\" was a great film. It wouldn't be a film I would choose on my own to watch, so I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it. It was a very powerful and beautiful movie really about a young boy in Yugoslovia growing up and having to deal with the battles of life. The acting was excellent, and to me the music was one of the best parts. The story was magnificent as it was some what told through the eyes of the Yugoslavian gypsies. It was a coming of age story...a journey that we get to experience through a film. It was a very surreal and vibrant film that I recommend for others to watch if they have a chance. It's no Hollywood film for sure, and that's what also is so great about it! If you want no special effects then this movie is for you! It's really a movie I can't compare to any other. You will just have to see it to know what I mean. It kind of by the end of the movie showed me that there really is more to life than what meets the eye.",

It shows us events that could happen in real life that does not physical happens in real life. Magical incident but are not acknowledge in real life. It shows us that something extraordinary can happen in our everyday life. What I loved about this movie is that you do not know where the movie is taking you, because the movie itself does not follow a formula. It does have different genres, it first starts of with a humor. Then it takes a turn to a more seriously genres that eventually turns into tragedy. The film represent its own rule, it defined its own logical frame. It does not have the typical happy ending. If you look at another point of view you could see that the movie ends the same way it started with the wedding and a orphan kid. Another thing that I would like to point out is how Kuturica the director shows us how the other characters in the movie build the character of Perhan. You get to see the unconditional love from his grandmother. She is the moral center in the movie. She brings out the moral and reminds him of how good he use to be, a grandmothers boy. From Azra his wife, he felt betrayed because he thought she was carrying someone else child. His sister Danira brings hope to him. Perhan also felt betrayal from Ahmed that he in a way saw as a father figure. Kuturica made us think that the first Perhan dream of the river sequence, where he imagine getting married to Azra is just imagination, a dream. The amazing thing about this scene is that the director gives us reason to believe that it might not just be a dream nor a imagination, when Azra burns herself under her breast. We get to see her to it again on their wedding night when Perhan rejects her. By Azra writing Perhan's name with burn marks makes the river scene real or felt real. I Love that Kuturica is twisting our minds. This proves the magical realism. What Kuturica is trying to say is that imagining feels real, to imagine is real. There is definitely a theme of self sacrifice is this movie. When Perhan returns to his village and finds Azra pregnant it turns him into a \"mean bastard\". He brings her to Rome and he treats her badly saying things like \"give birth to your child so I can sell him\". The self sacrifice that helps Perhan become human again is when Azra dies giving birth to the child and seeing her hovering in the air made him realize that the child was his. One again this movie has truly a powerful storytelling, it is so beautiful, spiritual and tragic. The music is very moving and amazing. It is so beautiful that it fills you with so much mixed emotion. I definitely recommend this movie for people to see. I feel sorry for these children. When someone rich from their village come and visit them, the poor believes that if the children goes with them they'll have that wonderful life they've always wanted, but it just gets worse. It breaks my heart. For Emir Kuturica to make the character Perhan tolerate and bear with awfulness to collect enough money for his grandmother and sister takes courage and I loved that.",

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypsies\" by Emir Kusturica is certainly one of the most unique and profound movies I saw in a long time. It was an impressive story about the innocence of being a child (a world that can often be quite magical) and the harsh reality of being an adult, of having to take on responsibility and making tough decision in order to survive. I really think that Emir Kusturica told this story very honestly, with a rare insight into a world of child trafficking and ruthless exploitation. This isn't a very usual topic but I think it was a story that needed to be told, because as much as we'd like to deny it \u2013 it isn't just a movie, it's reality. Something that made the movie even more unique is the fact that it was spoken in Romany. In my opinion \"Time of the Gypsies\" is a movie worth watching, especially if you appreciate real stories, without glorifications and refurbished dialogues but honest and straight to the point.",

            "content": "I truly enjoyed this film, although it completely caught me off-guard. This movie truly was an emotional roller coaster, as the audience truly wants Perhan and Azra to have a happy and satisfying life together. Although the beginning of the film truly depicts a comedy, it foreshadows the tragic end of Perhan after the initial rejection of his marriage proposal to Azra by her mother. This film depicts family interrelations and social standings, even within a so-called gypsy community. I personally loved the formalistic moments of the film, especially the personification of Perhan's turkey and the majestic, spiritual experience that Perhan and Azra experienced together at the river which consummated their relationship, and ultimately led to the demise of Azra, as it resulted in the conception of a child, Perhan Jr. The relationships depicted in this film were beautiful and tragic, as the Perhan becomes corrupted during his journey with his little sister, Danira, to repair her club foot, in which the hospital does not exist and she is taken from him. As he fails to protect his little sister and is forced into a world of corruption his initially lovable traits diminish. As Perhan loses his trust in people, he loses his loving relationship with Azra. He believes she is deceitful and only in death is he able to realize her pure intentions. The spirit of his mother is present through hard times, which is simply accepted in this film. Although Perhan eventually finds his little sister and son again, he is unable to let go of the grudges he has developed against the man who led to his downfall. Towards the end of the film he utilizes his magical powers to kill the man who did wrong by him and his family, Ahmed, which in turn leads to the execution of the initial foreshadowing, Perhan's death. This film has so many beautiful aspects from the filming to loving family ties, that it's a tragedy that it has not been released in the US on DVD.",

He lives with his grandmother, his little handicapped sister, and his gambler uncle. They live in a Gypsy community in a village located in Sarajevo. The story gets even more interesting when Perhan is tricked into traveling to Italy with Ahmed (a local Gypsy lord that everybody respects in the village), leaving his grandmother and only love (Azra) behind. Ahmed traffics babies to Italy. Perhan automatically gets involved in the dangerous lifestyle Ahmed is living. Time of the Gypsies is a great example of a Magical Realism movie. It starts as a drama and ends in tragedy. You don't know what to expect from the movie or what comes next! Just like life, where nothing is formulated and you never know what to expect. Through out the movie, we witness Parham's growth and change, as a young boy to a young adult. The director, Emir Kusturica, humanizes the characters in the movie without glamorizing them. Even though the movie takes place in a village so far from us and our lifestyle or everyday habits but the true human experience that's happening every moment of the movie is something we can all relate to; And most importantly, they are shown in the most interesting way that makes you forget that their lifestyles is different than ours.",

By the end of this film, I found that it had evoked some uncomfortable emotions within me, primarily due to its dark undertones and the habitual presence of death and betrayal. Nevertheless, I don't dismiss these emotions. I found myself embracing the artistic intentions of the director and respecting his ability to manipulate my feelings. This film intertwined elements of magical realism, instituting a very mystical essence which in turn added to its accessibility and overall charm. Kustirica wanted to surface the idea that beyond our physical barriers, there are elements in nature that really have no explanation. In other words, there are things that tend to occur in reality that are actually surreal, though we may not necessarily acknowledge there presence. Throughout the movie, we follow our protagonist, Perham, as he makes his journey from a young, emotional, immature boy into a responsible adult, willing to make sacrifices for himself and his family while living life on his own terms. It's a genuine 'coming-of-age' story. The choices that the characters make within the plot, are driven by emotion and not necessarily rational behavior. For example: Perham attempting suicide, attacking his uncle, and leaving his son and sister on the train for vengeance, ultimately leading to his demise. This notion that 'emotion' being the driving force behind these characters choices, parallel the Gypsy culture. Where most filmmakers shed gypsies in a negative light, Kustirica glorifies them. He demonstrated the raw human emotion that this group possesses through a tremendous exploration of music and dance.",

The story focuses upon Perhan, a Gypsy teenager with telekinetic powers who is vibrant and thoroughly optimistic about life and what the future holds for him. On a quest to marry his beloved, he sets out to make a name for himself and raise enough money to build a house for his future bride. The journey however leads Perhan into the sleazy underbelly of the Gypsy lifestyle where his youth is taken from him and the magic he saw in everyday life is extracted. Kusturica uses powerful visuals and an amazing score to build the Romani Gypsy's world and introduces a viewer to a microcosm so applicable to society in general, providing a lesson from the fringes of modern society, that is to never forget the magic in the world and to not take what you have for granted.",

Closer to most of the audience in working class, the story background is surround a poor family facing with a lot of humanity problem.I really like this movie as it contain a lot of moral problem and the struggling between money and love such as Perhan's uncle Merdzan hang up his grandmother's house because of lack of money, Perhan and Azra were not allowed to marry because of money, and the seduction of the quick-cash on Perhan. Every situation represented a struggle and a chance to show one's virtue. In fact, those situations happened quite often in our daily life. Seeing the story of Perhan, Emir reminds me the time of making wrong decisions in the past and causing endless of troubles to my friends and parents.When Perhan was suffering from his uncle and Azra's mother, I felt the loneliness and the lack of support from the world. This is so truth that, in the world, people won't help you. You are always on you own when you grow. If you are poor, you were forced to become independent more younger than the others. The sadness and the lack of love have impacted me. With a little anger to the world and anger to the limited ability that one man could do.The music in the movie has played a role to empower the sad tone to a higher level. I really like the unique style of the songs and soundtracks on the background. Not only it addressed a cultural feeling to the movie, but also the melody and the tone of the song have match the tone of the scenes. Often times, I was moved not by the scene and the acting, but by the music behind the screen matching to the story.",

Emir Kusturica directs a crime drama with so much more to offer. Within the film there are great examples of magical realism as well as a fantastic coming-of-age story for the main character Perhan. Something that greatly interested me in the film was the reoccurring genre of magical realism. For one the genre greatly interests me because it is a large part of Latin literature. In fact, it is a huge part of House of the Spirits which is a favorite novel of mine. Without a doubt both Isabel Allende and Emir Kusturica combine the fantastic and the real flawlessly. The effect is a great story that transcends the norm. An element of the film that I really loved was the loss of innocence that Perhan went through. I found it to be a familiar story of sorts but in a completely different setting. This for one made me think globally versus locally in terms of what people go through. The story progressed and showed Perhan falling to a life of crime that ultimately changes his existence and affects those important to his life. The idea that the film took place in the former Yugoslavia also spoke to me, and I was completely engulfed in the film.",

If you ever wanted to know what life is like for Gypsies in the Eastern Europe, all you have to do is watch the first 45 minutes. At first, you want to feel bad for the people in Parham's village. But, with an open mind, you realize that they are happy living as a close community that faces oppression on a regular basis.The fact that Kusturica is not of Romanian descent, and yet it feels so true to their way of life, is extremely impressive.The one aspect of this film that really impressed me was the amount of magical realism that is presented to the audience. Which they set you up for right at the beginning when Parham moves a utensil using his telekinetic powers. As an audience it seems ridiculous at first glance, but the characters accept it as normal, so in turn so do we. The floating veil of the deceased mother (which also) foreshadows the death of Parham's wife), the wedding in the river, Azra's floating dead body, etc. Everything that happens seems fantastical in this world, but when you are engrossed in their world, it seems nothing but real.In the end you are left with many questions. Like, is the son really Parham's? Did Parham sacrifice himself to save his family? Were the tragedies directly brought on by Parham's neglect to fulfill is promise to his Grandmother? Overall, this film really moved me with its mix of genres, tonal cuts, and a direct look into a culture that I never really knew much about.",

            "content": "Time of the Gypsies is a very funny movie that manages to have a fantastic plot not ruined by gags and one liners. We see a lot of comedic scenes like those found in Hollywood movies but Kusturica knows how to balance comedy,drama,magic realism, and all the other things that make this movie so great. The movie starts off a bit goofy but transitions into a very serious movie about the changes that occur to a young kid because of a manipulative and lying man.The movie in summary is about a kid named Perhan who is taken to Milan to get rich by Ahmed. This money is suppose to build a house and treat his sister's leg at a hospital she was left at by Ahmed. Perhan also saves up money so he may be allowed to marry Azra, his girlfriend before he left the village, by proving he has potential and wealth. He finds out that Azra is pregnant but is unaware who is the father. Perhan believes it's his uncles kid but Azra insists its Perhan's kid. These events add to Perhan disillusionment. He had been lied to by Ahmed and neither his house or sister's health were being funded by the money earned by Perhan. Perhan didn't believe the kid was his but proceeded to marry her.Azra has the kid in a magical scene but dies giving birth. He finds out his sister and son were taken by Ahmed so she can work for him. Perhan goes 4 years looking for her, he finally finds her and his kid as well. He puts them on a train back home, goes and kills Ahmed and his brothers but is unfortunately killed by Ahmed's new wife.Not only was the plot one of the most important factors that kept me entertain but Kusturica's ability to sneak in elements of magic realism and his implication of suspension of disbelief were pulled off amazingly. I went throughout the whole movie without questioning anything out of the ordinary. A turkey that was trained and behaved like Perhan's turkey seems completely normal to me. Seeing him move a can and spoon was surprisingly normal too. Transitions from real life to a dream were subtle that in some scenes it was difficult to differentiate real life from a dream. The scenes that dealt with magic realism weren't over the top. In a book magic realism can be written so a reader can visualize it and interpret the scene in their head differently from other readers so this causes the reader to make the scene believable to themselves only. In a movie it is different, the director visualizes the scene for us and its up to us to decide if its believable or not and Kusturica did a great job. The scenes looked like they can happen at any time of day.The movie will change mood,tone as it plays. As I mentioned earlier, the movie starts with some laughs but changes into a serious drama about the struggles of minorities in that area. The actions depicted by Ahmed occurs in that area and in many poor areas throughout the world even today. Kids are forced to pretend they have disabilities just to stand on a street asking for money. Girls are turned into prostitutes and kids are beaten if they refuse to work. It is a very serious issue that plagues many similar areas and Time of the Gypsies does a good job of displaying it seriously on film.Characters are also easy to like but can also be easily hated. Perhan started as lovable character who I could relate to but the more corrupt and powerful he got through his wealth, the more I disliked him. I hated him when he kept planning to sell his kid before he was born. As quickly as I started to dislike him and I started to like him more when he saw his wrongs and tried to make everything right. I was on the edge of my seat as he tried to jump into the train and was disappointed and saddened when he was killed. Other characters were also the same; the uncle,Azra,Perhan's kid and even Ahmed. They all did things in the movie that can change one's opinion of them.This movie is a now a personal favorite and I have been recommending it to multiple people. Unfortunately, according to my professor at SMC the movie is difficult to find but definitely worthy of being watched when found.",

Throughout the movie Perhan changes and in the end we are not sure who he is anymore or where his morality went, even though we are still able to understand most of his choices. The movie draw us into a bad circle showing us that crime always lead to crime, and hate will only give birth to more hate. Despite this fact it is in many ways a story of hope, and a story about how a man actually can change his fate. The acing is outstanding and so is the way the movie is shot, in a very realistic way that by the way completely makes us forget the magical elements like the fact that Perhan can levitate things.

Upon hearing the idea that its \"cyclical structure in a messy story\" is reminiscent of the idea that the stories of Gypsies are timeless, I couldn't help but feel that there are definitely aspects to the film that are essentializing. It being about the Gypsies' celebration of life despite daunting conditions and Kusturica's attempts at understanding the culture by \"humanizing\" them definitely bother me a bit. Stereotyping the culture in such a way, and regarding them as this warm, fun culture that always finds reason to celebrate life is condescending in the same way that my white high school classmate defends their racism by saying that they have a black person and that they \"love\" black people. In addition, Kusturica's want to \"humanize\" Gypsies suggests that they needed to be humanized, which is also rather irksome. The soundtrack and the cinematography were up to par, but I do wish that the possibility of cultural appropriation was taken into account.",

Magical realism being shown through defying logical explanation in a realistic and attainable way. Some examples show throughout the movie are the instance of the tin can being moved telepathically, the healing powers of Perhan's grandmother, and the levitation of Azra after giving birth. As far the plot is concerned, instances of disillusionment is key characteristic of this movie. For instance, when Perhan believes he has sent his sister to the hospital to have her leg treated and then becomes aware that his sister has been sold instead is a moment that viewers reflect on the reality of situations being outside our control. The cyclical nature of the movie widely influenced how characters interacted with one another and also the development of plot construction. There are three specific events that reoccur within the movie that attribute to making this film seem timeless and universal. One example is how Perhan imitates his Ahmed's thievish antics despite his previous repulsion by them. Also, the ruined wedding begins and ends the film which made me feel as though unfortunate situations are inevitable. Lastly, the association with Perhan's mother dying during childbirth and Azra's death is a blatant example of the cycle of life and death.",

The former Yugoslavian society still treats Gypsies as outcasts in the society.

Unfortunately, Perhan does not trust the one person he should, his son, which ends up being pure tragedy because he leaves his son in the same situation that he grew up in. This made me think about this little boy growing up and getting in the same trouble as Perhan ended up in and what his life may be like growing up without a mother or father, which would be truly sad.",

            "content": "Time Of The Gypsies is a masterpiece by Kusturica that gives us an enlightening insight into Gypsy culture. Through the life of main character Perhan, Kusturica gradually takes us from extreme happiness and a celebratory mood despite the dark cloud of poverty, to a grim atmosphere of revenge and death. The movie starts of as a happy, almost comedic film, but slowly shifts to a more serious and dramatic tone, to eventually end up as a full blown tragedy. Perhan's life has always been difficult; his mother has passed away, while he has never known his father, a Slovenian soldier. To me, this movie is about Perhan's journey to attain a sense of belonging. Even though he feels the unconditional love of his grandmother and other family members, Perhan wants to create a family of his own and have the family that his parents couldn't give him. But from the moment he leaves town with Ahmed to bring his sister Danira to the hospital for her leg and earn money to marry Azra, he gradually becomes desensitized, though not dehumanized. His dream of having a family of his own is seemingly shattered when he returns from Milan and finds Azra pregnant. But he's convinced that it's not his, even though we get the strong sense from Azra that he is in fact the father. Then Azra dies while giving birth to her son, after which Ahmed leaves with the baby. Perhan finds out that Ahmed, the man he thought of as a father has double crossed him. His sister never received treatment, and Ahmed never built him a house. He goes off to Rome to search for his sister and Ahmed on whom he wants to get revenge. After 4 years he finds his sister and also Azra's son, who may or may not be his son, but who is also called Perhan. He accepts the boy as his son. Perhan has the choice to go home with his son and his sister, but decides to kill Ahmed first. He succeeds in killing Ahmed, but is shot dead by Ahmed's widow. A tragic ending to a life of unfulfilled dreams for Perhan, which ironically leaves his son an orphan, just as he was himself. Perhan's dream of having a family went unfulfilled, when the love of his life died, thinking that she gave birth to someone else's baby. Perhan's sense of family also evaporates when his surrogate father turns out to be a con-artist. Perhan's life jumps from disappointment to disappointment in his quest to find a sense of belonging, while he becomes so desensitized during that journey that he's not able to see anymore what brings him happiness. He chooses death instead of life and love, when he leaves his son on the train to seek redemption for himself and his family. It is the wrong choice, but yet given what we know about what he has endured, not completely incomprehensible. Perhan, a young man, has caved under the cruelness that life can bring. I think what Kusturica is telling us here, is that the emotions and actions of Perhan are universal, and this story is not exclusively a Gypsy story. Perhan's life story could've started and finished in suburbia. Human emotions are universal. The way that we deal with those emotions depends upon ourselves, and is not exclusive to the culture that we belong to. Kusturica humanizes the Gypsies by showing us and teaching us about the Gypsy culture, which is very different from western culture and is often misunderstood in a negative way, but emphasizes that the people that make up that culture are the same as anybody else with the same emotions, hence the same drama occur anywhere. This is a very significant movie because of that: the rich Gypsy culture and its people are fully shown, so that outsiders can see what a beautiful culture this is. The mysticism about Gypsies and their culture, which has been the reason for misunderstanding and persecution for a long time in Europe, is taken away. Cinematically, what Kusturica does very well is draw the viewer in with his story telling, creating a strong narrative and mood for the actors to shine. You almost can't help yourself and say \"don't go\", when Perhan leaves Perhan Jr. on the train to go after Ahmed. At this point he has his sister back and, from what he himself now also believes, his son. We know that he won't return, when his son urges him to stay. It's a tragic ending to a tragic life shown through powerful acting and magical filmmaking.",

To me It exemplifies the quintessential \"rags to riches\" story whose plot goes full circle, and ends with similar circumstances as the beginning of the film. The story also included many of the ups and downs that go with the roller coaster of life, that everybody experiences on a daily basis; but in Perhan's case the downs are much worse then what most people experience. Emotionally the film made me feel sorry for Perhan because he was an outcast among the outcasts. Since Perhan was an outsider among his own he always needed to prove himself more then most, and all the different downfalls that occur in Perhans life ultimately lead to his early death. Since most of the film Perhan is away from his hometown I got his sense of his home sickness for his grandmother, Azra, Danira, and all the things he was accustomed to. Eventually when he does make it back home you realize he has matured into someone completely different, and I felt sorry for his grandmother when she sees him for the first time since he left because she does not like the person Perhan has become.",

This is definitely a film that plays with your visual imagination, very culturally rich and captivating scenes, the music in this movie seems to sync perfectly and add that magical element to it, and at times seem almost hypnotic, especially during a wedding scene on a river in the first part of the movie, as well as a scene where there is levitation during a birth sequence. I am extremely disappointed this film is very difficult to find, and more so that I have not even heard about it, until very recently. To me it is one of the few films, that is very hard to categorize into one genre, as it touched the whole gamut of genres from comedy to drama to romance.

Something that was very interesting for me was seeing the culture and life of gypsies. I love movies from a characters view and a story where a man really goes through hell and back. It had a lot of good laughs and a lot of deep scenes. Like i said its not your conventional movie, if you lucky enough to find it i think it is definitely worth that 2 dollars at your local goodwill VHS section. In all seriousness now, this movie brings realization to a culture that seems overlooked completely and a culture where you think of things like poor and homeless and shows the heritage of a great culture. Really opened my eyes and made me realize kinda to get closer to my family. Keep your love ones close kinda deal. As much as this movie is \"heart-breaking\" is equal to how much it is \"heart-warming\".",

            "content": "Time of the Gypsies, was a great movie because it dealt with several questions such as , their traditions,laws,discrimination,culture and poverty. First of all, their traditions,laws,culture,discrimination and poverty goes hand in hand. Gypsies has always been outcasts in many country's and without any support and help from governments mostly in Eastern Europe, has lead them to built their own community and deal with their own problems instead turning to governments officials for help. This movie deals with those problems and brings forward the different problems they have to endure everyday. Those different issues are a result of discrimination and them not trusting outsider. That has put their communities for the most time, in the hands of corrupt people who takes advantage of people in their community whom are suffering because of financial and other social difficulties to their own benefit. Time of the Gypsies, is in my opinion a great movie because of its great combination of using comedy,tragedy,love,violence and loyalty, and not just focusing on one part. The movie instead, shows all component that all humans experience everyday, and that they also like other use have good and bad in their society and that all of them are not criminal as they are portrayed to be, but instead they are like most other community.Great Movie !!",

I watched this movie in my Foreign Cinema class and was hooked from the very start when the little Romani boy Perhan had a pet turkey as a best friend. This movie is not a feel good movie, but it sure makes me more aware of everything I have in life and how accessible and convenient everything is to me in the USA.Emir Kusturica does an excellent job portraying the surreal lifestyles of young Yugoslavian children, in this case Perhan, struggling to properly emerge into adulthood. In the beginning of the movie he finds himself lost and on the edge in loss of all hope. Later, still confused, which he finds himself challenged with overwhelming responsibilities after he stumbling upon a sketchy opportunity to make money with Ahmed, such as building a home for his grandmother, caring for his little sister's injury, and most of all his ongoing controversial marriage with Azra.It seems so hard for me to grasp the flaws of Eastern European traditional lifestyles, where gypsies who are in essence still nomads, of heir own ethnics and values, their falsely believed myths, observances, ceremonies, and beliefs that mixes with the notion of European criminality. Overall, this movie was very enjoyable until the very end. It opened a new awareness of the undergoing surrealism in our criminal underworld.",

            "content": "Emir Kusturica provides an insiders perspective on Romanian gypsy life. A commonly persecuted and antagonized group of people are brought to life within this tragic dark comedy. While the film proves to be a dark realist film of disillusionment and unfulfilled expectations it does incorporate a magical element. Kusturica incorporates these elements in an off hand almost natural tone. I believe this does a lot for the film because it allows for an escape from the brutal realities of the gypsy life. The protagonist, Perhan, is continually used, mislead, and trampled upon. Through all this antagonism he proves resilient, consistently hopeful, and at times selfless. By no means is Perhan your typical \"good guy archetype\" but rather one attempting to survive in a very real cinematic world. Kusturica leaves the audience to answer many ambiguous questions at the end that allow for self meditation and unique conclusions. The director's ethnicity, Bosnian Muslim, allowed him to make the film in Romany, a rare language, which I also respect highly. As far as the title is concerned I am a strong supporter of its intended title, \"A Time for a Hanging,\" as it proves to be more appropriate (both in the actors real life and the films implications).",

It know only depicts the daily life of a specific culture but tells us how life can change due to one simple decision. In this case, Perhan, the good boy turns into a bad boy. It is easy to categorize the good and the bad, but yet, what about the shades of gray? The scene of the train, where Perhan has finally found his sister and son but leaves them, shows how one, as soon has something we have been looking for, are not satisfied. Even though, we are not gypsies or have gone through what Perhan has gone through, we are able to mirror ourselves in him. The film gives insight to the fact of a cycle. The movie doesn't really end, rather pauses and foreshadows a similar story. In today's society, crime, war, racism, betrayal...are things that don't end. The key is how we deal with them. Do we avoid them or confront them like Perhan with the risk of dying while trying?",

Then the part where his \"inner-pride\" or anger takes control and he leave the two things he worked the hardest for in the world just to lose it all to avenge his agony that his uncle put him through. That sounds like some wild decisions that some make just for revenge, they risk everything for that one moment of revenge.",

            "content": "\"The Time of the Gypsies\", directed by Emir Kusturica, is a film that humanizes the gypsies and rationalizes the common stereotypes. The story unravels as a young Romani man (Perhan) who has telekinetic powers, engages in a petty crime with major consequences. Perhan lives with his grandmother (Khaditza), sister (Danira), and uncle (Merdzan). After a card game is lost, Perhan's grandmother is summoned to use her powers and save Ahmed's (gypsy sheik) sick son, Roberto. For repayment, Ahmed promises to pay for Perhan's sisters leg to be healed at a hospital in Ljubljana. After Ahmed gets double-crossed by his brother Sadam, Perhan gets appointed to the 'boss of operations'. In the meantime, Perhan's lust for Azra is a challenging development within itself, due to the fact Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovanian soldier who had an affair with Perhan's late mother. Amongst inclinations of a civil war, Azra's mother disallows the relationship but not for good. She becomes pregnant and soon after, marries Perhan but dies tragically during birth. After Ahmed doesn't live up to his promises, Perhan seeks revenge against him. This film evokes a sense of cultural identity that keeps you interested throughout. For me, on an emotional level, I connected with Perhan because of his ability to do good but still, can't refrain from being bad. More importantly, I have a clearer understanding of gypsy culture and there's more to it then I could've ever imagined. Overall, this film makes you think from a new perspective. Unlike the common Hollywood films of today, \"Time of the Gypsies\" has a pulse, it has something to say.",

The original title, \"Dom za vesanje\" which literally means \"Home for Hanging\", hints self- destructiveness in the film. At first, the film is introduced in a comical atmosphere. The protagonist, Perhan, is a young, honest Romany raised by his grandmother. He is now a grown-up but only thing he has is a kinetic power that enables him to move an empty can. His sister is sick, and his uncle just ate Perhan's turkey (the one and only thing that Perhan had, other than his kinetic power). Perhan falls in love with Azra but her mother refuses him; and he tries to hang himself. Then Perhan moves out to city with Ahmed to cure his sister, and there he is introduced to a world of crime. And the mood of the film begins to change.The second half of the film concentrates on corruption of Perhan's soul, his revenge and the self-destruction; and paradoxically the hope of redemption when Perhan undergoes all the above. Through magical realism, Kusturica successfully demonstrates ups and downs of a life. The border between real life and dream is blurred and the audiences are somewhat relieved from the tragedies by the dream-like real life sequences.Music is also a big element in this film. Each characters has somewhat like theme songs, and it is interesting that Perhan's is played by himself with an accordion in the film.Also, to show the ups and downs, the plot seems to have a cyclical structure. Choices that Perhan makes throughout the film sometimes ends in success and sometimes ends in tragedy. Either way, the characters, the plot, and also the mood end the same as they began.",

This Kusturica film has the viewer enticed throughout, by relating to anyone who's dreamed of achieving something great. The protagonist, Perhan, starts as a young boy and learns the good and the bad parts of growing up and having increased responsibilities for himself and for his family. He learns that the world isn't always what it seems and you have to adapt to the situations around you. Kusturica employs many elements of magical realism within the film, by having Perhan and his grandmother have special abilities, which are seen as rare, but normal within the film. Since Perhan and his family are gypsies, they make do with very little and find ways to survive. There are many occurrences in which Perhan is tasked with choosing between his family and opportunities to make money and the viewers find themselves asking what they would do if they found themselves in the same situation.This movie is directed wonderfully and gives a true and gritty look into the struggle one faces while trying to move up in the world and become successful. Kusturica also works to ensure its authenticity by having the film spoken in the native tongue of Romany. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a different take on the coming-of-age story.",

            "content": "Kusterica fuses together both real situations and bizarre ones to create magical realism. This movie takes us on a journey through the protagonist (Perhan's) life and ultimately gypsy culture. This movie depicts the madness of life and the ugliness that comes from adulthood. We watch young, innocent, honest, and good hearted Perhan evolve into a lying, stealing, heartless mafia boss. Although this is a very extreme case it does symbolize the loss of innocence that occurs with growing up. As we grow it's almost like we are programmed to learn how to lie, become numb to others and ultimately lose our \"black and whiteness\". As we grow, we start to become a shade of gray-- no longer do we wear our hearts on our sleeves. We say what we don't actually feel, we deceive, we become motivated by materialistic items and act out of self interest. Through this move, Kusterica brings so much value to the saying \"ignorance is bliss\". To me, this story has an underlying cyclical theme of fate-- we as human beings, cannot escape the process of growing up that hardens our adolescent light hearts. The only thing that I didn't particularly enjoy about this film was the loud noises that occurred through out the film, but I assume that being an American viewer I was just not used to this type of style.Overall, I love the message that I took from this movie. It truly is a beautifully bizarre take on a coming of age story. Kusterica is like Fellini with a dark side.",

There are so many wonderful elements regarding this film, but I will try to get to the main ones so as to not get too extensive. This film was my first experience with director Emir Kusturica, and I must say, I am a huge fan. The acting in this film is fantastic - better than anything I've seen in a while. Set in both Yugoslavia and Italy, \"Time of the Gypsies\" takes you into a magical reality, that, in turn, brings you to a harsh conclusion about the human form, and the cyclical nature in which humans tend to get stuck. The protagonist of the film, Perhan, played by Davor Dujmovi\u0107, brings you into the mind of a young man that is altogether enchanting and haunting. We approach him innocently through the beginning of the film, as he does us. Throughout the duration of the story, we become conflicted by the choices Perhan begins to make, taking us on a journey of growth, manipulation, understanding, chaos and betrayal. The magical realism that takes place in this film can be noted in multiple scenes, many of which leave you questioning both the film and yourself. You must use your own interpretation to receive what you want out of this story, which, in my opinion, is what makes a great movie. While fictional, the underlying truth that accompanies the choices Perhan comes to face, as well as those around him, all hone in on realities that many people are able to relate to. The cinematography and directing are nothing short of excellent, and I could not be happier about having the opportunity to have seen this film.",

This young man has the power to move things with his mind, a minor skill in opinion of his grandmother a woman who in turn is as extraordinary as her belief that is a common woman. Perham's universe goes beyond reality. Supernatural events coexist with daily life. Both worlds create magic, but this magic does not preserve Perham's innocence. Reality takes up his turkey which, of course, is much more than a simple bird. Reality forces him to abandon his sister, become a gangster and be extremely cruel with Azra, the love of his life. When she dies, he loses himself. After four years in shadows, he finds and saves his sister and his own son. It could be the conclusion of the story and a sign of a happy ending, but it is not. It is only the end of Perham, the end of an episode in the life and the beginning of other story. There is beauty in every aspect, the story, characters, the mood. The scene in the river (festival in honor to Saint George) is gorgeous.",

            "content": "I was fortune enough to watch this film, \"Dom za vesanje\" in my spring film class on International Film. The film is a beautiful depiction of broad humanism. It shows how each character has their own motivations to get ahead in life. By using broad humanism, it's showing each character is multiply faceted and is built with flaws like in real life. An example of this is Perhan's journey throughout the film and his ultimate demise due to his insistent need for revenge at any cost. Perhan's story was an unusual coming of age story intertwined with elements of magical realism. Magical realism was another important aspect in the film. It is understood in the film that Perhan has telekinetic abilities in which seem unimportant in the start of the film but are later tied in for the revenge scene against his former mentor, Ahmed. I thought the female relationships that Perhan carried were extremely influential throughout the film. He was close to his grandmother, who raised him due to his mother's dead during his childbirth. She was a maternal figure in his life who taught him right and wrong despite their economic status and lives as gypsies. His younger sister, Danira was his beacon of hope and his second chance to do the right thing and leave his grimy past behind. There is a point in the film when he is on the train, reunited with Danira and his son and he has the choice to leave on the train with them, but he chooses to get his revenge on Ahmed instead. It's a heart wrenching scene to see his young son begging Perhan to stay with them. You can get the sense that the son knows he won't see the father again. The most important relationship in the film is the relationship between Perhan and his girlfriend, Azra. She represented innocence and pure love throughout the film from the first time she is shown to her death. Overall, the film is a beautiful story about a young boy growing up and having to go against the various conflicts in his life.",

Perhan was an engaging character. I felt really drawn into his story, and his growth throughout the movie. I'm no movie expert but from start to finish this was one of the best movies I've seen. In the early stages of the movie I was somewhat skeptical about the subject matter and it didn't appear to be anything I would enjoy. Ahmed was my favorite character. Lying and cheating people seemed to come so easily to him. I really believed after he had his stroke that he mean't everything he said to Parhem. In hindsight I definitely gave Ahmed to much credit to think he could be a caring, giving character, considering how obvious Kusturica made it that Ahmen was a criminal and exploited all those around him. The only part of the plot I found strange was the fact Parhem's grandmother Khaditza, who seemed to be so knowledgeable and wise was willing to trust Ahmen with her loved ones. She had already scene how Ahmen took advantage of her son, and she just seemed a bit naive for how intelligent she was. Overall that didn't bring the Movie down very much and the magical gypsies aspects, and the portrayal of the economic struggles of the people in the movie made it a enjoyable watch for me.",

            "content": "\"Time of the Gypses\" is an excellent movie. It shows a true side to people because we all have good and bad aspects of our personality and that's what makes us human. No one is perfect and I love how this movie shows the flaws of people instead of trying to hide it. Perhan, the protagonist, starts out as an innocent and pure boy who ventures out in the world with unmoral guy, known as Ahmed, as his guide. Perhan also has telekinetic abilities so he can move things with his mind, which is an element of Magical Realism. Magical Realism shows a thin line between reality and fantasy and it plays a big part in this movie. Perhan may be telekinetic but in the beginning of this film he doesn't use his ability to do much but move spoons around. His ability does play an important role in the end because he uses it the end Ahmed's life thus potentially ending a cycle of violence and slavery.The idea of a cycle is very prominent in this film and recurs several times. The film opens with an unhappy bride beating her drunk husband after he ruined her wedding day and Perhan is killed at the end by a bride who claims that he ruined her wedding day by killing her new husband, Ahmed. I liked how Kusturica, the director, had Perhan killed by a nobody essential because it de-glamorizes his death. If Perhan had been killed by Ahmed, his death would be more \"Hollywood\". The cycle concept continues with Arza, Perhan's first love, dying in child birth just like Perhan's mother did. Kusturica shows the connection between the two by using the same image of a white veil floating through the air, which Danira, Perhan's little sister, sees when she gets a vision of her mother.Perhan's son also continues the cycle because although the audience sees perhan and his son make a genuine connection on the train, Perhan's son steals the gold coins left on Perhan's eyelids to pay the ferryman for safe passage into the afterlife thus striping Perhan of peace even in the afterlife.Perhan's flaws become more prominent as he becomes wealthier and he hits his all time low when he is appointed \"Boss\" for a day. He lies, cheats, steals his way to the top but karma bits him in the bum by washing all of his stolen riches away with a flood. Perhan does redeem himself in my eyes in the end. He kills Ahmed and his cruel band of brothers in a rather gory way but their deaths are satisfying. My hope is that because the brothers are no longer around, the people they enslaved can be free to make their own choices. However, the pessimistic side of me says that someone else will just come along and replace Ahmed and his brothers but I like to think that Perhan sacrifices himself for a more positive future. His son is away from Ahmed and his life style, although I expect he will turn out just like his father but at least Perhan was able to free Danira.Danira is a moral center of this movie, and along with the turkey, she tries to steer Perhan in the \"good\" direction. She is the one who sees a vision of his mother and is the one who has been looking out for Perhan's son for four years. Even though the film never really gives Danira's story an ending, I like to think her life turns out better than it was before.Azra's flaw is her unfaithfulness to Perhan while he is away. The film does not specify if the sex with Perhan's uncle is consensual but I'm inclined to think it was because Azra was probably lonely and the uncle was charming to other women so why not Azra? I think its important that Kusturica does not blatantly specify that Azra was raped by the uncle because if he had, then Azra could have been seen as an innocent, pure soul who was simply taken advantage of. Azra would have been put up on a pedestal and she would have became something more than human. But with her flaw of cheating, she is a human being who makes mistakes. Azra's betrayal is the deepest blow to Perhan because he did have her on a pedestal and she is no longer the pure woman he though she was but this is what also makes her real.This film is complex, thought provoking and I definitely recommend others see this movie.",

I began watching this film studying the relationship between Ahmed and Perhan; it began first with Perhan, so the audience was prone to feeling a closer, intimate relationship with Perhan. Regardless of his kind and charismatic personality, Ahmed's sinister and controlling nature proves true through and through. I appreciate the genre at what it is, a middle land somewhere between fantasy and surrealism. We find this apparent in the movie through variously detailed symbolism. My first notation of strong symbolism began through a pattern of \"white:\" white bricks, house, cheese, bread, and church. Also Azra's white skin is noted by her mother as Ahmed's suit is white and let us not forget the white bird. I think majority of humans think of 'moral purity' or innocence when asked what the color white symbolizes.

Watching this movie for the first time, my mindset changed completely when thinking of gypsies. That is not what I thought the theme was however; the theme to me was loss of innocence. Perhan, the protagonist of the movie, starts off as off as an innocent kid living with his grandma and sister as a \"good son.\" At the end, he becomes like the character Ahmed, who is known as the \"money king.\" When innocent Perhan meets Ahmed, things begin to change for Perhan. In a way, Perhan is on the way to becoming Ahmed, except nature seems to get in his way. Nature, however, doesn't completely stop Perhan from becoming a greedy smuggler. We later end up finding out that Ahmed tricked Perhan into working for him. Another important concept in this film is the power of revenge. After finding out what a hypocrite Ahmed is, Perhan wants nothing but revenge. Perhan gets his revenge, but in the process, he gets himself killed. This film teaches people not to grow greedy and stay true to your family and the ones you love. Money should not come in the way of things that are the most important to you.

A lot of times when films try to cram too much into the limiting time frame, it ends up a confusing mess that loses the viewers attention. \"Time of the Gypsies,\" however, weaves the plot points together in a careful and artistic manner. The humorous element that shows momentarily during different scenes makes it all the better. I felt that Kustarica used this strategy to lighten up the heavy material and keep the audience engaged but non-judgmental. I really respect his bravery in choosing such an overlooked culture that so many of us carry judgments about, without any basis for these assertions. By showing this almost secret way of life, Kustarica opens up the audience's understanding, and contributes to lessening the judgment of the unknown. Perhan's journey with his \"winged sunbird\" takes him to a place where the loving family support he was once used to is replaced with the harsh reality of life. This journey causes him to change drastically, making him into the person he wasn't meant to be. The symbolism, repetition, and cycles that persist throughout the film are what I enjoyed the most about it. The accordion he plays at both happy and devastating times, the portrayal of Azra as both trust and betrayal, the duplication of the starting conflict as the ending conflict, the cycle carried out by Perhan's son, and many other elements of the story are what turn this from a simplistic tale of love and revenge, to a complex cultural tragedy that leaves the final interpretations up to the viewer. I was not sure whether I felt sorry for or hated Perhan by the end of this film, and finally concluded that it's best to just see him as a human being, for we all make mistakes and change as we try to discover the path we wish to take in life. All in all, \"Time of the Gypsies\" is a clever film with a wonderful plot, and I really enjoyed watching it!",

            "content": "This 1988 film was well thought out and written beautifully. Time of the Gypsies was a power coming of age film. The main character was so innocent in the beginning of the movie and throughout the movie his morals are being put to the test with the life choices he has to make. The soundtrack, as well as the movie, is amazing. This film is unique in every aspect. It was an honest moving film that takes you on a journey of the streets and the struggles of the gypsy lifestyle. I felt how Slumdog Millionaire really ripped off this movie. I enjoyed the magical realism in this film and the cycles being show with the brides throughout.",

            "content": "This film, spoken in the Gypsy language known as Romani, is a marvelous depiction of a foreign coming of age story. Many different aspects of this film struck a chord with me, as the protagonist Perham is extremely relatable. Broad humanism is a prominent theme in this film, reminiscent of Renoir in that each character has his or own motivation for their actions. Perhan doesn't set out to end up as a murderer, hustler, robber but is forced to do so because of specific circumstances. Whatever his situation may be, we as the audience are able to sympathize with him because we understand what he ultimately wants to achieve and what goals he has set forth. Many roadblocks impair his quest for love and family, but there is a sense of hope that is never lost no matter how downtrodden his current situation may be. I thoroughly enjoyed this film as it gave not only American viewers a different perspective but viewers worldwide an eye-opening window into the lives of Gypsies and that they are people to. They too have their own wants and desires and do what they must in order to achieve them. This film opened my eyes to a new culture and a new perspective of seeing the world. It did so in showing Perhan's connections with his loved ones and enemies, relationships that all humans encounter at some point in their lives. This film truly is a celebration of life, loss and the road to redemption as well as the steps that it takes to get there. It also leaves a bittersweet message at the end, of how our children are sculpted by their predecessors, and how we must try to be as decently human as possible in hope for a better world for generations to come. Another feature of this film that I truly enjoyed was the magical realism incorporated into many heavily important scenes. Without giving too much away, the wedding scene was dreamlike and euphoric, shot in a way that makes you question if and what is happening on screen. Another aspect that I would like to mention is the use of symbols in the film, for example the symbolic meaning that goes along with the color white, which has a connection to Perhan's deceased mother, as well as the turkey we come to love almost as much as Perhan does. I really enjoyed this film from its up and downs of happy times and bad. Although at times the use of magical realism makes it seem somewhat unrealistic, I believe that anyone who watches this film will be able to associate themselves or loved ones with a character in this film.",

Kuturica's 'Time of the Gypsies' is truly magical and contains cute humor. For some reason throughout the movie i was thinking of a 2011 remake with Christopher Mintz-Plasse. That would be hilarious! I was disappointed with the ending but I guess I'm just used to the \"Bruce Willis Endings.\" To me an important factor to this film is that it has magical realism. I thought it was very cool the things that Perhan could do, and although people thought they were useless powers we know how he put his skills to work with Ahmed. Nothing like I've ever seen, I love it!",

            "content": "I grew up with two Eastern Europe parents that came to North America during the 1950's. My father and grandparents were all born in Hungary and came as a refugees during the 1956 uprising. My mother, on the other hand, is Macedonian and from an area today in Northern Greece known as Kostoria.In 1989, one year after this film was released, I was 6 years old and traveled with my mother and sister to what was then called Skopje, Yugoslavia; today called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We traveled to Macedonia to meet family that still resides there and of all the things that I remember from this trip, nothing stays in me more than the distribution of food. Since there were no shops in Yugoslavia at the time, if we wanted bread, eggs, milk or anything else we had to wait in line and have the government give it to us. Yugoslavia was of course still under Communist rule, though not for much longer. I remember going down to the food distribution center with my sister, learning the Macedonian words for the food we wanted and told by a cousin that we probably wont get everything we want. Needless to say, once I returned home, going to a supermarket was quite a thrill.Watching Time of the Gypsies brought me back to the summer of 1989, especially seeing first hand how the Yugoslavians treated the Gypsy people. In Macedonia, ethnic Albanians, Turks and Gypsies are heavily discriminated against. In the Macedonian language Gypsies, who are most Turkish Muslims, are known as \"sheeptari\", which is a derogatory term that means invader. This is not unlike most Europe countries that heavily discriminate ethnic minorities whether they are Gypsies, Muslims, Jews, Russians, Germans, Hungarians, Arabs and so many others. Having lived in Europe for three years, I saw all this first hand.Time of the Gypsies is a beautiful film about the struggles of ethnic minorities in third world Europe. It also is about being able to leave that life and end up becoming dishonest, then having the need to come back to the simpler ways of traditional life. Overall, Bosnian director Emir Kusturica creates a wonderful look into the ethnic struggles of his own people.In spite of this film being so great, it forced me to look past Kusturica's pro-Serbian allegiance during the Bosnian war and his work with Milosovic during that time, which was a hard thing for me to do.",

Time of the Gypsies showed a life that we are already aware of but nevertheless, it remained engaging as it was very entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time. The drama and humor were intertwined beautifully, a balance needed to keep the story heartfelt and enjoyable. The magical traits like telekinesis and levitation were incorporated naturally, providing magical realism elements without trying too hard.Although Pehran did not live to see and enjoy his victory, he knew he was triumphant on his personal mission. I also noticed that the women in this story, Pehran's grandmother, Azra and Danira, had the most humanity in them. They all went through hell, abused by the men in their lives,yet they remained resilient and kept themselves together to the end. Even though the ambiguous ending left me a bit frustrated, I knew it was necessary to make me not forget it, as well as to continue talking about it.",

            "content": "In the \"Time of the Gypsies\", Emir Kusturica shares with us the mistake in which a young teenager does by choosing money and a \"job\" over his family. Perhan begins having a healthy relationship with his younger sister, Danira, as well with his grandmother. The three of them have telekinetic powers. His sister's leg becomes ill and is in need for surgery. However, the family does not have money to afford it. He falls in love with a girl, Azra, and she becomes pregnant. Perhan finds a young man to make business with and his name is Ahmed. Ahmed is known to save people from poverty and is treated like a \"celebrity\" or praised like one. Money is necessary to survive for food and shelter, but it sure can corrupt a person's mind if they allow it to be the only important source in life. In this case, Pehran is convinced that Ahmed will have a house be built for him and for his family. The type of business Ahmed is into is human trafficking. Perhan is a little uncertain and troubled by it at first, but gives into the business.When Perhand hears about Azra being pregnant, he denies it and says it isn't his. Throughout the film I feel as if Perhan loses himself into having so much money and forgets about his family. He becomes less friendly, moody and always wanting to \"work\". I believe that money and having that title of being part of a job \"industry\" is what he mainly focuses on. Perhan has his family, but he yearns and cares just for money in an ineffective manner. But when he finds out that his sister is used for trafficking, that is what hits him. He roams everywhere to find his little sister and I think she is his salvation. He goes through so much that he forgets Azra, grandmother but he finally comes to his senses when he finds his sister. He then experiences Azra dying but her child remains alive. A part of me tells me that a person has to go through so much corruption in order to come back into being their own self. His life journey is a struggle and it eventually becomes a part of him but that is why it is very important to have family around to support one another both financially and emotionally. The key to family is having each other and whether they have money or not, it shouldn't let it interfere with values, beliefs, morals or the basic meaning of humanity. This film is a great way to send out a message that money doesn't buy happiness.",

He's innocent and full of dreams. But once he leaves his little town, he become corrupt and the exact opposite of what he used to be. It really makes you think about how of the grandmother had never let him leave with his sister then this would never happen. The movie has a lot of mood changes. It changes from being comedic to being serious and emotional. It also has a lot of magical realism, like when the Perhan and Danira's mother is seen floating above the car, even thought she's dead. This film also made me realize how kids are being used as beggars and how far people would go for some money.I also think that the women in this movie are very important. The women in Perhans life are like moral compasses. They seem to be the good ones who try to guide Perhan in the right direction.",

He undergoes a 360 degree change in his personality, ending up essentially where he started. This is again characteristic of the \"cycle\" that the Gypsy lifestyle seems to possess. The movie also jumps between moods very rapidly. 1 moment you are laughing and the next you are almost disgusted with sadness. Optimism turns to despair. Hope seems to vanish completely. All of this combined with a dynamic main character keeps you fully engaged in the movie, attempting (and usually failing) to guess what is going to happen next.",

            "content": "The \"Time Of the Gypsies\" a movie to which you can only truly admire from point A to Point B, meaning that you must pay attention to the transition that falls into place with actor Davor Dujmovic (Perhan). The film touches upon elements of love, passion, hate, mishap, misguides in directionality. The director Emir Kusturice did a great job using all aspects of the environment from where the film was shot in; many natural elements were introduced in the film; such as, the acting that took place in the rain, and the use of the wind to introduce the mother of Perhan and his sister. These Natural elements gave the film a higher intensity of realism to the film; therefore, making the viewer connect to the story in a more naturalistic sense. A good use of Magical realism is touched upon in the film giving it a unique aspect of supernatural activity that helped the film take hold of the viewers from the very beginning and also helping it tie together many pieces of the storyline. A pet turkey obeying orders from his owner in this case Perhan; never had I seen anything like it presented itself very nicely; it created a connection of friendship between both Perhan and his pet turkey. I recommend this movie to those whom enjoy watching foreign attributes of life in general, this type of film helps people understand and take hold of this idea that we are all the same, and no matter how different our norms can be; life presents itself to us with the power to create our own destiny.

It really kept me on my toes, because there was always sparks of spontaneity in the film,which made it unpredictable. What really fascinated me was the stages of evolution of the character Perham from being a down to earth , not so wise individual, into a man that nearly resembled Al Pacino in Godfather and Scarface. Considering the many dilemmas Perham had to face, one thing that really affected me emotionally was the fact that he had left his sister at the hospital after he had promised her that he would leave. It really goes to show that money and greed was his top priority. Even though at the end of the movie the Perham and his sister reconnect, I believe Perham was a bit too passive and calm about losing his sister.",

Their love became a suffer for him. It \"brought him to earth\",when he realized he was faked, but it was too late! He regretted and \"washed God's legs\", but he made another mistake, he revenged! The opening sentence and Merdzan's prey at the end are circling the whole film! This film didn't have to be about Gypsies, but them, as people without ambitions,with clear soul, were the best for it!
