            "content": "This is it, folks: the worst movie ever made.I know, I know, there are many who argue that \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" are worse \"films\" than this one. Well, I'd advise those people to give \"Troll 2\" another viewing, this time with an open mind. As something of a self-made authority on the worst of the worst in modern cinematic torture, I feel qualified to make the bold assertion that \"Troll 2\" is the cream of that particular crop.From its laugh-inducing soundtrack (apparently recorded using only a vintage 1980s Casio keyboard) to its unilaterally awful acting, \"Troll 2\" is a life-changing experience, similar to the Middle Ages' trials by fire. If you succeed at ingesting this festering piece of cinematic detritus in one sitting, you will emerge a new person, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The watching itself may be painful, but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say, with conviction, \"I survived 'Troll 2,' and I'm still technically alive.\"The special effects in this movie are, indeed, special -- like a one-legged blind woman with Alzheimer's. Trivia: one of the various Emmanuelles from the infamous \"Emmanuelle\" series of soft-core porno movies designed this movie's pitiful costumes. That should give you some indication of their quality.The acting -- my God, where do I start? Suffice it to say that, if you set any cast member on fire, I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt. They're really that bad. More trivia: One of Elliot's \"boys\" in this movie would later go on to reprise his role (Disposable Character in Bad Movie) in the Lou Diamond Phillips classic \"Bats.\" Even more trivia: The father in this movie was a local dentist, and most of the extras were bona fide Utah residents, as well. Talk about low-budget.Back to the soundtrack -- There's not a single scene in the movie where the music is appropriate to the on-screen action. I get the impression that the \"composer\" employed for this stinker was, in fact, a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's still-vacant keytarist position. Seriously, it's rare, even in straight-to-video dogs like this one, to hear music of this woeful caliber.What more can I say that hasn't already been set forth in previous reviews? This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that's saying something. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to watch this film -- I recommend doing it alone, at least the first time you see it...that way, you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness -- and on feeling your brain cells die off, one by one, until you are no longer able to speak.Good luck to you, if you decide to watch this one. It doesn't get any worse than \"Troll 2.\"ADDENDUM (October 2007): This is still the worst movie of all time. Its status as such will never change. \"Troll 2\" is simply the perfect storm of bad writing, casting, direction, cinematography, costuming, score, makeup, effects, acting, editing, and inspiration.UPDATE (June 2010): I just watched it again. Alone. In one sitting. God help me, some component of my brain must be fundamentally defective.POSTSCRIPT (September 2013): This film continues to alter the life of each man, woman, and child with the good fortune/taste to bathe in its glory. I could not recommend it more strongly.CODA (February 2021): This magnum opus infests my soul still. Daily, I am haunted by its indelible essence. I will never escape.",

            "content": "This here is a treasure for bad movie buffs like myself. Absolutely unbelievable.Perhaps my favorite scene is when the family is greeted by complete strangers holding a welcome party in the FAMILY's house. Well... their temporary house that they, uh... well, you'd have to see the movie. Anyways, they are in the house and some old lady is playing country music on the piano. Everyone goes \"La la laaa la la la la la la laaaa\" and there is this fantastic breathtaking shot of a person carrying a cake towards the family. Well maybe my real favorite scene is where little Joshua is snooping during a town meeting. They are all discussing the evils of meat, sausages, and clusters of hemorrhoids.I have never seen a more delightful piece of absolute trash in my entire life. Everything here couldn't be more laugh inducing. It's made on such a technically inept level it's unimaginable. Some of the most memorable (not in a good way) lines of dialog are presented here:\"Joshua is not a little s***, he's just very sensitive.\" \"If my father discovers you here, he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.\"For a film that's titled \"Troll 2\" didn't it seem kind of strange that there were goblins and no trolls in the film? And don't let this fool you into thinking the original Troll film is terrible. It hasn't anything to do with that film.Yes, my friends, if you want bad film-making, look no farther!\"Eggs! BLEH!\"",

            "content": "Exactly what is that makes Troll 2 so bad? Could it be the atrocious acting? The cringeworthy dialogue? The costumes that look as though they came from the Halloween section at K-Mart? The bizarre yet unintentional homosexual subtext? The unexplained disappearance of certain characters? The fact that the monsters who terrorize the heroes in this movie are referred to as goblins not trolls? I could go on and on...I never saw the first Troll movie, but I'm told that you don't need to see it as the two films are connected in name only. Troll 2 is a rather simple story about the suburban Waits family who decide to exchange houses with a farm family in the town of Nilbog (I'm sure everyone knows the genius behind this name by now). How or why they made such an arrangement is, of course, not explained, as are many other things to come later this film. This also coincides with the youngest son, Joshua's, late-night talks with his deceased Grandpa, who tells him stories about goblins that seek to turn humans into plants and eat them. Once they arrive in Nilbog, Grandpa Seth continuously warns Joshua that the town is inhabited by those very same goblins and he must stop his family from eating anything the Nilbogians offer them. Yes, this really is the plot.Troll 2 was made by Italians with a limited knowledge of English. And it shows with every line of nonsense the characters spout. According to Italian logic, a kick to the groin can make you homosexual, it's healthy to completely forget about your loved ones once they pass on, ghosts can suffer from a bad sense of direction, tightening your belt can ease starvation, and the only song most people know or like is \"Row Row Row Your Boat.\" Also, corn is apparently an aphrodisiac. I won't go in to the ridiculousness of the actual quotes; you can see most of them on this page.The nonsensical dialogue is naturally accompanied by nonsensical behavior. A man running from the goblins (culminating in the legendary \"They're eating her and then they're gonna eat me\" scene) seeks refuge in the creepiest house he can find. Joshua stops his family from eating poisoned food by peeing on it and throwing Molotov cocktails at them. Teenage boys have no qualms about sleeping together half-naked. The citizens of Nilbog don't even try not to act suspicious yet no one ever questions their motives. Everyone is perfectly willing to consume spoiled milk and food covered in green slime without a second thought. The characters were so unbelievably stupid and blind that I often wondered why Joshua didn't just throw in the towel and let the Nilbogians eat his idiot family.Well, you have bad dialogue and behavior that defies explanation. What's the next logical step? Get bad actors, of course! The actors in this film have admitted to how inexperienced they were and once again, it shows. The standouts in bad acting would have to be Mama Waits and sister Holly. The mother's bug-eyed expressions and flat line delivery makes her seem cold and distant and the actress portraying Holly wouldn't have gotten a part in one of my high school plays. On the other end of the spectrum you have the preacher, the shop owner, and of course, the deliciously hammy Creedence. These three, while by no means good actors, at least appear to be putting some effort into their performances. Creedence nearly steals every scene she's in, not that that's a difficult accomplishment. I wonder if she had fun making this movie because it sure looks like it.I could go on about more of the negatives of this film: the cheap goblin costumes, the bargain basement special effects (the recycled lightning bolt being the most glaring one), the cheap and out-of-place music score, the ridiculous plot developments (the goblins are repelled by a bologna sandwich, Grandpa Seth does more dead than most people do alive, the contradictory twist ending), but it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. That and I only have 1000 words.Overall, Troll 2 is one of the funnest, most inept horror films you'll ever see; so much so, that I'm sure somewhere the spirit of Ed Wood is looking down upon it and smiling. Maybe he can freeze time like Grandpa Seth so we can appreciate it that much longer.",

            "content": "You often hear of movies that are so bad that they're good. It's hard to point to a single movie that is like this though. What some may say is \"so good it's bad\" may come off to others as just plain bad. However, everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed: Troll 2 is so horribly, shamelessly bad, that it is good.The writing for film is more than awkward (take the redundant \"Stonehenge Magic Stone\"), and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots. The reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it, Claudio Fragasso, is a native speaker of Italian. He wrote the script in English when English was (barely) his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible, but who can blame them? This was most likely the first (and last) film any of these actors have been in.The costumes and special effects have that wonderful B-movie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors, I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be \"frozen,\" or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed, the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up, and had the actors give their best guess on where they're supposed to be.I think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious, especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous, but at least you never know what's going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary, and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh. The only question I find myself asking now is do I give it a \"1\" because it was so bad, or a \"10\" because it was so good?",

            "content": "I collect crappy horror films, particularly the \"creature flicks\" and I have to confess that Troll 2 is my run-away all-time favorite. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities, none. Had the acting, story, effects, dialogue, any one of those not been as awful as they are in this film then Troll 2 simply would not be the same. It would have been forgotten long ago and not held as the utter piece of crap that it is. First, there is absolutely no connect with the first Troll movie. This is probably a good thing since the first movie wasn't even funny in an awful way, just horribly lame. There is not a single troll in Troll 2 anyway, since they're all \"goblins.\" The premise entails a family (Mom, Dad, Joshua, Holly) in some sort of \"exchange program\" which puts them in a town called Nilbog (get it?). It turns out that the town is really goblins who try to feed humans neon green slop that turns them into part-vegetables. The goblins then eat them. The family is evidently comfortable eating food like corn-on-the-cob with neon green stuff on top and cakes with \"eat up\" written in green \"icing,\" except for Joshua who suspects trouble by virtue of the fact that the boy is in communion with his dead grandfather, a man who conveniently knows all about the goblins and how to conquer them. As if this premise weren't enough, the acting is horrible. Holly has a boyfriend who comes along and drags three of his own friends who each suffer a gruesome fate (turned into a tree, drowned in popcorn, etc). These dorks couldn't score with Nilbog girls if they paid them, but since there's a weird homo erotic feel to their interactions, it probably wouldn't come to that. Holly's BAD at delivering her lines - it reminds me of second grade and how we'd read the parts of a play out loud in class. It sounds prepackaged and faked, like reading off a teleprompter. The Mom is equally awful and has really strange bug eyes. You half expect her to turn into a goblin. Apparently \"row, row, row your boat\" is her favorite song and she makes her family sing it. Joshua looks like he's in constant pain and every whine of his makes you grit your teeth and beg for a chainsaw (Creedence has one!). Although far from being good, the Dad here delivers the best performance, but maybe that's because he reminded me of Craig T. Nelson, who can actually act. As far as costumes, they went crazy with the green dye. It's everywhere. There are only three goblin mask molds that they use on different midget or kid actors so that the goblins look inbred. There's a closeup where we see a goblin's mouth and the fakeness of the mask is revealed. The music is a keyboard synthesizer. The strangest thing about this movie may be the continual string of non-sequiturs. We see \"Nilbog milk\" but we never find out why it's there or what it's supposed to do (It presumably doesn't aid in the vegetable-morph process). We never learn about grandpa's powers, why he's unable to stop the family from eating bad food yet is able to hack a goblin with an axe through a mirror later and produce a Molotov cocktail to hurl at the Nilbog preacher. Why turn Arnold into a tree? Who was that girl randomly running through the forest and why doesn't Arnold seem surprised to see goblins? Just who is Creedence and what does her family being \"from Stonehenge\" have to do with anything? How does \"the power of goodness\" vanquish the goblins? I have to conclude that there's a satirical undercurrent to this film because it's just that random. This film is obviously a local product from somewhere in Utah. It changes your perception of that state. According to the cover, this movie is just over an hour and a half but I swear it feels like a three hour movie. I recommend watching Troll 2 if you like funny bad movies, but it's best watched with friends and intoxicating substances. \"They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawd!\"",

I don't have the energy to dissect the film scene by scene nor would anyone want that, but I actually did enjoy certain aspects of the film, what I enjoyed was its 'campy' improvised feel, and how it always manages to avoid clich\u00e9, and that even in the most unconventional ways. The film has the creators stamp all over it and when he encounters a snag or hiccup in the plot, be damned to those who disagree with how one should deal it, he plows through it and comes up with his own completely unique solution no matter how illogical it may be. This is film this is make believe, I don't care if it makes sense it is actually refreshing to see a little bit of 'weird' now and then. That is not to say that I wholly enjoyed the film, I found it to drag on and several times let myself be distracted by other things while the film played, it is no great film even in its badness, it is bad for sure, but there were more than a few entertaining moments. For instance, Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls, it is a movie about goblins, but hey whatever just a technicality eh? lololol.",

I vaguely remember an opening scene where a man is being fed food by a girl, and he turns into a tree or dies or something, and immediately, I thought, \"What the hell is this crap?\". The movie progresses at an equally bad rate: A family comes to a town called Nilbog, and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin, which makes no sense, because the title of the movie is, I believe, TROLL 2, not Goblin 2. Of course, the lead character, a small boy, happens to glance into a rear view mirror on his parents car, and see's that Nilbog backwards spells Goblin. Only one problem: Nilbog reflected in a rear view mirror spells qodliN, not gobliN. WHOOPS! Then there's this stupid chase scene through a forest, where Goblins keep on popping up from nowhere, and urging people to run towards them. Over all, this movie was pure junk. 1 star because I am in a good mood.",

The film opens with a man wearing a pointy hat being chased by what appears to be Yoda's inbred cousins. The pointy hat man falls and is revived by a girl with disturbing freckles. To be helpful, she offers him a bowl of green gunge. Naturally, pointy hat man drinks the green gunge without a second's thought. He then turns into a tree.This tragic story has been recounted by Grampa Seth to his irritating grandson, Joshua. It turns out Grampa Seth is a ghost who has extensive knowledge of goblins and their evil green food.Joshua and his cretinous family set off for a vacation as part of a house exchange with a family of retards who live in the town of Nilbog. Thoughtfully, the retard family have left a selection of hideous green cakes for them to eat. Unfortunately, Grampa Seth appears and hints to Joshua that having a waz on them might be a good idea.Close behind them, following in a camper van, is his sister's boyfriend and his boyfriends, I mean friends. One by one the boys encounter many terrible things. Dork #1 sees a terrified girl in the woods, to reassure her he chases her and jumps on top of her. He then meets a woman from Stone Henge, who sounds like she is from Transylvannia, who turns him into a plant. And puts him in a pot. Dork #2 meets a policeman called Sheriff Freak who drops him off in town in the middle of a group of men with moustaches. Dork #3 has a grisly encounter with popcorn.Meanwhile, the family are given a traditional Nilbog welcome by the town's residents - a great deal of clapping, chanting and more green cake. Troublemaker, Grampa Seth appears again and encourages Joshua to set fire to one of the party guests. Shortly after this the goblins appear and throw sandwiches at the house. The film soon comes to a dramatic conclusion.In many respects, this film is a disgrace. The acting is unforgettable - I am particularly surprised that the drugstore owner was not at least nominated for a best supporting Oscar. The dialogue is understated and poignant - especially where Holly punches her boyfriend in the gonads and he delivers the immortal line, 'Are you trying to turn me into a homo?'. And the music is the work of a genius of sorts, or at the very least a remedial level music student with a Casio keyboard.Nilbog....Nilbog.......",

Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles, which could well be true.

Troll 2 is so famous that I think it can't be considered a cult film any more as it's gone more mainstream. Again, how I never saw this film until last night I don't know. I've heard so much about these Troll movies that it's just crazy how a film so bad has such a huge reputation. The Room by Tommy Wiseau has recently taken over the \"king of good bad movies\" crown but I had to see who was the former king and Troll 2 often came up in the conversation. Now of course due to YouTube the most famous scene being the \"They're eating her and then they're going to eat me! Oh, my Goooooood!\" has been uploaded too many times to count. But this film is so much more than that: horrifically bad acting, awful special effects, a weird \"plot\", bad writing and just craziness ensues.Joshua Waits is being contacted by his dead Grandpa Seth. Seth informs Joshua of evil creatures known as goblins roaming the world who force or trick humans into consuming poisoned food which will turn them into the goblin's favorite type of food, vegetables. The goblins would then eat them.Meanwhile Joshua's sister, Holly, receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot. She accuses him of spending too much time with his friends. Since she and the rest of the family are going to Nilbog for a holiday, he offers to meet her on the way. She agrees but under the condition that he will come alone without his friends. However, Elliot does not turn up at their meeting point and Holly's parents, Michael and Diane, go on without him. They meet him further up the route but she angrily dismisses him since he is accompanied by his friends. A meal has been prepared at the house where they are staying, but Joshua's grandfather shows up again and freezes time for thirty seconds, giving Joshua a chance to stand up on the table and urinate on the food, and thus prevent his family from eating. Meanwhile one of Elliot's friends, Arnold, goes out for a walk and meets a woman being pursued by the goblins. Running away, they enter the house of the goblins' druid leader, Creedence, who uses the \"Stonehenge Magic Stone\" to give the goblins power. Creedence dupes the two into drinking a magic potion which causes the woman to disintegrate into a puddle of vegetable matter which is then eaten by the goblins, and now we know why everyone in the town is so eager to make the family eat their food, even though they're not so subtle about it.Between the \"you can't p*** on hospitality\" scene to the corn on the cob seduction scene, this movie is unbelievable. I don't know who was the worst actor in here but I'd say the leading contender is Deborah Reed who plays Creedence, the leader bad troll, I guess it was one of those \"non acting\" days. She was beyond over the top making you wonder what she was inhaling before each shoot. I love how the dead grandpa is talking to his young grandson, why wouldn't he just haunt one of the adults so maybe someone who doesn't sound like they have a wild imagination talk some sense into this family who is going to \"Nilborg\"\u0085 mmph! Sorry, I'm still recovering from this movie, why the family would take vacation to this weird town is beyond me and how they didn't drive away with those \"subtle\" trolls in disguise as humans who keep telling them to eat, I mean just\u0085 wow! Not to mention that they say they're vegetarian trolls, yet are turning human meat into vegetables, I mean, any vegan opinions? Bologna is their ultimate enemy and is by far the weirdest way to defeat an evil monster. I would say this movie is definitely a miracle, how it was created, who knows? Any of the actors or writers realize how bad this was while shooting it? I suppose I should see the documentary \"Best Worst Movie\" in order to find out, but the question is even if I want to see it? I still need to recover from Troll 2, all I can say is that after I finished watching this movie I finally snapped out of my mind set to see that I had been robbed and was sitting on the floor and the robber left a note saying how he felt bad for me that I was watching Troll 2 and that I would have no meaning for life any more after viewing it.1/10",

When the Waits family swaps house with a family from Nilbog in the countryside to spend vacation, everybody is excited but Joshua since Grandpa has warned him that the place is evil. Joshua travels to Nilbog with his father Michael (George Hardy), his mother and his sister Holly (Connie Young) that invites her boyfriend Elliott Cooper (Jason Wright) to meet her and he also travels with his three best friends to Nilbog. Joshua discovers that the Nilbog is goblin written backwards and the place is the kingdom of evil goblins that want to eat them. But his family does not believe in his words.\"Troll 2\" is one of the worst movies I have ever watched; but also one of the funniest. On 31 July 2003, I became curious with the reviews of this movie and I decided to check whether it could be so bad; actually it is worse. The horrible and ham actors and actresses and the amateurish direction, screenplay, dialogs, effects and make-up are lame. Today I have just watched it again and it was good to relax and laugh in a Monday evening. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): \"Troll 2\"",

            "content": "Everytime I walk out of a movie theater, no matter what movie I had just seen, I always think to myself, \"this was no troll 2...\"  No movie since has been made that has left such an impact on me as a serious film critic. Why is this movie so great?  Unlike 99% of movies out today, Troll 2 accomplishes something most movies don't even come close to and usually fail at, it's entertaining.This movie has no relation to the original Troll and that is a good thing. The reason it was named Troll 2 is a mystery much like how Tarantino's movie, Reservior Dogs, has everyone guessing why it was named as that. Unfortunately, the director, Joe D'Amato, has taken that secret to the grave with him.  The plot, every scene, every bit of dialouge, the acting, the costume and makeup, the music (especially the opening credits --classic), and every little detail of this movie captures your attention leaving you in awe from beginning to end.  The movie is about a family who decides to go on a vacation in the small town of Nilbog despite protest from Joshua, the young son and hero of the movie, who was warned from his deceased grandfather about cruel deformed forest dwellers who live in Nilbog.  As with most parents of the babyboomer generation, Joshua's pleads are not only ignored, but mocked and ridiculed.  The family, needless to say, goes on with the planned schedule and the adventure begins.One might criticize the casting of this movie.  I'd rather have \"regular people\" in this movie, (\"regular people\" meaning the demeaning term used by arrogant movie star celebrities which refer to us, the people who aren't movie star celebrities), as this cast in Troll 2 has more personality than any overpaid, silicone enhanced, plastic surgery addicted, tabliod covering, tanning salon using, church of scientologist following, teen movie drama appearing, \"actor\" out there.  Watching the cast is memorizing, especially how they react to the goblin threat.I could go on forever about this movie, I apologize for the rambling.  Go and see this movie, find it, rent it, you will be introduced to a whole new experience you probably have never have had.  Until Troll 1.5 or Troll 3, I'm going to defend Troll 2 as a true unique movie experience unlike anything else. Groundbreaking filmaking...Troll 2...Cue the goblin music!",

            "content": "I would like to begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking a hot fork and shoving it in your eye socket for some people, whereas for others it will be the funniest F'n thing you've ever seen.Before I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwich\u0085Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls (just goblins), Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for Troll 2 didn't see Troll 1 or Troll 2!!!! The original cover of Troll 2 has a werewolf (Not in Troll 1 or Troll 2) chasing a little boy who doesn't even appear in either of the Troll movies! If that doesn't make you want to take your head and smash it against concrete, I don't know what does.I will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis. The film begins with Grandpa Seth talking to his grandson Joshua. Joshua is constipated throughout the film and grandpa is dead. You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back\u0085that kind of dead. He tells that old story of how Peter Pan ran through the woods one day, ate green goup, and turned into a MLANT. The mother, played by Margo Prey (AKA greatest actress ever) assures Joshua that it was just a dream and goes onto explain that Grandpa's death was, \"Very difficult for your father, for Holly, and for me his daughter.\" You may want to give that quote a second reading\u0085 The daughter is also brilliant in this picture. The chemistry between her and her boyfriend Elliott is sizzling!!! Ouch very hot! So sizzling that Elliott and his friends couldn't be more gay! Holly explains, \"You take them to bed with you too (referring to Elliott's guy friends that are hanging out the window) and I don't believe in group sex\". What??? Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott (that he is a good for nothing) and that they are going on vacation for a month. Ellliott then asks, \"Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow?\" \"Yes!\" \"I'll come with you?\" \"OK I'll tell my father that you're coming with us tomorrow\" Believe me the movie keeps going\u0085Joshua must do it he must do it! He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it. Oh my god! Or how about \"You're a genius big Sister!\" Watch for the mother staring directly into the camera and yelling, \"Oh dear god what can we do!\" So they have this family exchange and they go to Nilbog and oh my god!This movie is a pure masterpiece. It's so bad it's fantastic! I recommend everyone to give it one viewing just so you can say you've survived it's stupidity. Make sure you watch it with friends though\u0085DO NOT watch this movie alone or you will lose your mind trying to figure out why anyone would make a movie this bad...I will leave you with this: Mother says \"Elliott what are you doing here?\" Daughter says \"Elliott is part of the family now!\" Mom puts her hand on Elliott's face, \"Oh Elliott!\"",

            "content": "An insightful warning into the dangers of organic farming. A character-focused drama packed with thrills and suspense. Good acting from a largely unknown cast. Excellent special effects produced on a low budget. An original, highly intelligent plot which doesn't underestimate the intelligence of the viewer. Strong and stylish photography. A fine score which compliments the on screen action. Plenty of chills and thrills and moments of genuine horror. Effective shock sequences and unexpected surprises at every corner. A crew of seasoned genre veterans working at their hardest. TROLL 2 contains absolutely none of these things, being as it is one of the genuinely worst movies ever made. Not to mention one of the worst sequels, as it has absolutely nothing to do with the first TROLL, which was an irritating kiddie fantasy which still manages to be miles better than this one in retrospect.The opening scene sees a man getting attacked by goblins in the woods and sweating chlorophyll as a result (!). It only goes downhill from here. You see, this is merely a fairy tale told to the youngster Joshua, by his dead grandfather. Gramps has been dead for six months or so but still hangs around to give his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 useful advice - kind of like a burly version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Joshua is played by the truly obnoxious Michael Stephenson, who makes previous contenders for the most-irritating-child-actor-ever awards like Giovanni Frezza seem mild in comparison.Sadly, the rest of Joshua's oh-so-awful family are just as bad. Firstly there's the brain-dead dad, played by Craig T. Nelson wannabe George Hardy. Wooden isn't the wood for Hardy's stolid portrayal of a tough family man. Similarly, Margo Prey's turn as the silly mother Diana is just as grating, and as for his sister, well the less said the better. One of the many low points of this movie is the sight of her dancing in a mirror. A witch is one of the main bad guys in the film, and the actress is definitely the worst I've ever seen.The \"plot\" - not that you can call it that - consists of various dumb teenagers being turned into plants and eaten by the goblins, which are actually dwarfs or child actors with unconvincing masks on. This happens repeatedly and once the initial surprise of seeing somebody bleed cheap green blood wears off, it quickly becomes tiring. There's so some silly conspiracy-type plot about townsfolk who are really goblins in disguise, and a finale which rips off NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD yet again by having the heroes surrounded in their home by the monsters. The script is so stupid that the kid only figures that Nilbog is \"goblin\" spelt backwards when he sees it reversed in a mirror. Or try the scene where he stops his family eating their greens by urinating on the table - a new low in cinema standards, although an admittedly amusing one.Other hallucinatory highlights include a couple making love to a corn-on-the-cob and getting swamped by popcorn (there is no explanation for this scene whatsoever), Joshua descending into a red-lit netherworld to find his grandfather's spirit, a storekeeper who gives out spoiled milk, a boy who becomes a pot plant, and a girl who drinks a potion and is turned into a gooey vegetable. The special effects are rubbish, even by no-budget standards, and I am astonished that this film got an '18' certificate in the UK - there's hardly any blood at all, just people becoming plants, which the BBFC surely couldn't have taken seriously? The film just ends with a whimper instead of a bang and you'll end up instantly forgetting the events of the previous ninety-five minutes. A protective psychological measure otherwise you'd probably go mad. Appalling stuff, although strangely amusing, this is a must-see for all bad movie fans as one of the very worst that there is.",

I gotta say this has to be the funniest and most cheesiest b-movie i've ever seen in my life as it has a major cult following since it debuted on video in 1992 and had popular HBO/Cinemax showings in the 90's, it has became this generation's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" in terms of a cult movie with a camp appeal and new kind of fanbase. I'm surprised Mystery Science Theater 3000 didn't riff this crappy in a good way sort of film for it would have been their most popular episode of all time, this movie has became a new cult sensation and even spawned a brilliant documentary called \"Best Worst Movie Ever\" which earned better reviews than this movie itself.

I've seen tons of films that I have enjoyed far less than Troll 2\u2014films with seemingly no redeeming qualities whatsoever, the celluloid equivalent of Ketamine; at least this one provides plenty of unintentional laughs and is so utterly bizarre in places that it kept me watching to the bitter end. Surely that's gotta be worth a rating of at least a 3/10?P.S.

I had only heard bad things about this movie (to avoid it, etc.) but i came across the Troll/Troll 2 DVD used at a local store, and i like the first movie, so i bought it. Now don't get me wrong, i love the first movie, but Troll 2..oh man..i had no idea what i was in for until i watched it. i mean WoW, this movie is so bad, so horrible, that i just couldn't help but cry from laughter just about every 5-10 minutes. From the acting (if it can even be called that) to the 'plot', to the costumes, *Everything* about this movie is so over-the-top horrid/ridiculous, that it makes this movie one of, if not the best comedy ever made. While Troll 1, of course, is the meat & potatoes of this DVD, Troll 2, unbelievably, is the true reason to buy this DVD. It is so compellingly entertaining, is HAS to be seen to believed. Troll 2 rivals every so-bad-it's-hilariously good/entertaining movie that i've ever seen. It beats Halloween III, Link, It's Pat, Cabin boy, The good son, Sleepwalkers, and C.H.U.D. just to name a few. Don't get me wrong, i mean that in a good way, as i love the above movies, it's just that i didn't think it could get any better than those movies--and then Troll 2 happened. This movie is easily the king of cheese, and i also mean that in a good way, because regardless if it was indeed unintentional or not to make such a hilarious movie, it succeeds at what almost every current Hollywood fails at--Troll 2 is actually entertaining. And in the end, that's ultimately what matters--is that a movie is entertaining and holds the viewers' interest for the entire duration. Troll 2 does just that and much more. And it's actually extremely successful as a comedy. (WARNING: Minor spoiler ahead) If Troll 2 doesn't make you laugh throughout, just wait until you see what the little kid ends up pulling out of a carry sack (given to him by his grandfather)towards the end of the movie to be used as a 'secret weapon' to defeat the goblins. That scene has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen in *any* movie. At that point, my eyes were so full of tears from laughing, that i couldn't concentrate on the movie and so i had to momentarily pause the movie and recollect myself. In closing, to every fan of cheesy cinema out there-believe me when i tell you, this movie is rich. You haven't seen anything until you've seen TROLL 2. It's hysterical. It should be in every fan's collection. Go out and buy it now before it goes out-of-print. You'll regret it later. This movie is so good and hysterically entertaining, that i can't help but give it a 10 out of 10 rating. Troll 2 is simply great. I could watch it again and again and not get tired of it. To the makers of this movie: You have made an excellent movie and i would love to see a multi-disc special edition DVD set for Troll 2! Do it for the fans!",

Nothing I have experienced has displayed the degree of perfection attained by the geniuses (yes geniuses and nothing less) behind Troll II.The story-line is gripping, believable, and damn scary.  The Waits family is on a month long vacation in the country town of Nilbog, as part of the family exchange program.  They leave the modern conveniences of their home to \"rough it\" in Nilbog's rural setting.  I'm on the edge of my seat already, but wait, there's more.  Young Joshua's deceased Grampa Seth comes back from the grave to warn the family of Nilbog's dangers.  The beautiful Holly Waites's boyfriend tags along with his blatantly homo-erotic chums. There's something strange about the curiously unrefrigerated \"Nilbog Milk.\" Oh, and did I forget to mention that the town is full of GOBLINS?!!!The acting in this film can be summed up in one word and one word only: superfine.  Every member of the Waites family was portrayed realistically and intriguingly.  The chemistry between Elliot and Holly was so intense that I would be surprised to hear that there was not something going on off camera.  The town matriarch has full command of the screen whenever she graces it with her presence.  One actor takes the cake, however.  Scene stealer Draco Floyd as the Store Owner is a sight to behold.  He truly takes this movie that extra step into masterpiece.  Watch for him.  He'll give you chills.The special effects are top of the line for 1992, and some of these techniques are still used today.  Watch for the spear throwing, the regeneration of Creedence's hand, Grampa Seth in the mirror, \"the shirt buttoning scene,\" the vegetable transformations, \"the popcorn scene,\" and of course, the goblin costumes.The underlying social commentary of Troll II was truly ahead of it's time. Homosexuality is dealt with on many different levels.  Elliot and his boys are obviously repressed closet homosexuals.  Their's is a constant struggle for acceptance into the Waites family.  The town of Nilbog is in fact run by a lesbian who lusts after Holly Waits and takes great pleasure in the demasculinization of Arnold.  Vegetarianism is approached more directly. The goblins turn their human victims into vegetables before devouring them. This says in no uncertain terms that everything you eat (plant or animal) was alive once, and killing is still killing.  Troll II takes a chilling look at organized religion in the sermon scene.  The Preacher (played by my father, I'm pretty sure of it) has his congregation in the palms of his hands and easily turns them against the lovable, freckled Joshua.  Power like that belongs in no one man's hands.On the whole, realism sells Troll II.  It's scary because  it COULD happen. Don't watch this one alone or at night, but DO watch it.  You won't forget it.",

            "content": "OK, this movie is bad. Like, really bad.Actually, it sets a standard for bad movies. My friend invited me over for a group screening of this film on a nice big projector screen. Probably one of the best moments of my life.I was side-split from the get-go. The movie opens up with a bunch of midgets wearing Halloween masks chasing some Paul Revere looking guy through the woods... to a song that sounds very similar to the theme song to Nickelodon's GUTS.After about 20 minutes in, I was taking tallies for well-delivered lines. By the end of the movie, I had no tallies on my list. Not a single one. There isn't a piece of good dialogue in this whole freakin movie. It's astonishing.I'd like to see a 'making of', especially after seeing the scene where the family battles the Goblins on their summer-vacation-home staircase. A \"goblin\" gets thrown down the stairs. Usually a movie with such a low budget will resort to using a dummy. Nope. Some midget (or a kid) got dressed up and thrown down a flight of stairs in full-costume. I've seen some nasty falls in my life... all I have to say is \"broken collar-bone?\" The \"Mom\" of the main character in this movie is by far my favorite character. She always had a surprised look on her face, which I thought at first was added for some sort of intensity for the role. I was wrong. I think she has adult ADHD or something. Though, I'm extremely grateful for all of the close-up full face shots we got of this monstrosity of a woman.The main character is a little boy. He looks like he could be Zach Ty Bryan's brother. He's by far the best actor in this whole movie. When it comes to screaming in terror and chewing on a bologna sandwich while looking straight into the camera, he's the best. \"CONCENTRATE!!!... CONCENTRATE HARDER!!!\" Another notable performance is this evil witch who's name is as obnoxious and unnecessary as her whole role in this film. This woman is cracked out to the max. She thinks she's some sort of horror-expression actor like Boris Karloff, making scary faces to the camera. What she achieves is something more like a substitute 5th grade teacher who got stuck working on Halloween (and decided to sniff rubber cement for 20 minutes straight before class started) The \"Goblins\" themselves are midgets in costumes. Or maybe kids. I hope they're midgets though, because these little guys get rocked pretty hard by the cast throughout the movie. Pushed down by a face-palm by the dad, thrown down the stairs like I mentioned earlier, getting beaten with a slab of wood, etc. I'm just worried, because this isn't the type of movie that I'd imagine took too many safety precautions on-set.By the way, I put \"Goblins\" in quotations because this movie's title is \"Troll 2\"... and there isn't any mention of \"trolls\" but \"Goblins\". That itself is a failure beyond anything I've ever seen in the B-movie industry.My friend noted that there was a lot of long shots of the witches apothecary... which consisted of a bunch of coffee mugs with dry ice in them. Dry ice, being the best special effect used in this whole movie. Actually, I take that back - green jello and green food coloring was used well.The soundtrack - which I mentioned earlier premieres with the GUTS theme song, cools down to some pretty eerie synth ballads after awhile. These haunting 8 bit MIDI airs easily explode into Yamaha keyboard music after the \"Demo\" button is pushed. Lots of synth brass, it reminded me of the \"Casino Zone\" music from the hit game Sonic the Hedgehog 2.All this aside, watching this movie with some of my best friends was one of the best experiences of my life. It's one of those movies that's so bad, you're gonna need a few alcoholic beverages to make it worthwhile. I was slightly inebriated during my viewing, and it added to the experience.Troll 2 is easily the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. Not the best, not the worst... the 7 stars I'm giving this movie is exclusively for it's FUN value. Go check it out if you can find it!!! Oh, and before I go...Things I've learned from this movie: Getting hit in the groin makes you homosexual.Making another notch in your belt and tightening it curbs hunger-pains.It's common for suburban white families to fast for 2-3 days for no reason at all.Hospitality is measured in how long a large group of people can stand around somebody and chant the same song over and over again.Teenage cool-dudes from the 80s-90s will go to extreme lengths to get some hot babes.Corn-on-the-cob is a fantastic sexual aid.",

It got that rating for a damn good reason. ***SOME SPOILERS IN THIS ONE, BUT THEY WON'T HURT THIS FILM*** The movie follows a family that, for no apparent reason, is just \"switching homes\" with some hicks in some podunk town called \"Nilbog\" for a vacation. If that concept isn't weird enough, don't worry, the movie will quickly outshine that wet spot. Well, the town is infested with--you guessed it--goblins. What's that? You guessed trolls? Ha ha, sorry sucker, this movie is titled wrong--probably just to throw you off!! In fact, as the horrible little boy in the movie suffers the line, \"Nil-bog isss Gob-lin... back-waa-ards!!\" you begin to realize this the movie has a wealth of increasing crappiness yet to vomit your way. The goblins are immensely laughable, if not downright pathetic--they're midgets (oh, I'm sorry, not-tall people) dressed in what appear to be fire-damaged carpet with masks apparently crafted by the artful hands of Helen Keller. One of them has eyes the size of golf balls--and they never blink! On top of it, the \"goblins\" are vegetarians, so of course, in order to eat the visiting humans (in case you haven't guessed, the whole town is goblin-infested, like in \"The Howling,\" but crappy), they--get ready--turn them into vegetables of some sort. The acting is gut-wrenchingly bad--the worst is the woman playing the Mom in the family, there is no atmosphere--it takes place under the terror of daylight, and well, there is but one entertaining thing in the whole movie: That classic scene where, haunted by the ghost of grandpa, the little boy pisses all over the family's dinner to prevent them from eating food that would vegetate them into Goblin-meal. No kidding. 1/10www.ResidentHazard.com",

A dead and creepy Grandpa Seth appears as a ghost and warns Joshua of the danger: Nilbog is populated by goblins, and it's up to Joshua to save his family.Disclaimer: the film is in no way connected to \"Troll\" and has absolutely no trolls in it. Also, the acting (with the odd exception of young Stephenson) is atrocious. The mom is the worst actress ever, but the others are not much better. The daughter, Holly, has a really bad dance routine.The director, Claudio Fragrasso, says the movie \"is a fairly unpretentious story for children, shot in four weeks and two days in Utah. It's a pretty amusing film, packed with funny jokes which ridicule horror films in general.\" I think that he gives himself too much credit, though, as the \"jokes\" are not obvious at all.Jim Harper says that although it is considered \"one of the worst films ever made\", it is \"reasonably well constructed\". However, \"the script is quite possibly the worst thing Fragrasso has ever put his name to, contradicting itself on numerous occasions\". Quite frankly, the documentary about the film, \"Best Worst Movie\", really sums it up. It's bad... but so bad it's good. That phrase has never been more true than with this film.I saw this movie sitting on a shelf at Wal-Mart on Blu-ray. I do not know why you would want it on Blu-Ray, but it's available if you do. Either way, no matter what format you choose to see it in (it's also a Netflix instant play), it's well worth if if you like bad movies.",

            "content": "Troll 2 starts as Michael (George Hardy) & Diana Waits (Margo Prey) along with their two children Joshua (Michael Stephenson) & Holly (Connie Young) prepare to go on vacation for a month out in the country in a small town called Nilbog which has a population of 26, hey I said it was small. Once there Joshua quickly realises that the town is full of Goblins since Nilbog is Goblin spelt backwards, he also discovers that the evil Goblins want to turn his family into vegetables & eat them because that's what Goblins eat. Can he save his family & stop the evil Goblins & their queen Creedence (Deborah Reed)?Originally shot under the title Goblins & re-title Troll 2 to cash in on the mildly successful Empire Pictures fantasy horror film Troll (1986) this Italian production was written & directed by Claudio Fragasso under the pseudonym of Drake Floyd & is a unique viewing experience if nothing else. Troll 2 is one of those films which you have to watch, mere word typed on my computer cannot possibly do it justice in how unrelentingly bad yet throughly entertaining it is at the same time. Troll 2 was made by an Italian crew in America with an American cast who apparently offered to make the dialogue sound more natural & actually make sense but the director told them to say it as he wrote it which is why the dialogue is simply hilarious, in an early scene Holly warns her boyfriend that if her father found him he'd 'cut your nuts off & eat them', OK so the cutting off of his nuts is a reasonable sounding threat but then eat them? It just sounds hilarious & the way it's delivered by the actor's add a lot as it's obvious they are uncomfortable with their lines but their being paid to say them so what can they do? The story is quite good in parts, I liked the idea of the Goblins (the word Troll is never mentioned during the film) turning people into vegetables so they can eat them but the ghostly Grandfather thing is awful & the way Joshua saves himself from the Goblins at the end is to start eating a Baloney sandwich in one of single greatest worst moments in cinematic history if that makes sense. I don't know what to say really, Troll 2 is a film that defies any logical explanation, I mean what on Earth was going on with the guy buried under a load of popcorn? It's an impossible film to recommend as it's generally considered by many to be the worst film ever made which is a notion I couldn't disagree more with, hell it's hilariously funny & entertaining so in that respect why is that a bad thing? Sure, it doesn't work on a dramatic level but who said every film ever made had to?Director Fragasso has taken a lot of stick for turning in a film this bad but again I have to disagree that it's the worst directed film ever because it's clearly not, I have seen (or should that be endured?) many films technically & conceptually worse than Troll 2 & that's a simple fact. It's not particularly scary & you should go into Troll 2 with your tongue in cheek. Again some say Troll 2 has the worst special effects ever & again I strongly disagree, I'm not saying the special effects in Troll 2 are good, far from it, but I can point to literally dozens of films which have inferior effects. The Goblins themselves look pretty cheap but their masks are sort of gross, with a bit more time & money they might have looked quite good & their costumes are just potato sacks. There's not much gore, there's a cut off hand & some people 'bleed' green blood but that's about it. A special mention goes to Deborah Reed as the Goblin queen, her performance has to be seen to be believed as it's school panto level, she rolls all of her R's & makes such exaggerated facial movements you can't take your eyes off her, oh & she's a dab hand with a chainsaw too...Made for a couple of hundred thousand dollars Troll 2 has weak production values, it looks cheap mainly because it is although I think it has a certain charm. Shot in a town called Porterville in Utah apparently. The acting is atrocious but extremely watchable in a really hammy way, having said that I can point to films with just as bad performances as this & they weren't trying to make stupid broken English dialogue written by an Italian with little grasp of the language sound plausible. George Hardy is now a successful dentist apparently.Troll 2 is an unbelievable film, it's a film words simply can't do justice. I can't recommend it but I have to say I'd rather watch this low budget laugh a minute horror flick again than something like the dire & drab Hide and Seek (2005) with Robert De Niro which I simply couldn't watch all of & turned it off after 20 minutes because it was so rubbish. Most people seem to hate Troll 2 but I'm not most people & I don't give a damned about anyone else's opinion, I liked it but not for the reasons the makers intended.",

People go to bed in the middle of the day, people drink sour milk and yet no meat is sold in that town, what's even more strange is that it's not on any map. (Although it was obviously filmed in Utah as I strangely recognized some of the landscape) However goblins run this town and try to convince humans to eat some type of sludge which turns people into plants and our family armed with baloney sandwiches (!) clear off to stop the goblins and destroy the Stonehenge they worship. Oh and the main lead is a boy who sees his dead grandfather. The Sixth Sense this obviously isn't, although I don't think you'll be harder pressed to find a much worse movie than this stinker. It's all horrendous, atrociously acted and full of awkward moments (Check out the homoeroticism between the boyfriend and his friends who sleep in the same bed without shirts!) and some of the worst special effects ever. Like Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2, Demolition High and R.O.T.O.R it takes the work of a true genius to make such a movie. It's impossible to make a movie like this on purpose and because this was done with serious intentions, I fully acknowledge it is as a true treasure of goofy cinema. I mean this is a movie that tries to ask us to accept a hero who uses a double decker baloney sandwich as a weapon. Or a twist ending that makes very little sense (on par with the rest of the movie) and cheap sets that define poverty row production. This has somehow become a cult classic and I must admit that if there is a Troll 2 convention near my area, I'll go. As it stands now, I worship this as one of the best comedies ever made.1/2* out of 4-(Awful)",

Plus Troll II is like 7 on the bottom 100 and I wanted to see how bad it really was.Unlike Troll I, which is funny, cute and entertaining, Troll II is total crap. The movie opens with a bad voice over telling a ridiculous story about Goblins. Goblins, mind you, not Trolls. No one really cares about any of it. The bad voice is that of Grandpa Seth, who is dead. He is pretty bad actor with a hilariously serious look constantly on his face. His expression makes up for his acting. He is telling the story in a Princess Bride fashion to Joshua, an ugly little boy who is the best actor in the movie and that is not saying much. Moving on. The rest of Joshua's family are HORRIBLE actors- the worst I've ever seen. The acting is so bad you'll want to jump into the movie and take over because you know you're Oscar worthy compared to them. Or you'll just wish they would die. There is some mention of a farmer exchange program the family is taking part in. Joshua's sister has a tiff with her undeniably gay boyfriend about his friends (aka lovers).The family goes to Nilbog. It's deserted. The family is stupid for even going there for whatever reason. Grandpa Seth warns Josh of goblins and the green slime that turns you into goblin chow. Joshua pees on slimy food because his family is blind and about to eat it. The rest of the movie just gets crappier and crappier. There is a hideous German Goblin woman... aww, I'm not even going to go into it. This movie is so utterly stupid it doesn't even deserve a plot synopsis.

            "content": "\"Troll 2\" has nothing to do with the original \"Troll\". In fact, this fake sequel should have been called \"Goblin\" as goblins are plotting on eating everyone. While this sort of story idea isn't exactly Oscar material, it could have worked as a drive-in type film. Unfortunately, despite a few decent ideas, the film was a pile of crap--and really, really bad crap to boot! The film begins with a little boy who has contact with his dead grandfather. Heck, this sort of thing made a ton of money when the movie \"The Sixth Sense\" came out in 1999. So, a basic element in TROLL 2 wasn't bad--but it was carried out by a group of untalented idiots. This dead guy keeps appearing to the kid--telling him that the family should NOT go on vacation and, once they do, he tells the boy NOT to let them eat any food--as it will turn them into slimy blobs or plants. It turns out that the goblins killing everyone has something to do with hating meat-eaters. So, I guess vegetarians had nothing to fear...and the goblins were probably members of PETA, though their tactics were a bit less extreme.Who wrote this dialog?! I assume, lemurs! Some examples of this Pulitzer Prize quality writing include: --As a mother talks to her son, she says \"...it was also very difficult for me, his daughter,...\". Who, in the middle of a sentence identifies themselves this way when talking to their own kid. It would be like saying to one of my daughters \"Let's you, my daughter, and me, your father, go to the store\"! --\"Who wants to eat you, little brother\". What sister refers to her brother that way?! --\"They're eating her...and then they are going to eat me\". Who is this guy talking to and do you normally give a play by play of what is going on in your life? Such expositions are common in this \"film\".It's also interesting to note that the actors(!?) often sounded like they were reading their lines and there was absolutely no spontaneity about them. Additionally, the emotional tone of much of what they said was flat. If you look at the IMDb trivia, it says that the Italian crew insisted that every line be repeated verbatim--and it sure sounds it. This wasn't acting, this was recitation! The only actor(?!) who deviated from this was the bug-eyed creepy lady with the bad teeth (Deborah Reed). Instead of simply reading her lines, she played it up to the hilt--overacting in a manner that is hard to equal. In fact, she seemed like an untalented member of a local theater group who was jumping at the chance for \"the big time\"! What an annoying performance! Luckily, at least so far, TROLL 2 is her only screen credit. And, if there is a loving God, then this will be the last time we need to see her! Overall, this film accomplishes a rarity for a bad film--there is just about nothing that is interesting or worth while about the movie. It's awful, but not one of the more entertaining bad films--it's just bad. And stupid. And lame. And dumb.By the way, a documentary homage to \"Trolls 2\" was just released. \"Best Worst Movie\" attempts to make the film look like campy fun (whereas it really was just BAD), though it is enjoyable to watch--far, far more than the original film!!",

This movie is so bad that after watching it you'll want to run out and rent Ghoulies to get the taste out of your mouth.The opening scene has trolls chasing someone through a misty field to the tune of 80's techno music and it only gets better after that.*********I'm ashamed to say this about such a stupid movie, but this review contains SPOILERS****************** The movie involves a family moving to a town named Nilbog (that's right it's goblin spelled backwards even though the movie is called Troll, not Goblin) and swapping houses with some hillbillies. When watching this movie it's best if you go into it prepared to not ask any questions. Why a family would move into another family's furnished, food-stocked house is better left unexplained. Also why a family would proceed to eat the other family's green icing covered dinner is also better just accepted as normal.The green icing on the food is a repetitive theme throughout the uhhh...film. It's apparently some sort of troll dna juice that turns the digester into a troll. Although that is never really explained. Another tool the clever goblins..err trolls have come up with is Nilbog milk which also turns the person who drinks it into a troll. If it's that easy, it seems like they could turn the entire world into trolls by mass producing Nilbog milk, but maybe that's not their intention. What the trolls get from turning other people into trolls is never explained like in so many monster takeover movies. The monsters/zombies/trolls/aliens always want to turn humans into their likeness and that's universally accepted, but why? What benefit do they get from making people like them? Anyways, I digress. The good news for the family is the young boy has an ally in the form of the ghost of his deceased grandfather. The old man has the ability to appear to the boy to provide convenient warnings regarding the trolls just because he hates them that much.One of the strangest scenes in the movie (there are a lot of them) is when the kid receives a vision from grandpa that he must pee on the green icing covered dinner his family is about to eat to keep them from becoming trolls. Luckily he does this right before his sister unknowingly is about to eat some tainted GREEN ICING COVERED CORN ON THE COB. That's not out of the ordinary at all right? Another wonderfully horrible scene is when two guys venture into the weird troll witch's lair and one of them is turned into a plant, which doesn't really seem to bother him too much.This movie is so horrible that every adult should be required by law to see it at least once. Newer DVD players are actually being coded to reject this movie upon reading it. Maybe next time a family will move to a town named Llort and the adventures will start all over again. Oh yeah, and maybe next time they'll throw in some gratuitous nudity to transition the scenes. The R rating the nudity would have provided would have actually been a public service because it would have kept impressionable children from watching this mess.",

            "content": "Every once in a while a special kind of bad movie appears that falls into the \"so-bad-it's-good\" subgenre of B-movies. There are plenty of B-movies that are entertaining due to the fact that their badness itself makes them interesting. The Godmonster of Indian Flats, The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed Up Zombies, Blood Feast and of course the immortal Plan 9 From Outer Space are all low budget disasters that are as fascinating as they are terrible.And it's not just low budget drive-in fare that fall into this category. Hollywood has produced more than its share of gargantuan exercises in laughable awfulness: Valley of the Dolls, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Michael Cimino's psychotic remake of The Desperate Hours, and even Richard Rush's unfortunate return to the director's chair, the bewildering Color of Night.All these movies have something special in common. They're not just bad; they're insane. They're the work of a demented genius whose grandiose ideas of how to make an entertaining movie got lost in translation and resulted in the glorious mess that now spills across the screen. And for many fans, the infamous Troll 2 falls into this category.Not me, however. No frigging way.Troll 2 is mind-numbing. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. I agree with that. Unlike the movies listed above, however, there is no joy to be found. Other than a few admittedly weird moments, Troll 2 is a movie completely devoid of entertainment value. The moronic dialog, juvenile acting, incoherent story, pedestrian direction, pathetic special effects and irritating music swallow up the few chuckle-worthy tidbits in a black hole of banality.I tried to watch Troll 2 first not knowing of its cult following. Having found the original Troll moderately entertaining, I figured the second one would be another amusing little schlock fest. Needless to say, I was aghast at how dreadful it was. I watched it to the end only out of pure morbid curiosity. When it was over, I popped it out of the VCR, returned it to the video store and made a mental note to never watch it again. Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Then I heard there was a Rocky Horror-like cult following that held festivals and attended theatrical screenings of the movie. I thought maybe I had missed something, so I went out and plopped down $10 for the double feature DVD of Troll and Troll 2. While Troll was the same oddball slice of cheese I recalled, watching Troll 2 again opened my eyes up to the true nature of the movie: it is even worse than I remembered. I recall finding it to be a terrible but harmless little movie that I had no interest in ever bothering with again.But watching it a second time I was shocked at how offensive the movie is. Not because of the subject matter or gore, but because of the filmmakers' obvious contempt for their audience. This is a movie that tries to cash in on the success of Gremlins (and its subsequent low budget rip-offs) without bothering to put any effort at all into making it the least bit interesting or entertaining. The undeniably bizarre feel to the movie is not intentional on the part of the filmmakers, but the result of a perfect storm of bad writing, acting, directing and special effects.There's none of the earnestness of Ed Wood, none of the enthusiasm of H.G. Lewis, none of the misplaced zeal of Ray Dennis Steckler that made their movies so entertaining; just the half-assed efforts of some lazy, inept hacks trying to make a quick buck.Troll 2 sucks.",

After the grandfather's death the boy learns that his father (George Hardy) is going to take the family to a small town known as Nilbog. Soon the ghost of the grandfather tries to warn Joshua that they are in trouble and heading into a town ran by goblins.TROLL 2 has no connection to the first film but apparently the title was used for a commercial reason. Whatever the reason is, TROLL 2 has become a huge cult favorite over the years and it also inspired a documentary called BEST WORST MOVIE. That documentary has made this film even more popular and it's easy to see why because there are some really awful moments here that are at least so bad that you can have a good time with them.So, what's so awful about this movie? I'd honestly put the majority of the blame on some of the performances, which are just downright awful. This \"family\" has to be one of the strangest families in the history of film and the performances don't help matters. This is especially true for Connie Young who plays the sister and is so over-the-top and all over the place that you can't help but laugh. The way too silly mother (Margo Prey) gets a huge number of laughs but so does the father played by Hardy. Not for a second do you believe this group is a real family.Other awful things here include the story itself, which is just downright silly (switching homes) and the dialogue is even worse. The film also contains some pretty silly monsters and special effects but these at least have some campy moments that add to the entertainment. I'm not exactly sure what the filmmakers were going for other than to try and make money. The plot makes very little sense and there's just not much going for this film outside of how bad it is.TROLL 2 isn't the worst movie ever made. To me, the \"worst movie ever made\" needs to be painful to watch. At least this film can give you some entertainment.",

Not what the filmmakers intended (if they had, they'd be wicked geniuses), but nonetheless fun and craziness.Having said that, hearing from members of the crew and cast involved makes you realize, that actual human beings were involved in the making of this. Most of them aware how bad this is. Which may have lead to a large fan base for this. Have you seen the movie \"The Room\" and subsequently the movie \"Disaster Artist\"? I reckon something similar is the case here. I would even argue that The roon is a touch worse than this, if you'd compare them.I will be watching the best worst movie documentary too at some point (with quarantine going on, sooner rather than later) and I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy it - I already have some favorite parts of this ... well \"favorite\"",

            "content": "Troll 2, like Halloween 3, is a sequel that has nothing in common with the original but the title. In this case, the title was apparently added to capitalize on the \"success\" of Troll V 1.0.While the original Troll is a surreal, twisted, good/bad sui generis quasi-masterwork of quirk, this one, which, again, bears no relation to the first film, is one of the most monumental train wrecks ever filmed.After a really baffling prologue involving a Peter Pan lookalike, a bowl of green goo and a girl whose freckles were dotted on with a Sharpie Marker, the story shifts to a family of four. They consist of an actor who resembles Sam Waterston; his wife, who seems a little crazy; his daughter, Holly, a garden-variety 80's-style bimbo; and his son Joshua, who has regular conversations with the ghost of his grandfather, the poor man's Wilford Brimley. Holly's apparently gay boyfriend and his ambiguously gay friends (whose first act in the movie is to admire Holly's curtains; later they sleep together, semi-naked) are also along for the ride.The movie doesn't waste any time diving right in to the ridiculous; the family goes on some kind of nonsensical \"vacation\" which consists of them exchanging houses (?!) with a family of complete strangers from the remote town of \"Nilbog\" (that, oddly enough, ain't \"Troll\" spelled backwards). If that premise isn't unbelievable enough for you, don't you worry, there's plenty more insanity to come, as the family eventually learns that the town is populated by goblins (not Trolls, mind you), who first feed people neon-colored cakes and cookies that somehow turn them in to vegetable matter, and then eat them. That's if they're lucky. Others less fortunate get turned into a tree, while their b***s get turned into a milkshake. Probably the best scene in the movie, by the way.A few choice moments:The family arrives at their exchange house to find a table full of the aforementioned garishly-colored cakes and pastries, which they don't hesitate to sit down to eat, not thinking for a minute, \"hey, this is f***** up\". Thanks to the longest 30 seconds in recorded history, Josh is able to rescue his family by relieving himself on the sweets! For his troubles, his ungrateful father chides him with the best line in the movie: \"You can't p*** on hospitality!\"One of Holly's BF's buds sees a frightened girl running in the woods. He does what any normal guy would do, he tackles her at a full run. He then takes her to a Satanic-looking church, where Creedence (yes, that's her name), played by a woman who seems to have just strayed in from a porn film or maybe the fringes of performance art, changes the girl into mush to be eaten, and the guy into a tree, also to be eaten. We know this, because the guy helpfully tells us: \"They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!\"Joshua's Grandpa tells Joshua, during one of their meetings, \"Your mother has never taken my advice. That's why she married that good-for-nothing.\" (You know, your g*dd*mn father.) Later on, he pops up to helpfully hand Josh a Molotov Cocktail! Apparently Gramps served a few years in the SDS!Holly finally delivers the ultimatum to her boyfriend for him to decide between her or his friends. She expresses this by clocking him with a stunning right cross to the jaw! This is after the scene in which she knees him in the crotch. Interesting relationship they've got going there!Not at all surprisingly, this one ends with one of those eye-rolling, predictable, \"shock\" endings that were de riguer in the 80's/90's, and one loaded with glaring continuity errors! Might as well go out with a bang!Despite the rating above, on the \"so bad it's good\" scale, this gets a 10! Highly recommended for fans of the perversely weird!",

You either get it or you don't. You either see all the wonderful awfulness in Ed Wood's movies or you just see crap and get bored. Well, there are so MANY other Ed Woods out there - like Al Adamson, Arthur Marks, etc. But TROLL 2 rises to the top - directed by an Italian who sometimes uses the screen name Drake Floyd - they shot it in Utah using local \"talent\". Now let's talk about the \"talent\" - this is without a doubt - the worst acting I have ever seen captured on film - and it is a battle of suckiness between the teenage daughter and the evil villainess. They both reach levels of overacting and facial expressions that makes one fall to the floor. The film is a mess - a disturbed little boy who keeps seeing his dead grandfather while nobody else does - is worried that goblins are trying to kill him and his family - the family goes away on a vacation to Nilsbog (get it - goblins spelled backwards)where all the townsfolk act strange and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-like - seems people are fed plant stuff that actually turns them into plants and then the goblins eat the people/plants - and they actually try to throw in some Stone Henge plot b.s. The goblins are just dwarfs wearing the worst paper mache masks you ever saw. The other stunning thing about this movie is that acting is awful across the board. We loved it - we howled with delight at every bad line of script, ever piece of eye bulging and scenery-chewing - so if you enjoy cinematic cheese - seek this baby out. You won't be sorry.

The town of Nilbog is actually the kingdom of the goblins, as told to young Joshua by his grandfather Seth, who is actually dead. Now it's up to Josh to save his family from Creedence, the Goblin Queen, who is hellbent on turning tourists into goo and vegetables.\" - This movie is funny. Period. It is so hilarious, and I mean it. There is not a person alive who could resist giving in to this movie. You have to laugh. I'm serious. There is too much to laugh at. Is it the acting? The acting that is as stale as that loaf of bread which sits forgotten at the back of a pantry until you find it, mouldy and stale, all crunchy, with flakes falling off. Or that lump of cheese. Oh God. That cheese you find hidden at the back of your fridge, sprouting green mould and smelling like year old garbage. Yes, the discovery of old food stuffs describes the acting superbly. The director must have found these mouldy-talented stinkers at the bottom of his bread-bin and the back of his fridge. It's hard to pinpoint most of the bad acting... most of it is most of most of the acting most of the way through. Hehe. I mean, Josh Wait's is probably the most irritating character to grace the big screen ever. His facial expressions are amusing however, those snarly, grotesque twisted faces provided me with multiple jolts of laughter. Stat, one two three *face*, Stat! Clear! Aaaaaaah, Goddarn, anyway, I've always thought, if you divided a DVD store up the way you do with a supermarket, in among the prize meats you'd have greats such as 'The Godfather' and 'Lord of the Rings.' Then in the cheese and dairy section would be all the stinkers like 'Manos: The Hands of Fate,' 'From Justin to Kelly' and 'Troll 2.' - Okay, the script. Where to begin? The \"row, row, row your boat\" scene? That was pretty amusing. The Wait's family are sitting in the car, driving along, when all of a sudden the Wait's mother says \"Josh, oh Josh please sing me that song. That one I love so much.\" He suddenly starts singing \"row, row,\" and then it becomes an audio orgy as we get the delight of hearing these croaky nobodies sing their sweet little hearts out. I found it amusing when Josh found out Nilbog was their world \"Nilbog! It's goblin spelt backwards! This is their kingdom!\" Other classic lines include the drugstore owner barking \"There's no coffee here in Nilbog - it's the Devil's drink!\" Diana explaining \"Joshua is not a little sh!t, he's just very sensitive.\" And Arnold screaming \"They're eating her... and then they're going to eat me... OH MY GAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\" Another part you have to look out for is the song the town-folk are humming when they throw the get-together for the Wait's family. That made me choke on my fizzy drink with absolute laughter. Ah, I have the song playing right now in the back of my head. It's pure hilarity! \"la la la, la la la, la la la la...\" Fantastic! - The plot and story is really weird, I have to say. It's nothing too complex, it's just very weird (by this I mean what the Nilbog folk are doing.) For example there is a scene where Brent and Creedence kiss an ear of corn together, and they seem to have left their popcorn in the microwave too long, because popcorn starts flying everywhere, in this totally messed up and excruciatingly painful to watch 'love' (would you call it 'love'?) scene. Another weird part was when Josh was in the car, and branches started to grow out of his fingers and he started to sweat green custard. What was the reason for that part? Probably no reason, but this movie is rather jumbled up, and painful. Anyway, this movie is great for laughs, but do not take it seriously. It's probably more fun if you get a group of friends round, grab some alcohol and big bowls of popcorn, and get ready to be perplexed, bemused, entertained, annoyed and to be laughing hysterically. Because this movie has it all. Except trolls. Weird, huh...",

            "content": "If you are the type of sadomasochistic movie-goer who seeks out films so notoriously awful just to have a laugh or two, then chances are you are familiar with Troll 2, Claudio Fragasso's cult non- sequel classic. However, if you were to label Troll 2 as the worst movie ever made, then I would question whether or not you have actually seen it (although it was the subject of Best Worst Movie, a documentary made by the lead actor). Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most inept, poorly-constructed, and laughably performed films you could ever hope to see, but what separates it from the likes of The Beast of Yucca Flats, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Battlefield Earth is that it is enormous fun. I usually go into these types of films hoping for a few laughs but end up being subjected to 90 minutes of sheer tedium, but Troll 2 really is in a class of its own.We open with kindly old man Seth (Robert Ormsby) reading his grandson Joshua (Michael Paul Stephenson) a fairytale involving goblins. The stunted creatures chase a man through the woods and force him to eat a green goo, which turns him into a plant. You see, goblins are vegetarians, so they can eat the man once he has completed the transformation. Goblins are everywhere, warns Grandpa Seth. The bedtime story is abruptly ended by the arrival of Joshua's mother Diana (Margo Prey), who causes Seth to suddenly vanish. The lovable old man has been dead for 6 months, but still appears to Joshua as a ghost. Fearing the boy is losing his marbles, the Waits family head off to the town of Nilbog as part of some kind of weird exchange program, which will see them tend crops and live off the land for a week while the Nilbogian family head into the big city in the opposite direction. On arrival, they are met with a feast covered in a strange weird goo similar to the one from the story. It seems Nilbog is the home of evil goblins posing as humans hoping to gobble them up at the earliest opportunity.Before you think I've had a stroke, I can assure you that this is the plot of the movie. You will also see no mention of trolls, because there aren't any. Director Fragasso (under the pseudonym of Drake Floyd), who could speak little English, waltzed into town with a script written in Italian and seemingly cast the first people to audition who could string a sentence together. The dialogue was badly translated, nevertheless Fragasso insisted that the lines were spoken exactly as written on the page. Somewhat endearingly, the entire cast really give it their all, despite being lumbered with the lines such as \"It's goblin spelled backwards!\". Every single frame of Troll 2 lacks logic, and this is what makes the movie so charmingly hilarious and helps separate it from the horror lurking in the IMDb's Bottom 100 list, which may raise a smirk once or twice throughout their running time. Simply marvel at the complete disregard for common sense (Grandpa's Seth plan to escape the goblins is to Molotov cocktail the house while the whole family is still inside it) and stare open-mouthed at the moment when a young horndog is seduced by a corn-on-the-cob. There really is no way to describe Troll 2.",

Take the worst movie you've ever seen and multiply it by Graham's Number and you'll be close to how horrible this movie is. When someone says about a mediocre movie, \"This is the worst movie ever!\" you know they haven't seen this movie. Anyone who has seen this movie would be much more likely to say, \"The movie I saw is pretty bad, but, it's not as bad as Troll 2.\" But it's unfair to compare because Troll 2 is like in a whole separate category.Among the movies that are the worst of the worst, this one's not quite among the bottom dregs, which, to me, includes movies like Manos, Zaat, Beast of Yucca Flats and Pocket Ninjas (among those I've seen). Movies that have NO redeeming value. This movie sort of has redeeming values, which pushes it up (barely) to a 2 out of 10 in my book.So what are these redeeming values, you ask. Well, there's the hammy over-acting of the witch Creedence, played by Deborah Reed. She doesn't appear to be trying to be funny, but her performance is so over the top, I comes across as comic gold. Then there's some weirdly memorable scenes, like the one where the witch makes out with a guy with a corncob between her teeth and then the room starts filling up with popcorn. And who can forget the scene where the boy, Joshua, pisses on everyone's food to save them (should I even try to explain this)? And then there's the famous \"Oh my God!\" line that's been popularized as one of the worst death scenes in film history.To explain all the things about this movie that went wrong would exceed the character limit of this review, by a lot - a lot a lot. I won't even try. Unless you're really into bad movies, you should stay away from this movie, far away. You shouldn't even watch a movie on a video player that's ever been use to play this movie. It'd probably make even Citizen Kane suck by it's residual suckitude. Any video player that's been used to watch this movie should be subsequently burned and buried deep underground to prevent the infection from spreading.

Lines are spoken as if the actors are reciting poetry in kindergarten. The direction would seem to imply this epic of film incompetency was a comedy, but, shockingly, the film actually seems to take itself seriously. The script has no cohesion, makes no sense, tells no story, and is such a series of unintentionally stupid lines, that you shake your head in astonishment.The \"slime\" looks like that gelatin stuff they used on the \"You can't do that on Television\" children's comedy show in the '80's. The \"goblins\" look like they're wearing old, worn out Halloween costumes. The screaming of a victim being slimed is insanely laughable. The script meanders in and out of the kid's dream until you want to throw things at the screen. The kid always looks like he's about to lose his lunch. Speaking of lunch, you won't believe the lunch scene. Or the popcorn scene.

And this is for good reason. It's terrible in every single possible way you can imagine. The acting in terrible. The costumes for the creatures are terrible. The special effects are terrible. And the dialogue is terrible. But out of this piece of putrid garbage grows a beautiful flower that must be seen to be believed.The story itself has a rather strange pedigree as well. As it's named and distributed as the sequel to a low budget Italian - American movie called \"Troll\". That too is a bad movie but it has one thing that this movie doesn't, and that's a troll. Yes you heard it here, Troll 2, a movie marketed as the sequel to a movie about a troll has exactly zero trolls in it. Instead we have goblins. Or at least that's what they're supposed to be. They're nothing more than little people in cheap novelty masks and burlap sacks.All of that could be forgiven if it wasn't for the godawful acting and dialogue. This was written by an Italian man with no grasp of English syntax. As such when the actors told him that these lines don't actually work and maybe they should change them to something a little more correct, he refused and said the lines must be delivered exactly as written. Years later the director, who still claims this is an unfairly criticized masterpiece, has said this isn't true even if everybody involved in the production says it is.And then there's the acting. This ranges from just pain old bad underacting, to bad normal acting, to bad overacting to chewing the damn scenery and giving an over the top performance that is so full of ham I'm surprised the actress didn't turn into a pig. I'm not kidding. The actress playing the witch gives such a crazy performance it is worth the price of the DVD just to see it. And of course everybody's favorite line from the guy who realizes his fate.The plot of the movie is that you have a family of four, or five if you want to count the ghost of the Grandfather and yes he has a major role in this, to dio a house swap with a family from a small farming community. I've never heard of this. You swap homes with another family, live in their home and do their job I guess and they do yours? After all they're going to a farm so I would imagine there's chores and stuff to be done. But anyway this is in the town of Nilbog. The smart ones will immediately see the twist that Nilbog is goblin spelled backwards. Except for the young boy, who's the only one who can see his dead Grandfather, nobody else in the family realizes this. Well the goblins lure people to their village using this method to eat them. But they're not meat eaters. They're vegans. So how do they eat people? By having these people eat their Nilbog food which turns them into green plant mush which the goblins then eat. Yeah, that is seriously the plot and the twist. A twist so lame that even M Night Shyamalan would call it lame.There is seriously nothing good about this movie. But it's so entertainingly inept and wrong in every sense of the word that it becomes that holy grail of Grade-Z movies that are \"so bad it's good\". So if you can get past the bad... everything in this give it a watch. You'll thank yourself later.",

I can hardly bring myself to call it a 'bad' movie; the inspiration and energy is so incredibly consistent that the utter wrongheadedness only underlines the achievement. Because the highly self-impressed director could literally not speak the language he was shooting in, he gives us spectacularly under-accomplished lead actors which are, nonetheless, the perfect visual grotesque of the American nuclear family. Having scored this coup, he puts them to the service of a plot that serves as a metaphor for the true hidden enemy of modern civilization: vegetarianism, here finally revealed as an occultist plot to turn 'normal' people into the nourishing green slime required by legions of agonizingly ugly rubber-masked goblins. The premise seems wondrous enough in itself, but the endless stream of impossibly preposterous incident that the filmmakers make of it leave you gasping in slack-jawed amazement. Everything is so wrong it's right: the bad-toothed vegetarian ringmaster, the furtive nudging of the man-plant, the Village People-like denizens of Nilbog, the mirror dance, the impossibly convoluted interventions of the cherubic Grandpa, every single outrageous line of dialogue uttered from top to bottom. For once the cultsies are right: this movie circles around the bottom of bad and back around again to become a consummate entertainment, a glorious and unrelenting train wreck that must be seen to be disbelieved.",

The trolls try to feed them \"green goo\" to make them transform into edible plants.It has to be said Troll 2 is a truly terrible film. These films are made for teenagers that rented VHS tapes of Charles Band's Full Moon films or Troma for a few laughs with their friends. Troll 2 delivers on laughs, awful special effects, but it lacks a bit in the gore department.It's worth pointing out in every bad movie there is at least one good actor. Michael Paul Stephenson as Joshua, the little boy who is sort of the lead role is better than most of the adult actors apart from Deborah Reed who plays a Troll Queen and really goes for it, hamming it up, every facial expression really turned up to the Nth degree, knowingly giving viewers exactly what they expect and being sexy with it.A documentary was made by actor, Michael Paul Stephenson and is favourably reviewed. I do like guilty pleasure films and try to see the good in most films, but while far from the worst film ever made it is difficult to recommend because it's bad on every level.On Censorship: The film was passed in the UK uncut with an 18 certificate for VHS. It was downgraded to a 15 for DVD. For comparison the film has less violence than 15 rated Final Destination.",

Putting aside the sheer lunacy and jaw dropping idiocy that is the plot about vegetarian Goblins who turn humans into plants and vegetables to be eaten, it's the stilted dialogue delivery, the Z grade production value, the Goblin costumes that would be laughed off stage in a elementary school play - that gives Troll 2 it's amazingly stupid charm. As a child I vividly remember watching this on VHS, only to find myself beyond confused at the infamous popcorn scene and god knows what else, only to rediscover this special film years later, along with the rest of the bad movie loving world.

Forget about all the b-movies you and your friends have been suckered into watching; there are not letters or characters in any alphabet to properly categorize Troll 2.To start with, there are no trolls in Troll 2. None, zero zip Nada. There are goblins however. With Terminator 2 released just a year later you may have some expectations on these goblins but that's a huge mistake. They are actually children/little people hooded and rapped in brown sheets with masks on. The pinnacle of the special effects is when liquid of the exotic color green is shown. Yeah...The actors are terrible across the board. The most concise way to describe it would be to say that they are actually bad at over-acting while reading their lines in verbatim. That may sound like an over-exaggeration but no, they were actually instructed to do so and yes they actually did. By far the worst in this respect is the mother. You will notice this at the immediate start of the movie should you make the poor mistake of watching it.With bad special effects and bad actors you're probably hoping for a good sound presentation but you're in no luck there either. If you manage to go beyond the 2 minute mark without laughing as a result of the soundtrack there is something sincerely wrong with you.The tune that plays during certain \"action\" scenes (e.g. goblins hunting people at 0.5 meters per second speed) sounds like a remastering of some terrible 1980s 8-bit console game about The Blob in space.What about the story? Well, it's unclear if there really is one. First of all, there's no connection to the supposed prequel (which is a masterpiece in comparison). A family decide to trade places with some farmers in a village for vacation. This village is apparently goblin kingdom and from what I gather these goblins are hard core vegetarians. So hard core that they are defeated by watching you eat meat. Yeah...The best way to watch this movie is to gather some friends and buy huge amounts of alcohol and proceed to watch the movie while playing a drinking game. There are plenty of drinking games available for Troll 2 if you search the internet but I will share the one me and my friend used:Drink:When someone says goblin, \"nilbog\" or Joshua. Whenever grandpa Seth shows up. When they show the woman who looks like she has herpes on her lips. When the color green shows up (in abundance). Every time someone turns into a tree or bleeds green.When \"nilbog milk\" is shown/referenced. When goblins show up. When lightning strikes. -Whenever you want to punch Joshua in the face. Whenever a scene is so bad that you question whether to keep watching or not (be careful with this one...).Finish your drink/beer when:During the popcorn scene.\"OOOOOOHHH MYYYY GOOOOOOOOD!!!\" scene. \"You can't p*** on hospitality!\" scene.Credits roll.You can of course make your own rules, use only a subset of these and/or freestyle as much as you want.

            "content": "Claudio Fragasso and his wife/co-writer Rosella Drudi meant to make a \"good\" movie (whatever that means in Italian exploitation), and went to America to make a movie out of their script 'Goblin', which poked fun at vegetarians and people from Utah - a goal not too unmanageable by any means. But instead of doing the thing where they have the Italian actors speaking their language and dubbing later, they have American actors speaking their English script. And Fragasso and company just don't bother to explain things, at all. Who cares? Why not be weird? This is the kind of movie where you see a floating head of an old man (grandpa Seth played by thespian Robert Ormsby) and it's NOT meant as a joke... um, I guess.As the story of Nilbog (get it, eh, eh?) and the trip the Waits take there along with a few other might-be-gay jocks in a trailer and the chaos that ensues with the town being consumed by goblins, it's crap. It's not a good movie. And yet, it's not without lack of trying; Fragasso wasn't an amateur, having made horror films for years with fellow-trashmaker Bruno Mattei and also as a fill-in for directors like Lucio Fulci (Zombie 3, or 4, anyone?) But it's just executed in a way that... I still don't know. But it is a true classic as far as bad movies go, because Fragasso really believes he's making a good movie, and yet everything has a hallucinatory quality to it, in the camera-work, affectation of performances, the music, the popcorn that kills(!) A friend I watched the movie with made a good point, that everything was revealed to be a dream at the end of the little boy's journey through this story it might be even more interesting. Spoiler, it isn't. It is what you see, with a FREEZE-FRAME at the end for emphasis. However that doesn't stop it from being a gross, stupid, ridiculous, badly-poorly-over-the-top acted effort, mostly from actors who never acted before, and some never to again (at least as far as IMDb is concerned). It's also telling to find out after the fact that Fragasso and his team didn't speak English and mostly made the cast speak the lines of dialog as they were written! George Hardy makes a great-awful poor/rich man's Aaron Eckhardt-cum-Craig Nelson, Margo Prey unintentionally frightens as the stern-faced mother who orders \"Row Row Row Your Boat\" sung in the car, and the little boy Stephenson (who later directed Best Worst Movie about the Troll 2 phenomenon) gives it his all but mostly for calling for grandpa to come, usually as the giant head like the computer guy from Red Dwarf. There's spandex work-outs, awfully over the top supporting performances from yokels, sex with corn (I mentioned that but need to mention again, plus shots sexually panning down the woman's body as she holds the corn in black tights), and lots and lots and lots of green slime and sh*t (only old-school Nickelodeon has more). There's a goblin (not a *troll*, by the way) that throws ONE spear, and that's (spoiler) about it as far as spear throwing goes. And there's a random gay couple that, um, are they gay? A horror critic nailed it: the filmmakers made a bad movie, but it's also a movie made after they got hit on the head and just went for something... unusual. For me, only The Room is a more notorious and one-of-a-kind bad movie. It's a cheesy, mind-boggling laugh riot.",

In fact, I think they refer to the creatures in this one as goblins rather than trolls.

Here it is very pointless and stupid, and the only good I can say of it is that the woman is hotter than the one from part one.

After about thirty minutes I stopped my VCR in utter disgust, rewound it, and never looked back. Fast forward almost twenty years and I stumble upon Troll 2 latenight on MGM HD channel. By the way, this channel is golden as far as showing terrible films in stunning 1080i no less. After sitting through this in its entirety I'm assured that I did the right thing those many years ago. Troll 2 is just THAT bad. Directed by Italian hackmaster Claudio Fragasso, the real reason Zombie 3 sucks, here hiding behind the name Drago Floyd. The Waits family is participating in some bizarre hometown swap with some residents from the town of Nilbog, much to the chagrin of youngest son Joshua who delivers his lines with a facial grimace reserved for dire situations in a gas station bathroom when you have an upset stomach. Recently deceased Grandpa Seth assist Joshua from the beyond in keeping his family from being eaten from vegetarian goblins who instead of -I don't know eating plants!- have to get the humans to eat this disgusting green concoction that turns them into human trees to be consumed by the townsfolks, er trolls, I mean goblins. The goblins are controlled by their queen Creedence Leonore Gielgud who adds the ham to this cheese sandwich by using the same eyes widening schtick for every line she speaks. Joshua runs the gamut from urinating on dinner to assault with a bologna sandwich to save his family who are constantly hoodwinkedinto consuming the food covered in green icing that no sane person would even think of eating. The fact that they never question anything in this bizarre town is what's so frustrating about this movie. This film is definitely on par with Ed Wood's Plan 9 as far as worse acting performances ever. Joshua's mother Diana has the same clueless look on her face the whole friggin film and doesn't say one thing that's even remotely convincing. Michael Waits probably delivers one of the dumbest lines and probably most overlooked of this film as he explains to Joshua why the town is so empty in the middle of the day as a the \"farmers are all asleep this time of night\". Huh? One, it's mid afternoon. Two, what sort of farmer farms at night. Vampire farmers? Good god who wrote this! Which brings me to the worst of the worst. Holly Waits is the single most maddeningly awful character you will ever watch. It's downright vile how she spits her lines with this uber-bratty personality and her constant over emphasis on the wrong syllable. Her bizarre solo dance scene showcases that she's just as bad a dancer as an actress. There are some bad films that provide genuine enjoyment such as , for me at least, R.O.T.O.R., which is why the Bottom 100 is such as popular list. This film is not one of those as there is no hint of charm whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost.",

As the film progressed however, it became clear that this was not going to be an enjoyable experience.The main flaw of Troll 2 (named so even though the monsters in it are goblins) is the pacing, for a supposed horror flick it is incredibly slow and really lacks action. A movie about a family being attacked by small, ugly critters armed with spears could be great fun but no, the goblins are the lamest monsters ever and don't do anything more than look menacing. Really, they don't attack the family until the very end, they just give them food that turns them into green goo. The family is fine as long as they don't eat the stuff the goblins offer them.Apart from that rather major flaw, the setting is way too light and colorful for a monster movie - it looks like it was made for kids - and the actors are utterly unable to deliver their lines with any form of vitality.In the end of the film I realized I had gone in to see this film with the wrong attitude. I had thought it would be a monster movie and expected it to be either suspenseful, or funny, in a campy way. But this film is not a monster movie, it is a social commentary on veganism and how vegans have a tendency towards pushing their ideology on other people in their surroundings. The director clearly takes an anti- vegetarian stance by comparing vegans to monsters, lame monsters that don't do anything but nonetheless.",

This thing is generally considered as one of the worst movies that ever have been made. For everyone who still thinks that's an exaggerated statement...you're wrong ! Troll 2 really IS a disaster every way you look at it and a waste of time, pellicle and effort.Forget everything you knew about the original Troll (1986)...Better yet, forget everything !! Forget about the fact you have a bit of intelligence in you and forget about the theory that movies are a form of art and cultural entertainment...Those are necessary precautions you have to take in you're planning to sit through this entire movie. By the way...if you do make it till the end, you deserve a price...chances are that you'll give up a lot sooner.What is it exactly that makes Troll 2 this bad ?? Well, as a short answer, I'd say everything !! The characters make you nauseate and the \"actors\" who're playing them make you aggressive. The story is pretty pathetic and the setting are completely uninspired. And don't blame the low budget for that !! I've seen enough quickies where the level of creativity makes up for the lack of money. The cast and crew here just suffers from a lack of talent ! The special effects and make-up in the original Troll were really dumb and cheesy but they were Oscar-material compared to the stuff used in Troll 2. There where the original movie did an effort make it look like a hideous creature, Troll 2 just uses childish masks and brown bags...really sad.The story ?? Well, if you insist...( small spoilers...who cares ) A family of complete losers decides to spend a couple of months in the countryside. A couple of teenage retards follow them in a caravan. They all arrive in a town where they get turned into vegetables and eaten by \"Goblins\"...Little detail by the way : in the entire movie, the word \"Troll\" isn't used once ! The constantly ramble about Goblins so the complete background that was given to the Troll in the original movie is wasted in this movie. Either way, the idiotic family receives help from the grandfather who's been dead for a half year and a lot of useless things are being said. That's about it...A final word of praise goes out to the very talented cast ! You can be sure about the fact that you'll never see a more unique gathering of wankers ! The mother is extremely irritating, the father is just a big joke, the daughter is pretty good-looking but also pretty stupid...and - last but not least - the son Joshua ... man, I felt the urge to choke that little twat !

On the back of the cover they actually spell it 'NilboRg' which is just even more of a complete mess up. The text on the back is written as if a ten year old child has come up with the scenario. After opening the old 2nd hand big box VHS of Troll 2 the 'T2 curse' was upon me. The next hour and a half of my life would be the worst I have EVER spent viewing a film.The film is so poorly acted and has such a bad plot, fx, sound, camera work and make up that there should be a law placed upon this film that it should never be watched and that all known copies of this film should be blasted far away into space.The sound was utterly diabolical and sounded as if it had been recorded through a sock. From the cheesy pathetic intro music to the actual dialogue itself.The plot itself is something that I can assure you was written on the back of a napkin in 10 minutes. The final showdown where 'Joshua' confronts the trolls and unmasks his 'secret weapon' just makes me want to simply END my own life.The FX are actual BELOW low budget status. Such as the AMAZING scene where a troll throws a spear into some idiot. He basically holds the spear in himself, to look as if he's been 'speared'. At this point I'm shouting so loud at the screen with abuse, but they simply cannot hear me. Check out the 'troll' masks! Where did they get them from? I'm guessing they were picked up at a discount shop in the middle of the summer where they'd been lying in a box for some time.

            "content": "WOW. Where to begin with this one. This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life bar none and I've seen a lot of crap. Let me just set the scene before I even move onto the, ahem, 'plot'. This review has spoilers in it but unlike most films, knowing what happens won't affect your enjoyment of it.Troll 2 ahh the sequel to Troll 1 I hear you say? Nope, of course not. The distributors, concerned with the ability for the success of the film (and rightly so) renamed it to try and link it to a successful film, Troll, released 4 years prior. Along with that the artwork cover above was designed by someone who had seen neither of the films and as a result everything see on it has absolutely no relation to anything that happens... I mean he's drawn a werewolf for Christ's sake and that's not even the same kid.Troll 2 was the brainchild of Claudio Fragasso who co-wrote it with his wife both of whom were native Italians not well versed in the language of English. In fact they spoke no English, hired an Italian film crew to do their bidding and to save from any confusion brought in American actors. A cunning plan if I do say so myself! Despite all this though the film was somehow shot and completed successfully so onto the 'plot'.Troll 2 of course revolves around the mystical creatures known as trolls. Well... actually no, no it doesn't. Throughout the whole 90 minutes the word troll is mentioned a grand total of zero times. The film Troll 2 is actually about goblins. Whilst on a house swapping holiday in the small village of Nilbog (a gold star for anyone who can spot why it's called this) a family- mum, Diana; dad, Michael; sister, Holly; Joshua; and the vision of Joshua's dead grandfather Grandpa Seth discovers the village is inhabited by goblins that plan to eat them. They are of course vegetarian goblin's though and so first need to turn them into vegetable people by feeding them poisoned food. You couldn't come up with this even if you tried and yet somehow Fragasso has managed it. To add to the fun, Holly's boyfriend Elliot tags along in his campervan with his three friends Arnold, Drew and Brent.This poisoned food is worryingly green and looks like it's come out of a cows rear end, so of course the family gather round the table to eat it. But Joshua's Grandpa's ghost appears from nowhere to save the day by warning him that the food is bad as it's been made by the evil Goblins. So how does our Josh save the day? The only way he knows how, he gets up onto the table and pisses all over the food of course prompting one fantastic line from the dad.The special effect is stunning and ranges from a lightning bolt effect to a lightning bolt effect and the goblins are terrifying showing off what must have at the time been the cutting edge in how to make costumes from things found in a dumpster and potato sacks. The music sets the scenes and is composed entirely from a keyboard synthesiser probably with a couple of keys missing. O and before I forget, the acting is appallingly atrocious.The weirdest thing about this film is the continual ream of continuity fails and unexplained scenarios. For example, we see Nilbog milk but never find out why it's there, no one in the town drinks it, surely it would go off? We never learn about grandpa Seth's special powers- why is he helpless to stop the family from eating the food but can hack a goblin's hand off with an axe through a mirror or create a Molotov cocktail out of nothing to fling at the nearby Nilbog residents. (No I'm not making this up!) Why does the mum have such freaky bug-like eyes? What was the purpose of turning Arnold into a tree instead of just eating him? What is up with that random girl running through the forest? Why is Arnold unfazed when he first sees the goblins? Who the hell is Creedence? What happens to her face at the end of the movie and has she never heard of chapstick? How do 'the powers of goodness' eliminate the goblins? Now I've only scratched the surface of this film with so much more to see including the best weapon ever used in the history of film. You will have to watch it to find out what it is but I'll give you a clue- it comes in paper bag and shares it's name with an Italian city and a former English Lord.The scariest part of this movie is when you realise that not only is it hilarious to watch but it's addictive and at some point in the future you are going to put yourself through the ordeal that is Troll 2 again! I'm proud to announce that I survived Troll 2, even if a bit of me and my brain died with it.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",

This film is dreadful, but because it is dreadful it is somewhat hilarious. The cinematography and editing are incredibly slip shod and the costumes of the trolls(or shall I say goblins) are quite horrible. The story also meanders all over the place, the script is abysmal and the direction is wretched. Then there is the poor pacing and atrocious acting, and any hopes of any thrills or scares are replaced with scatterings of unintentional laughs and often for the wrong reasons. Overall, it is a dreadful film, but it does have some unintentional entertainment value unlike some of the other bad movies I've seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

First off, the fact that they never mention the cheap k-mart costumed creatures as trolls (The Friggin' title of the film!!) but as Goblins should already say they were losing the concept quickly. But I guess the fact that the writer had the genius idea of naming the town Nilbog (Goblin spelled backwards) there was no turning back. OK, fine. So they're Goblins not Trolls, then why throw in a Leprachaun mythos by having them all be burned with clover scars and evil green St.Patty's day food? Which by the way when eaten turns you into a goblin. Hilarious scene where the kid prevents his family from eating this food. Hint: Urine for a surprise. This is nothing compared to the actual thing he uses to finally defeat the goblins in the end. I'm gonna tell you, since it's so retarded. It's a friggin' Balogna sandwich!!! What the Hell!!! He eats it, because apparently the Gobbys are vegatarians and just can't stand meat? Whatever.BY the way the sandwich is supplied by his dead grandfather who constantly pops in and out of scenes. Acting is 100% horrible. Story sucks, but funny as all hell!",

            "content": "If you like BAD movies (and I mean BAD....as in \"Plan 9\" bad....), believe me, Troll 2 is for YOU! I have seen some pretty bad \"horror\" or sci-fi movies....Leprechaun, Plan 9 From Outer Space, Jack-O, Jack Frost, most anything that Sci-Fi Channel unleashes........but nothing ever has (or ever WILL) compare to the utter INSIPID stupidity that IS Troll 2.And having said this, I must say I absolutely LOVE this movie! Let's introduce the characters.There is the Waits family--Dad (occupation: professional Dumba$$), Mom (a STUNNING, Oscar-worthy performance if there ever was....), Big sis Holly (probably not a contender for \"Dancing With the Stars....\"), and little brother Joshua (who should be the spokesperson for Irritable Bowel Syndrome....I mean this poor kid looks like he is in SERIOUS pain throughout the film....). We also have Holly's homosexual boyfriend, Elliot, Elliot's three gay buddies, a mysterious not-so-sexy sexy chick who appears in the woods from out of nowhere, and a horde of hideous rednecks......who are all (GASP) GOBLINS IN DISGUISE.And yes, I said GOBLINS....there are no Trolls in \"Troll 2\"....we don't even hear the WORD \"troll\" from start to finish. Instead, we have a cast of midgets in Value Mart Halloween masks running around in potato sacks. I kid you not. This \"sequel\" has nothing to do with the Sonny Bono afflicted original.Confused yet? Just wait....there's more....We have Grandpa Seth, a ghost only Joshua can see who has AMAZING abilities.....he can materialize Molotov cocktails from thin air, appear in mirrors at will, suspend time for no good reason, and make a MEAN double decker bologna sandwich....all while dressed in a very grandfatherly Mr Rogers sweater. Don't pi$$ this guy off....he may not have any powers of any real worth (and hell, he may be about as threatening as a wet sock puppet), but he can bore the hell out of you with a bedtime story in about 10 seconds FLAT. Yeah, Granpa Seth is hardcore.There is also Creedence.....the Queen of the goblins. I don't think this chick's mom ever bought a tube of Crest her entire childhood....and she has a truly sick fascination with botany. She is also gonna have you running to the store for chapstick by the time this masterpiece is over....I promise.And where does the ultimate battle between good and evil take place? The tiny town of Nilbog (here's a super fun activity....write NILBOG on a flashcard and hold it up the mirror.....I think you will be pleasantly surprised). This is where the goblins live, and once you see this sleepy little town, you will instantly know that obviously goblins don't have great taste in Real Estate. The ill-fated Waits family has chosen Nilbog as the ideal vacation getaway....complete with dust and dull atmosphere.....and the aforementioned gay quartet is not far behind. And ALL of them are being eyed as potential snacks by the ever-hungry Trol....um, I mean GOBLINS......Nothing in this movie makes sense....so don't even try to make sense out of it. There is the horrible plot to turn all the humans into globs of \"manplant\" (the goblins' favorite dish), gratuitous green food, killer popcorn attacks, a house that looks like a church that looks like a house, a mind-numbing \"welcome to the neighborhood\" chant complete with musical score and tainted food, some of the BEST movie lines EVER (MICHEAL.....who are the goblins????), TONS of wooden acting, a styrofoam Stonehenge block with absolutely no believable worth in the \"story\", a Mullet-wielding preacher, and a cutting-edge special effect (yes, that was singular, NOT plural....all you get is black screen with a pathetic lightning bolt a grand total of 14 or so times). What makes this movie all the more sad and yet funny at the same time is that the director actually thought he was making a truly GOOD movie.....the actors have all since admitted they knew it was crap from the get-go, but most of them have a pretty good sense of humor about it.....after all, most of them were just picked off the street and asked if they wanted to be in a movie. True story.Well, that pretty much sums it up.....the movie is total DRECK, from start to finish. And the scary thing is....not only is it actually fun to watch....it's ADDICTIVE...you WILL end up having drinking parties around this one, I assure you. Just because it gets one star does NOT mean it's not enjoyable.....it's that train wreck that you just can't take your eyes off of.Ten Stars....not because it's good....because it's so BAD it's good.",

            "content": "Recent studies have shown that the average person's intelligence is going down, thanks to so-called \"contributions to society\" like American Idol, Michael Bay movies and unhealthy ingredients in foods. It has been started that intelligence started to downgrade around the time the new millennium started. After watching Troll 2, I believe this trend started ten years earlier, when a schlock Italian director was hired to direct this absolutely atrocious film, if you can call it a \"film.\" Everything about Troll 2 reeks of stupidity, from the cast to the script to the score and even the costumes. Ed Wood, notoriously named the worst director of all-time, wouldn't touch this film with a twenty-foot yard stick. Even the infamous Uwe Boll would call this one a stinker. Yet, along with the stupidity, there are still plenty of laughs to be had. Troll 2 is such a ridiculous film that it's very hard to watch it with a straight face. While cringing at the horrible celluloid you're watching, you might find yourself giggling as well. However, that's the only thing that will help you get through this crummy backyard production.The plot of Troll 2, which I managed to find past the badness, centers around Joshua Waits, a young boy who constantly having conversations with his dead grandfather's ghost. Meanwhile, His sister, Holly, is having problems with his boyfriend, Scotty, the \"good for nothing playboy son of the Coopers.\" She wants him to spend more time with her and to forget about his friends. The plot starts to begin when the father decides to take the family on a vacation to the small town of Nilbog, but once on arrival, Joshua becomes suspicious of the other townsfolk. Scotty and his friends also head to Nilbog, where he hopes in finding Holly and they want to score with some local girls. The residents of Nilbog appear to be very kind to the Waits, constantly trying to feed them oddly coloured vegetables and milk with \"Vitamin D!\" Yet, Joshua and his grandfather knowing that the Nilbog citizens are in fact goblins in disguise, swoop in at the oddly right moments to stop them. Scotty's friends, meanwhile, are turned into \"man plants\" by the leader of the Nilbog goblins, a witch who likes to annunciate every single syllable.The plot synopsis above does not do justice to how bad and laugh-inducing Troll 2 is. Claudio Fragasso, who at the time of making this had a limited knowledge of the English language, wrote and directed this with little care for story, characters, interesting settings and making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. The goblins are made with what look like Halloween masks that probably made up about two dollars of the budget and pillowcases full of hay. Sequences where characters ooze disgusting slime and turn into flat, green pancakes are especially embarrassing, due to the obviously bad editing and ridiculous nature of it. The score is also downright poor and laughable. Techno music was quite popular at the time of this film's release, but that's because they had style. Here, the composer just hits random notes on the keyboard. The script is the worst aspect of Troll 2, as it features the worst dialogue I have heard in any major motion picture and the story is extremely silly and badly fabricated. Eating bologna sandwiches kills goblins? Apparently so. Because they're vegetarians, they must turn humans into plants to eat them? I guess they have no idea how to plant their own vegetables in Nilbog. And don't even get me started on that out of left-field ending. It looks like the screenplay never passed the first draft page or Fragasso never even showed it to script readers.The people involved I feel the most sorry for are the actors. Maybe they're very good and could have had some great careers in Hollywood, starring alongside Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise. However, any evidence of that is not displayed in Troll 2. Michael Stephenson gives quite possibly the worst performance by a child star I have ever seen, yelling and screeching and crying \"Grandpa!\" so many times I lost count after bad line delivery #1270. George Hardy, a practicing dentist, plays the father with as little emotion as possible, with every single expression looking exactly the same. Margo Prey, the mother, provides the difficult cast of being even more bland. Connie Young's performance as Holly is monotone and thus makes her character more uncaring and annoying that she already is. If she auditioned for her high school's school play, the drama teacher would cross her name off the list after about two minutes. Robert Ormsbry, is just as cringe inducing, playing Scotty the homophobic boyfriend (although he is oddly enough shown in one scene, sharing a bed butt-naked with one of his buddies). Darren Ewing gives probably Troll 2's most infamous acting job as Arnold, who provides a reaction shot that provides more laughs than screams.Finally, Deborah Reed attempts to shoot for Oscar gold with her performance as the evil leader of the goblins. She apparently finds it necessary to pronounce every vowel and in so doing so, extends what should be a short sixty-minute feature to a bloated and long ninety-minutes. Thankfully, Fragasso didn't give her a Paul Thomas Anderson-esquire monologue. Otherwise, Troll 2 would have yet another hour of running time. Despite the awfulness of Troll 2, the images of its unintentional hilarity are still stuck in my brain. However, unlike a classic horror film like The Exorcist which I highly appreciate, Troll 2 is only around and in circulation so myself and other people can make fun of it.",

The writing - I'm pretty sure there was no script and no writer, and if there was one it was written on toilet paper by a degenerate.3. The sex - there are two sex scenes in this movie, one involving corn and the other involving two teenage boys. Both involving a trailer home.4. The title - the title of the movie is Troll 2 and guess what there isn't one effing troll in the whole movie, they are goblins.5. The cast - you have never heard of them and you never will.6. The cinematography - made you look! there wasn't any. I'm pretty sure they just strapped a hi-8 camera to the back of a goat.7. The plot - A country family (of goblins) switches homes with a city family (of terrible actors) and the terrible actors have wacky experiences full of forced-feedings, urination, child abuse, hunger strikes, dead grandfathers who have friends in hell who teach them lightning magic tricks, vegetarian goblins, stone henge super powered witches, milk full of vitamin content, sheriff freak, plant people, corn sex, awesome dancing, mobile homes, homoeroticism, evil clergymen, sweaty kids, and double decker bologna sandwiches.If those reasons aren't enough then you are stupid.

And for the record Troll 2 has no trolls, it has goblins, ha!My dog once asked me: \"I am going to make a movie.\" I said to him: \"You're a dog. Dogs don't make movies.\" After seeing Troll 2 I said to him: \"Go on and make your movie.\" I've seen a lot of crap. Believe me. I've become an expert in this field. And Troll 2 doesn't belong in my field of expertise. Because I watch movies. I like movies. I comment movies. Troll 2 is not a movie. Troll 2 is like just before you die. The same feeling. It's when you say: \"Damn, a whole life wasted.\" I wasted my life after watching it. I have no longer desire to live, to love, to hate, to feel. I have become totally numb.

Every detail is so off and some moments are so pointless and confusing that they defy explanation. It is obvious the creators of this film are borderline insane and have no idea how movies work, but that's the beauty of it. That's why it is so successfully awful and so bizarrely funny, because of the obliviousness of a distinctly foreign filmmaker attempting to make an American monster movie and failing with miserable hilarity.

I wanted to watch this movie for a long time but couldn't find a copy. Then a friend invited me over to watch it on netflix. I was amazed. All the things I had ever heard about it were true! It was a pile of S%$T!! At first my friend and I were just laughing hysterically, the movie was so bad it was funny. This was because the acting was so bad we couldn't believe it, emotions were hard to register, facial expression looked absolutely ridiculous and the actors didn't even look like they knew what they were doing. It honestly looked like the director tried to find the worst actors ever. But thats OK, because this may be the worst script of all time, so no talent was wasted. Seriously, the story is a mess and the dialogue is horrible. It sounds stiff, forced and is completely unbelievable. The plot is also equally ridiculous,making little sense and full of obvious holes that weigh the film down even more. On top of all that the film is just idiotic in every way possible. The effects suck,the makeup is like something from a children's show with no budget and the premise is so silly it defies belief. Only watch this film if you truly want to see some of the most incompetent film making ever",

            "content": "Out of all the movies I have seen which have been dubbed \"worst\" movie of all time, Troll 2 (1990) is by far the most fun. While Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) has its charm and The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961) has its mercifully short run time, Troll 2 has everything going for it if it wanted to be a parody of 1980's creature features. Everything about it is brimming with cheesiness and over the top goofiness, from the acting, the special effects and even the story itself.Troll 2 begins with a family poised to swap houses with a family from a faraway town called Nilbog, so they can get in some vacation time. Joshua (Michael Stephenson) is still reeling from the recent death of his grandfather and sees his ghost constantly. Meanwhile Holly (Connie Young) the older sister, is trying to have some fun with her boyfriend (Jason Wright) but keeps getting interrupted by his interchangeable trio of friends. When the family travels to Nilbog, with the teenage boys following behind in a camper, Joshua picks up on some ominous signs in and around their new vacation home and discovers there are goblins trying to eat them.The principle unintended laughter is directed towards the lackluster special effects by D. Christopher Salmon and Co. many times during the movie the goblins that appear on the screen look like little people frocked with dirty sheets and topped off with paper mache masks. Not to be outdone however, Actress Deborah Reed chews the scenery like a starving child on a cracker as the goblin queen. Every facial expression and emotion is carried through her off-kilter eyebrow movements and phony Eastern European accent and played to those in the cheap seats. There was more ham in her performance than a bologna sandwich.Every other actor fails spectacularly to bring any life out of their characters though it didn't help that they were propped by a horrid script written by Claudio Fragasso and Rossella Drudi. The dialogue was ridiculously stilted and there were enough plot holes to strain spaghetti through the celluloid. Yet despite the filmmaker's blatant incompetence not once was I bored watching Troll 2.In fact I would rather watch Troll 2 again then sit through the original and tangentially related prequel Troll (1986). That movie made the fatal mistake of being boring and forgetful while Troll 2 is an entertaining train wreck of biblical proportions from start to finish.Those curious to see Troll 2 need not be worried by its unseemly reputation. There is no need for a Mystery Theater 3000 (1988-1999) dubbing since the hilarity is up-close and holds your attention. A must watch for film buffs and a fun filled Saturday Z-Movie night for the rest of us. Just make sure no one you invite to your Troll party is a vegetarian.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",

Next major issue, if the \"goblins\" were vegetarians, then why turn people into vegetables when they can grow their own! It would make more sense if they were flesh eaters. Now finally, the last and biggest problem with \"troll 2\". The climax, the ending of the film leaves the impression that Josh destroys all the Goblins, then the other shoe drops.

Classics in the genre such as Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dracula, Scream, Nightmare on Elm Street while good in their own right, will have taken a serious step down in your mind after you've laid eyes on the greatest horror nay, any movie ever made.  Troll 2!!!  The movie begins when a typical house exchange program goes awry and the protagonist family ends up living in Nilbog, that's goblin spelled backward (pure genius), the capital of the goblins.  From here on in, zany antics ensue.  The family youngster, Joshua(played by electrifying Michael Stephenson), sets out on his own personal quest to save his family and rid the world of the goblins.  Kudos Michael.  After some close calls in which young Joshua has several brushes with death, he manages to contact his dead grandfather (who is not in hell by the way) and gets him to come back for a pivotal 10 minutes in which he punches out one particularly nasty goblin and equips Joshua with the most powerful weapon that Earth has against a force as devastating as the goblins.  A TRIPLE DECKER BOLOGNA SANDWHICH!!!!  Look out Hiroshima.  Then almost as suddenly as he arrived, Grandpa disappears for good ala Obi-Wan Kenobi in some lesser known movie. I cried at the ending of the movie, which I will not ruin for those of you out there that have not yet been fortunate enough to see this work of art. I think that since prequels are all the rage nowadays, we need a Troll prequel or two to get our juices flowin again.  Who wouldn't like to see Grandpa Seth as a rambunctious teen who has some run-ins with the goblins and yet somehow finds the will to defeat them.  I can only wish that this movie gets made.  Until then I will have to continue to watch Troll 2 on a daily basis.p.s. the musical score is completely terrifying in it's own right.  The artist's use of \"spooky\" chords and notes in several of the film's key chase scenes, and the infamous popcorn scene simply made the movie that much better",

            "content": "Well, it seems many of the comments on this site have pretty much summed it up: you will never ever ever see a movie like \"Troll 2\". It is destined to be the stuff of \"Shock Video\" type geekdom/worship/hatred in twenty years or so. Totally transcending any movie in ANY genre, it soars (or is that sinks?) in its heights of ineptness and twisted depravity. A direct-to-video family monster movie becomes, in this case, a hideous and surreal monster in its own right, shocking the viewer with its universally awful acting, ridiculous costumes, insane dialogue and hideously ugly kid actor star. Anyone who can make it through the whole 90 minutes of this will emerge a new person, and will probably ache for hours just from laughing so hard. Hard to believe director Joe D'Amato was the man responsible for the cult classic gore films Anthropophagus 1 and 2! I think the guy must've hit his pinnacle here, though, blessing us with this amazing turd. I'd recommend watching this once sober and then, if you're up for it, trying the following drinking game:TROLL 2 for Alcoholics:You'll need: a few cases of cheap beer (Beast or Genny'll do, quantity depends on how many friends you have over; figure MANY beers necessary per person) AND one bottle Mister Bostonplus, as many friends as you can muster up (must have sense of humor)the rules: 1.) Drink once every time a character seeps green goo 2.) Drink once every time someone sez: \"Joshua\" 3.) Drink twice every time dad sez something totally bizarre or mom gives mega creepy stare 4.) Drink twice every time Grampa Seth appears 5.) One shot every time a character is given disgusting random green food to eat (and doesn't find it strange!) 6.) One shot for every time eighties dance music is blaring 7.) Two shots for every time aforementioned music accompanied by actual dance 8.) First person to tally beard/mustache count in \"General Store\" scene can make someone else drink 9.) Drink three times for every close-up shot of Joshua's unspeakable face 10.) Slam beer for every line spoken by actual goblin 11.) Any person to spot one of the three f**k-ups in filming (besides movie itself) makes others drink (HINT: fly, dad's oops, hallway)12.) Drink twice for each time \"smelly bladder\" \"nest of infections\" or \"stinky intestines\" is mentioned 13.) Two shots for every time grampa and grandson engage in pyromania together 14.) Slam six-pack everytime you're genuinely gripped with fear.Hopefully this game will make the film that much more enjoyable, and your friends can drive home drunk and create some horror of their own. Come to think of it, no, I don't think it's possible to make this film better (worse) than it is, but you're welcome to try (and destroy your liver in the process). Cheers!",

            "content": "In-crappy-credible. That's the word that comes to mind. How do movies like this get made? Was there no sane person on the set (never mind, they didn't have a set) who had the guts to tell Claudio Fragasso \"sorry mate, this just ain't gonna work, just give it up already before anyone gets hurt\"? Wow. That's all I can say. I truly cannot summarize how awful this movie is in words. But I'll try, anyway. I have to get this film out of my system before I go insane.Take some rednecks and ex-porn stars, throw them into some anonymous town in the middle of nowhere, slap a huge \"NILBOG\" sign on a pole, hire lots of dwarfs and some sh!tty costumes, and get the most over-the-top, annoying, washed-up Z-movie actress you can find to play the main antagonist, add a delusional kid who is almost as convincing as the thespian from \"Pod People\", and at least twice as irritating, and you have a movie. That's the Claudio Fragasso way! So we have a kid actor with whom we're supposed to sympathize, but he's so bad I just wanted to hit him most of the time and tell him not to be such an overreacting little prick. Seriously, Joshua looks like someone is repeatedly kicking him in the groin whenever he tries to emote.Unbelievably, Joshua isn't the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua's mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed. She plays Creedence Leonore Gielgud in a way that makes it hard not to think that the nice men in white coats were waiting for Deborah after major shooting of the film had finished. This woman has the scariest eyes I've ever seen, they're constantly moving up and down, bulging in and out of their sockets so fast even Rodney Dangerfield would be scared. Her eyes are enough to almost distract you from her horrendous overacting, but only almost. Hearing her deliver her \"little flower\" speech makes you pine for the subtlety and depth of Vin Diesel. But enough about her.Can it get any worse? Actually it can, because suddenly a myriad of the aforementioned dwarfs - sorry, I meant goblins - appear. Think of an army of walking, oinking potatoes with bargain bin Halloween masks - those are the goblins. Sound scary yet? I thought so.Kill me now. I thought the film couldn't get any dumber, but it did - suddenly Joshua realizes that \"NILBOG\" is actually \"GOBLIN\" spelled BACKWARDS!!! Yes, I'm stunned too. This truly is the most brilliant plot twist this side of M. Night Shyallaman. And so cleverly set up, too! I can assure you I did NOT see this coming, no siree. Gee whizz, what a shocker! All sarcasm aside, this is probably the part of the film where I completely lost it. The sheer look of shock on Joshua's face upon his revelation combined with the \"scary\" music (which was probably stolen from some Japanese TV show from the eighties, by the way) - this is unintentional comedy at its finest. And by \"finest\", I mean \"most painful\".So, when all is said and done, what can we make of this movie? It's low budget, so badly acted you'll want to gouge your eyes out, unintentionally hilarious, blatantly homoerotic (Elliott having trouble choosing between his \"boys\" and his girlfriend, Elliott's \"boys\" sleeping half-naked next to each other) and it gave me the impression that Claudio Fragasso has a fetish for the colour green. In conclusion this film has very deservedly earned itself a position on the Bottom 100, and I'm still blown away by the fact that there are movies this irredeemably awful out there. My review has barely scratched on the surface of how awful this film is - it's worse than \"Red Zone Cuba\", worse than \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\", worse than \"Time of the Apes\"... and I wouldn't hesitate to say that it's *this* close to being as bad as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" (interestingly enough, both films feature a hilarious scene in which the main characters inexplicably burst out in a chorus of \"Row your boat\"). My Bottom 100 marathon couldn't have ended on a higher note of badness and I'm happy to say that I survived this ordeal (Watching \"Bloodrayne\", \"Captain America\" and this in a row) without any extensive brain damage... or did I? Anyway, to any devoted fan of bad movies, this is truly appetizing... and provocative. To quote Arnold, one of Elliot's \"boys\": \"OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\"",

            "content": "How bad can movies get? Well this low-budget fantasy/horror film from 1990 is always right up there with the very worst of em'. The inconsistencies are numerous, the acting is terrible throughout and ultimately the film feels very scatterbrained. It's my viewing experience that Italian's are guilty of churning out some of the worst movies ever and what do you know, Troll 2 just happened to be directed by one, Claudio Fragasso is his real name, though he's credited as \"Drake Floyd\" in the movie. I've read that this talentless and delusional imbecile actually thinks that THIS MOVIE, TROLL 2! is a \"masterpiece\". It boggles the mind. It is a scatter-brained mess of a movie, but not completely incoherent, it's plot (is that really the word to use) goes as such and it is a challenge to thread this mess together. Here goes.The \"Wait\" family are going on a vacation and their destination is a quaint little hamlet out in the country-side by the name of Nilbog (and as the movie will proclaim, Nilbog IS goblin spelled backwards) with a population of 26 people. It's all very scenic, with meadows and prairies's and such, however the town folk are all rather odd in the eye's of the Wait's (their not a likable bunch either). You see their swapping homes with another family (for a month I believe) who happen to live in Nilbog, I've never heard of this before, but that's what their doing here.There's this ugly little kid named Joshua who keeps seeing apparitions of his dead grandpa, who keeps telling Joshie-boy of bad things to come, specifically \"goblin's\" (and you were expecting trolls, weren't you), this fictitious rubbish is all started by the cardigan-clad ghost of grampa Seth, reading him stories from a book of tall tales, while sitting in a rocking-chair. Josh is unbalanced from the loss of his grandpa, so a vacation is what they all need. Back to Nilbog, the town folk are all vegans and scorn those who aren't (Josh's defense from them later in the movie is a \"double-decker bologna sandwich\".....) there's a fanatic preacher in the town, who along with the sheriff are their leader's. One afternoon Josh hears voices and wanders into a barn and see's the preacher yapping to a crowd about the sin's of eating meat, Josh is quickly discovered, he's briefly groped by a few people, then pop's walks in and saves him \"we were just giving him some ice cream\" is the preachers line.Later that day the town folk all unexpectedly gather at the home of the Wait's family \"to make up for the misunderstanding we had earlier today\" they bring all kinds of eat's, but nothing with meat in it, they play some terrible sounding folksy piano music, do their own brand of dancing..... and well it's a party, of sorts. Then Josh is lured outside by the ghost of grampa Seth once again, the preacher literally goes up in flames for some reason, the flames are quickly put out, what was once a man is now the charred remains of a goblin (still no trolls). As is the logic in this movie, the sheriff say's \"you killed him\", to Mr. Wait's even though he was the one who extinguished the fire; the collective mood of the town folk turns grim once again, they intend to kill the family somehow (all while remaining motionless), so a stand-off begins as the family runs back into the house. At one point the sheriff throws them a bag of poisoned sammiches, their logic, eat these it'll make it easier for you and you won't have to die violently. Oh god this is painful, cutting to the chase, the Wait's family survives their ordeal, partly because a little boy brandishes a double-decker bologna sammich.In this movie there's really two stories going on, the Wait's teenage daughter is followed to Nilbog by her effeminate boyfriend Elliot, in an RV who also brings along some friends. They park on the outskirts of Nilbog and soon one by one they die/or are romanced by this \"witch\" who is CONSTANTLY over-acting and is quite irritating. She has many magic potions that transform people into, plants, green gelatinous goo, or sometimes it just makes people lethargic and sweaty, it varies for each victim - again the logic of this movie....well there just isn't much of it. I guess you could say she's the goblin queen (still no trolls).Returning home the Wait's are safe at last, pops goes to the office, sis goes somewhere, leaving Josh and mom at home. However some noises soon catch Josh's attention, wandering downstairs, there's mom or what's left of her, surrounded by \"trolls\" who are eating her remains, or more rather just smearing green crap on the muzzles of their cheap masks.The so-called troll's in this miserable movie are nothing more than midgets wearing cheap masks (without a hint of pliability) and brown robes, with rope belts and their armed with crude looking spears and for the most part are ineffective at killing anyone. Their, literally, just tossed around a bit.For me it's a real chore to watch Troll 2 from beginning to end, I find that the film runs out of steam an hour in, the last 30 minutes are truly painful boring to watch.Ultimately Troll 2 is -easily- one of the worst movies of the 90's or from any time period.Coincidently, not a single cast member has/had much of an acting career. Not-a-one, hmmmmm.........",

It's got more quotable lines than any other film I've ever seen, Duck Soup included. An acquired taste, how much you like it will depend on how familiar you are with the stereotypical movies it resembles...barely resembles. Those who haven't seen too many horror movies usually just think it's badly made, with bad acting, bad effects, etc., and completely miss the surrealist heights it hits. Imagine taking your run-of-the-mill late nite cheapo horror flick and stripping it of any logic or pretense of plausibility, cast a bunch of the MOST unprofessional actors you can find, and rewrite the dialogue at the end of a bad acid trip. No wannabe cult hit, it was apparently made with the best intentions, and we all know what the devil does with those! The director's called it \"an unpretentious childrens' story,\" overlooking the obscenely cruel ending, which jars the relatively light-hearted mood of the first 92 minutes of the film. Not to be missed.",

I turned to look out of the corner of my eye, in the $1 bin lay this wonderful little beauty, one of the greatest horror/suspense/thrillers that one can ever hope to buy.Who would have thought that Claudio Fragasso's dream of cinema gold would be accomplished with Troll 2? The film is just an absolute wet dream for film lovers and critics all around, and it's no surprise with all the things it has to offer, but not limited to: quirky and clever lines, awesome special effects, a star-filled cast and crew, state of the art equipment and cinematography, and the perfect plot, what more could anyone ask for? The cast and their execution of the lines is absolutely curtains. Michael Stephenson as the lovable Joshua Waits gives one of his best performances, especially with the scene peeing on the food, that is just what this film needed!! George Hardy also gives one of his best performances, and I tell you, \"You can't p*ss on hospitality, I won't allow it!\" My family is always in silence from his performance, it's almost like he God commanding us from heaven. Finally the great Robert Ormsby, who plays Grandpa Seth. He steals the screen as the dead grandfather, whom Joshua talks to. His performance needs to be reviewed by screenplay writers and actors from all over, this is textbook acting. I would love to list the rest of this brilliant cast, but there are too many great things about their performance that would take too many pages.This film is probably one of the most perfect films I have had the pleasure to watch. It ranks better among many other classics of horror, such as Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and even Saw. This film has everything in those films, and more! If you have not seen Troll 2 yet, forget all other movies, this is the must-see film of 2009!!!",

            "content": "Awkward and clumsy film about an American family who uproot from their \"city\" life in order to live in the country. As to exactly why they do this is never really made that clear, (I doubt anyone cares anyway). Anywhow, after some painful drawn-out scenes, including a disturbing dialog exchange between Mom and Dad, the family eventually set off for their new home - a town called \"Nilbog\".Like a teen-novel, we see things from the youngest kid's unheard and somewhat ignored point-of-view. His performance is as good as it was ever going to be, but nevertheless it is very trying and more than occasionally annoying. Being the only member of the family with the ability to see his grandfather's ghost, he is viewed as unbelievable and hysterical by his naive and idiotic family.The film forces us to wade through the messy plot and inexcusable deus ex machinas as they are lumped on to one another. By the end, the whole plot has become unglued, the characters unwelcome, and worst of all the good and evil voices of the film are watered-down - nothing is suspenseful, frightening or even remotely original, (again like a poor teen-novel).The worst crime this film commits is that it undermines it's own invention. The trolls of the title, I suppose, are the goblins in the film. They are never dangerous or threatening. In fact, their powers seem to weaken throughout the film (I suppose this was one lazy and easy way of giving the \"good-guys\" their strength). For example, towards the end of the film, there is a siege-type situation in the family are trapped in their own house, surrounded by the goblin/townspeople. Exactly why the townspeople (who vastly outnumber the family) don't just enter the house and kill them all is illogical, incredible and frustrating.Regular viewers should ignore this film, while C or D grade enthusiasts will only give mixed responses at best.",

The man by the name of Joe D'Amato, of Anal Perversions of Lolita fame, created this masterpiece that deserves a place alongside the great films of our time.The story involves a house exchange program in which a family from the country switches places with a family from the city. Although this occurs often without incident it seems this time something went wrong. It's a good thing that dead Grandpa Seth is around to help out when the sh*t hits the fan with that sage advice for which he's known. Joshua, our hero, tries to warn his family of the threat of attack by the goblins of Nilbog but the family pays no mind. When good old dead Grandpa Seth gives 9 year old Joshua a molotov cocktail to play around with the truth about the goblins becomes apparent. Needless to say that this film achieves a level of genius so far unmatched in the film industry. Joe D'Amato was working on a level in which few of us could hope to understand. But for those of us who believe in the true beauty of film, Troll 2 holds a special place in our heart. And as Grandpa Seth said, \"No I'm not in hell but I knew someone who was there once.\" Genius!",

We start with a suburban family that's \"trading houses\" with some country folks. Apparently this is their idea of a vacation. Could you imagine that, having some total strangers living in your house, going through your stuff, doing god-knows-what in your bathroom? Anyhow, they get to the town of \"Nilbog\" and...well, I would say strange things happen, but nothing quite so strange as how bizarrely untalented these people are in the acting department. I mean, this is truly elementary-school stuff here. In fact, none of these people could get a lead role in an elementary school play. At one point the daughter is having a private conversation with her boyfriend, but she speaks all her lines as if trying to make sure that the people in the 10th row can hear everything she says. The father is just, well, out there. A person doing an intentional parody of bad acting couldn't hold a candle to this guy.Anyhow, they find goblins in this town, they turn people into some sort of salad, and then eat them. The daughter's boyfriend and his two bumbling semi-gay buddies come along (easy to see why she doesn't want him hanging around with them) to provide yet more comic relief. Eventually they manage to defeat the goblins (never mind that the name of the movie is Troll), by holding them at bay with a double-bologna sandwich.Back to the acting. This thing makes the cast of Slumber Party Massacre look like they deserve Emmy awards in comparison. It's just incomprehensible how bad these people are. The writing is beyond retarded. I mean, why not have these people driving through Nilbog when the car breaks down, instead of having them \"trading houses\"? Because that wouldn't have been retarded enough. I should mention that Mom asks the kids to sing her favorite song while they're driving to Nilbog, which is \"Row Row Row Your Boat\". And yes, they do the thing where everyone sings the verses starting at a slightly different time. Why do they do that? Is there any other song where people sing the verse, then two seconds later someone else starts singing, then two seconds later someone else does it? I mean, that is just SO annoying.The only good thing about this whole movie is that there's a short scene of the daughter working out in her sexy leotard. This is way at the beginning of the movie, so just turn it off once you get to that point.",

            "content": "The original Troll was a rubbish film, but nothing can prepare you for the true awfulness that is the \"sequel\", which has gained a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made, and rightly so. In fact, it is not a sequel at all, it was originally meant to be called Goblins, but it was marketed that way. Basically, Michael Waits (George Hardy) and his family travel to the rural farming community of Nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backwards) for a month-long home exchange vacation. Michael's son Joshua (Michael Paul Stephenson) is haunted by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Seth (Robert Ormsby), who warns him that there are goblins who want to mutate the family into vegetables and plants so that they can eat them. Meanwhile, Joshua's sister Holly (Connie Young) is visited by her boyfriend Elliot Cooper (Jason Wright). Holly accuses Elliot of being homosexual since he spends more time with his friends, but he promises to show his devotion by accompanying the family on vacation. Elliot fails to arrive on time, but the family catch up with him and his friends Arnold (Darren Ewing), Drew (Jason Steadman) and Brent (David McConnell) in an RV. Outside of Nilbog, Seth appears as a hitchhiker, who warns Joshua that Nilbog is the kingdom of the goblins, and that if his family eats anything while they are there, they will be mutated into plants. The family disbelieves Joshua's warnings and continue their journey. They arrive in Nilbog and meet their strange exchange family, the Presents. Joshua sets about destroying all of the food the family finds or acquires. Seth suggests causing a scene to stop them eating a feast prepared for them, so he urinates over it at the dinner table. Meanwhile, Arnold goes for a walk in the woods outside the town and encounters a girl (Michele Abrams) being chased by goblins. Arnold approaches them and insults them; they respond by throwing a spear into his chest. Arnold and the girl enter a chapel, where they encounter the goblins' queen, Druid Witch Creedence Leonore Gielgud (Deborah Reed), who uses the \"Stonehenge Magic Stone\" to give the goblins power. Creedence tricks them into drinking a magic potion that dissolves the girl into vegetable matter, Arnold witness the horrifying scene of the goblins devouring her, before screaming helplessly as he is mutated into a tree. The following morning, Michael and Joshua venture into town for food, but find the general store closed. Michael falls asleep on a bench, while Joshua enters the local church and eavesdrops on a goblin church sermon, all about the \"evils\" of eating meat. Joshua is eventually found; the parishioners capture him and attempt to force feed him poisonous ice cream, until Michael finds him, suspicious of the townspeople he takes him home. Meanwhile, Drew goes to get some food, Sheriff Gene Freak (Gary Carlston) picks him up and gives him a green hamburger, and at the local store, the owner (Don Packard) gives him poisonous milk. Feeling dizzy, he goes to the chapel and finds Arnold, who has mutated into a tree. Drew tries to drag him, but Creedence appears and knocks him out; she chainsaws Arnold into pieces and Drew is killed off-screen. Returning home, the Waits family find the townspeople have prepared them a surprise party to apologise for the events at the church. Joshua attempts to make contact with Seth, only for Creedence to appear in goblin form through the mirror. Seth's ghost appears to stop her attacking Joshua and chops her hand off with an axe. Creedence returns to her chapel, where she mutates herself into a beautiful woman in revealing clothes. She finds the RV, seduces Brent and drowns him in popcorn. Seth and Joshua try to cause a distraction, but the Priest captures them and recites a spell which banishes Seth's soul to Hell. However, before he vanishes, Seth summons a bolt of lightning from the sky, which causes the Priest to burst into flames in a fiery explosion, killing him. When Michael extinguishes his burning corpse, his true goblin form is revealed, and the villagers turn on the Waits, revealing themselves all as goblins. The Waits and Elliot then retreat to the house, where the villagers surround them and hold them hostage. Joshua, Elliot, Holly, Michael and Diana (Margo Prey) hold a s\u00e9ance to bring Seth back from the dead, after returning he only has mintes to retain his physical form before he has to return to the afterlife. Seth gives Joshua a paper bag containing a \"secret weapon\" to use against the goblins. The creatures break into the house and transport Joshua to Creedence's chapel, where Joshua opens the bag, revealing a meat sandwich. He eats the sandwich, making his body poisonous to the goblins; he then touches the Stonehenge Stone, which destroys Creedence and all the goblins. The family returns home, and everything seems fine. But the family were unaware that the goblins had poisoned their food in the house exchange. Joshua walks in on a group of goblins eating his mother's transformed corpse on the kitchen counter. They offer him a bite, and Joshua screams in horror. Also starring Mike Hamill as Bells, Christina Reynolds as Cindy, Glenn Gerner as Peter, Lance C. Williams as Mr. Presents, Elli Case as Mrs. Presents, Gavin Reed as Presents Son, and Melissa Bridge as Presents Daughter. The producers decided to market this film as a sequel to Troll, as they worried it wouldn't succeed, of course, it doesn't make any difference, it just makes it all the more stupid. It is not actually a sequel, it has no relation to the original whatsoever, and has no trolls at all. The plot is absurd, the acting is terrible, especially the over-the-top strange looking Reed as the female villain, the puppetry and makeup effects are wasted and cheap looking, and the script is full of laughable dialogue (\"They're eating her, and then they're going to eat me! Oh my gooooood!\"). It may have a cult audience that embrace it being so bad it's good, for me, it was just an abysmal film that is a complete waste of time, a horrendous fantasy horror. Poor!",

Don't even see out of curiosity what I'm talking about, you'll either cry or die of laughter.Whatever the case, I sure hope the producers didn't take the end seriously.But credit where credit is do. It was a great film until the end.6 out of 10\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------",

Well let me tell you, Hobgoblins is to Troll 2 what Gone with the Wind is to Heaven's Gate.Let me sum it up : Troll 2 has no trolls, it has Goblins. There are no actors, only people trying to act. And their attempts are beyond the pathetic. The kid on the box isn't even the same actor as in the movie !!However, there are some scenes that are soooo bad, they actually make you laugh. One of these is Joshua, a 9 year old boy, the \"hero\" of the movie, who takes a leak on diner in order to avoid the family eating the Goblin prepared food, that would turn them all into green jelly (does this make any sense ??). Anyways, thats not the funny part cause u dont see him actually doing it....The funny scene is when his dad punishes him : get this, he actually tells him \"I'm tightening my belt by one loop so i don't feel hunger pains, and your sister and mother will have to do the same\". Is this a script or what ???? How dumb does one have to be in order to write such KRAP ??I actually bought this movie in order to show it to all my m8.

            "content": "This agreeably idiotic movie, which really doesn't have anything to do with John Carl Buechler's \"Troll\", still has enough W.T.F. moments, lousy acting, insane writing, and memorable lines (\"You can't pi** on hospitality! I won't allow it!\") to make it fun viewing for folks who appreciate crummy B cinema. However, this viewer has to admit that for him the film failed to quite live up to the reputation it's developed; he really didn't laugh *that* much. The story concerns a family that for whatever ridiculous reason swaps residences with a farming family in a not-that-far-away small town named Nilbog. (It's not a real brain twister to figure out the meaning of that name, but that is part of the clunky charm of this thing.) The young son, Joshua (Michael Stephenson) is seeing the spirit of his deceased grandpa Seth (Robert Ormsby), which will turn out to be important in his family's later fight against the multitude of goblins (yeah, this movie is about goblins rather than trolls) inhabiting this fair town. There is a certain enjoyment in seeing amateur actors not only stumble their way through the story, but in actually taking themselves seriously, which in itself is an impressive enough achievement. The tacky special effects are endearing, as are some of the characters. The highlight scene is one with which many of us are now familiar: the not-to-be-forgotten \"Then they're gonna eat me!\" scene. Of course, who could expect any film of this ilk to be actually seeming to promote a message about the wonders of going vegan? Yeah, that's in here, too! And, as has been mentioned, \"Troll 2\" does espouse the belief that hospitality is not to be taken for granted. When watching this, one has to wonder if it was EVER meant to be taken seriously. It gets goofy almost right away and keeps being silly right up until its ending. It's exactly the kind of thing you watch with friends and beers.But not coffee. That's the devils' drink.Mind-boggling bit of trivia: exploitation goddess Laura Gemser is credited with doing the costumes!5/10",

The family's son, Joshua, will have to summon the spirit of recently departed grandfather, Seth, in order to combat the supernatural powers of the Goblins.With an American cast, it's certainly augmented by an Italian style, particularly the zoom-friendly camera-work and lighting, not to mention the laughable goblin face designs and emphasis on icky gore/make-up effects. An entire Italian film crew and an American cast, can you just imagine the disconnect and the culture clashes that must have occurred? Grasping at straws, I just took the plot as the mad nightmarish fantasies of a child who has lost his grandfather, concocting this fairy-tale(..with the grimmest of Grimm overtones)where he and Seth could save the day, rescuing their family from the vegetarian Nilborg goblins.It's reputation certainly caught my attention and Troll 2 is so positively bonkers I couldn't turn away. It's so indescribably bizarre, Troll 2 held my interest, despite the fact that I was well aware of how dastardly awful it remains from start to finish. I simply couldn't stop watching it, scene after incomprehensibly strange scene would unfold and I would just stare at the screen dumb-struck. Green slime would fall down the faces of those humans who had the misfortune of drinking poisoned broth, tainted by the bad potion of the ghastly Goblin Queen. One poor soul is paralyzed, slowly turning into a tree. Another is overtaken by popcorn! I kid you not! You see one poor girl deteriorate into a mass of green goo! Once the human form turns into a green gelatinous blob, the goblins have a great feast! Michael Stephensen, as the kid hero, along with the rest of the cast, will cause plenty of belly laughs with their performances. Deborah Reed, as Creedence Leonore Gielgud, the Goblin Queen, is really made up into a grotesque witch, and she contorts her face into as hideous a visage as possible..and there's no restraint in her over-the-top performance, as she takes it over the cliff, into a thickety ravine, with plenty of broken bones and brain damage. Reed's performance reflects the nature of the film, she matches the heightened hysterics of a maddening story. Everything about the movie is off-the-deep-end, and Fragasso's Troll 2 has built a loyal following because of it's lunacy. I mean the way Papaw Seth and Stephenson's Joshua join forces, a ghost and his young grandson needing all the help he can get to save the family from a community of goblins in human clothing, it all lends itself to parody and mockery.Troll 2 must be seen. It's an example of the purest form of weird cinema. It should've been titled Goblins, though. I wondered just how the cast members must've felt while watching it once the film was completed, seeing their reaction as it played out on the screen.",

I've been advised that Troll 2 is, in fact, the \"Best Worst Movie.\" I'm here to tell you: I've seen worse.No, it wasn't about the \"expectations being so low due to all the reviews.\" I just watched it with an open mind, though I cringed at almost every minute \u2013 especially at Creedence (Reed) who probably made her high school drama teacher drop dead if that person saw this.Maybe it was just so well known and publicized that it garners so much attention. It's (far too) easy to ridicule \u2013 the town of NILBOG is goblin spelled backwards in addition to blatantly reiterating the truth throughout the movie these are goblins (and not what the title suggests.) Hell, Halloween III: Season of the Witch wasn't about Mikey Myers, but then again, aside from the future subtitles, it wasn't called \"Michael Myers.\"Perhaps it's just me that comes down harder on movies that are actually supposed to be of high quality that's more of a letdown. I have yet to see the documentary based on Troll 2 (though its #1 in my Netflix queue): Best Worst Movie, but I cannot simply imagine they set out to make a masterpiece.OK, sure, it was bad all around: laughable acting, dialogue, camera angles and shots and special effects that would make the Syfy channel directors droll. And those masks! One in particular was the worst, but since they don't wear name tags, I couldn't state which one I'm referring to.Is it sensible to give way the spoilers to the plot? Oh, why the hell not? Family + Dead Ghost Grandpappa head off to the town of GOBLIN (say it backwards!) where they're practically force fed green icing in order to decompose them enough so the vegetarian residents of Nilbog can eat them.Like all 1980s horror films (in fairness, this was released in 1990, but the three hours it took to film probably took place in 1989) it's up to the boy who cried green to save the day. Thankfully, he's got the most useless ghost since Ghost Dad to at least attempt to help him.I might write an addendum to this review following my viewing of Best Worst Movie because I'm curious to learn a little more about what they were thinking. For example, not five minutes in is the stereotypical homophobic remark but later on, the same guy, Elliott (Wright) had his arm wrapped around his \"buddy\" in bed with no clothes on. Also, why they thought they had to steal the \"not-so\" brand name of the original Troll in order to sell this.If you get a chance, like I did, watch this movie a second time using the Rifftrax commentary. I was rolling in laughter with what they came up with. That is, if you can tolerate one of the worst movies ever made a second time. (And yeah, you can. It's call alcohol, or the \"drug\" of your choice.)",

Well it's horrifyingly stupid. If I start thinking too much about it, I might have just started sweating out green sludge! What was the deal naming the film 'Troll 2', where it's goblins that appear\u0085 I guess that's one of life's many mysterious. At least the ending (while tacky) is unexpected.",

Good acting will not be allowed, even for those of you who can actually act. As to the script, turn your manuscripts upside down and read then backwards. A total of $7.35 will go towards costumes and special effects. Not a penny more. The most expensive item in making the movie was the damn motor home. If we had it to do over we should have used pup-tents, and saved the extra money to buy beer for the crew. Unfortunately, as it is, there isn't enough money to buy beer.All in all, it's a really horrible movie and I hope saying that hasn't violated the 'contain spoilers', clause, because horrible is the only thing good about it.",

It does have a surprising amount in common with the first film though as both concern mischievous shape -shifting creatures who enjoy turning humans into plants. Here though, their agenda is far more horrific since they only want to turn humans into plants to eat them since they are vegetarians (!) and yet, 'Troll 2' is never scary, frightening or unsettling in the least. A lot of the blame comes down to the wooden acting, with Connie Young turning in a particularly poor performance with very rehearsed line delivery as the protagonist's older sister. The dialogue in general is bland though and the costumes and makeup for the goblins are cheap-looking. There is admittedly something interesting about the plot regarding being a vegetarian and the possible benefits of eating meat, but this all gets a little mixed up amid such absurdities as the young boy's dead grandfather being able to pause time in order that he can urinate on the food that his family is about to eat (yes, that happens). The mythology at hand is quite hard to nut out too with grandfather coming back in visions, then in real life and then, who knows? More could be said, but in short, it is easy to see why this has become a cult hit among those who like to laugh at its sheer awfulness.",

The cameraman, much like the daughter in the film, was still smoking dope, the plot has more holes than a block of special Nilbog Swiss Cheese, the special-effects were nothing special, and all of the lines could be better delivered by a group of 12-year-olds with ADHD. Though it IS fun to watch.Let's start with the acting. Joshua: A young boy who is either emotionless or distraught. That's it. Those are the two things he conveys. His father is either emotionless or enraged. He's sitting in a chair while a town of people sings and dances and brings him food, and he looks like he could care less about the goings on. The mother is always emotionless. Always. Never upset, angry, or caring, just emotionless. Did the director tell her she was playing a statue? Was she trying to emulate the first 45 minutes of The Matrix? Or did she just get botox injections before each scene? If she did, it doesn't show. I'm not even critiquing the daughter. She doesn't deserve attention. EVER.On to the props. They dyed some food green and bought some cheap as free Halloween masks from a pharmacy. These were there costumes and special Nilbog food. And the kid who gets turned into a tree? Exactly which kind of tree is it that he got turned into? Is there such a thing as a tree with rubber bark? If there is, that's the one. As for the goblin's weapons, I'm more than certain they hired an amateur whittler to carve some tree branches into shivs. The most realistic weapon was thrown at a 85 degree angle into the air that hit home at the target's shoulder. It was cheesier than Cheese-O-Saurus Rex's diarrhea.Finally, the worst part of the film, the plot. It includes goblins who hate meat, and turn people into trees/piles of green syrup, a grandpa who is dead, an apparition, able to freeze time for 30 seconds, come back to life, and give his grandson a backpack with a double-decker bologna sandwich. Need I say more?Although this movie has to be the WORST made movie of all time, it is pretty fun to watch, so I gave it two stars.

Having nothing to do with the original Troll movie, both films seem to tread a thin line between if being Fantasy and Horror, and just doing a really bad job of it.

With help of the spirit of his late grandfather, Seth (Ormsby), Joshua tries to warn his family until they eventually believe him. I watched this on HBO as a kid. Everything about it is bad, but it's a bit amusing and like a Grimm fairytale on drugs. It also should've had a different title because it has nothing to do with \"Troll\" and has no trolls, only goblins. Reed is probably the only person in the film who is somewhat entertaining and yet a bit over the top with her Bela Lugosi/Eva Gabor accent and facial expressions.

Many people talk about this movie on the internet as if it's some kind of urban legend. Everything is true.But I have to thank this movie for making me laugh out hard with incredulity. I couldn't believe most of the behind the camera situations that were actually displayed! The acting is putrid, worse than amateurish. Have you noticed how the actors look awkward, like not knowing what's going on. For example, when everybody is dancing, singing, and clapping in order to convince the family to \"eat\". If you take a close look at the actors, none of them knows what to do next! Pay special attention to the drugstore owner.Maybe Fragasso (the director) tried to use symbolism in order to express his ideas. For example, the \"erotic\" scene between the crazy vegetarian freak woman and the guy in the trailer. What was the deal with the popcorn's exploding while they were making out?. Maybe the pop corns represent an orgasm while exploding? Maybe the Director wanted to give priority to the visuals instead of the story, like in most generic Italian movies. Heck, if Argento does it, why not him?. We don't learn about the connection between the dead grandpa and the boy, also what happens to the guy who has sexy with the freaky lady?, what's the deal with the Patrick Duffy look alike preacher?. What was the trick that \"a friend\" taught to grandpa?. Why is one of the trolls an obvious puppet?. Why would grandpa mistake the bedrooms and scare the hell out of the blonde girl?.The dialogs are beyond bad. When more than three scenes focus on discussing about a guy who has to pick between his girl and his friends, then you know something is wrong.What about the random and uncalled for moments?!. When the geek friend goes out of the trailer, finds a hot girl, and then tries to negotiate with the trolls... please, that was awful. Then the same geek delivers one of the most outrageous if not comedic moments of all time in cinema. You know, the \"oh my Gawwwwd\" moment.The \"sinister\" score was the same used in \"Dead Dudes in the House\". How's that strange? One last thing.

Troll 2!!! So this movie has a pretty impressive 'cult' fanbase as one of the best bad movies ever made, and while there are bad films I like better, I think this beauty more than lives up to its reputation with every frame. I enjoy it and find it good but not on the level of it being any kind of good motion picture, I just love how much it makes me laugh, because it's not just awful, it's hysterically awful! There's no question that it is indeed a terrible film in every aspect, the effects, the music, the camerawork and most of all the acting, but it's so entertaining because of that, because of how much of a colossal failure it is at a serious attempt at cinema and to watch this movie is to enter a bizarre fantasy land that feels like it can go off in any random direction at any given moment, but it can be such a fun blast if you're in just the right frame of mind for it, whether that may require you to drink or smoke a little something first who can say! The original Troll I have a special place for and enjoy on a genuine level, like a movie. It's witty, it's goofy, it's fun and it's even a little creepy, so why did this 'movie' have to associate itself instead of sticking to its guns and daring to be its own thing? Obviously because somebody took one look at what an astonishing sh*theap it was and realised that it would never attract any attention or stand on its own, and so they decided to just leach off the good name of a far better horror picture! It's so weirdly structured and so much stuff in it doesn't even remotely make sense, like how the grandpa can randomly become corporeal enough to hand out Molotov cocktails to his grandson or use the Force to battle sinister goblin reverends, or of course stop time itself so that ugly children may p*ss on hospitality! The dialogue is so stilted and unnatural sounding, like it's bad rehearsals for a community stage play, with the worst offender for me being the freakshow of a mother who always looks so astonished and strange, like a deer caught in the headlights. She really looked out of her mind, you can see the insanity in that woman's eyes, she clearly was not quite all there! I did like the rather strapping father, he was at least a little gung-ho about his silly thankless little role, and speaking of enthusiastic, I love Deborah Reed as the goblin queen witchy-woman, because she seemed like the only cast member to be fully aware of what kind of film she was acting in and just went completely nuts with it, her manic expressions and thunderous theatricality are a real highlight and have to be seen to be believed! The director was a deluded old stubborn fool for not acknowledging and embracing his movie's legendary rottenness! So ridiculous but so funny, if you don't get the so-bad-it's-good thing than you'll definitely just hate it, and you'd be in your right to, but just roll with it and try to have fun and enjoy the offbeat freaky ride, and do remember to eat ya veggies!

Probably due to the film's reputation of one of the worst movies ever made. And this reputation is justified. It's not often that I give movies the lowest possible rating of 1 out of 10, and i can usually find something positive even about the crappiest films, but \"Troll 2\" simply has no redeeming quality whatsoever, the film is utter garbage and hardly bearable to sit through. Also, this isn't one of the films that are so bad that they become funny and are therefore worth watching. This film simply becomes more annoying and unbearable with every minute, and even hardcore fans of awful cinema are well advised to avoid this stinker. The film doesn't even feature Trolls but only Goblins.A family consisting of an extremely annoying boy who talks to his dead grandfather, his irritating teenage sister, an idiot father and a mother who looks like she'd be typecast as a witch rather than a mom decide to travel to the countryside. They are followed by the girl's idiot boyfriend and his 'good for nothing' friends. The father thinks they are a bad influence on his daughter, although they look like a nerdy group of 'Dungeons and Dragons' players. Anyhow, the little boy is repeatedly warned about dangerous Goblins living around the little town. This little backwater is supposed to be the Goblin's kingdom... It's getting more and more awful with every minute. Every second of the movie I hoped that this pain in the ass of a family, as well as every other character in the movie would die as quickly as possible so this terrible thing would be over. Nonetheless \"Troll 2\" is unendurable 95 minutes long.The film makes every effort to destroy any possible tiny bit of tension that could have come up. In the very beginning, when the (dead) grandfather tells a story about goblins, in which a guy meets a woman, the boy comes up with the line \"I bet it was a goblin in disguise\", which is exactly what happens next. Also, the 'goblins' like to turn humans into vegetables in order to feed on them. On the other hand these goblins are hardcore vegetarians, who are so afraid of meat, that they can be defeated by throwing a sandwich at them.Even if you're a hardcore fan of bad cinema, and even if you're curios whether this really is as bad as they say, I seriously recommend to avoid this at all costs! It really is as bad as they say, or, more precisely one of the most awful stinkers ever made! Unbelievably terrible pile of garbage! 1/10 because there is no 0.",

I'll start with the plot. It's about a stupid family going to the stupid town of \"Nilbog\" and meeting trolls and witches there. Not only that, but the little boy sees his dead grandpa's ghost. Sounds good?...Read on. I'll start my negatives on the acting. This has some of the worst acting I've ever experienced. Every line said has no emotion whatsoever, and it's as though they got these people off the street. The best actor was the little boy who is one of the worst child actors I've ever experienced.Now onto the effects. They were some of the worst I've ever seen. I guess this was on a $5 dollar budget or something. The trolls were all midgets in fat little suits with really lame looking troll costume heads. In a particularly brainless scene, a girl turned into a witch comes onto a boy and they have an ear of corn in each other's mouth and popcorn starts coming at them(???) They were about as scary as something from an Ed Wood movie!The direction was all over the place. The camera-work was awful and shaky and I just hated it! The writing was just as bad as the acting, and this was one of the weirdest, stupidest things ever. I guess there were trolls, and witches and the witches turns people into trees or something(?) It was awful, don't see it unless you want to make fun of it, which is why I own this film. It is really hilarious, and would have been better off being released as a comedy. The worst line has to be, \"Grampa Seth is still with us in our hearts, but we must banish him from our minds.\"PG-13 for lame green blood. 93 mins. 0/100.",

It's not the worst, but not good either.The actors are pretty bad, as are effects, continuity, production values, etc.But the worst part of the whole movie is the dialogue... well maybe it's the acting, but the dialogue makes it fail, or win depending on how you look at it.This was a movie written by an Italian, and directed by an Italian, who spoke almost no English, yet they wrote the English dialogue! The characters said things in a way no normal American would. There was no English speaking director to realize they were saying things the wrong way.There was no possible way this movie was going to be good. It turns out to be one of those movies that you'd pass over if you saw it on TV.It's only when you've been told \"It's the worst movie EVER\" that you take the time to watch it. It's pretty good as a Good BAD movie, but but no means is it the \"BEST WORST MOVIE\" as so many claim. It's really not much different that so many other direct to video 80's films.This movie is great when watched with friends after repeated viewings... which makes it NOT the worst movie of all time.",

This film has Goblins, rather than Trolls, disguised as normal human beings. The goblins feed on part plant, part animal food. In order to obtain this food they need a human victim. They feed him food which is doctored by their queen and which converts the victim into the food they need. The Goblins eat their victim WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE!!!WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED? Honestly people, this is a gem of a horror film.The principles of good film making are adhered to. 1. The plot is intriguing. 2. There is good gore and make-up effects. 3. Sound-effects and background music are adequate to film. 4. The film IS SCARY AS HELL!!! 5. NO HAPPY ENDING. The hero is probably eaten or killed at the end, WE MAY NEVER KNOW.What more do you want out of a horror film?Brief Plot: For the summer vacation, the Waits family has decided to vacation in the town of Nilbog, a remote farming community, where they will swap houses with one of the local residents and spend the summer living off of the land. The night before the family is set to leave, young Joshua Waits (Michael Stephenson) is contacted by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Seth (Robert Ormsby), who warns him about monsters known as goblins\u2014malicious vegans who turn people into human/plant hybrids in order to eat them...When they reach Nilbog he Waits family discovers that the residents have left a large, all-vegetable meal for them. Seth helps Joshua by freezing time and warning him that the food is actually a potion that will turn them into vegetable people.Eventually Joshua will face the true terror of Nilbog and attempt to stop it once and for all!Verdict: Must have for all horror buffs.

            "review_title": "Not so much a film as it is an experience",
            "content": "One of the best worst films ever made, this is not so such a film as it is an experience. It is not as outrageously fun as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and \"The Room\" as it isn't quite as bizarre as those films but it's pretty damn close. I understand that neither Claudio Fragasso nor Rossella Drudi, who were responsible for the screenplay, spoke great English at the time that the film was made. That...would explain a lot. Maybe if they had written it in their native Italian and had had someone - hopefully someone qualified! - translate it into English, the dialogue would make more much sense. As it stands, the vast majority of it is pretty atrocious but hilariously so. That said, better dialogue would have done little to improve the insanely stupid plot. Fragasso's direction is not as bad but it is still very bad. This is particularly apparent during tracking shots when the camera almost always shakes slightly. If he was going for the shaky cam effect, there were no other indications of it in the film! It lasts for 93 minutes which I think is about 15 minutes too long as it tends to drag towards the end. As is well known, the film has nothing to do with \"Troll\" and does not feature any trolls nor is the word even mentioned. Other than that, however, the title was perfectly chosen. The film stars Michael Stephenson as Joshua Waits, a young boy who is regularly visited by the ghost of his late grandfather Seth who warns him that goblins plan to turn the family into plants and consume. The goblins are vegetarians so they're particularly conscientious movie monsters so we have to give them credit on that score at least. As part of a house exchange holiday (which actually isn't a bad setup for a horror film), the Waits family are going to spend a month in a charming little hamlet called Nilbog with a population of only 26 people. As is helpfully pointed out to us by Joshua a mere 45 minutes into the film, \"Nilbog\" is \"Goblin\" spelled backwards. Amazingly, this little nugget of information did not pass me by until that point. Joshua's father Michael is played by a dentist named George Hardy. He has all the on screen charisma of Cary Grant, if he had been a dentist. There is hardly a line delivered by anyone in a remotely natural sounding manner but the award for the worst performance is a tie between Connie McFarland as Holly Waits and Deborah Reed as Creedence Leonore Gielgud (no relation to Sir John, presumably), both of whom are wonderfully awful in completely different ways so, hey, at least there's variety. Reed's overacting in particular is a joy to behold. My favourite bit is certainly the (in)famous urinating on hospitality scene and that is also the best line in the entire film. However, I did find it educational as before I saw this film for the first time, I thought that it was indeed possible to relieve myself on concepts such as hospitality, kindness and generosity. Thankfully, this managed to set me straight. The popcorn sex scene was...odd. It's something that I've never been able to forget. Try as I might. Another great moment is when Michael says, \"Are you still smoking dope, Holly?\" in a tone which suggests that he takes it about as seriously as her not using a coaster on the table. I also love Holly's interaction with Elliot Cooper, played by future bestselling author - no, really - Jason Wright. Well, I say \"interaction\" but it mostly consists of her insinuating that he is gay because he has three good male friends - none of whom are the sharpest tools in the shed, bless 'em - and assaulting him. I assume that it is the fact that she is incapable of saying anything like a real person that attracts him to her.Overall, this is a gloriously bad film which manages to fail admirably on every level. It was a great disaster for all concerned. If it were possible on IMDb, I would have given it 0/10 for quality. 9/10 for enjoyment factor though!",

I could look past a phony accent, but these people seemed to have been beamed down from some planet where language itself simply does not exist. The result is a bona fide suck-fest of a film that I, a man with a wide sense of humor, have trouble comprehending. Just what exactly was this movie?

The first time I saw it, I simply sat there with my mouth agape at the incomprehensible dialogue, the pathetic acting, the grade-school costuming.  However, I may advise you that it does get better with multiple viewings, as you start to see more of the subtle nuances of the badness.  For instance, in most other movies I can single out one or a few actors who are not good.  In this movie, the best actors are the extras.  From the hideous mugging of Joshua, to the bizarre lines of Sheriff Gene Freak, no one comes out unscathed.  Especially bad are the mom, who shouts all her lines in a grating monotone, and her daughter, who dances for no reason and has a love/hate relationship with her quasi-homosexual boyfriend.  As in, she loves him in one scene, and hates him...in the same scene.  But then, I haven't gotten into the goblins.Yes, Troll 2 has no trolls at all.  These are goblins (\"spiteful, and impudent\", the 'wise' Grandpa Seth explains), also known as squat burlap-sack-clad midgets with Wal-Mart $2.95 Halloween masks and work gloves.  Of course they don human disguises for most of the movie, because this is easier to film.  They are led by Deborah Reed as Creedence, who rivals Jon Voight of Anaconda and John Steiner of Sinbad of the Seven Seas for my hilarious overacting award.  They are vegetarians who listen to intricate sermons on the evils of meat-by-products, while still loving to eat people, just so long as they're \"purified\" by dry-ice concoctions or green-toothpasted food.  Which, by the way, none of the family finds strange in the slightest.  Green corn-on-the-cob?  Sure, eat it every day.  No problem.I won't spoil the magnificent ending for you here (though many have already) except to say it nullifies the entire struggle against the goblins up to that point.  Which I suppose is indicative of this entire movie.  It's pointless to the nth degree, but I love it.  If you like bad movies, you will too.  Heed the advice of Grandpa Seth.  They can.

The actors might as well be puppets they're so wooden!\" Usually you take such comments with a grain of salt since most of the time said critics are glorified message board trolls (no pun) seeking the delusional power from making fun of a movie. In this case, they're completely right. The goblins do look like fat kids in Halloween masks, and the actors might as well be puppets (that goes quadruple for the actress who plays Diana Waits).Remember, this is a movie where the ultimate weapon that slays the evil vegetarian goblins is a double-decker baloney sandwich. I think it's safe to say these people were trying (way too hard) to make the acting ridiculously wooden. Most of the time you can hear the punctuation in their dialogue. Who talks like that? In simple sentences with elongated pauses between each sentence? One sentence at a time? There's no life or anything remotely natural about this delivery.Diana, the mom, stares with eyes wide all the time, giving her family menacing looks as though hinting that she has something to do with the goblins (even though she does not.) Oh, sorry, the word \"hint\" implies that she's subtle. The mom might as well be wearing a sandwich sign that says, \"I have something to do with the Goblins!\" I mean, the dolls in the later Child's Play films are light years more articulate, more subtle, and more believable than this actress.Each of the cast has their own unique (read: irritating) quirk. And in their mighty efforts to make fun of bad acting, most of these people forgot that they were also trying to be funny in a cheesy B-horror way. The result? Oh my God is it painful. The beginning of the movie attempts to establish the characters before sending them on the road to trade homes with the family from Hills Have Eyes (don't ask), and so we get to endure 10 or 20 minutes of this pain nonstop before any kind of relief.When they started singing \"Row, row, row your boat\" in the car, an epiphany struck me: Troll 2 was an attempt to take over the world. It would inspire mass hara kiri from those watching its virtually unprecedented awful qualities, leaving the powers behind the film with no opposition for global control. It was difficult, but I resisted the urge and survived to write about it.The film contains exactly three jokes that work (as in the audience laughs with the film), but by that point the audience doesn't even notice \u0096 they're busy laughing and/or cringing at the mountain of stuff that fails. The most notable of Troll 2's successes is the character of Creedence, the psychotic druid (the first two times she appears \u0096 after that the punchline gets old). Creedence is played Troma style and, honestly, should not be one of the films successes; however, juxtapose to the rest of the lifeless cast anything with a hint of heartbeat is a success.The art of Troma style acting involves answering the question, \"How ridiculously far over the top can you possibly go?\" Under the Troma school of acting, a character can't ask a question without perpetual eyebrow movement and overly animated facial expressions. Creedence would be the perfect match for Ace Ventura, the pet detective.Like I said, Creedence shouldn't be as entertaining as she is, but after watching zombies trying to walk around and act for 20 minutes \u0085 a total flake is a nice change of scenery.All in all, Troll 2 sets rock bottom expectations for itself, then grabs a shovel and starts digging so it can sink even lower.",

Troll is about a Troll(Obvioulsly) trying to turn an apartment complex into his world while a boy named HarryPotter (This was made before the Harry Potter novel so their not stealing the name) suspects something.But now Troll 2, besides the name this film has no connection with the first film. the film is basically about a boy named Joshua who keeps seeing the ghost of his Grandfather Seth who warns him about the Goblins (Not Troll's) and if anyone eats their food their skin becomes plant matter and are eaten by the Goblins, while his told about them his parents have booked a holiday in a remote town called Nilbog (Goblin spelt the other way) Meanwhile their daughter Holly is in her room working out when her Boyfriend sneaks into her room, and it seems her father hates him and would chop his balls off and eat them. Since Holly doesn't like him spending any time with friends and only be around her.The family soon arrive at Nilbog and are given a feast of food with green and blue clay on top, so instead of wondering why Joshua's family decide to eat it when his Grandpa Seth stops time and tells him to do something so thinking quick Joshua pisses on all the food.While in the mobile home Holly's boyfriend and his mates are also enjoying a stay at Nilbog after he told them that the town is full of young women looking for men. so Arnold decides to go out for a walk and sees a young woman running through so he follows her only to find that Goblins are right behind them.The two go off into a church to find that the Queen of the Goblins lives there and after the woman drinks from the streaming cup she becomes the a plant like woman and eaten by the Goblins while Arnold becomes a half man half tree.Soon one of the others decides to go out for supplies and runs into Sheriff Gean Freak (Nice name) and offers him a lift, during the drive the Sheriff offers him a sandwich with a green meat inside it and the guy eats it with no questions asked why it's green.of course the family soon discover that the town people are Goblins are the only way to kill them is to touch the magic stone but when Grandpa Seth takes Joshua there he fends the Goblins with a baloney sandwich, him and his family touch the magic stone and kills the Goblins.Joshua, his family and Holly's boyfriend go home and while the father goes to work and the two teenagers decide to go out Josh and his mom go in their house. it's not long before Joshua goes into the bathroom and find green mush in the shower so he runs into the kitchen to find the Goblins eating her Mother with the Goblin's line \"Want some, Joshua?\" Troll 2 is a enjoyable movie if you're into low budget horror films.

Overall this is definitely the worst acting i have ever seen, i did not think i would find worse actors than Schwarzenegger in his debut as Hercules in \"Hercules in New York\" but this movie proved me wrong. I could understand Arnie, he had no idea about the language he was babbling........but these people......oh boy! My rating for the acting job = *FART* Special effects. Oh dear god! The goblins looked like they were made from feces, their faces looked fake and stupid. Special effects job seems to be done by some blind retarded teenager.Music, it seems to be done by the same sound-engine found on the very first Pong console.....bleeping and stupid sounds without any relevance to what is going on.The script? Jesus Christ! Who in their right mind wrote this? Or who in their right mind approved this to be aired?! I am 100% sure if i would throw some corns on my PC keyboard and let a chicken peck on it i would create something a million times better than this awful fiasco.

Off how, you ask? Kind of peculiar? A bit bizarre? A mind-blowingly awkward sin against common sense? Yeah, that's the one. Troll 2 isn't just another bad movie with bad acting, and zero atmosphere, there's something else going on here. Anyway, Kid is being told a bedtime story, about goblins, by dead-Grandpa, come to think of it, that's what Troll 2 is all about... yeah!! Goblins!! Dead-Grandpa disappears when other family members show up, possibly because kid's acting is the only one he can stand, really, the other family members are really something special. Speaking of Goblins, they've tricked kid's family into temporarily trading houses with another family from a town called Nilbog. Well, nuts to that, kid says. Unfortunately, the family is quite keen on the idea, so it's off to Nilbog to hopefully, not be eaten by Goblins... yeah, Goblins!! And what about Troll 1, you ask? Well, what about it? I haven't seen it, I don't watch much mainstream. This practical joke on celluloid has nothing to do with it, whatever it is, they just picked a money-making title at random. In all my years of searching,Troll 2 is only the third worst movie I've come across. If you care, or don't believe me, or are just insane, check out Zombie '90 (#2) and The Chooper (#1) for experiences still not as strange as this one, but worse, nonetheless. Ultimately, I walked away from this one with a smile. Bewildered to hell and back, but smiling, because when the complete and utter shock wore off, I came to realize, I not only witnessed something too strange for words, but also, something too hilarious for words (almost). If you're looking for a new level, as well as a new type of badness, then this garbage from another dimension might be for you. How would one rate Troll 2? How am I supposed to know? I don't even know what the hell I just watched, so let's just let this one be.There are rumors of a sequel entitled Troll 2: Part II... I repeat, Troll 2: Part II. and in case you were wondering, Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards. No, really!",

I have wanted to see this for quite some time and now I am just speechless. I honestly wanted to cry while watching this horrible, dreadful and obnoxious movie. If you can call it a movie that is. Its about a family played by very bad actors (Espically the teenage daughter who always laughs..) wanting to go for an vacation in Nilbog to escape the grandpas death. Along the ride comes the daughters \"boyfriend\" and his friends. Although they don't go in the same car since ht egirls is upset since her boyfriend liks to spend time with his friends. Controlling freak. Anyways the disturbed boy sees his dead grandpa in his head which tells him that its a baaad and evuuul place and that he must stop them. But of course the family doesn't listen because its a retarded movie. At Nilbog they meet the family they are meant to switch houses with. The family is typical redneck stereotypes and just stare at the family (and laughs, not because its in the script but because they are lousy actors) and pushes them away. Very awkward scene. Then the exchange family goes away and the redneck boy casts a ball to the retarded boy which says \"Eat before we eat you\". Well that isn't disturbing at all so of course the boy forgets to tell his parents. I mean who wouldn't if you are a mentally disturbed freakshow? In the house there is a feist prepared with a lot of green gooey stuff in everything but oh no the family thinks it looks YUMMY and decides to dig in. Now the disturbed child sees his grandpa in the door who tells him he must stop them from eating the food. He claps his hands and the family \"freezes\", although they sure blink, grin and shake a lot to be frozen. Boy pees on food to stop them. Hes such an hero. The dad takes him upstairs and hreatens him with a hunger strike and beating. This was in the 90s and still his dad threatens his child? weirdo. And from now on its goes waay downhill.

First off the plot was probably written by a 5 year old and a man who was on crack. At one point to defeat the monsters the kid pulls out a \"double decker bologna sandwich\" he throws it at the goblins which hurts them because meat is their weakness, that kind of idiocy sums up the movie.The story revolves around a boy named Joshua who has visions of his grandfather's ghost telling him about goblins. The kid's family meanwhile is switching houses with a family from a small town calledNilbog (Goblin backwards) of course this means that the townspeople are really goblins disguised as humans that they to get Joshua and his family to come to their town. the only way that the goblins will eat the humans is if the humans will eat a green substance that looks like cake that \"chlorophies\" humans, or turns them into a plant. The plot only gets worse from there, as the residents of Nilbog constantly try to get Joshua and his family to eat their food, while Joshua and his Grandpa's ghost try to stop them. Another big problem that I have with this movie is that it is called Troll 2, while the word troll is not used once in the entire movie. In fact it is about goblins. Maybe they should have called it Goblin, it might have made more sense that way. This is the worst acted movie that I have ever seen. The kid who is probably 7-8 yrs old is the best actor by far. It makes me wonder if the director spent all the film's budget on green icing (which there is a lot of) and was forced to make his own family do the acting.I think that my friends and I could have done better acting. The only reason that i give this film a 1 is because there is no .5 or 0. That said, if you want to watch a terrible movie and get a good laugh from it, this is for you. I laughed many times at the ridiculous plot twists, cheesy score, bad acting, and complete awfulness of this movie.

Unexpected hilarity. I like the part where the deceased Grandpa says 'I'll distract them with this' holding a fire extinguisher. I'm pretty sure the fact that he was dead and is now alive will be pretty distracting, hahaha.

The only rule you must keep in mind while watching is attempt at a movie is: DON'T ASK WHY.  If you are confused, just remember that the actors probably were too.The first thing you must accept is that the title of this movie is `Troll 2,' but there are no trolls mentioned anywhere, just goblins.  The ONLY connection I can make from the first film is that people do turn into green pods.  The next piece of garbage to swallow is the idea that the family is taking a vacation through an `exchange program' where they switch homes with someone in the country.  The star, a young boy named Josh, has the weight on his shoulders of not only being the hero, but also being the best actor as well.  His mother, who seems to only have one facial expression, forces Josh to sing her favorite song (Row, Row, Row Your Boat) during the car ride to Nilbog.  The father is an idiot, and the teen sister delivers her lines as if she had just read them before filming the scene and then there's Grandpa Seth, the family ghost who tries to help them.  Trailing the family van is the sister's boyfriend, Elliot, and his friends to look for `liberated Nilbog girls.'  In one of her best lines, Holly warns Elliot `If my father knew you were here he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them!' Thank God none of these people had much of a film career afterwards. The family arrives in the practically deserted and oh-so-clever titled town of Nilbog and meet with the family who they are exchanging homes with. Right away, Josh recognizes that something is wrong and his fears are confirmed when he receives a message from the goblins written on a baseball (???).  The family sits down to eat food that looks like it has been covered in mold as Grandpa Seth appears to tell Josh that the food will turn them into goblins food and he will stop time for 30 seconds for Josh to do something.  Torn, Josh stands on his chair crying `I must do it!' while unzipping his pants.  The angry father carries Josh upstairs to deliver one of his great lines `You can't p**s on hospitality - I won't allow it!' and tightens his belt a loop while challenging his young son to a hunger strike.Elliot's friends (who he sleeps naked with?) head out one by one looking for food, but don't realize that coffee is the devil's drink in Nilbog.  Arnold believes that there must be `a logical explanation for all of this,' but the only explanation I can think of is that the script was the result of a drug-induced hallucination.  Grandpa Seth can stop time, but just can't seem to find Josh's room in the house, the father falls asleep outside the general store while looking at a cookbook, and Josh overhears the townspeople complaining about the `smelly bladders' of humans.  When the family is confronted by the townspeople with more Nilbog food, one of Grandpa Seth's solutions is - of course - to give his young grandson a molotov cocktail!  And what about Elliot's friends? Forget about them, it is obvious that the director certainly has towards the end.Of course, the best part of this movie is the end, which is fairly anti-climatic, but hilarious.  Afterwards, the movie pretty much drops off without much explanation to an even more `shocking' ending.  Amazingly enough, the director made this 93 minute fiasco seem like an eternity, but don't let any of this deter you.  If you love watching bad flicks, don't hesitate to run out to your video store now searching for it.  The entertainment you receive from the interesting love scene with corn is worth the rental fee alone.  In my opinion this one belongs right up there next to `Manos.'",

It's a fail of such epic proportions I actually wished I had a time machine so I could go back to when this was made and run onto the set swinging a baseball bat yelling, \"Stop doing this! Go home!\"Words fail me, but let me just describe one scene. A woman dressed like Elvira shows up at an RV in the woods. The guy inside sees her approaching ... on TV. She's carrying an ear of corn. He steps out of the RV and she starts vamping it up, showing her garter belt, licking her lips, etc. The camera zooms in on her ample cleavage. She tucks the corn into her belt and they go inside. She shoves him down on a sofa and crouches over him, waving the corn. \"Aren't you hungry?\" she asks. \"I like popcorn,\" he says. She then puts the corn in her mouth and presses it against his mouth and says with a leer, \"Then let's ... heat it up!\" Immediately, buckets of popcorn are flying around the room.Everything about this movie screams cheap, stupid and amateur. Not a single line of dialogue rises above idiotic, the characters act by bugging their eyes out and the little trolls or goblins or whatever the hell they are can barely move inside their Teletubby costumes.

Grandpa Seth comes back from the dead to tell his grandson Joshua Waites a bedtime story about goblins, which is really lucky because Josh and his family are going to spend a vacation in the deceptively-named town of Nilbog, in some other family's house. Along the way they sing mom's favorite song \"Row Row Row Your Boat\" and Josh gets out to pee but ends up talking to a homeless man instead, who is Grandpa Seth in disguise. His family have no problem with this. They are also followed by Holly's boyfriend Elliott and his two mates, who sleep in the same bed without their shirts on.Grandpa Seth stops time so Joshua can pee on their food. Sadly that's all the food left for them and they didn't bring any, so dad and Josh have to go into town the next day to buy some. Joshua accidentally stumbles into a church where the goblins look like people and try to make him eat ice-cream. Elliott's mate is pursued by goblins but because they are NOT people-shaped they can't catch him so they throw a spear at him. He enters the house of Frankenfurter's understudy Creedence Leonore Gielgud, who turns him into a tree. The other friend gets sick off vitamin A enriched milk and stumbles into Creedence's house but he can't move the pot his friend is in so she drowns him in popcorn by eating a corn cob with him. Or something - I'm going by memory and I didn't concentrate hard enough while I was watching this.Meanwhile the townsfolk (in people suits again) stand and stare at the Waites menacingly until they barricade themselves into the house. They try coaxing them out again by throwing sandwiches on the porch in a threatening manner. Joshua takes charge by performing a s\u00e9ance (he must have done a few of them) which involves lighting every candle they could find. The goblins chase them into Creedence's house where a rock from Stonehenge has somehow materialized. I think I've skipped bits. Do you care? Grandpa Seth returns from the dead one last time to give Joshua a triple-decker bologna sandwich which makes the goblins scream in agony when they watch him eat it. The Waites family kill Creedence and the goblins by concentrating on Stonehenge with their hands. Elliott becomes part of the family just for being there. There's a surprise twist at the end, because nobody expects something random to happen at the end of THIS movie. Academy Award nominations, sadly, did not follow.",

The acting is so laughable you won't believe it, I saw that most of the actors weren't really actors at all and those that were real actors were uncredited for being A PRODUCTION Assistant FOR THIS CRAP! 4) DREADFULLY Hideous cinematography. It's constantly shaking and it gets SO annoying AND STOOPID, (a word to describe the entire film) 5) It's so gay, literally. The Grandpa's burning in hell and the older sisters' 'boyfriend' has homosexual friends that are into 'group bi-sex' 6) The music is...oh dear, it gives you the worst mood in the worst way Avoid this movie.

It struck me as less of a horror film and more of a bad episode of Goosebumps. Now, already not being a fan at all of that series, this movie has enough naive charm to oddly enough warrant more than one viewing. That being said, you should watch this film first, before the original Troll(and by now, I'm sure you've learned the two movies have nothing in common), if you have young kids, maybe 6 or 7 years old. Then, while your kids might be scared by a few goofy masks, you can laugh with your mate over the moronic dialogue.And, overall, it's the dialogue that makes this movie fail. There are other issues, such as poor actors and bad effects, but lots of movies have that against them. According to the film trivia(and if you merely look at the names of the film crew), almost the entire crew was Italian, whereas the actors are American, so besides the language barrier, the director demanded the script be read verbatim. And whoever wrote this script must have been about 17. I think this movie could have easily garnered a 4 out of 10 from me if the dialogue was a little more realistic, even if the delivery was still just as silly.The oddball plot involves a young boy who has visions of his grandfather, Seth, who died six months prior to the start of the story. His parents repeatedly tell him that there is no way he could possibly see Seth and to drop the issue. Seth constantly warns the boy, Joshua, about being on guard against goblins(Goblins is the original title of the film and certainly more appropriate--there are no trolls at all, if you care). In a strange turn of events, Joshua's family is supposed to \"trade homes\" with a farming family from a town called Nilbog. However, after arriving in Nilbog and meeting this other family, we quickly learn that not only is this other family a goblin clan, but the entire small town is goblin-kin as well. And, as an important plot point, goblins don't eat meat--they use special foods to turn wayward travelers into gooey green plant material they can consume. Now, you've probably seen several of the \"best parts\" already online in small random video clips, but they are no less spectacular when viewed as intended. So, after the whole family realizes what's going on in Nilbog, and after Seth appears a few more times to help out, Joshua eventually helps his parents, sister, and sister's beau escape from Nilbog by using a baloney sandwich against the goblins. Yes, you heard that right.Hailing this as the worst movie ever does it a severe injustice, and it also shows you probably haven't seen very many really terrible movies. Most people don't seek these films out, they have the films thrust upon them by friends or relatives with a sick sense of humor. I think with the moderate success of the original Troll, lots of people were apt to see this one as well(a rather smart move on the part of the distributors). Troll is also a great children's fantasy/horror flick with cheesy, albeit acceptable acting(Blue Cheer, anyone?) and lots of special effects. By watching Troll 2 first with the kids, you set up for watching Troll maybe a year later. I think both films could potentially give your kids some scares, but Troll 2 will definitely leave you rolling. I'd rather watch it again than be forced to sit through some of the garbage Hollywood allows to be heavily promoted on TV and given theatrical releases with big name actors. I've seen lots of trash films, and 2 stars is a pretty low rating--I don't hand out low ratings like candy--but I still recommend it for the daring.",

Along the journey, his ghostly courageous Grandpa Seth (also my name!) saves him from getting eaten by the goblins. Yes, these goblins are vegetarians and they turn people into plants before they eat them. I swear to God that I'm NOT making this up. Everybody knows the \"Oh My God!!!!\" scene, even if you haven't seen the movie.What makes this movie work is how unintentionally funny it is throughout, which makes it so entertaining. The goblins are anything but scary and try to watch this as a disastrous comedy as opposed to watching a terrifying horror film.

I couldn't stop laughing for 2 hours at the terrible plot, acting, and everything else in this movie. First of all, the movie isn't even about trolls, its about goblins... The entire concept is just ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense at all. I feel like whoever came up with this idea had a stick shoved up his ass all the way to his brain or something. Something that made it so he couldn't think straight, because this movie was so bad, that it gave me cancer. I lost intelligence from watching this movie.However, you should watch it. Why? It is so bad that it actually happens to be the funniest movie ever created. You will laugh more at how terrible this movie than you have ever laughed at any other comedy movie. I can't even describe how bad it is, you just have to see it.",

I also discovered that what was inside the box, the movie, was the best film EVER.  If you ever want to see acting at its finest, acting that will make you re-examine your life, acting that will make you see the world for the first time, watch Grandpa Seth deliver words of advice from beyond the grave to little Joshua. It was delightful.  No, it was brilliant.  No, there is no word to describe its perfection, so I'm forced to make one up, and I will do so right now. This movie was scrumtrulecent.  This movie was a blinding, brilliant light from heaven.  Watching this movie is like staring into the face of god, and seeing him looking back and smiling, saying \"you are my most wonderous creation.\"  I am born anew in its genius.  So, go do yourself a favor and buy, or rent, the greatest movie ever made...by humans.",

Well, this movie strayed from the ordinary (the movie features goblins, instead), but I applaud that; it's not every year a movie as unique as this comes out.  Troll II contains some unforgettable scenes: the popular dinner table set piece, Grandpa Seth's lesson in fire-starting, the priests' sermon on meat, etc. Also, entertaining characters such as the child hero Joshua, his deceased-but-back-to-save-the-day Grandpa Seth, Creedence the local witch, the sexy Holly, the air-head Elliot and his boys, the generous Sheriff Gene Freak, Grandpa Seth's friend who used to live in Hell (whom, by the way, taught him a very useful trick), and of course the goblins themselves. \nThe films' use of foreshadowing is, also, very effective (eg, On the way to Nilbog Diane exclaims, with sandwich in hand, \"Speaking of hungry, WANT SOME ,JOSHUA?\".  Also, look for the big bowl of apples in the middle of the table during the dinner scene).The above may sound silly, but it's different and in every respect of the word:  FUN!  While being a clever spoof, the film also provides chills of it's own; younger viewers beware.So, if you're watching Troll II and find yourself saying \"I can't...I can't move(!), why?\", it's probably because you're having a good time.",

Having become a b movie fan earlier this year, I made it my goal to watch a majority of the \"bad\" films that exist. This not included garbage made today, I'm talking about 90's and earlier. Over the course of last year, I learned of the films from some people on a forum on another website. Claim it as the best/worst film ever made. They consider it to be the best bad movie of all time, even greater then the cult favorite Plan 9 from outer space.The basic plot of the film is that this family goes to another town for a vacation called Nilbog. The town is completely made up of religious vegetarians who love milk for some reason. It turns out that the entire town is made up of goblins hence the name Nilbog which is actually Goblin spelled backwards.The plot itself is just so bad. The actors and actresses are bland and are overacting at many parts of the film. The whole idea of how to beat the Goblins is just goofy in itself. The film itself has NOTHING to do with the previous film, so if you have seen the first film, and expect to see the 2nd film deal with more Trolls you would be disappointed.The film is bad, but there are worse films out there. Trust me I have seen some of the films that are worse than this and it makes Troll 2 look like a blockbuster hit.Overall if you enjoy b movies or bad movies, then this is your film.

Never before have I seen a film with acting so bad, that every line they speak makes me want to laugh at how atrocious it is. It's a b-movie, I get that. But I've seen other b-movies that are leagues better than this. And the goblins (no this film isn't about trolls this time) look like a bunch of kids in Halloween costumes with masks from Party City.While there's some very funny moments that are trying to be scary, there's some outright strange moments that are trying to be scary. For example, there's this one scene where this woman is transformed into this green slime. And my first thought was just \"What?\" That scene wasn't even really scary, it was just gross.This remains the best worst movie ever made.

Along the way we get to witness: a witch who seduces a young teen with an ear of corn, goblins eating green pudding, a ghostly grandfather who has power over time & space, people being turned into plants, etc, etc.Well worth the rental price (only if you like terrible movies).I gave it a 9 out of 10 stars.

This movie not only deserves the award for Worst Movie Of All Time but should also win the following awards: Worst Screenplay of All Time - Claudio Fargasso Worst Direction of All Time - Claudio Fargasso As the man most responsible for this stinker, he needs to be named twice. Such classic lines like \"You can't pi$$ on hospitality\" after Joshua pees on the food. \"Joshua is not a little $hit, he is just very sensitive\" from a loving mother about her son. \"Holly, are you smoking dope again?\" from father to daughter. And \"If my father discovers you here, he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them\" from girlfriend to boyfriend. And then there's the directing, for which he should be shot for the corncob scene alone.Worst Actress of All Time - Deborah Reed as Creedence Leonore Gielgud Worst Scary Actress of All Time - Deborah Reed as Creedence Leonore Gielgud Worst Sexy Actress of All Time - Deborah Reed as Creedence Leonore Gielgud Poor Deborah deserves 3 mentions. Her over the top acting as the druid witch is worse than any high school performance I have ever seen. And then her seduction scene with the corn cob is too bizarre for words.Worst Performance By A Mother Of All Time - Margo Prey as Diana Waits. \"Joshua is not a little $hit, he is just very sensitive\" says it all. Plus the look on her face in several scenes make first grade plays look like they are being performed by Katherine Hepburn.Worst Performance By A Father Of All Time - George Hardy as Michael Waits. \"You can't pi$$ on hospitality\" after Joshua pees on their dinner, followed soon by what looks like a belt whipping but instead turns into \"I'm tightening my belt loop by one notch. Your mother and sister will do likewise. I grew up in the depression and I can go hungry longer than you.\". Then there is \"Holly, are you smoking dope again?\" But most of all, his acting is worse than his dialog.Worst Performance By A Child of All Time - Michael Stephenson as Joshua Waits.

The plot, such as it is, revolves around Goblins, a suspicious town called Nilgob, Urine, Ectoplasm, the spirit of a deceased relative and Baloney Sandwichs. Just to add some randomness, surprisingly none of these elements bare any understandable or logical connection. The scriptwriter is clearly insane and hopefully has found some form of medication that will allow him to exist on the plain of reality as the rest of us.

The truth of the film is that the true bad ones are the men and not it appeals to me the goblin. In the end they gain the goblin and is right thus. To me it is a lot the sense and the way, a true philosophy of life dealt with lightness and great irony. perhaps is this the mystery that wraps the phenomenon of the film? \u0085 and goodness knows how many other esoteric mysteries are hidden in the symbols, the brand on the faces of the people of the nilbog are a four-leaf clover, the chlorophyll are the blood of the plants, the magic and the power of Stonehenge.

This is probably most evident in the dialog. The characters say things that make little to no sense. The also say things that make sense but are completely strange. This is has a very good comedic effect.Besides the poorly written dialog, the movie is pretty trashy and boring. There are a couple stand out appearances that are funny because of the actor or because of the acting. I'm referring to the shopkeeper and the daughter in the movie.The film is quite incoherent. The editing and flow is really terrible. This doesn't really carry a comedic effect like the other flaws, its just bad. The camera-work isn't too bad. Not sure why this gets complaints. I guess people just like to complain about every possible thing there is to complain about in a bad movie.",

Basically, this family goes to the town of Nilbog (Goblin, backwards) and are stalked by Trolls who want to eat them. In order to consume humans, the Trolls force people to eat a substance that turns them into a green, slime-like substance that the Trolls can digest. Sounds interesting, right? Well, I'm not entirely sure how a movie this atrocious can get made. The acting is worse than any elementary school play that I have ever seen, the Troll masks are literally rubber Halloween masks from Wal-Mart, and the dialog is so corny that Orville Reddenbacher would be proud. It's a good movie to have a drinking game with (everytime someone says I wish Grandpa Seth were here, drink. Every time someone looks directly into the camera, chug).

This masterpiece rescued a rainy cottage day as I watched it unfold with astonishment.  It fails so miserably, and so bizarrely, that it manages to rise above its form.  Right from the start, the movie takes us further and further into the land of ludicrous, with side trips into insaneville and \"what-the-f*&% is going on\" city.

The dinner scene, the scene where the kid realizes Nilbog is goblin backwards(which happens after his dad tells him that people in small towns go to bed early in the afternoon, then proceeds to fall asleep on a bench while reading a vegetable cookbook), the scene where the guy runs (literaly) into town to buy milk but ends up eating a green hamburger and turning into a puddle of goo, they are all brilliant.

At first glance a sub-Z-grade continuity abomination, this fine fine example of direct-to-video hysteria is a nonstop explosion of genius disguised as ineptitude. Grade-schooler Joshua is visited by the protective ghost of his Grandpa Seth, who warns him that his family's vacation destination of Nilbog (.) may be worth avoiding. But there's no changing dad's mind, and soon the whole family is knee-deep in black magic and nefarious villagers, including the remarkably abnormal `Sheriff Gene Freak'. Joshua and his dead grandpa are the only ones aware of their mortal danger, which Joshua at one point attempts to curb by urinating all over the dinner table. Not bad for PG-13. Worth noting is the fact that `trolls' aren't mentioned once in the film, while the threat of goblins remains all too real. Directed by `Drago Floyd', who was actually Claudio Fragasso, a low-rent auteur from the initial home video exploitation tidal wave of the late 1980s. Fragasso most importantly directed Alice Cooper in MONSTER DOG, but also made a significant mark by writing TERMINATOR II in 1989.

Few films can come close to Troll 2, especially within the realm of direction, acting, plot, and cinematography.  This wonderful motion picture combines the dark, surrealistic elements of grand guignol and infuses them perfectly with subtle camp.   The performances of the two young leads may be compared to that of Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in African Queen, yet never has a horror film seen such brilliantly realized characters.  I felt every minute of their fear and pain.  Never has such an amazing screenplay been committed to celluloid.  The reference to Nilbog, the mystical town hidden among the dark, ominous Utah canyons, symbolizes the shroud of mystery lingering over West Germany just before the Berlin Wall fell.  -SPOILER ALERT- And when it is revealed that Nilbog spelled backwards is \"goblin,\" -END SPOILERS- everything comes together perfectly and the plot unspools as devilishly as in another brilliant feature, The Usual Suspects.  I suppose few have seen this wonderful gem, as it suffered a fantastically limited release (1 theatre), but I suggest to go see it when they release the fifteenth anniversary edition nationwide in 2005.   One of the finest, most heartfelt motion pictures I have ever had the pleasure to view, Troll 2 is highly recommended.  Invite all of your friends over to screen this film in the comfort of your living room, and tell them I thought it was a masterpiece.",

Theory 1 - These \"actors\" happened to send their \"Win a Starring Roll in Troll 2\" cards back first.  Theory 2 - The Casting Director stumbled through K-mart in a drunken stupor slurring \"Who wants to be in a movie\"  Theory 3 - when the budget got tight, the Director was forced to employ his babysitter, his paperboy, his hairdresser and his cousin in starring roles.  Theory 4 - these people didn't even realize they were being taped.There is so much wrong with this filth its hard to know where to begin. Lets start with the ridiculous plot.  The family exchange program was just ludicrous.  How hurting was this family for a vacation that they would agree to such a ridiculous idea.  The food issue was also a bogus idea.  The family didn't eat for three days and didn't even seem to notice. They also didn't seem to care that all the food was bright green including the butter on the corn and rolls.  While we're on the subject of food, we should mention a scene that should've been left on the cutting room floor.  I'm speaking of the scene in which the witch seduces the teenage boy with none other than corn on the cob.  The scene proceeds to have minimum wage stage hand throwing handfuls of popcorn from behind the camera. \nNow the sister in the movie's acting deserves a paragraph all by itself.  It had to be the worst display of acting ever, a few choice words to describe her performance would be - horrible, lurid, loathsome, appalling, nausiating, awful.  I think she would've faired better in a high school play that was thrown together in a week.  We also found it utterly annoying how Joshua and his sister referred to each other as \"Big Sister\" and \"Little Brother\".  Who talks like this?  It's almost as if the screenwriter forgot to proof-read or the actors were just told to make up their lines as they went along.  Maybe the writers just worked on the script during the 4 days that this movie was being filmed.Finally the costumes looked like something you would pick-up the day before Halloween at Family Dollar when all the other costumes were gone.  To wrap things up there were a lot of things just unnecessary with this film.  The gruesome use and abuse of green food-coloring and sweat plagued this film. The ridiculous scenes involving a bologna sandwich and Joshua urinating on the food were just plain stupid.  Without giving away the ending we can honestly say it reeks.

My favorite line in the flick was her mondo-bizarro, \"My people come from...Stone-henge\". Bloody 'orrible reference that was, mate!

It didn't turn the guy into green, or any other color, slime. It didn't even harm him. Was she hoping for, \"Death by Orvillle Redenbacher\"?

            "content": "What can I say? This is the one of the best horrible horror movies EVER. One of my favorites next to Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 and Friday the 13th Part VII: Jason Takes Manhattan. So bad it's funny. There are absolutely no good actors in it, fake-looking costumes, dumb ideas, and an outrageously (and unintentionally) funny script. Who could forget the classic lines such as \"Do you see this writing? Do you know what it means? Hospitality! And you can't p**s on hospitality, I WON'T ALLOW IT!\" and \"They're eating her ... and then they're gonna eat me ... OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\" Right up there with SNDN2's \"Gar-bage day!\" The movie is about a kid named Joshua (Michael Stephenson) who is warned by the ghost of his Grandpa Seth (Robert Ormsby) about goblins whose favorite food is half-human, half-plant. Joshua's parents, Michael and Diana Waits (George Hardy and Margo Prey), go on a vacation with him and his sister Holly (Connie Young) to Nilbog, which is goblins' kingdom. While there, Joshua tries to stop his family from eating their food (it turns people into goblin food) and getting them out of the vegetarian monster infested backwoods town.Go see it. It's so bad, it's actually worth your time.1/10 (as a horror movie) 10/10 (as a comedy)",

However, if you get over the hump of popular opinions, you may discover that this film is classic horror at its finest. Never before have film makers captured so realistically the plights of a young man and the effects modern corporations and their agendas to control the masses.

Did patrons actually pay to see it in theaters? Is this when people started to bring guns to movies and shoot at the screen? If so, I certainly understand why. Skip it. Even if it's free.

Nevertheless it sees it to who, even if it does not understand nothing, laughs like a crazy one. Finally I have seen I and must say that, this film (perhaps too much intelligent for people of 1989, year in which has been realized) is not a horror, is a demential comedy, intentionally comic, like is made not to understand it. The family of the film is crazy, a likable and ingenuous, smiles and always calm father, a mother with obvious signs of madness or insanity, a small son who speaks and sees the ghost of the dead grandfather. the grandfather is distracted and very strange, arranges many troubles, remaining likable and ironic like the rest of the family. Perhaps the adolescent sister, ago strange dances and has problems with the sexuality of its boy, is gay?. The goblin \" writing\" like the vampire, the Bologna sandwich, used like l' Saint water in order to make to disappear the goblin-vampire. The mother, Queen-witch of the goblin, protect than them like sons, as mother nature protect the earth and the atmosphere of the annihilator man. The priest who ago dialog on the meat, saying a how much is toxic and how much is dangerous to eat it, a dialog from Oscar for thedemential in the country U.S.A., native land dell' hamburger. All this cannot be accidental, of involuntary, and dumb to think it, the situations in the film are too many behind other, therefore is obvious that they have been intentional thoughts and thus. They wanted makes us to laugh and to think on the things series and there are resolutions in brilliant way. This film is a perfect fable for the children of all the world even if some scenes, make fear, like the transformation in plant of the child, in the dream in machine, but then quickly it is returned to laugh, with the ghost grandfather who, disguised from homeless, with trust in hand says, it to stop itself in order to speak with he. Brilliant. The film has cost least and it makes up and the customs make part of work-ands that today does not exist more. To see told with great irony, much comic, and performance from actors from dumb movie and a lot other anchor, thus much from not being able to be accidental. Who has made and written this film it is a true genius. Now understand the phenomenon. Perhaps some American persons are too much stupid in order to understand all this? But it makes you to see it your sons, a beautiful instructive fable on the life, the good and medical food, the sens of the dead, the love, the scared on diversity.",

            "content": "Apparently a lot of people I know saw this when they were little kids, as well as I did. As a child this movie frightened me; I over-looked the shoddy costumes and acting. Also as a child you see this movie from Joshua's point of view and experience the terror of the goblins create because of their group-entity, and their powers of shape-shifting.This film can't really be a child's horror movie in the tradition of \"Troll\"; as the movie runs-on the viewer looks through the eyes of teenagers and parents. However, teens and adults can't forgive the movie's acting, background music, dialog, costumes, and plot holes-- not to mention how this movie just makes up it's own logic as it goes along (Ex: Grandpa Seth being able to freeze time, yet he doesn't understand the layout of the house the Waites are staying in). What's an even greater indicator that this isn't just a child's horror film is the infamous pop-corn scene-- a Witch transforms herself into a vixen and seduces a teenage boy, whilst brandishing an ear of corn; which also goes back to my other point about how this movie makes up its own logic: the viewer sees that she is broadcast on television inside a teens RV, complete with hot jazz background music; she asserts from T.V. for the teen to come outside, as he does the audience cannot see a sound or camera crew. Simply put, she can broadcast her image off satellites, directly into a camper because she's \"magic\". This is also the very same reason why she and the teen are able to make the corn on the cob turn to popcorn by biting it! Other logic I find confusing is when Joshua and the family are to destroy the goblins by just touching this foam Stonehenge (which supposedly the goblins draw their power from) this is because Joshua as explains that \"only the power of goodness can destroy these monsters\". So I guess I'm supposed to assume this \"goodness\" can be manifested from human beings which can radiate \"goodness\" from the very pores of their hands? Okay, that just doesn't work. Maybe little kids would forgive that, I dunno who else.One of the major flaws in this film like other Joe D'Amato films, is that it doesn't know how to cater to a diverse audience. The positive side of this, is that people such as myself look back on viewing this movie, and remember how ridiculous it was, and decide to rent it fifteen-years later and die of laughter!",

Troll 2 is about some stupid kid and his ridiculous family that go to some dopey looking town with a population of 26 and they promptly get disemboweled by the local population... I WISH.What really happens is rather subject to one's state of mind when watching the film.When I watched it, it was painful to sit through. Of course, it left an indelible stain on my memory. Kinda like a cattle brand on my brain. These kinds of movies, once watched, will never leave you. They haunt you to your grave.Anyway, the story - good triumphs over evil, thanks to a baloney sandwich and a bunch of people touching a rock (?) That's right. Even writing it now it seems ridiculous, but imagine actually allowing this movie to get made? That's the difficult part to understand. Pornos have better production values, sets, actors and scripts, for that matter. The story was as ridiculous as any get and the lines are memorable for their poor execution and their utter lack of impact. Take this gem from the annoying Joshua: \"Nilbog! It's goblin spelled backwards! This is their kingdom!\" Like we didn't see that one coming you little so and so...I will give this movie a terrible rating, 1 out of 10, but I do suggest people watch movies like this. That way, we can start to really appreciate better movies, like Plan 9 from Outer Space. The reason I think it's so abysmal and so great can be summed up by the looks on Creedence's face as she's taunting her captives... Or the overacting by Joshua and the underacting by his mother. The movie is like a 5 car-pile up, you know it's bad, but you don't want to turn away, even if there are little bits and pieces of people strewn across the road, and the screams of the children trapped in the cars will haunt you to the day you die...Terrible.

I usually give movies a chance before I judge them, but the opening sequence killed it for me! Okay, here's what's going on. I'm going to save you the trouble of watching this film. In the opening sequence, the main character, Joshua is being told a story about goblins and how they like to eat people that are turned into plant things (what?) by his Grandpa Seth, who's obviously reading the script instead of a book. Then, the emotionless mother comes in and the grandpa's gone. Gasp, he's been dead for a while and the kid's insane! As the mom goes to comfort him, she says stuff like \"Banish him from your mind. His death has been hard on us, especially me, his daughter.\" That's nice. We kind of gathered that he was your dad, since his last name's Seth and yours is Waits. Stupid people. Anyway, the family's going away to a town called Nilbog (if you don't get what's going on, you're probably dense or illiterate) because of a family transfer thing or whatever. Anyway, the sister, who sounds like grade-A crap yells at her more than likely homosexual boyfriend about him being with his friends more than her.

It had many random scenes which made no sense, like the dance sequence which has nothing to do with anything. The corn seduction, which again has nothing to do with anything. All of these things made this movie so awesome to watch. You cannot help yourself to watch till the end. The most annoying thing was the magic Grandpa Seth who is like a fairy for little Joshua. Again another thing that doesn't make sense. \"Joshua, sing me that song I love\" Oh My God! This is some classic stuff. This movie tickles you in everyway possible, which you don't see much of anymore. This should be in the comedy section since it was made with the intention of being serious but turned out to be a huge comedy.

The movie is bad in that there are some really bad actors, there are super cheesy lines, and there are continuity and plot problems. The costumes and masks for the monsters are very poorly made and have fixed expressions, the events do not make sense in a 3rd of the movie, and the actors who try to sound scary or menacing look laughable. This is like something made by high school students who got their hands on good equipment and watched a bunch of decent horror movies.It is very easy to see the bad things about this movie because they are obvious but after having watched this film twice I see how there are actually very unusual good aspects in here. I think this film was purposefully made to appear like its a stupid cartoony kid tale but a horror movie in disguise. There are intentional and un-intentional dark humor jokes and there are some parts which are darn creepy. Also strangely there is a pretty decent soundtrack.I really can't tell if some of the jokes were intentional or not but seeing a kid who screams because he sees green goo and tree branches coming out of his body is funny and scary. Add to that a person who turns into some sort of green pie full of green paste who is eaten by the monsters. These things are funny. Or how about the creepy lady who comes to the unsuspecting family's house to offer them some cake when she makes a comment about Joshua's sister \"appetizing! HAHAHA\" and the mom goes \"WHAT!?\" A lot of that cheese is funny, trust me.On the horror side the creepy parts somewhat merge with the humor aspect of the movie. As ridiculous as it sounds but seeing someone be transformed into green good and then devoured by ugly monsters is darn creepy even if its a bad movie like Troll 2. The final scary/creepy kick comes in the very end of the movie so its worth watching till the end.Not all actors are bad in this film. I think the actor who plays the kid is a very good actor , he looked very genuine. The dad and the grandpa were also really good and interesting characters portrayed by decent actors.To me this is definitely a cult-classic, if you are interested in dark humor, bad movies, or like bad 80s horror movies you definitely must watch Troll 2.",

This must have been thought up of whilst under the influence of mind-destructing substances.Where shall I start? I'm not sure if this film could be any more corny if one of the goblins said \"you're about to watch a nice corn-fest movie\" and throw fake corn and mutate into one of corny effect goblin plants.The plot is the film's best ingredient, but even for that there's not very much to tell. A family, which includes a boy with the world's weirdest hallucinations, goes on vacation to Nilbog which is a Goblin-infested town, as do some guys, one of which can only date the daughter if he stops hanging around with his friends. Everyone in the town is trying to turn these people into plants by tempting them into eating food with green gunk on them (now if you found this green gunky stuff on a cob of corn, in a glass of water and then on every food you'd at least wonder the hell why) and drinking stale milk. O-KAAAY. What's more, despite the title, there ISN'T A SINGLE GODDAMN TROLL in the film! In fact, there is NO MENTION OF Trolls nor does it HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH Trolls. You're more likely to find one in around the corner.Instead of wandering if there's a hospital, how about the family-or I should say everyone in the film-asks if there's an acting school in Nilbog, because is this possibly the worst acting I've ever encountered along with the acting in Going Overboard. I rather much agree with Justin Michels' comment about the acting. Unsurprisingly, I researched the actors in this have appeared in only a few at most or no other films. That's really all I need to say about the \"acting\".One really strange part of the film that'll stick in my head for eternity is where of the teenagers is with the green-plant-mutating-paint woman in the trailer holding a cob of corn with her mouth seducing the guy, and the guy says \"I'd like popcorn\" or something like that and then suddenly a load of popcorn comes in at them because of the woman's spell. RRRRRRIIIIIIGGGGGGHHHHHHT\u0085\u0085 This film is extremely crap, corny, stupid, crap, and hardly makes sense.

A movie should have good special effects and costumes. They should have natural sounding dialogue. Good music that accents the atmosphere. More important than anything else though, a movie should entertain.\"Troll 2\" starts in an instant with Grandpa Seth reading young Joshua a story to bed. In his story, there are goblins who can change form to make themselves resemble humans. These goblins would trick humans into eating a green sap, which would turn them into vegetables, because the goblins are vegetarians, and their favorite food is human vegetables. Joshua and his family were prepared to go on vacation to the small town of Nilbog. When they arrive, Joshua quickly discovers that the residents of Nilbog are goblins in disguise. Unfortunately, nobody believes Joshua, so it's up to him to prevent his family from eating the food given to them by the locals.I think it goes without saying that the plot of this movie is ridiculous. The actors make Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin look like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. The special effects are breathtakingly cheesy. The goblin costumes are suitable, for those going trick or treating. The dialogue is about as natural as a person speaking his second language for the first time. Lastly, the music is shockingly upbeat, it sounds fine, but it completely offsets the creepy tone that the movie is trying to portray. This movie is very bad.Did this movie do anything right? Believe it or not there was one thing that was done well in this movie. The most important thing about a movie is that it entertains, and this movie is very entertaining. This movie attempted to be a creepy horror, but it became an amusing unintentional comedy. Every poorly acted moment is a burst of laughter. Every time I see those plastered on facial expressions of the goblins I laugh. I can forgive all other flaws with a movie as long as it's entertaining.This movie is truly the offspring of a bunch of bad elements that don't work being blended together into something that miraculously does work. People love to watch the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man wreak havoc on New York City. People also love to watch the poorly acted \"Scooby-Doo\" cartoon. When people watch old movies, they look for the wires that hold the UFO's up. People love to find imperfections, and are wired to love garbage. This is the perfect mesh of over the top ridiculum, combined with rancid acting, with corny special effects sprinkled on top. Everything offsets itself so perfectly, I wouldn't ask them to change it at all.I really did enjoy this film and it's many, many flaws. I actually would recommend this movie, not only to those who get a kick out of watching bad films, but also to those who love to laugh. This is a bad movie, but it's a guilty pleasure.

Words cannot convey this sense of foreboding I feel in the pit of my stomach.I guess I should give you some background as to what I'm rambling about.I purchased Troll/Troll 2 for the sole purpose of owning Troll. I had no idea what Troll 2 was or what it would eventually do to me. You see, I had seen Troll when I was around 5-7 years old and had relatively fond memories of it, so when I saw the DVD for sale I gleefully snatched it up.The strangest sensation overtook me then, a cross between dizziness and existential dread while razors danced in my stomach and my skin broke into a cold sweat. The feeling soon passed and I quickly tried to forget about the experience.Later that day I watched Troll expecting to relive a bit of my childhood. Well, the saying \"you can never go home\" held true for me. I found Troll to be an unforgettably, forgettable movie if that makes any sense. Completely disposable and not worth mentioning beyond this point.I watched Troll 2 the next day. My expectations were low, but I figured I might as well give the second movie a chance.My life would be infinitely better had I washed my hands of the whole affair and turned my attention towards other pursuits, or maybe not. Who's to say? Where would the world be if there had been no Bubonic Plague or if the members of the Beatles had never formed a band? My soul cries out for a \"what could have been\" but without the Plague mightn't the world be even more burdened by overpopulation, pollution and resource depletion? Would we have been able produce someone whose intellect would dwarf Einstein's? If the Beatles had never formed would some other band have been able to garner recognition left by the void of the Beatles or would they create what in hindsight would be considered puerile drivel?These are pointless questions that can never be answered. Time to get down to brass tacks.I cannot stop watching Troll 2. I have alienated friends and family members. I have become an outcast in my neighborhood and have been shunned by co-workers. What is worse, as each day passes, I find it harder to disassociate myself from this film. My waking thoughts are centered around it. My being has become enmeshed with its life force, and make no mistake...it is alive and it grows stronger with each viewing. There is no turning back. I have gotten to the point where I feel little remorse showing this film to others, addicting them, changing them, tailoring them so that they may spread the Gospel that is Troll 2. I'm slowly coming to the realization that this is not just weird gibberish that I'm spouting off. It's not cathartic and it does not ease my burden or put the last shreds of my guilty conscience to rest.Yes...YES! I have become drunk off the wine of revelation and I understand now. I finally SEE. I do not fear the outcome. I feel HER re-assuring hand on my shoulder. Watch Troll 2, such wondrous and provocative pleasures await you!",

            "content": "....When you think of it as a failed Seinfeld 'Halloween Special' episode with Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer dressed up in ugly potato sack bags and K-Mart $2.95 Halloween masks romping around some forest in North Carolina. But this film is something much worse and more sinister than that. That's right folks, this is the cream of the crop, the worst movie ever conceived by mortal man.The 'film' (can I even call it that?) begins with a Grampa horribly narrating a dull and pointless story, Princess Bride style to his ugly, whiny, and disturbed grandson, Jonathan. Peter Pan is venturing home from the woods when he gets lost and is chased by a mob of ravenous goblins (Yes, despite the film's title, this movie has droves and droves of goblins. There is NOT A SINGLE TROLL IN THIS FILM) set to a dodgy 1990 theme. This gets me on the vomit inducing soundtrack. It sounds as if an eight year old composed the music. Unfortuenatly, it also sounds as if that said poor eight year old was high off of something. Peter is then fed puke green slop by a supposed 'lovely princess of the wood' (although she looks like King Koopa, but I guess beauty is all in the eye of the beholder). He is then turned into a half man half plant creature. Apparently, the trolls, ooops, I meant goblins are vegetarians and will not eat any meat whatsoever. Although it might have sounded good on the McDonald's napkin it was written on, this feat is executed quite poorly as Peter begins to sweat green food coloring. Oooooh that's a great effect. I could have done better with colored pencils and glitter.The Mom interrupts this little soir\u00e9e and gives a grating, annoying, monotone speech to Johnathan. It seems Grampa Seth has been dead for six months, but only Johnathan can see him. Perhaps a pre cursor to the Sixth Sense? Hmmmmm.....? We also learn Johnathan is one messed up kid as he rants and raves about goblins and the Mom blows his cover by saying 'Remember what the doctor said?\" But don't let the Mom fool you, she is the worst offender of vomit inducing acting in this crap and that IS REALLY SAYING SOMETHING. And she is so '80's. Apparently, her favorite song is 'Row Row Row Your Boat', but since the title is so hard to remember, she just calls it 'That song I like so much'. The sister is pretty crappy as well. She delivers all of her lines with a smirk on her face. Perhaps she was high and realized what crap she was in, or she enjoyed the crap she was in. That aside, I hope the young actress who plays her took acting and dancing classes after she saw the way she was dancing in this. Maybe she tried to dance like Tiffany. The dad is by far the best actor in this romp (and that's also not saying much). It's amazing how all these actors and actresses in this movie can say their lines with straight faces.So the dimwitted family head to the fancy town of Nilbog (get it? To quote the movie: \" Nilbog....is...goblin...spelled...backwads!\") to switch houses with some hillbilly family out in the woods. Close behind is Holly's boyfriend and his....well.....friends.As soon as the family get to the house, they are greeted by the Addams Family who leave them food in the house. The retarded family sit down to munch on biscuits with green paste on it, steak smothered in green sauce, and corn on the cob smeared in green dip. Even if the stupid family thought it was wasabi sauce, it don't sound too appetizing slapped on corn on the cob. I guess this film takes place in some sort of alternate universe. Grampa Seth shows up and stops time for thirty seconds (hmmm...seems more like ninety seconds to me) so Johnathan can urinate on their dinner. You can say he rains on their parade. He gets his father quite upset, though.We also meet a witch who is so over the freakin' top that she makes John Voight's performance on Anaconda seem like Joseph Cotten's performance on Citizen Kane. She is from Stone Henge, but sounds like she is from Germany (accent included). And she actually (or the writer of this trash, your pick) pulls out some bull Stone Henge plot on us. What is it's significance? What does the Stone Henge have to do with goblins? And also, who really cares? She turns one of Holly's boyfriend's boyfriend, ooops, friend into a plant.The film finally comes to it's lackluster climax when the silly family are barricaded inside of the house and the goblins throw sandwiches at the house. Things get extremely silly when the family holds some sort of freaky s\u00e9ance and Johnathan ends up in the witch's liar. .the witch hoists him up (in an incredibly funny way. It's so obvious he's stepping on some kind of stool, which just makes me laugh every time I see it) and tries to turn him into goblin food. He is rescued by a double decker bologna sandwich. Then he keeps repeating to his family, \"Only the power of goodness can defeat these monsters!\" And they all put their hands on the stone and CONCENTRATE! Sure, I'll remember that one when it never happens to me. The family then return home and Johnathan's mom becomes goblin food.If you think comedy is dead, check this one out. It is all sorts of funny. The best thing about this movie is that it actually takes itself seriously. Nobody is laughing or smirking (except the sister) and it tries to pursue an aura of dread and desperation. Too bad it's so funny, you will laugh it off the screen of your television set. Have a few glasses of vodka before watching this, it's even funnier.",

            "content": "I've already sent a rather lengthy comment in for this film, but I wanted to share some TROLL 2 experiences that I've had.  This is the kind of film that brings people together in bizarre way, the kind of film that could end world hunger, the kind of film that kind of makes up for God putting Rosie O'Donnell on the planet.First of all, the first time I saw TROLL 2, I was about 13 years old, and I happened to catch it on HBO in the middle of the night.  After that night, I tried in vain to find anyone else who might have seen it, and I was a sad man.Several years later, a friend I hadn't seen in a long time and I got to talking about film-- the good, the bad, the ugly films, etc-- and TROLL 2 came up.  I had found someone else who'd seen it! I was a happy man.That year, that friend gave me one of the best presents ever: A dub of TROLL 2 from HBO, with an episode of Jerry Springer preceding it that dealt with the midget ku klux klan.  This happy man became happier.And, then, tragedy struck: One day, while my girlfriend and I were waiting tables at this restaurant, I received a phone call-- my apartment had burned down.  Sure, I lost all my clothes, my furniture, my electronic stuff, but most damaging of all was the casualty of my prized copy of TROLL 2. Things had never been bleaker; I was a broken man.But TROLL 2 and its legacy were not through with me.  Only three months later, my girlfriend and I had started over in an apartment in another, nearby town.  We moved in with a friend of mine, and on the first night in our new apartment my friend went up to the local mom and pop video store to see what he could see.  He returned with, of course, a new copy of TROLL 2. It even had the cover box, which features pictures of actors not seen in the film! We quickly decided that we would not return the film, as any late fees they could possibly charge us would be worth it.We moved yet again before the end of that year, and that's when my girlfriend and I started breaking in the masses to TROLL 2.  It started at a party, where I threw the thing on as background noise/something to make fun of, and from that day on, every time someone came over we'd ask, \"Do you know about TROLL 2?\"If the answer was \"No\", then they had to watch the film with us.  By that system, and ever since, I would say that my girlfriend and I showed TROLL 2 to somewhere between 20-50 people.  Before long, a drinking game emerged; People started to be able to quote whole scenes of dialogue from memory; Nicknames were given to favorite characters, and each of us had our own very special TROLL 2 character.My absolute favorite thing in the film is the Tr-- er, Goblin with the really, really fake looking mask.  You know what I'm talking about.  It looks like all the masks were made from papier-mache, and that mask was made with the leftovers of all the other masks.  It's the troll that's usually seen on the far right or left of the screen, the one with bulging eyes the same color as the skin on the mask and the obvious \"eye holes\" cut beneath them.  We called this Troll \"Squiggy\" (It seems highly appropriate), and every time he came onscreen everyone had to raise their drink and toast him, yelling \"Squiggs!\" or \"Squiggy!\" at the top of their lungs.I miss those days, as I've broken up with that girl now (we're on good terms, by the way, and I'm sure alot of that has to do with the bond that formed between us during such scenes as the \"popcorn seduction\" and the \"Eggs? Blegh!!!\" scene), and moved back home.  But the cockles of my heart were warmed (and my cockles aren't easily warmed, mind you) by the numerous posts regarding TROLL 2 on this website.  Squiggy bless you all!If you want to drop me a line about Nilbog or its denizens, write\nWord, Dr. Scott",

            "content": "You can worship La Dolce Vita, Citizen Kane, The Seventh Seal and all the great films of the 20th Century, but can they really measure up to this? Troll 2 is the ultimate cinematic experience in it's complete disregard for anything that has gone before. The film pays absolutely no regard for cinematic convention, eschewing the tried and tested structural values of film-making for a pseudo absurdist approach that leaves the viewer disorientated and confused.It is in this state that one can draw all the cathartic and didactic meaning from this film: one the one hand, that nothing makes sense, so why bother living at all, on the other, wasting your time watching films of this nature will instill a feeling of 'Carpe Diem' and make one live their life to the full. The genius of Troll 2 is that literally every single line of dialogue has infinite meaning and none at all simultaneously. Your sanity, reason for existence and destiny are all questioned when watching this film, merely by assessing your own state while viewing.But this film is not just brilliant in a metaphorical and symbolic way, the events themselves allow us to question our own frail time on this mortal coil we call life. Take Grampa Seth's transportation through the mirror, a metaphor for the fear of death and it's importance in holding us back from what we want to do. Or Holly's dance sequence, highlighting the frailty of 'woman'. The 'trolls' themselves, goblins who look exactly like us - suggesting that perhaps vegetarian goblins lurk within all our souls. Perhaps the most important moment is the sweetcorn sex scene - the ultimate metaphysical erotic battle between vegetable and human in one scintillating image.The script of Troll 2 reads not unlike playwrights such as Shakespeare, or the poetry of Milton. It's multifaceted, almost impenetrable mask of mystique is T S Eliot's legacy on film, combined with the homo-erotic subplots associated with the Elisabethans in the form of Eliot and his friends experiences. The camper van itself is a symbol of youth and dubious sexuality, combined with milk based imagery later on we see the microcosmic journey through existence that is at the essence of humanity.Troll 2, in short, is the sum of our hopes and fears, what is to be human, depicted perfectly on screen. The final scene illustrates this best of all - for what sums up the fragility of existence more than the words, 'Do you want some, Joshua?'",

Surprisingly, in the movie title TROLL 2, they do not even use the word troll. In fact, there are NO trolls in the entire movie, but there are plenty of goblins that all look exactly the same. This movie is pretty much like making a movie called Superman but having it star Spiderman, it just doesn't make sense. The scenes in it are just ridiculous. The town is called Nilbog (I honestly hope somebody got fired for this), and it is run by evil Goblins that want to eat this family, and that's pretty much all that makes sense. I do have a few questions of my own: 1. What does that German Goblin contribute to the movie? 2. Is the family that stupid that they're living in a town called Nilbog where the food all has neon-green goop on it? 3. Don't even get me started on Grandpa Seth. His character does not make sense at all. 4. The ending is eye-gouging awful. The scene I laughed the hardest during was when the father and Joshua go out to buy Nilbog Milk and the store is closed, so they decide to wait. The dad sits down in a chair outside, pulls out a Vegetable Cookbook, and starts reading. The scene cuts away to Joshua for less than 3 seconds, and when Joshua looks back at his dad, he is asleep. This scene is just insane. Words don't do it justice. I beg you, please don't try to be funny and give this movie a 10 without even seeing it. Once you see it, you will want to shoot yourself for giving it anything above a 1.",

There is an overwhelming sense of sorrow felt throughout the film due to the family's loss, especially the standout among the cast, Margo Prey, who plays Joshua's mother, Diana Waits. I am shocked to have not seen her in any movies since then, as her performance was a show-stopper. It is almost next to impossible to not sympathize with the character of Diana Waits - there are moments where she comes close to bawling over the loss of her father, whom she makes clear, she is the daughter of, but, luckily, her son Joshua starts singing her favorite song to cheer her up.Let's not forget that Troll 2 is a horror movie, and will scare the most mature of adults. There are several cheap scares as is usual in any horror movie, but it is also deeply atmospheric in a way that only director Cladio Fragasso can accomplish, and it is safe to say you WILL get goosebumps. It is also very gory, but it is relevant to the story and constructive as is rare in horror movies. In one terrifying scene where the goblins are introduced, I was taken aback by how realistic the goblins were portrayed. A smart choice was the employment of Laura Gemsler, a respected actress in her own right, who designed the goblin's costumes. With what was obviously a sizable budget, these goblins all open their mouths and devour the people they victimize after they turn them into plants, in an unexpectedly frightening twist of fate.So watch Troll 2 if you dare. With it's frightening and somber atmosphere, powerful and engaging performances by the whole cast, it will surely be a movie you will never forget.",

This movie is about a family that is trading houses with another family that they've never met. ***Spoilers. As if it matters...*** The town that they go to is called \"Nilbog\", which is \"Goblin\" spelled backwards. Everybody in the town is a goblin. Sheriff \"Gene Freak\" is the best character in the history of cinema, and when one character asks him where the girls in the town are, he laughs so hard he seems to be choking and yells \"GIRLS? ahahahahaha!\" as he suddenly drives away. I can't explain why it's funnier than any other thing I've ever seen on video, but it is. Watching this movie is as cathartic as stabbing cantellope with a steak knife. Go watch it now.

            "review_title": "One of my favourite movies of all time",
            "content": "I think like most of us here, I've discovered Troll 2 thanks to its notoriety online as one of the worst films of all time. Now, I'm not gonna go ahead and claim that this movie is well-made by any conventional standards of cinema, but I do think that Troll 2 is truly a one-of-a-kind film, and that its qualities lie in at a different level of analysis, one that doesn't really care about conventional standards of artistic quality.The premise itself is fairly simple: on a family vacation to a small village named Nilbog, our heroes are going to be ambushed by vegetarian monsters known as goblins. The movie follows Joshua, a young child, as he figures out how to fight back against them, with the help of his ghostly grandpa.This idea for the film came from the fact that, back in the late 80's, the director and his wife (who co-wrote the film together) had increasingly more friends that turned vegetarian and thus they came up with this concept for a vegetarian vampire, presumably out of spite.Now, what's very interesting with that concept is that not only is it charged politically (more on that later) but it also gave them the opportunity to draw inspiration from body horror. At several points of the film, we see characters transformed into plants in a moderately gruesome fashion only to be eaten by goblins, and that in and of itself might get a rise out of you.The movie's overall production quality is fairly low. Most of the effects, props and costumes are fairly cheap looking, which makes them stick out. For instance, several scenes of the film display a sort of green paste that's relatively gross to look at, as well as what is supposed to be green blood, I assume. I find it fairly cool that the colour of nature is portrayed in such a gross, unappealing manner throughout the film, even if that's just a result of budgetary constraints.This also reflects in the food,... which I guess is the main cultural conflict of the film. Goblins have this food that is mostly normal looking except for the fact that it systematically contains that green paste. The characters in the film don't have a problem with the way it looks (aside from Joshua), but as the audience we understand that their food is supposed to be gross and basically inedible. By the same token, the goblins look particularly cheap but they are absolute nightmare fuel in their own right.The acting is absolutely horrendous, but it's bad in a way that is fun and unique. Every single actor plays terribly in their own little style, which gives their characters unique personalities, as a result. Now, maybe if the script wasn't so weird they might have given \"better\" performances but honestly, I don't think so. Also worth noting: I believe the actors were instructed to not stray away from the material, even if their dialogue was clunky or nonsensical...Which brings me to the script! What's very particular about the script is that it is written by Italians, trying to emulate a language they are not very familiar with, I.E. English, but also trying to paint their own picture of the late-80's American traditional family. And why I think this is valuable is because getting a look into the way Americans are portrayed by people other than themselves, in a genuine manner, is fairly interesting, given the hegemony of their culture.What I believe the film is trying to say is that the American way of life is incompatible with vegetarianism, but not just that. The goblins in the film represent a way of life that is diametrically opposed to that of the traditional nuclear family. Goblins don't even seem to have families, or if they do they don't seem to value that unit very much. They also engage in sex outside of marriage and they presumably have different religious traditions, which puts them in a position of outsider to the hegemonic culture to begin with.On a side note: when it comes to films like these, that have acquired a reputation for being terrible/a laughing stock, we should analyse what they have to say and try to understand what their authors wanted us to take out of them. Because no art to devoid of meaning, and in fact all art carries with it a set of values for us to talk about.In conclusion, I think the reason I love this movie from the bottom of my heart is not because it's \"so bad it's good\", as some may say, but rather because it's a genuine piece of art, and that none other makes me feel this way. I think it has a charm that far surpasses its ineptitude, in the conventional sense of the term. The film isn't devoid of sense and its plot is no accident: our two writers experienced something in the world and wanted to talk about it in the form of a horror film. There is, I believe, genuine artistic intent in this movie, and this is what makes me come back to it every so often.I cannot look at a movie I enjoy this much and say \"oh yeah this film is bad\". That doesn't make sense. it's otherworldly qualities are strength rather than weaknesses, and to say this movie is \"so bad it's good\" undercuts the very reason why I like it so much in the first place. It's bizarre, it's fun, and it's entertaining. It is a truly joyful experience. 10/10",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I had nightmares about all kinds of fictional creatures; the werewolf from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban being the most terrifying of all. However, after seeing Troll 2, I've realized that what I should have been afraid of was terrible movies made about these creatures. Troll 2 is about a family from a small town who participates in an \"exchange program\" \u2013 some made-up idea where two families swap houses for a period of time. The Waits family is headed for a town called Nilbog\u0085or \"goblin\" spelled backwards. Throughout the trip, Joshua (the youngest son) is contacted by his dead Grandpa Seth, who continually warns Joshua to have the family leave Nilbog. Meanwhile, Joshua's sister Holly is going through relationship troubles. Elliot, her boyfriend, has\u0085gasp\u0085friends! Before the Waits depart for Nilbog, Holly tells Elliot he must choose between her or his friends. So naturally, Elliot follows the family to Nilbog in an RV\u0085with his friends. I would credit the actors, but that would just be embarrassing for them. Before you get your hopes up; there are no trolls in this movie. Only goblins. Terrifying goblins. Goblins that can't eat meat. Goblins that feed humans their goblin goop to turn the humans into vegetables. Apparently, turning humans into plants and then eating them is much better than just eating regular plants. Many terrible movies have at least one saving grace. Troll 2, however, is utterly and completely abysmal. The acting is horrible. The costuming is cheap and unbelievable. The writing is completely terrifying, and the plot itself is full of holes.For example, when the family arrives at the house in Nilbog they find food on the table. The food is visibly covered in green stuff (which would be a warning sign to any normal family), but the family sits down to eat anyways. Suddenly, grandpa Seth appears to Joshua and tells him that he cannot let the family eat the food. Somehow, Grandpa Seth freezes time for 30 seconds just when the rest of the family is about to put the food in their mouths. During this thirty seconds, Joshua must stop his family from eating. So what does he do? He pees on the food. I actually almost peed myself while laughing over the ridiculousness. Troll 2 was directed by Drake Floyd, a pseudonym for Claudio Fragasso. Fragasso is an Italian porn director, which does explain the terrible script and plot. However, I still think there should have been someone there to stop him from making this terrible movie. Rather than give this film zero stars, I'll give it one \u2013 because I did spend most of the movie laughing my ass off at how bad it was. In fact, Troll 2 might actually be the worst movie that was ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it for yourself\u0085if you have the time to waste.",

            "content": "I saw this movie at least 4 times when I was sixteen years old. Every single time I watched it I found something else to despise about it. It's not that it's overly gory- I've seen much worse violence in cartoons. No, it's that the movie itself is just so horribly made, with no attempt to place any cohesive structure to the many subplots going on, not to mention the ALL TIME WORST DUBBING JOB IN HISTORY.(Was this made in Italy? For crimeny all over, Lucio Fulci was supposedly a hack of a director, but at least his dubbing sounded halfway real, and he used different colors for his gore.) Speaking of plots, the storyline is supposedly a sequel to the original \"Troll\" movie, (which in itself wasn't half-bad; I found that movie to have a decent story which was explained surprisingly competently and presented with decent, high quality stomach-churning effects, unlike this film which uses nothing but bright green gunk for EVERYTHING; blood, cake frosting, saliva- you name it, they've got it being used for it) but manages, whether intentionally or not, to have no plot ties to that film whatsoever. The acting is annoying, the main character is the most worthless child actor ever in existence, and the ending is just so stupid that it achieves the effect the director wanted- it sickens and horrifies you, but not because it's actually all that horrifying or sickening; it is solely because it's such a horrible waste of time. Overall, and hopefully I'm not giving anything away, the only saving grace of the movie is the popcorn feast/seduction/whatever in the motor home. That actually made me laugh for a bit, and forget for a second how terrible the rest of the film was, and would continue to be.To wrap this up, if you truly want to know what a terrible movie is, I would suggest that you first see \"Glen or Glenda?\" by Ed Wood, and then watch this film- trust me, \"Glen or Glenda\" is going to seem like \"Citizen Kane\" after this tripe. The only successful thing about this movie is its complete ineptitude in almost every single aspect.-1 star, since they don't have that rating on the board. Truly satanic in its awfulness.",

Surprisingly, not everything in this movie is awful. The film's isolated rural landscape creates a sense of dread and tension.

Also the masks worn by the goblin extras look genuinely scary. Some of the characters in the movie are well casted, despite their incompetent acting. This includes the father and the little boy of the family on vacation and the little boy's deceased grandfather, who warns him of what he and his family are getting into right from the start. What Troll 2 does is take the boring old horror movie formula... 1:Someone notices something weird and sinister going on and no one believes him/her. 2:He/she proves the danger is real. 3:They find some way to supposedly defeat the evil. Stupid magicy good vs evil cr ap happens. They think the evil is defeated.4:Fast forward a little and everyone thinks its happily ever after but then the evil force comes back and does something nasty.

The acting speaks for itself and is one of the main reasons why it's so terrible/hilarious. The story line drifts away like a child with a.d.d. What we have here folks is a film that tried to be scary and ended up failing so miserably that I can't even begin to describe it's epic fail. Was there even a post-production in the making of this movie?",

            "content": "Haha, wow.Troll 2 is one of those rare horror movies that could make you appreciate having thrush because, on the bright side, you didn't make Troll 2. This movie is what happens when the forces of screen writing and brain-damage inseminate a jackal, whose child is melted down in holy water and turned into haunted film. The super intelligent apes of the future will watch Troll 2 to make them feel less guilty about the worldwide rapey-genocide they will have committed on us humans. And it will work.Troll 2 should be rated MA15+ and never shown to your children. It will erase every lesson you have ever taught them about stranger danger. If you show this movie to your child, there is a 100% chance they will become molested or dead within the next hour. It's like saying candyman into the mirror, except the mirror is a television, you don't have to say candyman and the candyman is every rapist in your suburb. I've never seen characters act this stupid outside of a Chris Farley movie. I can only conclude that Claudio Fragasso is some kind of murdering rapist and Nilbog is his fantasy world where parental instruction is as scarce as parental supervision. Giving this movie to a kid must legally be considered 'accosting a minor for immoral purposes'. In Claudio's goblish molestopia, kids always do what you tell them to, even if you're a predator in a policeman's outfit offering them a hamburger made of green goo (Which happens. And he eats it). If a pack of murderers know you have Troll 2 in your movie collection, they won't bother to bring rope.The magic of cinema is supposed to take you to fantastic places and allow you to escape the drudgery of everyday life. The magic of Troll 2 will throw you in a van and take you its gingerbread house. So, if you love fantastically shitty movies, I highly recommend it. If you have trouble finding a copy, I'm pretty sure it comes free with every child abductor's starter kit.",

It gets a bit slow (in comedy terms!) around the middle, but the beginning and end absolutely beggar belief.

If you haven't, and you can find a copy of this (both DVD and VHS versions exist, at reasonable prices!) take the plunge, irrespective of what films you enjoy - I guarantee you will get a kick out of it.Simply put, you must see this film.*SPOILERS*If not for the distinct lack of Trolls in a film called 'Troll 2', then for the poor Goblin masks.If not for the completely unerotic and unrelated corn on the cob seduction scene, then for the mad woman singing 'Row, row row your boat' completely out of tune.If not for the lesson that a bologne sandwich can ultimately save the day in any situation, then for the cheesy 80s music.If not for the woman that has Stonehenge in her house, then for the alternate moral, which is that urinating all over your family's food is the answer to all of your problems.If not for the man who shouts the most unconvincing 'Oh... my ... GOD!' in existence, then for the most unconvincing chainsaw scene in existence.If not for the father's tendency to drift off whilst forgetting his lines, then for the bizarre straight/bisexual confused antics of the supporting cast.If not for the moment when SOMEONE FINALLY REALISES that Nilbog is goblin spelt backwards, then for the mysterious repeated resurrection of the grandfather character FOR NO REASON.And remember, son, \"I'm gonna tighten one notch in my belt...\"",

It is an extraordinarily badly acted movie with excruciatingly terrible special effects and a plot that would make Ed Wood cringe.

The overall pace of this movie is pretty quick and I can honestly say I was not bored at any time while watching Troll 2. I don't think I've ever laughed at anything so hard in my life. I can even remember my mom yelling down the stairs at me asking if I was okay because I was laughing so hard. This will always be one of my favourite movies of all time because of its unique entertainment value.

I think this movie simply suffered from \"get another producer!!\". John Carl Buechler who directed \"Troll\" should have been paid \"whatever\" to come back for this one. Claudio Fragasso needs to stick to writing \"which isn't that great either\" OR just offer ideas. This movie is so overacted and cheesy my grandpa could have done better.

Anyways, this film combines the riveting plot lines of lesser films like the Godfather and Schindler's List with the acting excellence of Robert Downy Jr.'s performance in Tropic Thunder, but like with all the actors. The decision to title the movie \"Troll 2\" and proceed to not include a single troll in the entire film can be described as nothing short of pure genius. Also, the plot twist where all the townspeople turn out to be goblins was so unexpected that I was forced to question my own existence. The moral to the story, that \"only meat or the power of goodness can vanquish these monsters,\" has only become more relevant in the 27 years since this movie's release. Finally, the closing scene, where the goblins inexplicably return from their defeat and brutally devour the mother while she is in the shower, is one of the most hauntingly beautiful cinematic sequences I have ever encountered. The obvious allegory to the challenges faced by oppressed minorities in modern Los Angeles is icing on the cake in my opinion. The fact this movie did not win every Oscar possible the year of its release is a travesty, and serves more as a statement on the current Hollywood establishment than anything.",

            "content": "It is really hard to describe this \"film\" without using the phrases 'Holy s**t' and 'f****d up' but I will try.  By the way this review contains some spoilers.So there is a town called Nilbog where a bunch of Goblins (that's right Goblins, no trolls in this movie) pose as slacked jawed yokels and feed tourists curdled milk and oddly colored cakes.  Food so vile looking that no human would even consider eating it.  But the hapless family that this movie centers on seems to really find the Nilbog cuisine quite appealing. The food in Nilbog has two interesting properties, it makes you become a puddle of Goblin attracting green slime or it makes you become a half human, half plant (the favorite food of Goblins).  The forces behind this movie never decided which cliche was better I guess (neither). One thing is for sure, these goblins hate non-vegetable foods.  As in the General Store scene the very mention of eggs makes the store owner spit in disgust. The movie has a vile witch in it, vile due to her acting, otherwise laughable. One quote of hers shall always haunt me: \"I am your neigh-bore\", that is how she says it and I agree.  She takes the green colored cake for the most foolish and overdone character I've seen in years.  It is a spectacle to be seen to be believed. The family featured in this movie is a real treat, if they were in Huckleberry Finn they could be the raft because they are four planks of wood.  The most unsure, nervous actors I have ever seen.  Their eyes dart around as if begging to be saved from drowning.  Some scenes are obviously cut short due to forgotten lines.  The family is a real combo.  You have the weight lifting, bad dancer daughter who hates her boyfriend for hanging out with his boys-a, you have a Stepford Wife, a mannequin with a country drawl for the Husband and of course the son, a plucky li'l redhead who stumbles his way into saving the whole sorry lot of them with the help of a dead grandfather who talks to him and suggests molotov cocktails as a solution (among other things which must be seen to be believed). I could not believe the boyfriend of the family's daughter.  His skills were nonexistent, it was like a middle school rehearsal gone bad.  You really need to see this guy (and his boyza).  But the daughter is of course no prize either.  Her lines come out as smooth as a chainsaw cutting through asphalt.Now some quick rips: The Goblins look like sacks of potatoes with homemade masks on. The guy who stretches outside the R.V. has quite a warmup eh? The popcorn scene is coma-inducing. The townspeople are a real bunch of lookers. A Duoble Decker Bologna Sandwich!  Is this some kind of sick joke or what?This movie is recommended for the following reasons: Goblins are foolish. The movie is ridiculous. MST3k would have a field day with this dog. A good lesson on what not to do when making a film. You will laugh and laugh (in disgust)Sub-Z movies can be a real treat But watch in moderation: This thing is so bad it ripped off Manos The Hands of Fate with the \"Row Row Row Your Boat\" sung while driving.",

The family is being chases by the whole town but all of a sudden the town decides to stop chasing them and let them go in the house to have a seance. The townspeople respond by shooting a gun in the air. 7. The town's name is NILBOG (it's Goblin backward's). 8. The family doesn't think twice about eating green food. 9. The goblins masks look like they were purchased at Dollar General. 10. The movie is called Troll 2 but there is not one single troll in the movie, nor is the word troll ever even said. Enjoy!!!",

            "content": "I ran across this movie on TV during a recent bout of insomnia, and the only thing it accomplished was to put me to sleep.The plot, as far as I can tell (and I am NOT going to try watching it again), is that a family of robots is participating in a home-exchange program, and will be spending their vacation at the house of their exchange family. Unfortunately for the robot family, their exchange family is actually actually a pack of very short cannibals who like to wear cheap latex monster masks, and who have some kind of obsession with green slime, specifically, getting their victims to eat the green slime. I think.Anyway, on their drive over -- after a truly emotional robot argument between the robot father and his robot daughter over her choice in boyfriends -- the youngest robot son thinks he sees his grandfather standing on the side of the road, and convinces the family to stop and pull over. Grandfather warns him of the monster-masked monsters lurking in their new town, and then the shrooms wear off and he turns back into a smelly, surly hobo. Then some stuff happens, and the family arrives at their destination, where, upon noticing how deserted it looks, the robot father makes the astute observation that, \"country folk go to bed at this time of night\", then takes advantage of the bright, mid-afternoon sun to drive the rest of the way to their vacation-home.Once there, they meet the family that will be driving to their home, and the youngest son receives a threat, which triggers another episode wherein he believes the ghost of his Grandfather has returned and is telling him to pee on everybody's dinner. Stupid robot. Shortly after this, I fell into the sweet embrace of sleep, and only awoke at the end, where the monsters and their leader -- an incomplete MtF transsexual -- are defeated by a lot of scowling, and, to be honest, I don't think the ending would have made any more sense if I'd been awake for all of it. ...Oh yes, I am leaving out the super-super twist-ending, because if you are that interested in the story, you deserve to have to sit through the whole freakin' movie, you twit.1/10, but only because there is no 0 option.",

And to be perfectly honest, I think all you people are overlooking the fact that Troll 2 was not made to capitalize off the wild popularity of the original underground hit, Troll, so much as the existence of Troll 2 was made to truly validate the existence of the first Troll.Set at the turn of the century, the late 1880s, Troll 2 serves as a prequel that adds to the mythos of what is already a rich tapestry of the Troll canon. Troll 2, a time-traveling, mischief-making apparition, is from the streets.Julia-Louis Dreyfus who played the beautiful Girlcat (the sexy college professor who sees beyond Troll 2's rough exterior for the man that he is) is NOT in this movie, as it is a prequel, but there are allusions to her and the imminent intertwining of their eventual fate.See this before you see the first Troll, and then scour the internet for the massive collection of fan fiction, because you're going to have to wait until 2009 for Troll 3! Julia-Louis Dreyfus IS attached, and Brett Ratner is said to be bringing his unique and original vision to the series as both the writer AND director! See you in the theatres!",

            "content": "I don't get the notoriety and the alleged \"so bad it's good\" fanfare of this film?OK I love bad movies. Specifically I love unintentional comedies in the Action/Martial Arts genre.Whether it is a proper Hollywood production with Swarzenegger (Commando), Van Damme (Street Fighter) Chuck Norris (The Delta Force) or some obscure undiscovered VHS gold starring ? (Deadly Prey) (Lady Terminator).Without sounding a hypocrite I discovered a good laugh by scraping the barrel with Undefeatable (check out \"best fight scene ever\" on YouTube) and the pant wettingly funny Samurai Cop.Most of the above films have one thing in common. Foreign film makers directing Western \"actors\" with hilarious consequences- odd plot quirks and really bad acting- and an abuse of film-making conventions.Avid film buffs, media studies students and fans of late night movies with 4 tins of beer tend to lap up these type of films.However there is a new sub branch fanbase of these types of films that casual fans of bad movie wince at. Anti-social YouTube reviewers (shudder), nerdy blog posters (Cinema Snob) and other friendless, weirdo basement dweller types who do video reviews that are as long as the film itself. Why? You might as well go and watch the film, download it, rent it or buy from the bargain bin at the DVD store. But what makes it worse is their odd choices of \"bad movies\" that just aren't funny- they're downright boring.One of these films is Troll 2. I only made it to the 48 minute mark and after pausing the film for the 4th time I switched it off. The film isn't that badly made- its a very average straight to VHS low budget horror flick. Sure the make up effects are atrocious even by late 80s, horror standards but we're all familiar with people using them in their profile pictures on public chat forums- whatever humour has been lost. As for the acting and scripting there is little in Troll 2 you didn't get in any other straight to VHS horror- waiting to be exhumed and used in \"viral\" Gifs, Internet humour and (excuse the pun) trolling message boards with weird stills from the film.A bit like when \"The Room\" came out with Tommy Wiseau. Whilst so many geek film critics thought that film was hilarious; I didn't. In my opinion that was just like the bad unsexy \"erotic\" made-for-TV thrillers of the early 90'sIn summary don't waste your life watching Troll 2. If you thought the infamous \"Oh myyyyyyyyyy godddddddd\" scene was the most hilarious thing you've ever seen a) you've lived a sheltered life b) you don't know was real bad acting is c) that was the highlight of the film's \"comedy\" so no need to watch any more",

The way Arnold (played by Darren Ewing) speaks during the scene is the main reason. He sounds bored at first, but when he has say \"oh my God\" he goes hilariously over-the-top. Making it even better, there's a fly on his forehead when he says it.Close runner-ups for best scenes include the infamous scene where Joshua (played by Michael Stephenson) gets his family to not eat the goblin by urinating on it and the end where the goblins are chowing down on Joshua's mother.",

For all you kids out there looking at the VHS (or hopefully a soon-to-be DVD) cover, you should be warned that not one of the characters pictured will appear on your TV screen.  I write this as a \"grizzled\" veteran of Troll 2.  I've been in double digits for months now and I hope to crack 100 viewings before the year ends.  So take my advice and heed my word..1) DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ALONE!:  I recall my first solo experience with Troll 2.  I believe that it was my 13th viewing (unlucky of course).  I was 8 beers deep into a 12 pack of Stroh's when I decided to throw in my copy of T-2.  2 hours later my brains were fried.  I felt as though my head just caught on fire and the flames were extinguished with a p***-soaked rake.2)  GIVE THE FILM A CHANCE.4)  DO NOT GO TO NILBOG.5)  DO NOT DATE GIRLS WHO EAT RAW CORN COBS.6)  DO LAUGH AT THIS MOVIE.  DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUS (even though the cast unfortunately did)7)  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPEAT ANY OF THE SPOKEN LINES...FURTHER POSSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE COULD OCCUR FROM QUOTES LIKE, \"THEY'RE EATING HER...AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO EAT ME....OH MY GOD!!!!!\"8)  DO NOT WORRY IF YOU COME DOWN WITH \"TROLL 2 DISEASE\" (better known as \"T2D\").:  Let it run it's course...usually about 3-4 days with symptoms ranging from headaches and loss of memory to anal warts.9)  WATCH THE FILM MORE THAN 10 TIMES...THEN IT STARTS TO GET REALLY FUNNY.10)  SEND ME ANY TROLL 2 RELATED E-MAILSLATER BROTHERS IN T2 ARMS!",

The outrageously loud laughter of Gene Freak after Brent (who is obviously gay) asks where the girls hang out at night, you can't ask for anything better. I do have to say that the best part is when Arnold gets speared in shoulder from 5 feet away, except the spear travels like 100 feet in the air, now thats one hell of a throw.Did Holly really think that Elliot could see her flipping him off from such a distance?

The boy too is pretty good. Around them are cast 'actors' ranging from reasonable to outright ridiculous, as if they practised acting by watching re-runs of Scooby Doo. Some 'performances' seem to have been carved out of wood, the kind you'd find in an M Night Shyamalan film, but at a much lower price. The special effects... sometimes they're OK for a low budget movie, but mostly are moments of comedy genius, like the food which seems to have been created by 5-year-olds.

I thought it was a perfect good flick. Of course, I was just kid. My mind wasn't developed enough to know what a truly good/bad flick was. Now I know. This movie very much deserves it's reputation. How many cheesy flicks have their own documentary ? Not many , that's for sure. Like Rocky Horror , Troll 2 is more than just a movie, it's an experience. I've never been to one myself, but they seem like a lot of fun. To sum it all up, give troll 2 a chance, you won't regret it. There are worse movies out there, but they're the bad kind of bad, where as Troll 2 is the good kind of bad. Check it out.",

This movie is more closely related to Children of the Corn than the first Troll movie.Even though the movie was named incorrectly, I have to give it 6/10 stars. I'm a huge B movie fan and can totally understand the following this movie has. It has some of the worst writing and acting I've ever seen in a film, but it's difficult to completely hate it.

So then it shows a old man talking to his Grandson, Joshua. Then the story ends and Joshua's mother comes it, and Grandpa Seth is gone. As it turns out, Grandpa Seth has been dead for 6 months and Joshua constantly sees him.So the father talks about them swapping homes with a family in the country for a couple of weeks. There is some sort of subplot with the teenage sister of Joshua having a boyfriend and him not coming with them to the home swap. So the family begins to drive, then Joshua suddenly has green goo coming from his forehead. He starts to turn into a plant and I blocked the rest out of my mind.Anyway, they arrive in the town of 'Nilbog'. There is NO subtle-ness here. As it turns out, the town is made of Goblins looking like humans. It ends with Joshua being cornered by the goblins and him pulling out a sandwich and screaming 'A double-decker bologna sandwich!' and eating it. This kills the monsters.

Grandpa Seth is creepy 2. Grandpa Seth's death was very difficult for his son-in-law 3. Mom looks as if she is a goblin 4. Holly's is training for the NFL or a dancer at the strip club in Nilbog 5. Elliot is a raging homo 6. It's OK to eat green paste on corn or for that matter anything. 7. 30 seconds according to grandpa is really like 2 min. 8.

            "content": "This movie is the equivalent of constipation--it is a slow a painful process that is only rewarded when the process is complete. The screenplay seems to be written by an incoherent vegetarian with a budget of $16.34.The plot basically revolves around vegetarian Goblins that have a knack for baking, an old woman that likes to turn people into trees, and a small boy and his dead grandpa. But wait, it gets better. To fool strangers into falling into their clutches, the Goblins name their town Nilbog (Because its such a normal sounding name, and nobody can tell that its Goblin backwards, right?). Then the Gobline, due to their high intelligence quotient, only have milk in all their stores, and they give the milk out for free (yet somehow the family still eats, the Goblins still have all their culinary supplies, and the Goblin Queen has...corn).But obvious as it is, Jonathon and his family still move to Nilbog, unperturbed by the fact that they are switching homes with a random family, the town is Goblin backwards, their children see ghosts, the place only has milk, and the Goblin Queen calls Jon's sister appetizing.Oh but wait, did I mention the Goblins can walk? Yes! They don't CHASE Jonathon, they walk after him with sticks. Intimidating, right? And when they do catch him, they pick him up and carry him five feet away, and put him down. Yes, the Goblins are also capable from moving you from Point A to Point B, so you better run! But then there are some good parts. Jon's Grandpa can turn into lightning, a guy makes out with a corn cob, Jon has a MOLATOV COCKTAIL (that is confiscated by a Goblin, and thats the end of that plan...anticlimactic...) and, dare I say it, a bologna sandwich! So basically, the bad guys only have vegetables and sticks at their disposal, despite the fact that in their human forms, they have shotguns and chainsaws. For about 10 minutes of the movie, all you see is a guy making out with corn and get covered in popcorn.This movie just sucked.

            "content": "Never have I given a movie more than an 8, and certainly not a 10, since a 10 implies that a movie is perfect, and I felt that a perfect movie couldn't exist. This movie made me question that assumption. This movie is a true work of art, dealing with the delicate issue of generational mental illness affliction in a Utah family in a creative way. In the movie mental illness is represented metaphorically as goblins. The movie starts out with Grandpa Seth of the Waits family, reading a story about goblins to young Joshua. Afterwards Grandpa Seth tries to convince his grandson that goblins exist, they do and Grandpa Seth is telling him. It seems as if Grandpa Seth is making an effort to pass his delusions onto his grandson, that is until his mother steps in the door and asks who Joshua is talking too, in which the chair Grandpa Seth was sitting on is shown empty. So it's not Grandpa Seth pushing his crazy on his grandson, but Joshua himself showing signs of mental illness. Diana Waits, his daughter, who herself clearly is a sufferer of some mental affliction, worries about the whole ordeal she had just witnessed, and talks about the situation with her husband George Waits. She asks George who the goblins are, unto which George scoffs. George Waits seems like the sanest at first until you realize that his idea of a vacation is exchanging houses with strangers from the country. The exchange is where the insanity really comes out, as the family must fight their demons in the form of the towns' people, which of whom they believe are cheaply costumed vegetarian goblins who want to devour them. There's a side story where the teen daughter of the Waits is having problems with her gay boyfriend, who is either using her as a beard, or since he seems mentally challenged, isn't able to understand why his girlfriend would have a problem with him sleeping with his friends. The daughter, who seems to have a type of dissociative personality disorder, stays with him even though she seems to know about this. The parents know of this and don't want Holly to hang out with this playboy son of the Coopers. He ends up going into the town the Waits are going with his friends, who he sleeps with, in his camper. One of the friends of Holly's boyfriends friends, whose name is Arnold is involved in a scene where he and a girl he had just met are caught in an old building by a crazy towns' lady, who is queen of the goblins in a poignant scene that foreshadows the ending where Joshua realizes he can't escape his madness. In this scene the girl who Arnie tried to save is caught and eaten by the goblins, and Arnie, who is turning into a tree and can't move, is forced to watch. Horrified he screams out, \"They're eaten her. And then they're going to eat me. Oh my Gaaaawwwd!\" This scene is best viewed in Hungarian; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8PyNeSV2J8There is an anti-meat message that is pronounced through the character Creedence after Grandpa Seth gives Joshua a bologna sandwich, which he eats to defeat the goblins. Perhaps Joshua's illness is brought on by a lack of meat in his diet? So maybe it's pro-meat? Anyway this movie makes you question which is a good thing. In the end the Waits return home, and everything seems okay, until Joshua awakens to see green slime, which is what the goblins turn people into to eat, since they can't eat meat they make people one with the vegetable world. He goes into the kitchen to see the goblins on the floor eaten his mom who has turned half plant. This shows that he can't run away from his problem, and the illness that is eating his mother is going to eat him too. The kid who played Joshua was so affected that he made a documentary on the Troll 2 phenomena as an adult, revisiting some of the old cast; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1144539/ This film is a Tour' Force! A Masterpiece! If you're only going to watch one movie during your lifetime it should be this! If you decide to watch this film, make sure there's somebody watching with you. -David Manning",

Surely those who do not consume meat are actually chlorophyll-obsessed goblins. There is no other alternative.\nIt also is a precursor to David Fincher's top-notch film Se7en, who surely took inspiration from Troll 2 when examining our basest human nature and penchant for sin. Gluttony and lust reign supreme in this film, with a scene of copulation and a rather phallic corn cob that reminds us all that too much of a good thing (even light, low calorie popcorn!) leads to evil.\nWatch this movie.

But here's the thing - it is so bad it's possibly the funniest film I've ever seen. The plot of the film is very weak. I've never seen Troll so I can't compare the two, but I'll be pretty sure it won't involve people turning into a cabbage.Another thing to love about this film is the acting throughout. At school we put on a better acted performance. That was in the Nativity play when I was four. At least at that age we didn't know we were bad actors (I was one of the Three Wise Men, which is a vaguely ironic role for a four year old boy). These guys have no excuses. The daughter makes out that she's reading from cue cards all the time.The best thing about the film is the costumes of the goblins themselves. Oh yeah, by the way, it's about goblins not trolls. Not one troll in the movie. If ever there was a case of false advertising, this'd be it. Not that I was particularly craving some troll action. Anyway, back to the costumes. Most of the goblins looks the same - paper bag skin and joke shop mask accessories but there is one which doesn't look like the rest and is possibly an extra from the Muppet Show. Just so you know which one I'm on about, it appears in the car on the journey to Nilbog.Just to give you an idea of how bad this film is, here's a line from the father of the family: \"I'm tightening my belt one loop so I don't feel hunger pains and your mother and sister will have to do the same.\" What? If I ever feel the nauseous pain of starvation, I'll remember to wear a belt.The really surreal thing is that this film got an '18' rating over here in the UK. If I'm being honest, there's nothing particularly shocking or gory in this film. The special effects are so abysmal that you'd have to be really gullible to be lulled into thinking this is at all real. I think the age rating here actually suggests the combined I.Q. of the cast, crew and anyone else involved in making this film.Seriously though, see this film. It's a must watch. I'm rating it not on how much I like it, but on how it ranks in film quality.",

At one point in the movie the main character has to stop his family from eating a poisoned food. He has 30 seconds until his family unfreezes and eats the food. So what did the main character do? He peed on the food. The people in this movie do the most stupid things possible. The goblins in the movie are trying to make the humans eat a green slime which will turn them into a slimy vegetable. A boy was offered a green hamburger and easily grabbed it and ate it without hesitation. What an idiot! One seen is so stupid its insane. The witch of a movie is trying to seduce a boy to eat a corn on the cob. They go into his trailer and the boy says he likes popcorn. so she puts the corn in her mouth and makes him eat it at the same time. Than out of nowhere popcorn starts to come out of absolutely nowhere. Than the witch leaves the trailer right after the boy gets covered in popcorn. Why popcorn... I don't know. The ending of the movie wasn't that bad. They get home from there horrible vacation (almost eaten by goblins vacation) and the father and sister doen't even step into the house before they go back to their normal lives. The boy and his mom go into the house. The boy goes to his room. Than he hears a noise. He goes downstairs where he finds a bathtub with a whole bunch of green slime in it. (his mom). Then he goes into the living room were he sees his mom getting eaten by goblins. The boys screams and the movie ends. You have to see this movie. Its really funny. Its hard to rent so you can just buy it for 7 bucks. It also comes with troll one. The funny thing is about troll one is that J. K. Rowling based her famous book harry potter on the first troll movie. Thats why its good to see troll one even though its not as funny. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!",

The Mother is just Genius. how she says \"JOSHWA\" and Not Joshua, that's putting your own personal stamp on a character right there. The boy, Joshua, is just brilliant, every scene he is in he steals, and i am certain that the trailers for \"THERE WILL BE BLOOD\" that say \"CITIZEN KANE SURPASSED\" were stolen from the trailer for this movie for Joshua's performance. (Although, clearly the guy who gets turned into a plant spent months getting his part perfect, i mean the delivery of the line \"OH MY GOD, THEY'RE EATING HER, AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME!\" just shows that this guy has the ability to get such raw emotion through the screen and into your heart. the terror i experienced on his behalf makes the exorcist look like an episode of the muppets. however, the best part, and the element of the movie that still, 18years on remains unsurpassed for me, is the Goblin masks. i think that the Jim Henson workshop have been embarrassed by this little film, who, with an Italian director who can't speak English, and hardly any budget, have managed to make goblins that have defined what one should look like. specifically i mean the one that the sister turns into when they are in the car. clearly the muppets stole the idea of \"BEAKER\" from this goblin. Jim Henson needs to take a long look at himself as i believe he has been truly outdone here by master craftsmen.the icing on the cake is Grandpaw Seth, whose every line reduced me to tears. i scoff now at the Oscars, which seems to be all political.Lets look at who won the Best Picture award in 1990...\"DRIVING MISS DAISY\" Troll 2 not even nominated.Best Actor?

If that seems like a pretty big problem for a film called Troll 2, then you haven't seen anything yet. This movie contains such fantastical scenes as... as... a helpful ghost stopping time so that a kid can jump onto a dinner table and pee all over his family's food, which is naturally the only sane way to prevent them from eating a substance that would otherwise turn them all into goblin snacks (oh, yes, there are goblins in Troll 2, just no trolls). In another scene, the villainous witch who rules the goblins becomes a sexy femme fatale and seduces a young man in his trailer, brandishing what I can only describe as a corn-on-the-cob dildo. After the lad falls under the witch's spell, so to speak, the two frolic on his bed \"eating\" the phallic corn until, at the climactic moment, popcorn erupts out of thin air, shooting everywhere and covering them. This is some pretty strong visual allegory for a PG 13 rated release! The narrative purpose of the scene, though, like much in Troll 2, is unclear, given that after the witch leaves the lad he seems perfectly fine and none the worse for his experience. Others victims are not so lucky, finding themselves turned into edible vegetation for goblins to feast upon. Some of the acting in Troll 2 vies with the best that Tommy Wiseau's The Room or Neil Breen's Fateful Findings has to offer. I would say that Troll 2 is unintentionally hilarious, but I'm not so confident in offering an opinion on what the filmmakers intended when making Troll 2. What I can say is that, although Troll 2 is \"bad\" on a whole different level from most of its competitors, I unironically love it.",

OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDD!!!!\" This movie is one of the worst things to ever exist. I find it debatable whether this or The Room is the best worst movie, especially since I'm a huge fan of The Room's awful quality. The effects and makeup look rather cheap, there's the misleading title and it's rather weird, but not in a good Tim Burton-esque kind of way. The acting is just awful but I don't find it to be as memorable as that of Tommy Wiseau whose indecipherable accent made the movie amusing especially during that awkward James Dean nod. There are multiple instances of bad editing, errors in filmmaking and things that make you think \"What?\". Like the time-stopped sequence, the kid has 30 seconds which means 1 minute in the \"cleverly titled\" Nilbog and does the kid remove the food that turns people into plants from his family's hands? No, he \"pisses on hospitality\". And everyone knows you can't piss on hospitality. Everyone is one side of the spectrum. They're either overacting or they barely are. The villain, a druid witch, speaks in a slow manner. Not 0.5 speed YouTube slow but she unnecessarily makes sentences longer than they actually are. Padding, ladies and gentlemen, padding. This movie has one of the most absurd ways to defeat a villain EVER. It's actually rather infuriating. But I like to keep my reviews spoiler-free excluding minor ones, so I'll let you figure out this way how the goblins were defeated. The funny thing is the mother is the scariest character in the entire movie but it isn't intentional. And the movie is categorized as a comedy but I don't know where the intentional humour is. Or wait, are you saying the unintentional humour including the timeless quotes were done on purpose unlike Tommy Wiseau who'd rather hide from his mistakes by saying \"Yes, yes. Movie is flawed. But I do that on purpose\". Just, what the hell was this movie all about? Especially with the dead grandpa. I have no idea. Maybe I should dive deeper into the depths of cinematic hell for VERY terrible movies. I hear Birdemic is absolutely awful, not even reaching \"so bad, it's good\" status. And I've been planning on investigating what made The Garbage Pail Kids Movie such a mess for months now since I believe that with most of my movies, I too often play nice with what I see. Yeah, I'm taking a cue from I Hate Everything. Troll 2, everybody. A movie that may or may not be the best worst movie ever. I still consider The Room to fall under that category.",

The acting is absolutely horrible, everything in the film is done completely wrong, the costumes are so bad they look like they were bought from a cheap Halloween store, and it's basically not even a sequel to the first film. Frame to frame, this movie is horrendous and is fulfilled with obviously noticeable mistakes, but that's what makes this film hilarious and very enjoyable. I don't know if the people who worked on this film were trying to actually be serious about it or make it look like a awful film on purpose, but they succeeded at making it a film so bad and horrible that it's actually pretty good. A must watch for a lot of laughs!",

This film actually has no connection to the Charles Band film \"Troll\" and was originally written as titled \"Goblin.\" Trolls are never actually mentioned in the film. This story is about the small town of Nilbog where the inhabitants are all acting quite strange and doing their best to get visitors to it their strange green food and drinks, which then turn them into on of their zombified townsfolk who try to get others to join them in their green food eating ways. Supposedly the director and his co-screenwriter wife wrote this in reaction to too many of their friends becoming vegetarians. But this film is one that has now deservedly earned a cult following in a \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" so-bad-it's-good kind of way. Many of the film's actors showed up for auditions to play extras but ended up being cast in lead roles. The director an his co-screenwriter wife did not speak English well and there screenplay was written in that same broken English, but to add to the film's ridiculousness, they forbade actors from altering their grammatically incorrect and nonsensical dialogue. It's an embarrassingly awful and ineptly made film to be sure, but that's wherein it's entertainment value lies.",

            "content": "The worst movie ever made. By far. Why? I'll tell you why...\n\nThis pathetic excuse for a film begins with a fat old man named \"Grandpa Seth\" narrating a pointless story to his grandson Jonathan. According to \"legend\", some guy with a silly hat ran through the woods once, attempting to escape the clutches of some evil goblins who were undoubtedly attempting to catch and hit him with their fake plastic masks. The idiot guy with the hat eventually falls down and is picked up by a comically dorky woman who feeds him magical green porridge. This pastel green soup makes him sweat Cascade dishwashing detergent and turns him into \"half man, half plant\", which I like to call a \"mlant.\" He is then supposedly eaten by the goblins, but I'm not exactly sure how this happens because the prop guy didn't cut the holes for their mouths big enough to get anything larger than a Tic-Tac through. Maybe when \"Goblin Mask v2.0\" is created, they'll be able to physically put something in their tiny mouths other than the director's minuscule penis.\n\nThe back-story-story is then interrupted when Jonathan's mom walks into the room and Grandpa Seth instantly disappears. According to the movie, this is because Seth has been dead for half a year. Mom and dad begin to talk about how excited they are to go to the town of \"Nilbog\", where they're swapping houses with a farm family. \n\nYes, \"Nilbog\". The town is named NILBOG. Do you get it? Are you impressed with the extreme degree of cleverness and creativity the \"writers\" exhibited when brainstorming this plot in their respective jail cells? I won't even go into detail with how intensely stupid the idea of swapping houses with a random farming family in the woods is, but then again, this movie seems to have been filmed in some sort of alternate universe where aliens dress up and try to act like how they guess human beings would. Nobody in this film reacts in any explicable sense to the events that occur around them. It's almost as if they wrote down six basic human emotions on a piece of paper and rolled a die every scene to determine which one they would attempt to portray.\n\nAnyway, the family of Jonathan, Michael, Diana, and Holly heads out to the wonderful and wacky town of NILBOG (NILBOG!!!) and begins to get in an argument in their minivan on the way there. The daughter and father fight about her boyfriend, who the father believes is a \"rotten good-for-nothing\" just because the kid's really stupid and hangs out with his homosexual friends all day. To break up the tension and bickering, the mom steps in and requests Jonathan to \"sing that song I like so much.\" The song, \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" was obviously too technical and confusing for the mother to recall the name of, but that still doesn't quite explain why she liked it \"so much.\" I would guess it's because she's an idiot, but I've been wrong before.\n\nThe family finally pulls into NILBOG (haha, NILBOG!), a town full of farmers who participate in a constant foam hat conventions, and meets the antisocial weirdos who they're swapping houses with. In a terribly scary moment of foreshadowing, the little farmer boy tosses a baseball to Jonathan which reads \"Eat up before we eat you\". Ooh, scary! Jonathan's family enters the house and are overjoyed to find a table full of prop food which doesn't look even remotely like anything anybody reasonably intelligent would consume. There's green biscuits, pitchers full of bright red and green liquid, and corn on the cob with green paste smeared all over it. So, being the braindead morons they are, Michael, Diana, and Holly all immediately dig in and prepare to shovel the filth down their throats. Before they can cram a single moldy biscuit into their stomachs, Grandpa Seth appears in a mysterious and shocking way (he knocks at the window). He explains to Jonathan that he has to stop his family from eating any of the food because it will turn them into goblins, or even worse, legitimate actors. Jonathan gets Grandpa Seth to stop time for 30 seconds (I really can't explain how he does it, I guess it's a perk you get for being dead) and does the only rational thing he can do to stop them from eating the food;he pees all over it. I'm not kidding. Once time resumes again, Michael takes Jonathan to his room and gives him a stern lecture that contains the phrase \"you can't piss on hospitality\", which is one of those lessons that you just can't learn on the mean streets of Nilbog.\n\nHolly's boyfriend and his cretin pals show up in their mobile home and park it in the woods, undoubtedly so the rest of the residents of Nilbog won't be awakened by their lusty cries of ecstasy during the night. One of the friends named Arnold goes outside the camper to smoke, sees a pretty girl running through the woods, starts chasing her, and gets a spear thrown into him by some marauding goblins. Arnold and the girl decide the best place for them to hide from the goblins would a nearby ominous, gothic, scary house, so they go in and get molested by a Druid lady. The woman playing the Druid is one of the most embarrassing examples of overacting in the history of modern film. She stretches out every vowel to approximately four hours in length, wildly gesticulates as if she were petting electric dogs, and forces her eyes open to the point of looking as if dinner plates were lodged in her forehead. She offers her guests a couple mugs full of dry ice and lime Jello, which they drink. This causes the girl to turn into a lump of slime and Arnold to transform in a tree (a tree that sweats dishwashing detergent). Drew, another one of the fools in the trailer, decides to run to town and get some milk. Oh, the wild and crazy kids these days, what will they do next? On the way to the general store, Drew is given a ride by Sheriff Freak, the law authority of Nilbog. Sheriff Freak (that's really his name, I swear) gives the kid a green sandwich and he immediately eats. The kid is dropped off by the sheriff, buys some milk, and then runs into the Druid's house to hang out with his buddy Arnold, who is still a mlant. I think he ends up being killed or something, I don't remember. It's not very crucial to the plot, all the kids were just cannon fodder anyway.\n\nJonathan stumbles upon the evil goblin church, which is actually the director's unfurnished basement, and gets captured by them (the goblins, not the director). They try to make him eat evil Nilbog ice cream, but his dad shows up and scares them away by threatening to call their parents and tell them that their kids are dressing up in goblin costumes and making lame movies when they should be studying for school. Grandpa Seth, who took time out of his busy schedule of \"being dead\", shows up and hands Jonathan a Molotov cocktail so he can blow up the goblins, which surround his family and chase them into their house. Well, they don't really chase them, they just stand in place while the family runs away. The goblins surround the house (by standing in place) and throw bags of sandwiches onto the porch, which I assume is how goblins traditionally attack their enemies. There's a scene placed in the movie around this point which involves some kid and the Druid eating corn together (which explodes and turns into popcorn), but I'm not going to bring it up because even mentioning it makes my brain hemorrhage. Oh wait, too lateeeesahhf0940945y9h)$))\n\nEventually Jonathan and his family hold a seance to summon the spirit of dead ol' Grandpa Seth, and Jonathan mysteriously appears in the Druid's house. I don't know how, he just teleports there or something. He and Grandpa Seth attempt to kill the entire goblin race by touching the \"Stonehenge Magic Stone\" (I'm not making that name up), but it doesn't work. I though it might be more effective if they just pushed the damn foam rock over onto the Druid lady, but apparently that wasn't a valid option. The goblins storm into the house and make menacing gestures at the kid, but he repels them by taking a bite out of a bologna sandwich that he had in his backpack. Yes, the movie is that stupid. Soon the rest of Jonathan's family shows up, they all touch the Stonehenge Magic Stone of Magical Stonehenge Stone Magic and the goblins all explode and fall over railings. Everything goes back to normal, the family goes home, and the mom gets eaten by goblins (in order to leave the door open for \"Troll 3\", which will probably be about mutant giraffes or something).\n\nIn case you didn't notice, Troll 2 is a very, very, very bad movie. Is so damned bad that there isn't even a single fucking troll anywhere in the film. They manage to pack every bad and embarrassing \"sub b-movie\" clich\u00e9 into one mindless piece of electronic urine. None of the characters exhibit anything that could even remotely be called \"human traits\", and the retards in goblin masks act more like people than the actual actors do. Move over, \"Feeders 2\", there's a new king in town.\n\n1/10",

It's not a direct sequel to the film before it, but it has some very loose connections. It's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, nor is it, as it's referred to by its fans, the \"best worst movie\" out there, but I can see why people enjoy it so much. It's definitely worth repeat viewings and is an enjoyable bad movie. Not everything about it is terrible though. If anything, it's actually pretty well shot. That doesn't count for much when it comes to its content, but everything is in focus and is filmed well. That counts for me. I'd definitely recommend the movie for fans of movies that are so bad that they're good, and I'm sure many will fall in love with its awfulness as so many others already have.",

Joshua's father, on the other hand, is a classical example of a cinematic interpretation of the Freudian ?Primal Father? - elder of the so-called ?Primal Horde?, ?where all of the sons knew that they were equally persecuted by the primal father, and feared him equally? - and  it follows the tradition of famous examples like Shining's Jack Torret, or ?The Godfather? Don Corleone.\nHolly is, despite being only sixteen, is wildly eroticised and objectified by the camera's male gaze. \nShe would like to date a young boy from the neighbourhood, Elliot.\nIn a moment of female empowerment, she tries to seduce him and in consequence reclaim an autonomous state of sexuality, besides her father's means of control.\n\nThey rudely are interrupted by Elliot's friends, representing the homosexual tendencies of typical adolescent desires: but forced by a heterosexual matrix, the boys are only allowed to discover those sensual and emotional depth of their subconsciousness only thinly veiled by the excuse of boyish camaraderie, and only accompanied by a permanent reassurance about one's own heterosexuality ? they might cuddle half-naked in bed together, but they still talk about girls in mini skirts. \nHolly demands him to decide between her and his friends.\n\nThe father announces the next day, the family is going to have a vacation in the rural village of ?Nilgob?, much to his children's dismay, shortly followed after by Elliot and his friends in a caravan.\nSoon after arrival, the family realizes there might be something wrong with the inhabitant's of their idyllic vacation paradise-to-be. \nSoon after, the son once again hallucinates about his Grandfather, who orders Joshua to stop his family from eating the offered food: it is the first scene Joshua encounters the true face of Nilgob's population: ugly, grey-faced monsters living off of humans turned to plant slime.\nJoshua only sees one way to save his relatives from eating said green goo:\nhe urinates on the table.\nBy this phallic act he has fulfilled his grandfather's wish who here represents the absolute bourgeois sovereign,  to commit regicide by symbolically castrating the cruel ruler and establishing civil society.\n\nNear the town lives the mysterious Creedence Leonore Gielgud of Druid Origins, representing sinful, promiscuous female nature and thus a permanent thread to the fragile order of patriarchal reign of pure instrumental, male-connotated reason.\n\nTwo of the boys succumb her succubical suction: one of them is turned into a tree, she lovingly tends and caresses: the young man is forced to embrace effeminacy.\nSince nature in this movie is a symbol of femininity ? of course one might feel inclined to criticise the antiquated display of the female as uncontrolled, elemental, almost even anarchic, force and masculinity as reason, that has to overthrow and subdue nature, even if it's cruel and instrumental ? the Druid compels him to do a drag performance. She wants to make him realize that his idea of gender is mere a social construct that has to be reproduced by everyday actions to maintain the stable power of the heterosexist discourse. \n\nSince he refuses to become a tree willingly, this scene is easily read as a female-to-male rape scene, who are often parts of sexual fantasies experienced by submissive Oedipal characters.\n \nThe other boy is watching the telly, a highly sexualized music video, but the excitement on his face seems shallow ? like he's only watching the video because he is supposed to.\nIn the next scene, Creedence offers him a corn cob ? an obvious metaphor for the phallus.\nThis boy on the other hand embraces his homosexuality ? they both enthusiastically eat the corn cob, which strongly resembles oral sex performaned on a phallic object.\n\nDuring the movie, the family encounters and successfully fights the now goblin-turned villagers. But they only manage to do so with the help of Grandfather Seth, whose ?ghost? is getting stronger and stronger every time he appears.\n\nIn the final quest given by his mentor, Joshua faces both the Druid and his own awakening sexuality, as he enters what appears a giant, glowing vagina: he's re-entering his mother's womb, just to resurrect again now as a grown man.\nHe commands his family to touch the sacred Stonehenge Crystal, Creedence hides in her lair, and in this last act, the family, who, for once sticking together for the greater good, defeat the perilous element.\nJoshua proves himself as a greater, better patriarch than his tyrannous father, who stood helpless against the goblinish embodiment of the threat of castration.\n\nReturned home, everything seems peaceful and quiet, only Joshua isn't able to deal with the traumas witnessed ? it implies, the whole episode in the town of Nilgob was only a fantasy of him to deal with his own awakening sexuality, Elliot's friends nothing but a projection of his own, repressed homosexual desires.\nA fantasy to escape the cruel, abusive reality forced upon him by the Primal Father.\nFirst a strategy to overcome the terror Joshua has to face everyday, his daydreams have become more and more vivid and blur the thinning line between fantasy and reality.\nSince his daydreams are his way to develop his sexuality within a house, where it is controlled by his father, their increased frequency indicates that it has become an urge too strong to control: only the daydreams are left to explore his desires.\nAs we see in the scene in which the goblins return to the seemingly peaceful household and kill his family, ending up devouring Joshua's mother, the camera rests upon the last part of her body that has remained human: her snow-white, maternal breasts.\nOnce again, Freud can be applied here: his daydreams overcome his whole personality, the It overthrows the already broken home: his sexual urges become this forceful, he is n\nThe final cut shows Joshua's horrified face as the goblins turn towards him, leaving an interpretation about the end to the spectator.\n\nThis, as a clever device of postmodern film, that we as the spectators do have the power to write and end for this story ourselves, that we created as discourse,as we name it in a performative utterance as proclaimed by Judith Butler, that we, in conclusion, are nothing but discourse ourselves, written by the matrix of society.\n\nJoshuas daydreams display the prevailing of his unbridled sexuality. The only way his family can be viewed now through the eyes of the compulsive beast as effeminate green goo.\nThe goblins, his subconscious representation of this kind of nature, that only can be expressed as a violent one, finally may swallow Joshua himself.\n\nHe has destroyed his father in an act of feminizing and therefore, in this patriarchal society, destroying his father ? but thus, became in this ironic moment of dethronement, the bigger monster himself.\n\nSummary: ?Troll 2? is fucking deep.",

Suffice it to say his scene carrying little Joshua through the house rhapsodizing the merits of hospitality has to be viewed over and over. It's that good. \nAlso the brilliance of Troll 2, and this can't be overstated, is the irrelevance of a film's title. I finally understand that you can call a movie whatever you want and still create a masterpiece. I am thinking of making a movie about cyborgs taking over a tractor pull and monster truck rally before infiltrating Washington politics and calling it The Many Loves Of Allison. Or Possibly a love story at a nursing home where aliens leave pods that cause the elderly to become young again and call it DIABEETUS 3. The Title doesn't matter. It's the story that will draw in an audience. But whatever I or anyone else creates in the world of cinema it probably won't achieve the mind-blowing brilliance of Troll 2.",

The story is convoluted in the sense that the filmmakers had no idea what to do with the story. The dialogue is anus in every sense of the word. Seriously, not since The Room have I heard such anus-y dialogue in a film. Not to mention the characters are all fucked up. The Mom tells him in the beginning of the film that the kid needs to \"banish\" the dead grandpa from his mind. What a bitch. The father is a closeted homosexual who gets great lines like, \"You can't piss on hospitality!\". In all fairness, the father seems like the only guy trying to act, but that still doesn't make it good. The sister sounds like she's reading a play, and the main kid is about as awful as every other child actor. Let's talk about the scares in this so-called horror film... there are none. All of the attempts to frighten the audience are absolutely hilarious and poorly done. Not to mention tons of throwaway characters that are introduced purely so they can throw in some goblins for a few minutes. Man, this movie is bad. Like REALLY bad. \nOverall: Barely qualifies as a real film and is filled with awful dialogue, acting, writing, directing, EVERYTHING about this movie sucks. It's entertaining to watch and make fun of though. \nFinal Score: 0/10",

I finally took the time to watch one of the most infamously bad movies ever made, and let me tell you, I had a great time.  Don't be put off with how I am rating it, as I am grading it purely from a filmmaking standpoint; it is unintentionally hilarious to the core.  The thing about making a good bad movie is that you can't set out to make a bad movie; if you wink too hard at your audience, the joke ceases to be funny, and then you end up with something like Machete.  You have to have a madman sitting in the director's chair and let it happen naturally, and that's how you wind up with something like Troll 2 or The Room.  Everything about this is fun if you watch it in the right atmosphere, from the clunky exposition to the wooden performances, from the laugh-worthy troll masks and make-up to the drunkenly penned dialogue, there is nothing here that doesn't fail hard.

There's really not much that I can say that hasn't been said already, but here's a start:\n\nThe acting isn't nearly as consistently bad as The Room's, but certain key moments stand out when they become a spectacle of hilarity (see: \"They're eating her...and now they're going to eat me! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD!\"). The storytelling is tremendously weak, and showcases tremendously obvious foreshadowing that any sane person could see. The writing is just plain awful, featuring lines such as \"Nilgob! It's goblin spelled backwards!\" and the immortal \"You can't piss on hospitality!\" And the plot? Oh yeah, don't even get me started. This is a movie about goblins (despite being called Troll 2) that feed people food that makes them sweat/bleed chlorophyll and turns them into half-plant, half-human hybrids, \"the goblins' favorite food\". Yeah. Not even joking. \n\nWhat does elevate this movie to \"so-bad-it's-good\" status are any of the scenes that involve Grandpa Seth or the dad, played by Robery Ormsby and George Hardy, respectively. It's never really explained if Grandpa Seth is a figment of the kids imagination or not, and that just adds to the comedic factor in the movie. Also noteworthy is the horrifyingly creepy shopkeeper, who, if you've watched the documentary based on this film, \"Best Worst Movie\", was actually in a mental institution at the time of filming. Explains quite a bit.\n\nIf there's one person to blame for the astoundingly bad quality of this film, it's Italian director Claudio Fragrasso. If you look up some of the backstory to this film, you'll learn that he thought he knew more about American teenagers than the actual cast and crew, and also thought that he was pretty much the best director of all time. It's pretty clear that he had no clue what he was doing or what constitutes a good movie. \n\nThough Troll 2 isn't nearly as hilariously bad as other unintentional comedies (see: The Room), you can find a lot to have fun with in this movie, even if sometimes it is just boring. I personally didn't think that this film was as notoriously bad as its reputation suggests, but there's still a lot to enjoy when watching Troll 2. \n\n\"They're eating her!

Clearly made on a budget of about $10, it's so hideously, atrociously bad you have to watch it with your mouth agape struggling not to laugh, from the shoddy performances to the pathetic special effects, this movie leaves no stone of badness unturned.\nThe story (or lack of) follows a family of bad, bad actors as they vacation in the small town of Nilbog (Goblin spelt backwards. Yes! Seriously!!) where the Goblins, disguised as townsfolk, want to turn people into plants so they can eat them (the Goblins are Veggies. Yes! Seriously!!)\nFor a movie titled \"Troll 2\", it does seem kind of ironic that not a single troll features in the running time. The original Troll wasn't even that big a hit! It was a lukewarm horror flick which just happened to have a character called Harry Potter in it!\nThis movie has gathered a cult following, simply down to how awful it is, but I could never recommend anyone to watch it, it truly is the Holy Grail of crap movies.",

After finally seeing it, I have to concur. This film is dreadful, but because it is dreadful it is somewhat hilarious. The cinematography and editing are incredibly slip shod and the costumes of the trolls(or shall I say goblins) are quite horrible. The story also meanders all over the place, the script is abysmal and the direction is wretched. Then there is the poor pacing and atrocious acting, and any hopes of any thrills or scares are replaced with scatterings of unintentional laughs and often for the wrong reasons. Overall, it is a dreadful film, but it does have some unintentional entertainment value unlike some of the other bad movies I've seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
