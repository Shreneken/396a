            "content": "Misery is without a doubt one of the best films of the 90's, and in my opinion, Stephen King's best adaptation into a movie. This is TRUE horror, there's no monsters, no mega special effects, just Kathy Bates who is truly made the big time on one of the scariest villains in horror movie history.It's about a man named Paul Sheldon, he's an author, made incredibly famous by his popular books, specially his series called \"Misery\", the books are apparently about a woman in the old days who goes through heavy times in her life and he shares her pain and strength with the readers. When he finishes his last Misery book, he decides to celebrate and is heading back for his daughter's birthday, but he gets caught in a horrible blizzard and gets into a nasty and fatal car accident, but is saved by Kathy Bates, or as we know her Annie.He wakes up in a bedroom with his legs badly broken, bruised up, and cut up, but hears a light and charming voice saying \"You're going to be just fine. I'm your number one fan!\". Annie nurses Paul back to health and says she'll get an ambulance once the storm clears up. She's so lovely and charming, you would never have any clue that she'd even just harm a fly. But when she gets ahold of Paul's last Misery book, she gets infuriated when she finds out that he's killing off Misery and continuing onto more dramatic and dark stories. She makes him write a new Misery where she is resurrected, Paul used to write for a living, now he's writing to stay alive. Discovering slowly how crazy Annie is, he tries to escape more and more, but Annie is so convinced she's in love with him, she'll never let him go! Kathy Bates truly is the amazing star of the film, she is so disturbing to watch. Especially during the \"hobbing\" scene, she breaks Paul's legs again, she makes it seem so innocent, but it's HORRIFYING to watch! Both her and James worked so well together and were just incredible. The movie is so awesome, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone! It's a movie not to be missed.10/10",

In one scene the horror is very clear, you will know what scene I mean.Writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets in a car accident. He is helped by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who claims she is his number one fan. In his latest novel Sheldon has killed the favorite character of Annie making her a little mad. She keeps Sheldon in her home; he has to bring the character back to life in his next novel.Bates, who won an Oscar, is terrific as Annie, one of her finest performances. James Caan who is in bed or a wheelchair most of the film is very convincing. The room he is living in is one of those spaces in the movies you will not forget very soon. Directed by Rob Reiner this is a great film, although it could be a bit slow for some from time to time.",

            "content": "MISERY is another in a handful of excellent movie adaptations of Stephen King novels. This film's actually preferable to the original book, as good as it is, because Rob Reiner's direction is outstanding and heavily influenced by Hitchcock. Essentially this film is a two-hander between two great performers at the top of their game. Kathy Bates deservedly got an Oscar for her role as the seemingly mild-mannered Annie Wilkes while James Caan is equally good, one of those tough guy actors completely convincing as a vulnerable, crippled figure. This single location thriller is miles and miles ahead of King's second attempt at the genre, GERALD'S GAME, which was also turned into a poor film. It's slowly paced but absolutely riveting, making you really feel for and care about the protagonist as if you're there in the room with him. The changes from the book are for once superior, toning down the needless gore and saving most of the violence for two crucial scenes which have more impact as a result. The comedy relief between the sheriff and his wife turns out to be the icing on an already-fine cake.",

            "content": "Misery is without a doubt one of the finest movies of the 90's and one of the best movies in the thriller genre. It is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense and cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing and exquisite performances. In my opinion Misery is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King's works and truly a movie that cannot be missed, especially for the genre fans.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the author of a successful series of romance novels about a character called Misery, who decides to take a more serious approach regarding his future novels. On his way to publish his new manuscript, Paul drives from his hotel in Silver Creek to New York. Due to the extreme weather conditions, he has an accident that leaves him severely injured and hopeless. A local nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) finds Paul and brings him to her remote home in order to help him recover. Claiming to be his number one fan, Annie discovers that in his last Misery novel her favorite character dies and then her obsession about him takes a dark and twisted turn as a long story of captivity and abuse begins.The direction by Rob Reiner is phenomenal and on a Hitchcockian level as the film has a plethora of perfectly crafted suspenseful moments that have the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the amazing climax. The editing of the movie is also flawless, as the shots are specifically designed to induce tension in any moment they can. The cinematographer and Reiner both ace the perilous atmosphere of the picture, using close up shots of the moonfaced Wilkes both in her fits of rage and kindness which magnifies the polar extremes that Wilkes is prone to unexpectedly visit. What is also triumphed is the slow convergence of the audience and Paul Sheldon. The movie received a lot of critical acclaim, especially due to Kathy Bates' chilling and memorable performance as Anny Wilkes that earned her the 1990's leading actress Oscar award, which remains the only Oscar ever given to a Stephen King film adaptation. No matter how great Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning performance is, James Caan's cannot go unnoticed as it definitely qualifies as one of the best performances in his extensive career, despite how demanding and challenging his role as Paul Sheldon was.In conclusion, Misery is a dark and tense masterpiece that is an amalgamation of excellent direction, skillful writing, taut editing, amazing cinematography and stellar performances, which succeeds into creating the feeling of captivity and helplessness that the thriller genre was purposefully built for, and that makes it one of the best movies of the 90's and one absolute classic in its genre.",

A close runner up is Stand By Me, but for suspense and tension that just gets tighter and tighter, watch Misery.  Kathy Bates can go from nice and cheerful to downright crazy like someone turning on a light switch.  While watching James Caan suffer through the torture that Bates puts him through, you can't help but sympathize with the guy.  Rob Reiner presents us with the problem, and he slowly escalates the tension and the dread that creeps over the movie.  Even though the book was different in the \"hobbling\" process, Annie Wilkes' method of hobbling still gives me the chills whenever I watch it.",

            "content": "I remember last year finally actually meeting my personal celebrity crush and it was great. But after autographs and pictures he went his way and I went mine. There's a line between being a fan and being a freak. Which is a line that Kathy Bates erased with her Oscar winning performance in Misery. In her disturbed mind the chance of a lifetime came when author James Caan who writes Stephen King like novels comes to her town and she follows him out one winter night when he drove his car into a ditch.I'm not sure that rescue is quite the word for what Bates does to Caan. She frees him from the wreck and brings him home and gives him needed medical aid as she is a trained nurse. But with two broken legs and a broken arm, Caan's pretty much at her mercy.And then woe betide poor Caan when Bates discovers a draft of his latest work where he is killing off a favorite character. It's like Arthur Conan Doyle trying to kill off Sherlock Holmes and in fact he did try, but was forced by public outcry to bring him back.But Caan's facing a most demanding public of one. He gets under her tutelage to rewrite his work. In the mean time the fact he's missing is of national news. It's like if John LeCarre or Nelson DeMille went missing. The car is found and sheriff Richard Farnsworth has his suspicions.Which brings me to the only weakness of the story. I can't believe that he did not bring those suspicions with the evidence he had to the state police and eventually not have backup when he decides to act on his suspicions. He only confides in wife Frances Sternhagen and she's not much help.Stephen King has written any number of novels with monsters and other worldly creatures, but this story is pretty horrific all by itself, especially when the only monster here is a human one. Bates and Caan are great pair of antagonists. Misery is a great story about obsessed fans and what they can do.",

            "review_title": "The best horror film ever adapted from a Stephen King book",
            "content": "\"Misery\" accomplishes something which Hitchcock achieved in \"Psycho\" but which very few modern horror films achieve: it entertains without seeming exploitative. Even the movie's most gruesome scene, which ranks up there as one of the more memorably horrifying moments in all of cinema, ends with a laugh that somehow doesn't cheapen the material--maybe because it arises so naturally from the basic situation which the movie takes very seriously. We're not being urged to find the violence itself entertaining, as is the case for so many horror films these days. Rather, the humor is a way of breaking the tension of a desperate, nightmarish scenario. It is, we suspect, what helps the protagonist survive the ordeal.Like many of the greatest thrillers, \"Misery\" begins with a bizarre set of coincidences. A bestselling romance novelist named Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is on his way to the countryside to work on his next book when a blizzard causes his car to crash, leaving him severely injured and unable to walk. Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a retired nurse and obsessive fan who was following him, takes care of him in her house without letting him leave or contact anyone. She is upset that he has recently killed off a central character in his series, and she forces him to write the new book more to her liking, though in total isolation from the outside world. His family and friends fear him dead, but the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) is investigating a little more closely.\"Misery\" belongs to a unique genre in which a single character is trapped in a small area and spends the entire story attempting to escape. I've been fascinated by this type of story ever since I first read Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" With his fine attention to detail, Stephen King has made two notable contributions to the genre: \"Misery,\" and the unfilmable \"Gerald's Game\" (where a woman spends the entire novel handcuffed to a bed in the middle of nowhere). Everything is topsy-turvy in a story like this. The protagonist must adapt to a weird new set of rules that put a diabolical twist on normal routines. To most people, a house is a mundane setting where you wake up every day and leave without blinking an eye. For a house to become a prison seems almost unthinkable. Stories like \"Misery\" have the urgency of a nightmare, where the thing you fear most is always on the verge of happening.In particular, this movie has much in common with the 1962 suspense drama \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (which I recommend). The basic structure of the story is the same, involving a disabled person in the house of an insane woman, who subjects her captive to physical and psychological tortures while almost everyone on the outside doesn't even know the victim exists. But in the older film, the motives were simpler, rooted in sibling jealousy and old wounds. \"Misery\" brings the conceit to a new level by making the captive a famous writer and the kidnapper a crazed fan. The movie makes much of the irony that she's a pretty good editor. She's not really sadistic or vengeful, as was the case with the Bette Davis character in \"Baby Jane.\" The tortures she inflicts on Paul are the natural result of her trying to fit him into her bizarre little world.Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her performance, one of only three horror performances ever to receive that award. (The other two are Fredric March for \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" and Anthony Hopkins for \"Silence of the Lambs.\") One of the best actresses working today, she's fortunate not to have been typecast in this sort of role. She later proved herself quite adept at playing vulnerable women, like the battered wife in \"Dolores Claiborne.\" She brings to the role of Annie a certain earthiness that you don't expect in this kind of role. She plays the character as a woman who doesn't perceive herself as insane, who acts bubbly and cheerful most of the time and seems to view her sudden mood shifts as merely a personal weakness. At times, the movie almost comes off as a demented parody of a normal relationship between a man and woman living together.The very best of the Stephen King horror movies, \"Misery\" is a film which I count among my favorites even though it is so intense I sometimes have trouble sitting through the whole thing. With a screenplay by William Goldman, who has a knack for developing bizarre torture scenes (the Nazi dentist torture in \"Marathon Man,\" the Machine in \"The Princess Bride\"), the movie manages to be scary and classy at the same time--a rare feat for a modern horror picture. Kathy Bates is in my nightmares!",

            "content": "Horror movies generally aren't my cup of tea, but people have always talked about how great Misery is. So I decided to give it a look when it came on TV today. All I can say is that I was definitely not disappointed; this was an amazing movie.Misery is the story of writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan), who is driving through a snowstorm after just having finished his newest novel. The car crashes, and it seems that Paul will die, trapped in his car in the snow in a deserted forest, when he is rescued by a mysterious stranger. She turns out to be Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a former nurse who dresses his wounds and gives him a comfortable bed. In addition, it turns out that Annie is Paul's self-proclaimed Number 1 Fan. Specifically, she is obsessed with the Misery Chastain series, Paul's major claim to fame. Annie keeps Paul in an isolated room for days, then weeks, as the outside world searches for him. Eventually, when Annie objects to the content of Paul's latest manuscript, and when she has a hysterical reaction to the death of Misery in the latest novel, Paul (and the audience) come to see that there may be something wrong with Annie.Caan and Bates were absolutely stunning in their performances. The vast majority of this movie focused on them, so it was crucial that they both be able to convey the sense that something horrific was going on. It was no surprise that Kathy Bates won the Best Actress Oscar for her role. Everything in this movie really worked to show just how trapped Paul was, and how hopeless his situation seemed. And of course, this movie left a few indelible images in the mind. (One in particular comes to mind, and I really wish that I hadn't seen that scene previously on some other TV show; that almost took away from the impact of seeing it in context.) So, if you are a fan of suspenseful fare, or you just want to see a horror movie (mostly) sans blood and guts, Misery is for you. You will never, ever want to hear anyone say that they're a fan of yours again.",

While there were really no subplots or few twists, the story really grabs your attention with the tension, suspense and well-pacing of the course of events. Kathy Bates' outstanding portrayal in the role of Annie Wilkes is something to reckon with; she grows on the audiences from her seemingly sweet personality at first after rescuing Paul Sheldon, then, creeps everybody out as you see her mental instability progress from obsession to threatening.The suspense of Annie's unpredictability to Paul's no-escape predicament is a good edge-if-your-seat experiment.

            "review_title": "Trapped, Tortured & Terrorised",
            "content": "With most of the action set in one room and involving only two people, this tense psychological thriller is more like a stage-play than a movie. Fortunately, this style of presentation works well in establishing the claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of unease that prevails throughout this tale of an unfortunate man who, through no fault of his own, is held captive by a psychotic woman. The physical pain and mental torment that he suffers is dreadful and the journey that he makes through his personal nightmare is both harrowing and compelling to watch.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a highly successful writer whose numerous romantic novels featuring his heroine, Misery Chastain, have all been best-sellers. Having grown tired of writing this type of material, he'd recently been working on his first serious novel and on completing his manuscript, sets out from Silver Creek Lodge in Colorado and drives down a mountain road in a snowstorm to deliver his work to his agent. As the conditions worsen and the road becomes more slippery, he loses control of his car which rolls down a bank and into a snowdrift where he ends up unconscious with two broken legs, a dislocated shoulder and numerous other injuries.Local Woman Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) discovers the wreckage and pulls Paul out of the vehicle before taking him to her isolated home where she starts to nurse him back to health. When he regains consciousness, Paul is grateful for what Annie's done and soon learns that she's a trained nurse and a devoted fan who feels privileged to have him staying at her home. She tells him that because of the storm, the roads are closed and the telephones are out of action, so she's unable to inform anyone immediately of his whereabouts. Annie's obviously a lonely person and acts rather coyly and politely at this stage.After reading Paul's just-completed manuscript, she changes radically, becomes very angry and expresses her strong disgust at the amount of swearing it contains. A little later, when she also reads his newly-released Misery Chastain novel, she becomes outraged when she discovers that he's killed off her favourite character (Misery) and feels betrayed by him. She uses her dominance over him to make him burn his new manuscript and write a new novel in which Misery is brought back to life. As her behaviour continues to become increasingly violent and unhinged, Paul tries to go along with what she wants as far as possible whilst also trying to devise a way of escaping his hellish ordeal.Annie Wilkes is a highly eccentric character who's initially very ingratiating but later becomes completely deranged and horribly violent. With her pet pig (called Misery), her love of Liberace's recordings and an obsessive need to control Paul, the scope for any actress who portrays her is obviously enormous. Kathy Bates, in her Oscar-winning performance, does an amazing job of bringing this complex woman to life and James Caan, whose character is so helpless and physically constrained throughout, skilfully overcomes these limitations to make Paul a very sympathetic victim. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen add some light relief as the local sheriff and his wife and Lauren Bacall is also excellent in her cameo role as Paul's agent.The way in which the action unfolds on-screen is vital to the success of this movie and director Rob Reiner's brilliant pacing plays a big part in building up the mood and tension so effectively. There are some shocking moments such as the shooting of one of the story's minor characters and the infamous \"sledgehammer scene\" but more surprisingly, maybe, there's also a certain amount of humour to enjoy.",

Of course, this is Stephen King, so we know there are Bates types around every corner. I felt, as I watched this play out, that I was punishing myself. What else could she do to him without killing him. The only other movie I felt this way about was the top horror movie of its year, \"The Passion of the Christ,\" where Mel Gibson used every torture device and weapon to beat on Jesus's body before he was crucified.

Tension is kept mostly throughout (there are some predictable moments...but who cares?) And the performances are also a major plus.  James Caan is very easy to empathize with, and he manages to keep his cynical sense of humor. Richard Farnsworth, as a grizzled sheriff was a nice addition to the film since his character didn't exist in the book.  He also has a nice sense of humor, and he's the kind of guy who you want to root for.  But the most amazing performance is from Kathy Bates, who treads a fine line alternating between sweet and lovable to amazingly evil.  She won an Oscar for this movie, and whole-heartedly deserved it.Side note:  This is one of the few films which took an Oscar, that you can actually say the Academy had the guts to give out.

We get nasty bruised and bloody legs 2 bloody gunshot wounds, head is bashed in by a typewriter, and other various objects,nasty broken feet by a sledgehammer. The Acting is Oscar Worthy!. Kathy Bates is AMAZING here, she is extremely creepy, and was mentally unstable, she reminded me a bit of Norman bates (not quite as creepy), she is especially , scary near the end, what a performance!, she definitely deserved her Oscar!. James Caan is OUTSTANDING here, he gave an almost Oscar worthy performance here, as the poor sap author, i really felt for his character,and i was rooting him on!. Richard Farnsworth is good with what he has to do as the Sheriff. Overall A MUST SEE,Classic! for everyone see it now!",

James Caan and Kathy Bates lead this terrifically acted adaptation of King's beloved novel, and do it with great ease. Bates is great at portraying the dangerous mood swings of her character, adn Caan great at trying to survive them. Their emotion, pain, and true effort they put into their characters is truly outstanding, and most certainly y favorite thing about the film. At times it can certainly be very thrilling, but other times the tone seems to fall flat, and become nothing short of dull. However, this is often saved by giving other plot points their well deserved treatment, and Reiner is able to keep the film alive with truly utilizing its strengths. In the end, Misery is not great, but a fairly good adaptation from one of my own favorite authors (although i'm hardly a #1 fan). It's acting is incredible, and though it may prove to be totally unstable from time to time, it finds its footing often enough to truly prove itself worthwhile.\nMy Rating: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Kathy Bates went from respected stage actress, occasional film and TV character actress to Oscar winning star of this unforgettable horror film if a real kind. James Caan gives a truly subtle performance as a famous novelist of a beloved series of books (leading character's name Misery) who is stuck on a way to end the series he's tired of writing. After making a drastic decision, he heads out into the snowy wilderness with the only copy and is involved in a serious car accident. By the twist of the fate of the unlucky, he's rescued by Bates' Annie, a sheltered nurse, who takes him in and thanks to her training brings him around. Annie is also his self proclaimed number one fan, and in gratitude, he makes the mistake of allowing her to read the manuscript. It's a decision he'll rue for the remainder of his life. This film instantly brought itself to the forefront of parody, from Roseanne in the Bates role in one spoof and another having Mia Farrow holding Woody Allen hostage in a similar way. That one was called \"Miasery\". A Kathy Bates look-alike cousin of mine (also a nurse) once told me that she brought a well known patient of hers their medication and told them that she was their number one fan, having noticed the shock on their face and knowing what the shock was all about. After a short lived Broadway version of this Steven King classic, revisiting the movie shows how practically perfect the film is. Bates is the best female psycho villain since Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction\". There are great supporting performances by Lauren Bacall as Caan's agent, Richard Farnsworth as the local sheriff who suspects something amiss, and Frances Sternhagen as his plain talking wife. Along with the snowy photography, constant suspense and dark humor, they turn \"Misery\" into a darn good gripping thriller.",

However, with that said Kathy Bates takes the material and runs with it all the way to the bank.  This film made her a household name and provided her with a Best Actress Oscar in 1990.  She stars as a crazed fan who cares for author James Caan after he's involved in a near-fatal auto accident in the middle of nowhere.  Quickly her mood goes from cheerful to downright frightening when she learns that Caan's fictional heroine \"Misery\" will die in his newest novel.  Caan's character is not very well developed and this somewhat stalls the film, but it really does not matter because of Bates's performance.  All in all, \"Misery\" is one of Stephen King's novels that actually plays well on film.  If Bates were taken away, I am not sure how this film would fare.  Thank goodness we do not have to find out.  4 out of 5 stars",

            "content": "Writer William Goldman and director Rob Reiner do Hitchcock proud with this one. It has all the elements: a seemingly innocent place and situation invaded by a growing sense of sinister dread until a breathtaking climax. The intelligent script is peppered with moments that will either make you cringe or make you laugh, depending on how morbid your sense of humor is. It is a harrowing movie to watch the first time around. The crew has done a good job of making you feel Paul Sheldon's pain. Few films torture the audience like this one. In fact, I venture to say this is the best film of its kind since \"Psycho\" thirty years earlier.The acting is good all-round. Farnsworth steals every scene he's in with his sardonic and relentless sheriff - he did not get enough accolades for what would have been a routine part in a lesser actor's hands. Caan is solid and underplays beautifully, and the inimitable Kathy Bates carries the film with her alternately hysterical or ridiculously-sappy Annie, the psychotic Sheldon fan. Her performance is a throwback to Hollywood's old days - it's not subtle, not quiet, and borders on over-acting. This is not method acting, this is showing off. But Bates makes it work, investing Annie with enough pitifulness to make the character complex and, thus, hold the role together. This movie is famous, of course, for making Kathy Bates an overnight sensation as everybody went into the movie wanting to see what Sonny Corleone looked like as an older man, but left with accolades for Kathy Bates on their lips. She is absolutely terrifying and unforgettable in this role and perfect for it. Brilliant performance that elevated a 7-star thriller to 9-10 classic status.",

He completes the manuscript of Misery Chastain's final story and heads back to the city from his remote lodge. However on the way he crashes his car and it is only the intervention of a strange that saves him from death. He wakes up with broken legs in the house of Annie Wilkes who is now nursing him back to health while the storm rages outside. All seems find until Annie reads Paul's new book and, as a big Misery fan, is horrified to find that he has killed her. Keeping him just where he is, Annie demands that he rewrite the book and continue the story, becoming all the more unreasonable the more Paul resists.The old adage goes that if you must adapt a Stephen King story then make it one of the short ones rather than one of his tomes, however with Misery director Reiner takes one of his novels and makes it into a wonderfully tight thriller. The plot is very simple but the film makes the most of it, turning out a battle between the two minds that only occasionally spills over into a physical battle. The characters are well written and well delivered and it is they that drive the film forward. Of course it is the cast that makes a massive difference and in that regard Misery really gets it spot on.Caan returned from the acting wilderness he had been in during the eighties with a great turn where you can feel his frustration and desperation at his situation. However it is Bates that steals the show with a fantastic performance that is convincing whether she is in \"golly gosh\" or crazy mode, indeed it is the successful juxtaposition of these that makes the film that much more tense. She could have been hammy and OTT but she balances it very well and makes her convincing and yet unhinged. These two are the whole film but Farnsworth and Sternhagen make a nice little addition in their scenes while Lauren Bacall adds more star power to the film whether it needed it or not.Overall a very tense and engaging tale that is told with a nice air of menace by Rob Reiner. The writing is good but it is key that both Caan and Bates turn in great performances in the lead two roles \u0096 bringing the mental battle and instability of Annie to life in a consistently tense fashion.",

            "content": "No, famed novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) known for his successful series of novels involving a character called Misery Chastain didn't get out of his car when it crash in Colorado during a blizzard. The reasons why is for his legs are broken and a dislocated shoulder. He is rescued by Nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) and brought to her remote home, bedridden and incapacitated. He soon finds out that Annie is his number one fan and talks a lot about his novels. When Annie get a hold of Paul's newest works, she become enraged in many factors, but one really got to her. That one was Paul wanting to branch out and wanted to try something new, so he killed off Misery in his latest book, Misery's Child. She wasn't going to allow it, so she forced write a new novel entitled Misery's Return in which he brings the character back to life. Paul reluctantly does, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. The character that James Caan plays in this film is so realistic. He realizes very quickly that he's dealing with a psychopath who likes to be in control when he studied psychological disorders as part of his research for the Misery series. He knows how to butter her up, to keep her mind at ease as much as possible. He realizes that the way to get out is to treat her with respect & act like he understands her & that he's on her side. He figured what he had to do from this minute to the next, to the next. Yet he took risks, exploring the area and trying to escape. Using the type-writer as a weight to work out his shoulder and strength is smart. Sheldon is enormously witty and clever. Most victims in movies are just hopeless and stupid. The audience will feel for him because of that reason. He would have to be strong, to survive Annie Wilkes. Kathy Bates is best suited for the mercurial psychopathic role of Wilkes. Wilkes can be describe as a American yandere. Wilkes is gentle and care for a lot before their romantic devotion becomes mentally destructive in nature, often through violence and brutality. She subjects him to a series of physical and psychological tortures throughout the film. Bates makes Wilkes out to be a cunning, brutal and dangerously disturbed woman who hides her psychosis behind a cheery facade while displays obsessive-compulsive personality disorder by using with childishly strange words and phrases when expressing anger. Kathy Bates won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role. The supporting cast is made out to be one man, local sheriff, Buster (Richard Farnsworth) whom is investigating Paul's disappearance. The character rarely gives anything to the plot and personal wasn't needed in the film: pointless. Misery is a Rob Reiner film that based on the Stephen King's 1987 novel. There are some different between the film and book. For instance, the book was more violence to Paul. In the book, when Paul mentions that her typewriter is missing a key, Annie cuts off his thumb. Rather than hobbling him, in the book, Annie cuts off his foot. Buster is also treated with more violence in his death with her riding over his body with a lawnmower. In the book, Paul become an addict to painkillers and finish writing 'Fast Cars'. In the film, Paul becomes successful with his book 'Higher Education of Phillip J. Stone'. One of Stephen King's inspirations for Misery was the reaction his fans had to The Eyes of the Dragon. The fans rejected The Eyes of the Dragon because of its lack of horror. Paul Sheldon feeling chained to the Misery books by his fans was a metaphor for his feeling chained to horror fiction. As a horror/ thriller movie it works. People still cringe during the \"hobbling\" scene. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata was such a good choice as background music. The whole movie has a sense of tongue in cheek about it. Director Rob Reiner did a good job on it. The camera work is very similar to Alfred Hitchcock. Perhaps because the way King wrote the protagonist as immobilized in a wheel chair, Reiner purposely wanted to make allusions to Rear Window. Allot of the disorienting angles and suspense scenes reminded people of Psycho too. Some people might hate the ending since it different from the book. Endings are pretty hard to manage in general, because everyone kind of has their own expectations and predictions of how the story should end. It's especially difficult if you've invested a lot into the story. If it doesn't end the way you think it should have, you get disappointed. This is an intriguing notion, the craziness of fans. I suppose it echoes the surprise Annie Wilkes felt when she read that Misery was killed off. Critics are like that. A great movie that stirs the pot.",

            "content": "\u00ab Misery \u00bb is one of the most terrifying cinematic experiences, an excellent thriller served by two great performances when it could have been a risky campy B-movie with an over the top villain and a too pathetic protagonist: a credit to Stephen King whose fertile imagination brought up one of the vilest female characters and to Rob Reiner who casted Kathy Bates, as the woman-next-door embodiment of this wicked cruelty. James Caan also deserves half of the praise for his portrayal of Paul Sheldon, the poor writer whose misfortune was to have a car accident and to be saved by his number one fan, the kind of fans that would make any artist wish to vanish into anonymity forever.Annie Wilkes is Paul's number one fan, thanks to his most iconic fictional character, Misery Chastain, for which she seems to dedicate all her soul and reading hours. Annie is the most frightening type of villain, simply because she seems so vulnerable, so sweet and ordinary with her chubby face, her less than average beauty (Kathy Bates is far more prettier) and her clothes, no one would have suspected how twisted is her mind, and how fanatic she is. Indeed, she is a fan, in the creepiest meaning of the word. No one, not even poor Paul Sheldon who had just concluded the last opus of his \"Misery\" series, in which he decided that Misery would die giving birth. A symbolic way to turn the page of Misery, but one finger won't let this page be turned. Obviously, the end of Misery doesn't seem to please Annie, who'll gradually let some signs of craziness slipping and announcing the worst for Paul Sheldon, whose misery, sorry for the pun, has just begun. After smiling, serving breakfast, shaving him, telling touching amusing anecdotes and reading the first pages then finishing the book, the nightmare begins, and what a nightmare! Imagine a very hurting experience, the kind you wouldn't wish not even to your enemies, well, Paul endured them. First, immobilization, you can't move, your body is totally dependent, dependent of your enemy, who's not only creepy but also totally wacko. Secondly, you can't cry for help, you can't call anyone, no one can hear you; it's a mix between \"Alien\" and \"Baby Jane\". Yet, the claustrophobia is not the only fascinating aspect of the film. The most intriguing thing, and what makes \"Misery\" so memorable and impacting is the love and hate relationship between Annie and Paul, which wouldn't have been so perfectly illustrated by average actors, not even prestigious ones, Caan and Bates share this ordinary look that helps us to identify with the situation. So for some reason, Paul and Annie's story had this tragic element that provokes romances and destroys them. Paul was doomed from the beginning for having increased Annie's madness through the character of Misery. It's not a hazard if Annie saved him, she followed him, probably sooner or later, they would have met. She would even have wanted to kill him, had he published the infamous story where Misery dies. I guess Paul was lucky to meet his number one fan so soon, and he was lucky she wasn't her number two fan because that's precisely why she asked Paul to destroy his creation and resurrect Misery, an indirect way to maintain him alive, to make him useful, a temporary salvation for a slower death. After destroying his own creation, which is a very clever metaphor referring to Annie Wilkes' previous crimes. Annie kills Paul's baby and helps him to create another story, where Misery is alive. She loves Paul, and the new Misery story will be the fruit of this twisted passion.And after Paul's abortion, starts a long and painful rewriting of a story with his life at stakes. He wrote for a living, now, not to die, trying to figure out every way to escape. The film is a sinister and disturbing experience, where the performance of the two actors help us to feel the biggest empathy for Paul and to despise and fear Annie with so much intensity we know this will lead to a gruesome and brutal climax (Annie is obviously not the kind of villains you get rid of so easily). And because of this feeling of an imminent death, because living next to such a psychopath is already an agonizing psychological torture, \"Misery\" is the kind of thrillers that totally delivers its premise. The claustrophobia, when we follow Paul's attempt to escape or to neutralize Annie, the panic when we see her coming. This works because of an excellent directing, editing, and writing that creates a multi-layered combination of stories within the film, the story of Misery, and probably Stephen King's personal writer's phobia. Misery seems to be a reminiscence of Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\", she fascinates and inspires Annie's most evil instincts, she irritates Paul who doesn't want to be associated with her name forever, and she grabs the interest of the one who'll indirectly save Paul, the one I'd like to call the real hero of the film, Sheriff 'Buster' whose death still haunt me. Another great performance by the late Richard Farnsworth, who made me hate Annie even more.Yes, there is something exceptionally Hitchcockian in \"Misery\", something, the master of suspense would have probably be proud to make. It's creepy, brutal, violent and the thrills are provided by those moments we're put in Paul's shoes, except maybe for a particular one where we prefer to keep our feet in a safer place. A few movies have this Hitchcockian feeling (another that comes to mind is \"Blood Simple\") and \"Misery\" is one of the most unforgettable thrillers, thanks to an extraordinary villain, so traumatizing we can only breath after she dies, just like her fetish character, dying giving birth \u0085 to a story no one will ever read.",

            "content": "MISERY - 1990Directed by Rob ReinerStarring James Caan, Kathy Bates and Richard FarnsworthPlot Overview: After his car crashes on an icy day, renowned author, Paul Sheldon(James Caan) is picked up by sweet seeming Nurse, Annie Wilkes(Kathy Bates), whom all happens to be his number 1 fan. All is going well until Wilkes reads the end of the latest instalment of her favourite series and discovers her favourite character has met her end. In a psychotic twist, Wilkes turns against Sheldon and forces him to rewrite the story with a different ending.THIS is a good thriller. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire run time of this movie. I didn't even know I could bite that far down on my nails! It is a masterfully written, sensationally acted, expertly shot and edited masterpiece. It is truly exceptional. I cannot recommend this movie any more. Please see this wonderful movie.The plot of this movie is horrifying. King is known for his horror but what is more scary than being at the mercy of some psychotic nurse who is your only chance of survival and can end your life at any moment. You can't escape; you can't fight back; it's you and her and there is nothing you can do about it. THAT is a scary. That is a trademark of great horror. Sometimes a great horror/thriller doesn't need ghosts or an overabundance of gore. It just needs a terrifying idea and it is instantly effective.To say one minor issue I have in regards to the story, it is a little plot hole to do with the end. It makes, no logical sense and I would have liked some more explanation; just a throwaway line or two, explaining what happened. I understand the jist of it but I can't say what I would like explaining without spoiling the film and I will not do that because you need to see this film.Kathy Bates is equally hilarious and terrifying in this Oscar worthy portrayal of Annie Wilkes. She commands this movie and enjoys every, single second it it. It is truly a remarkable performance and 100% deserved the Oscar.A performance that goes under-looked in this film due to Bates' focus that I think is unjust is James Caan's excellent performance as Paul Sheldon. Obviously, Bates is the star of this film and gives the best performance but Caan gives an incredible performance as well. He has to act while acting and that will be a genuinely hard thing to make convincing.Richard Farnsworth is excellent as Buster(the sheriff). The back and fourth humour between him and his wife is perfect and really helps give you time to breathe amidst the intensity going on around you.Both the cinematography and editing in this movie are superb. They help give the film a tight focus and an eerie claustrophobic feel. It makes the film all the more terrifying. Both the costume and set design are excellent, also and give a sense of authenticity to the film.Overall, I absolutely adore this movie. It is a masterfully crafted thriller and I cannot recommend it any more. You have to see this movie without spoilers because it truly is terrifying. This movie is a masterpiece and thus I shall rate it 10 Sledgehammers out of 10.",

Misery has a very thin cast and relies on the screen presence and dialogue of Kathy Bates and James Caan to execute a quality movie. Bates especially, to pull off the compelling, outright switch of extreme personalities changes is a difficult feat that was accomplished superbly. Another part of the film's approach is to focus on precise details of scenes, character actions, mannerisms, props, setting and authenticity. At times some scenes and dialogue almost seem excessive in length, slowing down the film. Seriously, the plot of his Misery books gets in the intensity of the film. However, the film has some great payoffs with a few scenes, one being extraordinarily memorable. Misery is an excellent film that requires patience, empathy and respect to its context in time.",

            "content": "Misery is not just one of the more sublime examples of how to get a fulfilling adaptation out of a novel by Stephen King, but also one of the prime examples of Rob Reiner's gifts as a director. He previously had made Stand by Me, an adaptation of King's story the Body, and his storytelling skills are at a level that he only so often matched up to (thanks in part to a better-than-average script from Goldman, which one could mark as his best King adaptation as well, by far). Reiner, with Barry Sonnenfeld coming off of three of the Coen brothers best films, harnesses genuine suspense through little details, but at the same time also has a very macabre sense of humor about the proceedings. The material is like a crazy Lifetime movie done by Alfred Hitchcock, with the source always very obviously- and lovingly- King.The premise is a batch of not-quite-coincidences; a writer of a pulp trash series called Misery (James Caan) drives from his Maine retreat with a new book, and crashes his car in a blizzard. Pulled from a wreck by some mysterious person, it turns out to be what looks like a kind-hearted lady, Anne (Kathy Bates), who patches up his leg and keeps him in a comfy bed. But it doesn't last long as being simply 'kind-hearted'; very quickly she turns on a dime like a schizophrenic, and she can't stand the ending of his new book. She makes him rewrite it, after burning the old one, and it becomes a tale of two people who can't stand each other (though Anne gets turned on, in the greatest sado-masochistic sense, in the wretched \"Hobbing\" scene), and who can't break away- one by some twisted dementia of \"God-told-me-to\", one by the fact that he's tied to the bed &/or his legs/ankles are shot to hell. Can the old sheriff (Richard Farnsworth, always great to see him) solve the mystery in time? Beneath the heavy psychological implications laid out, sometimes at a wonderfully over-the-top pitch (watch as Bates freaks out at a plot point and tells of a time she saw a \"chapter\" from a Rocketeer movie), other times more sinister, or even sad in a pathetic way ('the rain gives me the blues' scene), it's the acting that pulls it through. Bates's is electrifying, as might be taken for granted for some, because she's doesn't lose the truth of the character; like Jack Nicholson's portrayal, in a way to compare, it's a part that the actor believes oneself in all the time, and so it goes wherever willing. Brave, to be sure, though also a delicate tightrope to walk so as to not go too much into overkill (which, if one saw Dreamcatcher one knows where Goldman can go wrong with King). But lest not forget Caan, in maybe one of his very best performances, where a lot of time he just gives 'what-the-bleep' looks on his face, or subtle ones where he feeds the mind-set of Annie as he plots any kind of escape or subterfuge like with the smudge-paper. If Bates is exceptional, so is he, as they have an equal partnership, in a sense, in keeping their scenes so well together.Plus, as mentioned, it ends up being hysterically funny, even in places unexpected (the tension between Sheriff and Deputy, who are also husband and wife, is very amusing). It doesn't go completely into camp either- try as it might to go into the realm of the ridiculous here and there with some of the lines and such, it's the extreme nature of the story, every little step that reveals coincidence and chance broken, or a little mistake taken, that alleviates some awkward tension. Few modern thrillers accomplish that, and even when it veers into becoming too much of a violent twist at the climax (Fatal Attraction ending, anyone?) it's still a helluva lot of fun, and at times great cinema on the obsessive nature of creating, and how a whole other momentum takes place in control and absurdism played straight - crazily straight.",

But I will say this: even if you haven't read a word of King's tome, I don't believe your ranking would go any lower--only higher.For a very basic overview, \"Misery\" tells the story of author Paul Sheldon (James Caan), whose car slides off a snowy mountain road after finishing a book and is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates)--his self-proclaimed \"#1 fan\". The problem? Annie is also crazy, meaning Sheldon is in for the fight of his life strictly to survive.As book-to-film adaptations go, this belongs on the better end of that equation. It captures the key events of the book quite well, is legitimately unsettling on a number of occasions, and the acting is fantastic (Bates especially as the loony Wilkes). Nothing boring or ho-hum to be found here. While it doesn't quite capture the author metaphors that King litters throughout his text, I won't even fault director Rob Reiner for that here, as the visceral nature of the scenario is the focus on screen.Actually, the biggest issue that kept \"Misery\" from jumping up another star ranking was its uneven tone at times. It seems as if the filmmakers couldn't quite decide if they wanted to make a dark comedy, or a taut psychological thriller. They basically split the difference, and sometimes that can be a bit jarring or off-putting.Overall, though, \"Misery\" is a solid film that deserves a solid ranking. It may not be one of my favorites of all-time or anything like that, but it certainly is a classic that I have enjoyed multiple times.",

Like several of his novels, the protagonist is a writer (Secret Window also has a tortured novelist). King's tendency to use his novels in the '80s as parallels to his own experiences is liked by some, but not all fans. However with this film, it works to its advantage. Shawshank Redemption is my favorite film based on one of King's books, but when it comes to his horror stories, this is the best.

As the film opens we see a very famous novelist named Paul Sheldon (James Caan) drive his car in a snowstorm to his publishers' office to take a look at a novel in his \"Misery\" series that he had just finished but he never gets there because he's in a snowstorm and rolls down a hill covered in snow while still in his car, he then is bleeding with a bunch of cuts and broken bones on him. Sheldon is then dragged out of his car and rescued by his self-proclaimed #1 fan who is a licensed nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes care of him and nurses him back to health. During the next few days Sheldon's agent Marcia Sindell (Lauren Bacall) is very suspicious as to where Paul Sheldon is and then tells the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) to help find Sheldon and get the book published. As the film progresses we see that Wilkes is getting crazier and more psychotic in every single scene she is in and holds Sheldon hostage while mistreating him because she didn't like the latest and unpublished addition to his series of \"Misery\" novels as well as going so far as to burn all of the pages and make him write another book just so she can like the revised edition that he is being forced to do, and Sheldon is doing anything he can possibly think of to stay alive. I won't spoil anything else beyond this point in the review because I feel that the scenes after the climax are way too important to spoil. Reiner and his screenwriter William Goldman are very effective with the suspenseful dialogue, and Reiner's frequent composer Marc Shaiman's score only heightens the suspense all they way to a Hitchcockian level. The performances from both Caan (who gives his best performance since \"The Godfather\" (1972)) and Bates (who won an Oscar for her performance, which was well-deserved, and the best performance of her career) are top notch, and Bates' portrayal of Wilkes is one of the best portrayals of a psychopath that I've ever seen, which is on par with Anthony Perkins in \"Psycho\" (1960), Anthony Hopkins in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), Piper Laurie in \"Carrie\" (1976), Robin Williams in \"Insomnia\" (2002), Heath Ledger in \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining\" (1980), and Christoph Waltz in \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). It is movies like this that prove that Rob Reiner is a directorial chameleon because he can make a good movie out of anything that is given to him, for example a courtroom drama like \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), and a children's movie like \"The Princess Bride\" (1987). This isn't the best movie that I've seen based on Stephen King's work but it's pretty darn close to it.",

The fan finds out he has killed her favorite fictional character off. \"You dirty birdy!\" she yells. Right here lies the strength in \"Misery\": its ability to take a good novel and turn it into a great film, by deep characters with waves of emotions and excellent lines of dialogue. Kathy Bates is the crazed fan of James Caan's fluent writer, Paul Sheldon, who has finally ended his Misery series. In the beginning, we see him telling Lauren Bacall that Misery has ruined his life. He has been type-cast, not able to write anything but Misery novels. So he has killed her off in his latest book, and set to work on a new novel, \"Untitled\" (which, in the novel Misery--the REAL novel--is named \"Fast Cars\").\nPaul retreats to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, writes his new novel with a sense of joy, and checks out of the cabin he is staying in. On the way home to the big city, unproduced novel in hand, he crashes off the edge of a ravine and flips his car. This is credited to both the winter storm and his drunkness from a bottle of Dom Periogne.He awakens days later to find himself in the care of Annie Wilkes (Bates). Everything is nice and dandy at first. Annie is a nice enough person. She tells him the roads are closed and the telephone lines are down, but she will take him to town when they clear up. She says she has called Paul's agent and has told his agent where he is. But soon Paul realizes he is trapped in the house with a madwoman. She is nice one second, a lunatic the next. And the best thing about this is how well Kathy Bates carries the character.I read the novel \"Misery\" by Stephen King. It is the only book of his I have read that I have enjoyed. (I hate his other work.) And something tells me that King thought of this idea of a writer trapped with a crazy fan because he himself is an author, most likely adorned with letters signed by mad fans every day. But would his fans be crazy enough to kidnap King, abuse him when he's bad, and make him suffer endlessly? The fan, thinking, in the fan's deranged mind, that they are serving God? So King wrote about this idea, and Rob Reiner turned it into a film a coupl'a years later. I personally enjoy the film a bit more than the novel.In the book, I imagined Kathy Bates the whole time as Annie Wilkes. Only I didn't imagine Kathy Bates herself, but rather the woman Kathy Bates plays. You see, Kathy Bates doesn't play Kathy Bates here. Kathy Bates plays Annie Wilkes.  She steals the show. She completely evelops her character. She easily switches her moods as if there is an on and off switch.I cannot imagine anyone for the role of Annie other than Kathy Bates herself.\"Misery\" is at times humorous, at times amusing, at times scary, and at times truly appalling; but it is always an excellent thriller. Reiner spotted the potential in the book in 1989, and he immediately went to work on the film for a 1990 release. In fact, I can imagine Rob Reiner scrolling through King's novel, fascinated by every page, wanting to turn it into a blockbuster film with big stars and big thrills. And then I can imagine Rob Reiner at the premiere of \"Misery.\" I can see the credits rolling. And I can see him smiling.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",

Annie Wilkes' cynicism is able to induce all of us the agonizing feelings we can feel in a suspense film. I see some people arguing if Annie knew the wine had that odd medicine in it; obviously, that's the writer's intention. And that's brilliant, because it's a simple scene which provokes lots of questions and doubts about her intelligence. And more than that, leaves the doubt to the spectator, making he think about the movie after it's over.\"Misery\", thought not perfect, is a great original work with good actors that will deliver you a good time and keep you on the edge of your seat.",

            "content": "KATHY BATES turns MISERY into one of the scariest horror films ever made from a Stephen King novel. It's a compact thriller with a plot that is never too complicated and characters that are just deep enough to make it an above average piece of entertainment if you like the King's brand of pulp fiction.Bates is the obsessed fan of writer Sheldon (JAMES CAAN), so much so that she has no regrets about punishing him for his transgressions, such as letting her favorite Sheldon heroine, Misery, die in the course of his latest book. Determined to keep him prisoner until he writes a new novel bringing Misery back to life, she deliberately breaks his ankles (this scene is a shocker) so he can no longer try to escape from the typewriter and wheelchair by the window.The Maine atmosphere is there (as always, with a King story, the setting is rural Maine), and all the performances are first rate with a nice job by Robert Farnsworth as an inquisitive sheriff on the trail of the captured writer he suspects might be in the Bates home.It's a straightforward horror tale in the best tradition of such material, with a stunning physical battle between Bates and Caan for a smashing finale with good triumphing over evil.Undoubtedly, a tale well suited to the screen and one of the best adaptations ever of a Stephen King novel. Bates deserved her Best Actress Oscar.",

This is always tense which is just fantastic! Unfortunately this is also the only issue I have with the movie. From start to finish, it's just non-stop tension. You barely get a break throughout the movie it's madness! Once it has finished you're exhausted.Onto the greats, Kathy Bates absolutely brilliant. At the click of your fingers the character (Annie Wilkes) goes from zero to one hundred. It's so real that it is genuinely frightening. Sometimes you look at a character and you try and picture what they would be like in real life. If there was a real life version of Annie there would be no difference to her fictional character. It was a well deserved Oscar win! That said, Caan who played the character Paul Sheldon was equally as mesmerizing. James Caan had the difficult task of acting acting. This is where he has to act his character who is acting to be someone he isn't, which is a difficult task. I was very impressed by both performances. Casting was perfect for Annie but lucky for Paul as Caan wasn't the first to be offered the role. The role was passed up by massive actors such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and even Morgan Freeman.This movie was very impressive and with being the only Stephen King movie to have won an Oscar I am surprised it isn't as well-know as others such as Stand By Me or The Shawshank Redemption. Rob Reiner did an outstanding job which I very much commend him for.",

            "content": "Rob Reiner's foray into the world of horror is wildly successful in his incredible film Misery. James Caan stars as author Paul Sheldon who, while leaving his secluded lodge in Silver Creek gets into a terrible car crash amidst a blizzard. He is saved by Annie Wilkes, a woman who keeps to herself on her quiet farm. There isn't much to Annie other than her eccentric love for Sheldon's Misery book series. She claims to be his number one fan, but as she nurses him back to health she reveals her love of Sheldon's books to be more of an obsession than a liking. Sheldon quickly finds himself in a lot of trouble as his own life is threatened by this deranged fan of his.Misery is an all around wildly entertaining film that incorporates horror, suspense, and even a little bit of dark comedy. These elements work together perfectly and make for an incredibly exciting film full of suspense and lacks any predictability. You never know what is going to happen next while watching Misery, and it makes it incredibly fun to watch. Kathy Bates is astounding as Annie Wilkes, a performance she won an Academy Award for it was so good. The performance is frighteningly believable, absolutely deranged, and makes you so incredibly afraid of what this character is capable of. We don't feel safe at any turn during the film, and it leaves us in constant suspenseful worry about what will happen to Sheldon. James Caan also does an excellent job in his role, but his and all the other roles in the film are heavily overshadowed by Bates.This film has a very natural flow and cadence to it that makes it a wonderfully enthralling experience from start to finish. There's never any dead air, the film always stays interesting, and something new and exciting is always happening. The majority of the film takes place in Annie's house, so there was a lot of opportunity for the film to become redundant and repetitive, but it always maintained a heightened level of excitement. There's never a dull moment in Misery.I personally loved every moment of Misery. I constantly was interested in what would happen next and I couldn't wait to see how the events of the film would all pay off in the end. This is such a well made film and Bates is so terrifyingly good as Annie Wilkes that, if nothing else, her performance will be forever engraved in your brain. It's easily one of the best Stephen King adaptations out there, and one of the best film's I've seen from the great Rob Reiner.",

Soon, she gets her wish: he crashes his car just outside of her isolated home in a snowy mountain terrain and she takes him in. Stephen King story is initially a wonderful duet between two disparate characters, and Bates' Annie Wilkes is a dream role for an actress; out-of-step with present trends, off-balanced and yet sugary sweet, she is dangerously forthcoming in her admiration. Still, pictures which intentionally gnaw at you can be unfair to the audience: turning the screws (and plot points) to its advantage, the movie keeps working against itself until we may feel disheartened instead of enthralled. The film is incredibly well cast, but Caan isn't given much to do but suffer and Richard Farnsworth, as a friendly local lawman, is shafted in the worst way imaginable (I almost gave up on the picture right there). Well-made, and directed by Rob Reiner in a canny, clever way--but Reiner delights in being a masochist and too much of this is on one queasy note. **1/2 from ****",

In my opinion he stayed too calm under the whole situation and didn't tried the maximum to escape. But I have the feeling this is more the directors fault.

I guess it was Rob Reiner's name being attached that made me underestimate this.Sweet Jesus, was that a mistake. I'll need some time for these fingernails to heal, because this was unbelievably gripping. What I really like about this movie is just how fun it is. We know that Kathy Bates is nothing but bad news, but there's something about her character. Annie Wilkes is one of the great movie villains, but her manner of speaking and awkward delivery make her someone to be pitied. And it injects the movie with the occasional burst of humor. That Bates can make us terrified and laughing from one minute to the next is testament enough. If memory serves, they gave her an Oscar for this; I am a-okay with that.Time has a habit of dulling the edgier movies, but \"Misery\" proves impervious to those effects.

            "content": "One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King's novel, Misery is a tense, taut & thrilling example of its genre that puts up a terrifying portrait of fandom gone a tad too extreme. Persistently looming with a sense of dread and uplifted by terrific performances, it's a manifestation of every celeb's worst nightmare.The story of Misery concerns the author of a best-selling novel series who crashes his car during a blizzard and is rescued by a former nurse who considers herself to be his number one fan. But things soon take a turn for the worse when she reads his latest novel and discovers the ultimate fate of her favourite character.Directed by Rob Reiner (best known for Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally... & A Few Good Men), Misery is a filmmaking lesson in gradually escalating terror as Reiner slowly & steadily ratchets up the tension and unfolds the plot with such effectiveness that neither its disquieting chill nor the viewers' interest is ever lost.Reiner's direction exhibits both confidence & composure but William Goldman's screenplay is just as impressive, for every scene builds up on the one preceding it plus it's able to carve moments of pure horror without relying on jump scares or any other cheap tricks. Humour is sprinkled throughout but it doesn't lessen the film's foreboding tone.The minimal setting & isolated location provide just the right environment for its plot to unfurl. Camerawork is smooth throughout, capturing each & every event or expression in a clear-cut fashion while also making use of angles that deliver the maximum impact. Editing is expertly carried out and makes sure that every scene in the final print is relevant to the plot.Coming to the performances, both James Caan & Kathy Bates are outstanding in their given roles. Caan plays an author who, following his accident, finds himself at the mercy of his dangerously disturbed caretaker. It's a physically exhausting work but the veteran actor pulls it off with finesse. However, Bates is even better as the psychotic fan, and easily steals the show with her twisted & downright deranged showcase that's inarguably her career-best performance.On an overall scale, Misery turned out to be way better & far more involving than I initially expected it to be, and is undoubtedly one of Rob Reiner's best directorial efforts. What drives this movie is the protagonist's endless attempts to outwit his abuser, and it's riveting to watch how those events play out. Functioning on more than one level, Misery is an unnerving & unsettling delight that delivers the thrills in heavy doses and still hasn't aged a day. Highly recommended.",

Kathy Bates gives an Oscar winning (and worthy) villainous performance, able to turn on a dime from a well mannered and considerate host, to a sociopathic and disturbed superfan. James Caan didn't get the same critical praise, but his acting is just as worthy of recognition. There's even a slight hint of well timed comedy, primarily between the sheriff and his wife, but Annie Wilkes has her moments as well. However, when the film gets dark, it can be deeply disturbing. I'm generally not very squeamish, but I have to turn away every time the movie gets to the hobbling scene.

A fan rescues a famous author and nourishes him back to health but after being possessive and showing fits of rage we wonder if he was better off dead.

Bates who plays his number one fan torments her captor who is injured. Her insanity worsens as the film goes on and it gradually builds into an explosive finale. This was a simple yet remarkable film, it revolved mainly around two characters and didn't need any additions or unneeded complexities.

Paul inadvertently gets into an accident and ends up trapped underneath his overturned mustang in the ice. One would think this would be the worst situation one could imagine onself in. But what follows is much worse. Misery is a thrilling adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name. Despite the movie's short run-time, the movie is a must-see simply to witness Kathy Bates' performance. There is nothing more terrifying than a person who won't curse like the Christian caretaker Annie Wilkes. Kathy Bates won a well- deserved Academy Award for Best Actress in 1990 for her portrayal of the psychopathic Wilkes. After Paul's accident, Annie \"rescues\" Paul and torments him into using his professional writing skills to fulfill her own twisted fantasies as the rest of the world desperately searches for the missing novelist. Paul is left in a very compromising situation where he has to use the best of his wits and writing skills to maneuver his way into an escape. The ride is thrilling, the screenplay is memorable, and the acting is compelling. The greatest moment of the film occurs when Annie, possibly purposefully, spills a spiked glass of wine that was mean to subdue her. As she pours a second glass to the dismay of Paul, the writer deleriously savours the moment with his abductor and makes a toast to misery. The abductor was alluding to the name of the character in the novel. The writer was alluding to his own plight. Days pass and Paul eventually gets stronger. He even lifts his own typewriter as a makeshift weight in a desperate ploy for survival. The survival instinct is raw. He eventually learns that his abductor is a baby serial killer. A former nurse who deserved to be killed years ago. Watch this movie which consistently ranks as among the best horror and thriller movies produced by Hollywood. Remember the most compelling line of the film, \"You want it? Eat it until you choke, you sick twisted ****\".",

            "content": "I don't know why it took me this long to watch Misery, but even after 25 years and countless imitators, this film rocks my socks.Paul Sheldon is a famous writer, most famous for his ongoing series titled 'Misery'. After completing a new novel up in the middle of nowhere, he races back to civilization to deliver the draft. Big mistake, a freak snow storm makes him lose control of his car and crash. Luckily he is saved by a woman who lives in the area. She takes care of him while he is bed ridden and luckily for him, she is his number one fan. Based on the Stephen King novel, Misery takes fan admiration one, two, maybe three steps too far. We enter the world of Annie Wilkes, a deranged woman who will stop at nothing to keep her favourite author locked up in her house, just to have him all to herself. At first, she seems like a lovable do-gooder. She won't swear, she's overly nice and humble. Things start to crack here and there when she doesn't hear things that she likes. Violent outbursts, stone cold stare downs and even sledgehammers make it into the mix. That sledgehammer scene by the way, which is arguably the most famous scene in the film, still makes me cringe even though I've seen numerous clips of it over the years. Extremely well done in my opinion. On the flip side of that, the scene when someone smacks their head on the typewriter...horribly done. Laughably, horribly done. That's the one hiccup in this otherwise, tightly directed film. I was surprised by the amount of talent behind the camera. Reiner directing, William Goldman adapting the story from King and Barry Sonnenfeld as the cinematographer. All three of these areas are highlights of the film. Without reading the book, I get the sense that Goldman managed to get the best adaptation of the work possible. Reiner gives us many scenes of unnerving tension, heightened because our lead protagonist can't even walk. Sonnenfeld captures the cold wintery landscape beautifully in scenes and really lets us feel the isolation. The real standout is of course, Bates. In her breakout role, which won her on Oscar no less, she commands the screen with oddity. She even makes snorting like an exciting pig seem perfectly fine, yet still oddly out of place in her role of Annie the psycho Wilkes. Every scene she was in, I had no idea what to expect. Will she be happy, mean, excited, deranged or dangerous? Sometimes she'd be all of them in a matter of seconds. An outstanding performance for sure, one that could have crippled the film is not done as well as she did. Caan manages to hold his own against her. I feel he has just as difficult a job in that he is restricted from using his body as much as one would like. He relies more on his facial expressions than anything else, he has to. Of course there is Richard Farnsworth, he is a lovable goofball here as the Sheriff. He delivers his lines with such soft, caring and humorous attitude that he almost feels like he should be in a different film. All three performances here are great and deserve recognition. Misery is a great film that I'm ashamed to have put off for so damn long.",

            "content": "I'm not even close to the biggest Stephen King afficionado. Of the films based on his works, I have mixed reactions. I think that The Green Mile is properly rated, The Shawshank Redemption is somewhat overrated, and that The Shining is VERY overrated. And much as I'm a sucker for low-budget horror, I'm even indifferent to movies like Christine and Children of the Corn. Maybe some day they will become guilty pleasures for me when I re-visit them. However, MISERY (1990) is a film that I had to come to really appreciate over time for it's greatness. Misery tells the tale of famous romance novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) who has just finished his latest novel on the main character of his collection named \"Misery\" and on his way back to home in New York, he crashes his car leaving his cabin hideaway in the snowy Colorado mountains. Paul is \"rescued\" by Nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a seemingly harmless spinster who has a nearby farm where she takes Paul to recuperate. Turns out, Annie is Paul's \"Number One Fan\" and has ulterior motives and plans to never let him leave, which he physically can't with 2 broken legs.Bates won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of the psychotic and obsessed Annie, effortlessly shuffling between veiled normalcy and psychotic outbursts. On first watch, I mostly admired it for Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning performance for Best Actress (one of the very few times in the history of the award that they've actually gotten it right). But over time, I've come to realize that this film is almost perfect in every way. It's a film of charming simplicity and staying power. Every scene has a meaning and a payoff.The main revelation I came to over time is that James Caan REALLY should have been nominated for Best Actor! In fact, I re-collect that I didn't think 1990 year was a strong field of nominees to the point I personally would have nominated Caan over any of the actual nominees. This is where that Oscars getting it wrong thing comes into play. None of the 5 actual lead male performances nominated have resonated with me over time. But Caan's minimalist yet remarkably effective performance has. This film just plain doesn't work without his pitch perfect reactions to all of Bates' over-the-top antics. Caan had the incredibly difficult task of playing the laid back Everyman who internalizes everything and was required to act most of the film non-verbally and let his physical acting do all the talking. Caan convincingly plays a person in immense physical pain throughout and never misses a beat. He was robbed by the Academy.Another thing I appreciate is the funny side yet connected subplot of the Sheriff and his wife (winningly played by film veterans Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen). I used to think their parts were boring and took away from the main plot, but their interplay is a key to why this film works, too. Finally, I find myself even liking film icon Lauren Bacall's cheeky performance as Paul's publisher. The film is a perfect clash of old Hollywood pre-1970 (Bacall), the revolutionary 70s (Caan), and the 90s (Bates).The key word that describes this film is SIMPLE. Director Rob Reiner, who also should have been nominated, keeps it minimal and relatable. No unnecessarily long drawn out scenes or over the top music or blood and gore. He lets the 2 main actors build the tension through their dialogue and acting. It's a masterclass of 2 coins of acting: Caan's subtlety countered with Bates' bravado. I also think I would have nominated this film for Best Picture. Retroactively, I realize that most Oscar-nominated/winning films are just a product of the time and flashes in the pan, while the ones that have re-watchability over time are the real winners. Thankfully, Misery is of the latter variety.",

            "content": "Rob Reiner's remarkable adaption of Misery is gripping, twisted, very effectively acted and is without any question one of the best thrillers of all time. Bates and Caan are simply natural stars, as they produce very convincing character personalities. But the gripping routine of the film is stunning and has several highlight scenes that are very exciting and ominous.First of all, the climatic point of this book-based thriller is incredible. It's disturbing, graphic and very shocking, and is also what thriller fans truly desire. But of course the climax is saved until after the film's other sequences of manipulation and uncertainty, in which without giving any spoilers (that need to be avoided for people who haven't seen the movie), which feature very graphically chilling visuals and amazing use of background music.James Caan takes the roll as Paul Sheldon, a successful writer, who is imprisoned by his \"number-one\" fan, Annie Wilkes, who is played by Kathy Bates. Paul Sheldon is our casual and norm thriller protagonist. He's a spectacular character, but Misery's antagonist is phenomenal. Annie Wilkes is amazingly-produced and extraordinarily-performed.These unique Stephen King characters blend excellently into the finely-formed tale. If it weren't clear enough, Misery is also a really moving and engaging thriller, but is definitely chilling, twisted and disturbing. It's an astonishing storyline targeting a disabled character's struggle to escape the house of his manipulator. Misery isn't directly a horror or scary movie, but is psychologically thrilling, no matter how many times you witness it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

            "content": "Misery invites the viewer into a nightmarish scenario, being caught in a house by your greatest fan, an early adaption of the whole stalking theme. It thereby touches issues such as the dark sides of popularity or how we don't really know our neighbors.All through the movie there's not much boredom and you get caught by the story line quite easily. It's a rather simple plot but nicely presented and without pretending to be more than it is. Some deficits prevent me from rating it higher though. At times the plot just appears to be a bit forced, like when the main character is caught the night before trying an escape, also it really stresses the classic element of horror achieved by simultaneous actions cut together. What bothered me further was the picture given of the kidnapper, without further knowledge I'd guess that her two issues don't really go together quite often and somehow it is a strange picture of people with mental issues presented here, as if one issue makes them capable of everything evil.Don't get me wrong though, it's well worth a watch. To see how the plot plays out in this rarely technicalized world was truly entertaining. The sheriff and his wife are my secret heroes in this one. 6/10 from me.",

I know this is considered a thriller classic but for me, I just never got what the fuss was about. I can't fault the acting but the story never seemed THAT original(how many stalker movies are there) and while mildly scary the movie itself didn't hold my attention at all. Not only didn't I love it, I'd say I really didn't like it much at all. And I just don't get WHAT is so wonderful and different about this.I am neither a major fan of King's or a non fan. I've read a few of his books(my favorites were Carrie and Thinner.) And I've seen a few movies that were adapted from his books, MOST not being very good. I never read Misery so I can't judge what was better the book or novel, all I know is the movie itself just seemed like yet another thriller with a better then average cast. The actually story was very dark, at times very brutal, moved very slowly and just didn't inspire one bit of interest in me. And I generally love Psychological thrillers!I didn't hate this and admit the acting and the general atmosphere were right on target but It's not something I would care to see again.

            "content": "Misery is a film that proves phenomenal in every aspect of its execution. Highlighting the story, though, are fantastic lead performances by Caan and especially Bates. Bates gives a world-class act as Annie, who first serves as a rescuer to grateful author Paul Sheldon. Their amicable relationship quickly dissolves, however, after Annie shows her true colors. Bates nails each line of dialogue as the character's inner darkness is revealed, gradually progressing her role to be more chilling and intense. Just Annie's presence, at a point, makes the audience fearful for its protagonist. What enhances Bates' performance to a higher level, though, is the charming nature she maintains all throughout. Not only does this make for some great moments of dark comedy, but also furthers the character's instabikity. This back and forth personality makes it clear why Bates was deserving of an Oscar. Caan is undeniably awesome as Paul, too. Even in the role's injured state, he manages to act with such great charisma. More than playing into the dark humor, this expresses the struggle to hold onto his waning hope. Caan convincingly expresses a wide range of emotions, therefore, from physical pain to utter disbelief and disappointment. Farnsworth is also very good as the police chief investigating the author's disappearance. Beyond the performances, the thrills themselves are built up by great direction from Reiner. He wonderfully crafts tension in how he shoots the film, maximizing the performances in play to his benefit. There is an additionally good score that stands out in many suspensful moments. As flaws go, the only real issue in what happens is a questionable decision by the police chief in the third act. Overall, Misery is a must watch Stephen King adaptation for its fantastic thrills and captivating performances.",

            "content": "Who doesn't have MISERY on their winter weather watchlist? It's a great cold weather, snowed in movie with geography and climate taking center stage. MISERY shows what can be the greatest force of human isolation, when the weather and your location can keep you so physically and mentally far away from others. Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) has a whole host of other problems besides her treacherous drive and remote existence, nonetheless, the feeling of being far away and cold is presented well in the film and the snow becomes a character in itself revealing how claustrophobic it can be to live in an area so plagued by the heaviness of snow where there's only one poorly maintained road the leads to town. I recently moved to upstate New York and have been warned countless times by locals how bad the weather gets in the winter and that everything shuts down. I've seen a bit of this already, the stores here have winter hours and the library in the first town we moved to closed completely between November and March. What has always been my favorite season is primed to start bringing me those winter blues that I never really gave much credit to being a thing.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is quite inwardly isolated himself. He's been riding the gravy train for years now writing romance novels featuring a woman named Misery that he never wanted to in the first place and has now been stuck in an endless loop of creativity sucking drivel. He can't be the writer he wants to be anymore being so bound to churning out more of this particular publication. He's stifled and needs to free himself so he decides to, against the urging of his literary agent played by a timelessly graceful yet powerful Lauren Bacall (can't you just imagine her being the only woman that could be married to Humphrey Bogart, I know he was married before but Bacall just seems so particularly equipped to be his wife), kill off the main character in the series that has imprisoned his time and creativity. Little does he know upon making that decision that he will become imprisoned by Misery's biggest fan.After his ceremonial cigarette and glass of champaign enjoyed after finishing the writing of his newest and non-Misery related book, Paul Sheldon sets out in his old Mustang leaving his self-induced seclusion reserved for the times he is working on something new. Visibly refreshed and ready to re-enter his preferred sector of the literary world, Paul's plans are waylaid as he skids off the road crashing his car and passing out in the process. When he comes to, he learns he had been pulled out of his car and brought to refuge by Annie Wilkes who, luckily for Paul, is a nurse with a whole stash of medicine and tools in her home to nurse him back to health. Annie tells Paul that they're practically snowed in and the phones are down but as soon as the roads clear up and service returns she will get him to a proper hospital. She reveals to him early on that she is the biggest fan of his work and feels honored to care for him. Being such a fan, she knows that he can only be in the area because he has written something new and asks to read his work. She encounters a fair amount of four letter words and in a fit of rage, reveals for the first time that something is not quite right with Annie.Paul's crash unfortunately coincides with the release of his most recent, and final, Misery book wherein the titular character is killed off. Annie rushes to a nearby book store to buy all the copies of what is sure to be her favorite installment in Paul Sheldon's oeuvre when she is betrayed to find out that Misery dies in childbirth. She takes Misery's death as a personal affront and she cannot believe that Paul would do that to her after giving her someone that pulled her out of a personally dark place. This meditation on art and its relation to an individual is a powerful one. Many of us have a connection to a film, or a book, or some other piece of art because it is so entrenched in the time in which we experienced it. For someone like Annie, who has often felt alone and like she doesn't fit into the world, having Misery as a companion was the life raft she needed to make it through her divorce. Being this person who was already so isolated, she developed a deep attachment to this character and decided that Paul couldn't kill her off. Instead, he must stay in her care and complete an un-doing of the novel bringing Misery back to life.It was already quite clear to the audience perspective, and eventually to Paul, that he had been kidnapped and Annie had no intention of taking him to a hospital, or anywhere else for that matter, by the time he was forced bu her to bring back Misery but the famous \"hobbling\" scene in which we see just how intent Annie is on deciding Misery's fate. Despite it being the best known scene of the film and one that stands out among all films as one that everyone knows, it would be a chore to actually see it happen and not to grimace. Despite its long history of being parodied, the setup is so intricately done that the payoff really is a payoff rather than a \"oh THAT part is happening now\" laugh a la many such famous movie scenes. After this, and despite his physical limitations, Paul sets out to free himself from the chains of Misery in a much more literal way than he had ever anticipated.James Can really doesn't get due credit as an actor. Yeah, he's Sonny and that is great but I'm consistently impressed by everything I see him in at every stage of life. It's a real cinematic injustice that he is slumming around doing Hallmark movies and UNDERCOVER GRANDPA. I can't think of a replacement for Caan that still keeps MISERY as good as it is. He lands Paul's self-assured indifference as a general character trait coupled with the restlessness of an artist that's coasting below their capabilities ready to perform at capacity once again. Most of his acting is done in a bed and the limited range of motion is not at all a hindrance to his performance. His plan to act along with Annie and write another Misery book bringing her back from the dead is note perfect. Once the initial frustration wanes and he accepts his fate that the only thing that can save him is to write the book Annie is asking for, he completes the task with the fervor, not of someone that is fighting for their life, but of someone that could do this level of writing in their sleep. Caan constantly creates a more interesting character than simply someone imprisoned by a psychotic fan of their work.At one point he long balls a plan to escape by attempting to poison, or at least knock Annie out, by saving the powder within the capsules of medicine that she gives him everyday. He decides to execute the plan by telling Annie he wants to have dinner with her and celebrate Misery's return. Annie is so thrilled to share the time with Paul and shyly clumsily has dinner with him. Paul sees his chance and entices Annie to share a glass of wine with him, she blushes immediately goes to retrieve the wine and after another ruse to get her away from the table, Paul dumps the contents of his homemade envelope into her drink. A quiet look of success subtly fills his demeanor when Annie suddenly spills the drink and foils Paul's plan. He is shattered, but Caan is so good at this understated acting that he's perfected over the years, Paul simply makes a joke and moves on internally gnawed at the wasted days spent depending on his plan while contemplating what to do next. The tension is palpable yet not predictable. By this point the audience doesn't know what to expect, will Annie have another tantrum about swearing or Paul's lack of appreciation, will some other incident arise, or will the night go exactly as planned. It's a great setup, well-directed by Rob Reiner and perfectly executed by Kathy Bates and James Caan.I love James Caan and think he's been consistently undervalued and inadequately utilized throughout his career so I had to sing his praises above for a role I don't think anyone could have brought as much to while hitting the perfect balance the character requires, but this film is clearly Kathy Bates'. She won her only Oscar (so far) and deservingly so for her turn as Annie Wilkes. She takes a character mistreated by the film and makes it much more than the caricature that was written for her. She brings a realness and a sense of humanity to the \"crazy woman\" the script gives us. The audience can, if even briefly, commiserate with Annie thanks to Bates' performance. Beneath the \"witness stand in Denver\" and the scrapbook full of her connections to the many people killed under her care at the hospital at which she used to work, there is a real person, someone who lost their love and took on an existence of isolation to avoid getting hurt again. The sympathy is fleeting, of course, as clearly no one would recommend dealing with loneliness by kidnapping someone and ultimately deciding to kill them because she decides that's what destiny had in store for them, but the fact that you can sympathize at all speaks to the strength of the performance given by Kathy Bates.I'm not sure how Rob Reiner does it--this ability he has to remain almost invisible yet one can tell that the film is directed by him. His trademark injection of humanity and heart into all of his films creates a noteworthy outing. I didn't remember MISERY looking like such a made-for-tv-movie but it certainly has that feel. The stakes of the film are raised once one learns that the source material, the Stephen King novel, acts as an allegory for the author's drug addiction, but even without that understanding the film is still a gripping exploration of isolation, even the self-inflicted kind, and its impact on our sense of self and ability to act in concert with others.",

He is rescued by former nurse Annie Wilkes(Unforgettably played by Kathy Bates in an Academy Award winning performance) who puts him up in her isolated cabin for recovery. Paul is grateful at first, and amused when Annie declares herself his \"Number One Fan\", but that later turns to horror when he discovers that she is mentally unstable, with an obsessive love of his fictional creation Misery Chastain, and when she learns that Paul plans to kill her off, goes over the deep end, and Paul desperately tries to find a way to escape, even though nobody knows where he is...Kathy Bates is outstanding as Annie Wilkes, creating a most unique and memorable portrait of insanity ever to be seen, eliciting both sympathy and hatred for her condition, but also for what she does to poor Paul.Though not especially scary, it is the fine performances and snowy atmosphere that make this film work.",

To be honest for someone so prolific you can't expect everything to be a great work of art and more to the point he gives his fans what they want.Misery is of course one of the jewels in his crown. Very much a reworking of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Which is never a bad thing. It is fondly regarded for a great performance by Kathy Bates who manages to ham it up much like Joan Crawford while still being scary and controlling. You totally believe Kathy Bates is strong enough to lift up James Caan in the snow. James Caan gives a victim performance, pretty much an Achilles Legs character, who gets played at every stage. A great contrast compared to his slick, gangster role in the excellent Thief. Another feature that elevates this against the mass of psychothrillers in the 90s is some stunning photography of the \"great outdoors\" of Colorado.The film toes the line between camp and genuine shocks, due to good pacing by Rob Reiner and the acting (special mention to Richard Farnsworth's lovable sheriff). The film has a really good humour to it with James Caan's Paul Sheldon character clearly modelled on King's own experiences with obsessive fans, but turned up to an absurd level.",

Even worse, it's a transparent, masochistic revenge fantasy aimed straight at the fans who made King a success in the first place. The protagonist is (naturally) a brilliant novelist, crippled in an auto accident and left to the not-so-tender mercies of his number one fan, who systematically tortures him so that he can continue writing best-selling garbage. The plot is not unlike an inversion of 'The Shining', but without the added element of the supernatural to give it any horrific guilty pleasures. Yes, the point is made that writers are always at the mercy of their readers, but cool, rational man of letters James Caan is, on the evidence of his cathartic fury of violence at the climax of the film, little better than psycho fan Kathy Bates (no relation to Norman). In fairness, it should be noted that the original, downbeat ending to King's novel was sanitized to make the story more accessible, but not enough to hide the author's contempt and self-pity.",

            "content": "Films where the hero gets trapped in a relationship with a psychopath define a distinct (but not yet over-exploited) sub-genre of thriller. In 'Single White Female', a young woman discovers that her flatmate is not to be trusted; in 'The Shining' (based on a book by Stephen King), a writer goes mad, tormented by ghosts, and attacks his family in a remote, deserted hotel. 'Misery', also based on a King story, uses some of the same elements: an isolated house in winter is the setting for a bizarre horror. A famous author chances to crash his car (breaking his legs in the process) near the home of his \"number one fan\"; she tends him while the snowdrifts cut them off, but when the weather improves, she declines to let him go. In some respects, the plot is handled oddly, in that the film does not stress the early days, in which the author still believes his rescuer is a sane woman with his best interests at heart. Instead, the film quickly reveals her lunacy, rushing through the process of growing mistrust that one might expect to dominate the plot, and thereafter adopts an almost jocular tone, as it follows its hero's attempts to trick his way to freedom. There's a growing sense of menace, in that the longer his imprisonment lasts, the harder it is to see that she'll ever be able to choose to release him, but it is slightly strange that the potential for psychological ambiguity is downplayed, in favour of a more straightforward script about a female bogeyman. Indeed, instead of the strange situation driving the gaoler to deeper insanity, she is presented as completely bonkers from the start, a serial child murderer who keeps a scrapbook of her own deeds. In some senses, the story would be stronger if its villain were more human, and the abusive side to her relationship with the hero uncertain for longer. But arguably, the film would not then be so entertaining. For really, 'Misery' is a high class pantomime. Obvious music underscores every happening, and plot rather than situation drives the film forwards. Yet it's all highly watchable, and the inevitable violent showdown is far more fun than in other, more serious films (whereas, by contrast, the exaggerated violence at the end of 'Single White Female' and 'The Shining' seems silly compared with the careful build up of tension that precedes it). 'Misery' is a limited film, but it's solid entertainment, and there's a very funny performance from Richard Farnsworth as the ageing local sheriff. A movie to watch on a cold winter's eve.",

Before the credits are over, Sheldon has taken a header off the snow-slicked roads, rolling his car and seriously injuring himself. Enter his \"number one fan\" Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who rescues him from a snowy grave, pops his dislocated shoulder back into place, puts his broken legs in splints, and hooks him up to the old intravenous in her isolated farmhouse.She cares for Paul in her traditional nursing garb for all the sense of authority and implied compassion it affords her. Sheldon regains consciousness with the belief that he's been saved by a guardian angel - albeit a rather odd one. He starts to see the real Wilkes after letting her read his unpublished manuscript; she's not impressed with his use of swear words and freaks right out. But that's nothing compared to her reaction when she buys his latest book and discovers that he's killed off her favorite character, Misery Chastain. She demands that he bring Misery back to life in a new book, and when the wheelchair-ridden Sheldon realizes it's either write or die, he complies - all the while nurturing his strength for that one shot at escape. From here on, the story unfolds as a battle of wits and wills - Paul as the phallic-less male and Annie as the domineering matriarch. Director Rob Reiner makes the movie work by never giving away more than he should and extracting wonderful performance from his cast. As Sheldon, Caan is calm and impressive here in his limited role. The film however, belongs to Kathy Bates. She doesn't grandstand one bit as the psychopathic ex-nurse Annie Wilkes, preferring instead sudden bursts of repressed spite which are terrifyingly hard to predict. One minute she is enthusiastically childish about her chapter plays, the next she has exploded in a fit of unpredictable rage capable of shattering Paul's ankles with a sledgehammer. Bates portrays Annie as someone with absolutely no sense of her own monstrosity. And this is why we can love her; she is evil in tweed but she doesn't know it. She plays Annie with that curious mix of callow subservience and self-righteous anger that marks the truly obsessed fan. She may not be a conventional leading lady in appearance, but she possesses more than enough authority and presence to carry a film on her own. What makes Misery such a fascinating horror tale is that instead of the usual King-size serving of the macabre, it rests on a chilling and extremely plausible predicament. Powerfully filmed and wonderfully enacted, Misery presents an intriguing character study in psychosis!",

            "content": "I first watched 'Misery' in 1990 and was completely blown away by it back then. Now, nearly thirty years later and I'm pleased to say that it's just as good as it ever was. It's one of Stephen King's (many!) big-screen adaptations and, as fans of the horror genre know, they can be a bit 'hit or miss.' I haven't read the books, so I can't really compare the two, but it goes without saying that, in my opinion, this is a total hit and I think one of the hallmarks of a truly great movie is that it becomes timeless. Yes, it was released (and presumably set?) in 1990, but if it found its way into cinemas today then I think it wouldn't look out of place in any way. Perhaps there may be a few more nods to social media and mobile phones (or why they don't work in the film's location), but that's about it. Until people stop reading books completely, this will always feel 'modern.'Anyway, enough simply lavishing praise on the film... on to the plot. James Caan plays an author called 'Paul Sheldon' who goes into the snowy mountains to finish every book he's ever written. However, upon completing his latest work, his car gets caught in a storm and he crashes. Luckily, or so he thinks at first, he's saved by local nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes him home and patches up his broken legs. Now, as you may have guessed, all is not what it seems and this 'Florence Nightingale' is anything but his guardian angel (let alone his 'biggest fan!').You'd probably be forgiven for thinking that James Caan is the star. And, no matter how good his performance is (and he is awesome!), he gets totally eclipsed by the 'real' star of the film, Kathy Bates. Her performance as the nurse from hell was good enough to win her the Best Actress Oscar and I'm not normally one for agreeing with who wins what when it comes to Oscars, but here it is totally deserved.Special mention to Richard Farnsworth who plays the local sheriff 'Buster,' who is a man on the brink of retirement who figures that there's more than meets the eye when it comes to this famous author's disappearance and goes digging around into the circumstances surrounding the incident.If you're a fan of horror (and the more 'real' kind utilising human nature as opposed to simply a monster running around ripping people apart) then you definitely have to watch this. I do hope it never gets remade (although if they ever did then I'd put forward 'Breaking Bad's' Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn as the two leads - Hollywood, if you're reading this - I want my 'finder's fee' for that casting idea!).",

            "content": "Misery is either a case of a film being slightly outdated, or just built up too highly for me to thoroughly enjoy this Stephen King classic. Well-acted, tightly written and directed, but not nearly as memorable or terrifying as it was made out to be. Perhaps that's an unfair criticism, but expectations almost always factor into how enjoyable the film will be.Misery may very well be King's simplest film, taking place in mostly one setting, and only dealing with a few characters in total, but it sure seems like it's one of his more personal stories. James Caan plays a famous author, Paul Sheldon, who is \"rescued\" by his number one fan, Annie Wilkes, who turns out to be a little more devious and cruel than a typical fangirl. Not having read anything about King's original story, I don't know how much of this can be based (even in the slightest) on a true story. I know King was never captured by a fan and tortured in inexplicable ways, but there has to be some level of personal touch King is putting to this story. At the very least, this is a major fear of his.In that regard, Misery is brilliant, especially for a 21st century audience who are obsessed (and as connected with social media) with their celebrity crushes more than they ever have been before. The sheer obsession that is in Annie's mind (wonderfully played by Kathy Bates) is the crux of the story and is undeniably memorable. But I was honestly expecting the insanity to be even more over-the-top. Maybe that's just pop-culture's infatuation of Bates' creepy portrayal clouding my judgment, but it's true.In all, there's plenty to like in Rob Reiner's direction, the score, iconic performances, and various other tidbits of Misery, but I can't help but feel a little letdown by the overall intensity of the execution. I'm still waiting for that big moment to happen. It never came.7.0/10",

Godfather star James Caan ably plays the victim of the piece, successful romantic novelist Paul Sheldon, who finds himself being cared for by the nurse after she drags him from a car wreck during a blizzard. Wilkes claims to be Sheldon's number one fan, but her treatment of the bed-ridden author takes a decidedly sinister turn after she reads his latest book, Misery's Child, in which he kills off Misery Chastain, the heroine of his best-selling series. Unable to accept the fictional death, Wilkes insists that Sheldon writes a new novel in which Misery returns, and does everything within her power to keep him captive until he finishes, after which she hatches murderous plans.With Bates and Caan on top form, and future Oscar nominee director Rob Reiner calling the shots, Misery, adapted from Stephen King's bestseller of the same name, is a tense, character-driven thriller that rarely puts a foot wrong. Wilkes' sudden rage coupled with Sheldon's helplessness makes for nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat action. Reiner skillfully cranks up the tension, early outbursts merely hinting at the nurse's madness, but as matters progress, the degree of Wilkes' insanity becomes more and more obvious, the woman finally going full-on nutzoid when she realises that Sheldon has been leaving his room: wielding a sledgehammer, she administers a procedure called hobbling that is guaranteed to have viewers squirming in their seats.An exciting climax sees local sheriff Buster (Richard Farnsworth) finally putting two and two together and paying Annie a visit while a drugged Sheldon tries desperately to draw the cop's attention from the cellar. This being an early '90s movie, it takes a few attempts to kill Wilkes, the woman only biting the big one after several well-crafted jump scares (corny, but a whole lot of fun). Easily one of the best Stephen King adaptations, Misery is a must for fans of the author and of horror in general.",

However, as he is going from a remote area to deliver his book, he has an unfortunate automobile accident. It's serious. Lucky for him, though, his \"number one fan\", Annie (Kathy Bates) lives nearby and, as a nurse, she rescues him and takes him to her home. Very skillful, Paul is soon on the road to recovery but it will be quite sometime before he is on his feet. He feels fortunate that Annie was johnny on the spot. But, horrors, he won't be feeling lucky for long. Annie, you see, is deranged. As Paul's last book about Misery goes on the bookshelves, Annie buys it. She tells Paul how good it is. But, when she discovers Misery DIES at the end, she turns vicious. All of a sudden, Paul is a prisoner who is ordered to write a sequel to Misery's adventures, with a promise to continue the series. She drugs him, berates him, and breaks his legs. Paul does as she asks, for he is afraid for his life but he secretly spits out pills and does strength training, preparing for his escape, hopefully. The town's sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) becomes suspicious about Annie but the diabolic nurse sees that his interference stops. Forever. Will Paul get away from this Mad Woman of the Country? This is a terrific film in almost every way. It has a sensational Stephen King story to tell and two strong performances from Bates and Caan. Most of the scenes are between these two, in Bates' house, so the movie's success is no small feat. Director Rob Reiner should be commended over and over, for his shots, for his pace, and for his attention to detail. Scenery and costumes are also well chosen, for Bates' surroundings and choice of clothes are quite bizarre. Yes, the movie is somewhat scary but not overly so and most folks will be enthralled.

            "content": "\"Misery\" is the first name of the heroine of a series of rather crummy novels that have been written by Paul Sheldon, who longs to get out of this repetitive literary rut and into heavy lit, almost as much as Conan-Doyle wanted to dump Sherlock Holmes.  It is also the dominant emotional tonus of Paul himself during most of this movie.It's probably Rob Reiner's best movie, based on one of King's less excessive stories.  The direction, like the script, is nice and taut.  Predictable, but nice and taut.  For most of the film we are in a sort of haunted farmhouse with Paul and his captor, Annie Wilkes.  The structure goes like this: ten minutes with the odd couple, then a one- or two-minute sequence of the local sheriff trying to figure out what's up, then back to the farmhouse for another ten minutes -- and so on.  Crazy characters are made to look crazier by the use of wide-angle lenses during closeups, turning their faces into those of porpoises.  There are two separate sequences in which Reiner cross-cuts between someone's boots climbing the stairs to the porch outside, while someone tries desperately to hide some evidence of misdeeds inside. That's what I mean by \"predictable.\"  But it all comes out rather nicely.The acting is unusually good.  Kathy Bates sometimes adopts a kind of false and theatrical tone when she speaks, as if she's not a good actress.  But it fits her character, who lives in a magic theater of her own making.  Her character is witlessly childlike, in her devotion to her hero, in her rage at his betrayal, or her hopelessness when it rains.  Nothing of that juvenile undeveloped quality is squelched.  She imbues the role with a monstrous pathos.  It's difficult not to feel sympathy for this overweight recluse when she is about to leave but stops at the door, turns to Paul, and tells him she loves him.  \"I know you don't love me.  Please don't say you do.\"   James Caan has never looked more miserable.  For the first movie in which I can remember him, he seems to be utterly helpless, and seems to know it too.  His pained expression as he tries to smile over Annie's specially made dinner of meat loaf (she puts some Spam into the ground meat), or pounds unthinkingly at his typewriter while she plays all of her Liberace records in the next room to inspire him, or when he realizes she is about to do something to prolong his dependence on her -- all priceless.  Caan is particularly good at registering pain.  He did well in \"The Killer Elite\" too, although there the pain may have been real, direction by Sam Pekinpah.I had a problem with the movie, though not one of thermonuclear proportions. I had a feeling throughout that this woman, crazed by drives she can't possibly understand, was being made fun of for the wrong reasons.  It's an easy shot to put someone in such a role who weighs more than our cultural ideals demand.  And the unbelievably ugly decor of the farmhouse (Caan: \"Tell me, did you learn interior decorating somewhere or do you just have a flair for it?\").  Liberace playing Tchaikovsky.  A portrait of the renowned pianist himself with that expensively capped smile, on the mantle.  Spam meatballs.  A \"Down Memory Lane\" scrapbook.  Pathetic china penguins.  A half gallon jug of Taylor New-York-state wine for that \"special dinner.\" It's only towards the end that her involvement in murder is suggested. Does she get her head bashed in because she's guilty of bad taste?",

Kathy Bates is, by the way, excellent in her torturer psychopath role, as opposed to James Caan who seems a bit uncomfortable.In fact, the real problem is the movie lacks heaviness and darkness to be totally convincing. Annie could have been much more demoniac, and Paul's character lacks credibility, particularly in his behaviour. The atmosphere seems therefore a bit sugarcoated and that is the big downside to this movie, that deserves no more than the average mark.",

            "content": "Most writers are extremely happy and somewhat proud to learn about their numerous fans as it helps them to ascertain the extent to which their popularity has reached. However,there is hardly any writer who is ready to subject one's writing skills to be tested by fans. These are precisely some behavioral traits which American director Rob Reiner chose to depict in \"Misery\" which is a faithful adaptation of a best selling novel authored by Stephen King. We get to see how a best selling author cannot please everybody with his/her writings as the reactions of an ordinary reader are completely different from those of a deranged fan. A large part of 'misery' is set in a house where a famous author has been held prisoner by his most ardent fan with a not so pleasant past. It is an ideal setting for psychological games where each party has to outsmart the rival in order to ensure one's survival. American actor James Caan looks perfect in his role as a caged person who would invent novel ways to free himself from the clutches of a deranged fan. American actress Kathy Bates is devilish to such a large extent that one is led to believe that the art and craft of \"writing process\" can be dictated as per the whims and fancies of a deranged fan. Lastly, before \"Misery\" there were not many people who were aware of how master of detective fiction Arthur Conan Doyle was nagged by his fans when he chose to kill \"Sherlock Holmes\" for some days.",

            "content": "What we have here is a decent movie, with decent acting (for the most part) and a good story which avoids the supernatural element that turns me off a lot of Stephen King's work. Having said that, what we also have here is a movie that - in my opinion - didn't reach the heights that are often claimed for it.James Caan was believable (albeit surprisingly unemotional I thought, given the circumstances) as writer Paul Sheldon, \"rescued\" from a car accident by his self-proclaimed biggest fan Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who then holds him hostage to force him to write a novel bringing back her favourite character (Misery) whom he had killed off in the last installment in the series. Bates is clearly the star of this movie, earning her Oscar. Her performance as the insane Annie is very believable (although, I thought, at times a little too over the top.) Richard Farnsworth on the other hand (as Sheriff McCain) I found irritating and totally unnecessary (and, although I have never read the novel on which this is based, I understand that his character was added to the movie, for no apparent reason that I could see.) Rob Reiner directed. This was his second go-round as director of a movie based on a King work. I thought his work on \"Stand By Me\" was better.This certainly isn't a bad movie. It's suspenseful, edge of your seat stuff a lot of the time. It just lacks consistent power, something that I think a better choice than James Caan and the total elimination of Farnsworth might have helped. Note: this is also a very violent movie in places, the scene in which Annie \"hobbles\" Sheldon being particularly disturbing.6/10",

I'm not even sure it had anything to do with the director or producers.It was actually quite hard to figure out what bothered me about this movie (other than the fact that I have no deep seeded need to see someones ankles broken!)until my mom pointed out that Stephen King understands something that a lot of horror/psychological thriller writers seemed to have either forgotten or missed and that is that anything you can imaging is much (bigger, hairier, sharper, just plain scarier) than anything I can show you. Once you put it on the screen, you take the director's view of what's scary shoved at you. If that view isn't one that scares the viewer personally, then the movie misses and the scares are just not there.This movie didn't scare me any more than someone jumping around the corner yelling \"boo\" at me. It didn't make me think, it didn't disturb me, heck...it didn't even say \"boo\" that loudly!

            "content": "Ironically, the novel \"Misery\"--while as much about the nature of fan/celebrity relationships as the writing process itself, is not one of Stephen King's better-written works. Coming in at a relatively lean (for him) 338 pages, the novel IS a relentlessly intense tale of mounting terror and palpable desperation. Condensed by William Goldman into a more conventional, three-act narrative (the novel is essentially a prolonged standoff between the 2 main characters) and directed by Rob Reiner (\"This Is Spinal Tap\"), some of the novel's intensity has been lost, instead replaced by a gallows humor that hits more often than misses. Upon completion of his latest novel, best-selling author Paul Sheldon (James Caan) hops in his vintage Challenger just as a snowstorm comes up and sweeps him off a winding mountain road; he is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), an ex-nurse who resides on a well-isolated farm and is a raving psychotic. Reiner does a good job establishing the confined setting, amplified in Sheldon's own vain attempts at escape, while alternating with the husband-and-wife Sheriff-and-Deputy team (Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen in delicious roles) conducting their own search for the missing author. Caan and Bates play off one another wonderfully, and retain the \"jousting\" effect of King's characters; Bates, especially, becomes a well-rationed blend of the Terminator and a typical, small-town woman (complete with phrases like \"cock-a-dookie\")--a performance that could have veered into camp, but maintains a veneer of disturbing realism throughout.",

Finding him stranded and unconscious in a snowdrift, she takes him home and attends to his needs until he regains consciousness. That's when the weirdness begins; in the movie's story, as well as the wide angle shots perpetrated upon the actors in their close ups. The deviations from the principal storyline really took away from this movie a great deal. That having been said, the feeling of discorporation you experience from the cinematography of the movie leaves you feeling disturbed and unsettled. Classic King. But again, the deviations just left me saying within the first 15 minutes ... WTF?! It was commonly predictable, horribly off-kilter, and widely uneven.

Cathy Bates may have stolen the show, but playing against James Caan's low-key style made her performance even more arresting. After an accident in a remote location, famed novelist, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), is kept prisoner by his most ardent fan, a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Cathy Bates). There are many twists to the story, but shockingly, she stops him from escaping by breaking his ankles (in Stephen King's novel she cuts off one of his feet). Although the story is unusual, it reminded me of a few I had come across before. John Fowles \"The Collector\" is an obvious one, and even gets a mention in the novel \"Misery\", but others are also interesting. Years ago, I used to love those collections of horror stories from Alfred Hitchcock and Pan Books etc. One was \"Marmalade Wine\" by Joan Aiken, which I read in the \"First Fontana Book Of Horror Stories\" in 1966. It was about a guy called Roger Hacker who goes for a walk through the woods and meets a once a famous surgeon who lives there as a recluse. Hacker unwisely boasts that he can predict the future, and the doctor invites him to sample his homemade wine. When Hacker awakens from a drug-induced slumber, he realizes he won't be walking home any time soon - the doctor has amputated his feet. It was actually made into an episode of \"Rod Serling's Night Gallery\" around 1970. Another along the same theme is \"The Man who liked Dickens\" by Evelyn Waugh, which I first encountered in \"The Ninth Fontana Book Of Horror Stories\" although it was actually written in 1933. It became a sequence in the novel, and then the film, \"A Handful of Dust\".In that one, Tony Last, while on an expedition in Brazil, ends up alone and fever-ridden in the jungle. He is found by Mr. Todd and taken to his home in a remote village. When he recovers from his illness, he is happy to comply with the illiterate Mr. Todd's request to read aloud to him for a couple of hours each day. As the days go by, then weeks, Tony realizes that Mr. Todd has no intention of allowing him to leave...ever.\"Misery\" takes its story to a different conclusion, but keeps the tension ramped up all the way. The film emerges as one the most disturbing types of horror story. Like \"Psycho\", \"Wolf Creek\", and \"Seven\", there is no supernatural explanation to screen us from events that could really happen. In the end, \"Misery\" leaves one a little more wary of one's fans.",

Set in the frozen landscape of Colorado's backcountry and following a writer finishing his defining novel, Misery is brilliant at setting a scene. This story is unique in its dynamics, and the acting of Kathy Bates (who won an Oscar for her role) is befittingly scary and unpredictable.Unfortunately, some of stylistic choices are a bit bizarre. Considering the setting, not much of Colorado's scope is used in the film; further to this, some of the \"high tension\" moments felt forced, sapping a degree of drama from the scenes.I am a big Stephen King fan - I just don't think this was the best adaptation there could have been, and time has not been kind.",

Of course a big round of praise for the actors Kathy Bates and James Caan who practically make this film. It doesn't really show much up until the end and lesser actors would absolutely not be able to sell the amount of tension and fear that's required to keep this one interesting. I mean the whole setting is claustrophobic and small yet Misery never feels restricted or dull through its hour and forty minute runtime. In fact, most of the time the film is at its weakest when it deviates from the farm and focuses more on the Sheriff character, I still don't understand what he contributes to the story. The ending is also a bit of a letdown as you can tell it must've been filmed rushed or as an afterthought, but everything else, super good.",

            "content": "Misery (1990)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Author Paul Sheldon (James Caan) has finished his latest novel and is trying to drive down from his mountain resort when his car goes over a cliff and crashes. Soon he wakes up in the home of nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who claims to be his number one fan. She begins to bring him back to health but before long the writer realizes that this woman isn't all there mentally.MISERY is a rare Stephen King adaptation that actually manages to be extremely good and director Rob Reiner certainly deserves a lot of the credit. He takes the story and does an extremely good job with it and manages to bring out not only the deeply disturbing elements but also some black comedy that was certainly needed to balance out some of the more shocking and graphic moments.Of course, when you've got such a terrific cast in the roles that's a major plus. Bates picked up a Best Actress Oscar for her role of the troubled nurse and no matter how many times you watch the movie you can't help but enjoy her performance even more. This \"nut\" character has a lot of different personalities that come out here and the actress nails them all. You can believe her soft-spoken sweet nurse and in a split second you can buy her raging psychopath. Caan has never gotten the credit he deserves but he too is wonderful here and especially when you consider that the majority of the time he's stuck in a wheelchair or a bed. Both Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen are great in their parts and even Lauren Bacall is given a good role.The film features some pretty graphic violence including that \"one\" scene. If you've seen the movie then you already know what that \"one\" scene is because once you see it you'll never forget it. If you haven't seen the movie, trust me, when you get to this scene you'll know what I'm talking about. The movie also benefits from some wonderful cinematography, a terrific score and William Goldman's screenplay hits all the right notes. There are some really dark moments here that are hard to watch but as I mentioned earlier, the black humor really helps.Reiner had previously worked wonders with King's STAND BY MEN so he obviously knows how to handle the material. He certainly milks ever bit of suspense and tension that he can out of the material and makes MISERY one of King's adaptations that really works.",

            "content": "Writer Stephen King is considered among the most important contributors to the horror genre of the last times. Wheter the quality of his work is good or bad is up to the reader; what can't be denied, is that his inventive stories have been of major importance for cinema as almost everyone has been adapted to film. Naturally, the quality of those adaptations range from awfully bad to superb masterpieces. \"Misery\" locates closer to the latter as it is one of the best horror movies ever made.Kathy Bates gives the performance of her life as Anne Wilkes, a lonely ex-nurse that rescues writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) from a near death as his car crashed during a snow storm. To Paul's surprise, Anne Wilkes is one of the biggest fans of his romance series, \"Misery\". While Anne takes care of Paul, he discovers that his number one fan may not be sane, and hell breaks loose as soon as Annie discovers that in the last Misery novel, the main character dies. Her obsession with the story will take its toll in Paul's health, as her psychotic nature will be revealed.Director Rob Reiner and writer William Goldman turned King's novel into gold, as their adaptation is superb and according to fans, superior to the novel. The story unfolds at a nice rhythm and it never drags nor gets boring. While it is not a faithful adaptation, it keeps the suspense and the tension is always at peak, it keeps you at the border of the seat.What really makes the movie are the performances of the cast. Bates & Caan have a big chemistry on screen and they were perfect in their roles. Kathy Bates's take on Anne Wilkes has become a classic performance as it is a perfect portrait of the insane obsession the character has with his idol. Truly believable at any moment, she manages to go from sweetheart to psycho in seconds, in a breathtaking Tour-De-Force that won her an Oscar.James Caan is equally great as Sheldon, but I'd like to show some respect to Richard Farnsworth. His performance as the sheriff was top-notch and another one of the long chain of great underrated performances of his career. He wasn't an actor playing a sheriff, he truly captured the spirit of an old cop in a small town.If a flaw is to be found in the movie, I would say that at times it has a \"TV movie\" feeling. However, it is maybe that subtle approach to visuals what made \"Misery\" so haunting, so scary, and so real.As if a common drama suddenly descended to darkness in a one way ticket to madness. If Stephen King's work is known for bringing the horror closer to home, \"Misery\" is the best example of that statement.Without a doubt, \"Misery\" is a modern classic, and it only gets better with time. This is probably, the best adaptation to a book by Stephen King. 8/10",

It starts off a bit slow but still interesting enough. Annie starts off to be this sweet lady who saved Paul who is a writer from a car crash. She is nursing him back to health and is a fan of his writings but then you realise she's got a few screws loose.Kathy Bates does so well, I can kind of relate to her character in some ways such as her attention to detail and passion for the stories even if she's a bit over the top crazy about it. Paul does very well trying to appease Annie from acting up and almost succeeds in drugging her so he can escape but the plan backfires so hard I had to pause because the pain (for Paul) was too much, though it was very well done, well written and executed.The Sherriff is actually a really smart man and manages to figure out where Paul is, I really liked him and his wife, they had some great moments. I wasn't surprised he died but it was still quite upsetting because he was such a good man. The ending was great, the fight, the aftermath and the explanation of Paul still mentally recovering from his ordeal.The film is very well shot and the quality is great considering its 31 years old. If I was to compare this to The Shining, I would watch this movie 30 times over.",

            "content": "Misery is the adapted film from the great Stephen King about novelist Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, the successful writer of the \"Misery\" series. After having written Misery into the ground for several years Paul decides it's time to retire Misery and kills off the beloved character in his latest book. Moving onto his new project he spends months hidden away in a hotel in the mountains of Colorado writing his new project. After completing his newest manuscript Paul checks out of his hotel and drives his old mustang back into town. However a severe snow storm makes driving an impossibility as Paul drives right off the hill. Paul awakens in the guest room of Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates, a retired nurse living by her lonesome in a secluded cabin. Annie tells Paul that she's his biggest fan and she has read every single one of his Misery books. With the storm knocking out the phone lines and roads Annie tells Paul it's best he just sit tight for awhile while his body heals. Paul's legs are shattered and one of his shoulders has been dislocated. After a couple of days of being nursed back to health Paul is anxious to speak with his agent and daughter but when Annie reads Paul's latest Misery novel she explodes with outrage. She won't stand for her beloved Misery's death. Annie, showing her psychotic and violent tendencies forces Paul to burn his newest manuscript and holds Paul prisoner until he writes the revival of Misery. Locked in a room and presumed dead by the outside world, Paul only hope is the local sheriff, played by Richard Farnsworth who is slowly flowing bread crumbs of his disappearance. Misery is great screenplay with a solid accumulation of twists and turns. The shooting style is a little dated but the use of wide angle close ups does wonders for making Annie Wilkes the scariest nurse you've ever seen. Her bipolar performance is definitely worthy of the Oscar. James Caan is also terrific as the witty and clever writer. I mainly know him from his stereotypical bad-guy roles but he also plays a great sympathetic cripple. One thing that I have to note is the amazing job done on the make up. The swollen broken legs of Paul look absolutely disgusting. Misery is a great horror flick and Kathy Bates will probably go down as the most terrifying nurse in cinematic history. Who this film is not for: -Even though I'm not into the horror genre, I really enjoyed this film. However some people who don't like scary movies will probably want to stay away.",

The dread you feel every moment for Paul Sheldon (James Caan) whenever Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) feels betrayed by his newest novel comes across as all too credibly real. Instead of nightmarish visions from \"The Shining\" or the unrealistic presence of a demonic clown from \"It\", what you have here is a devoted but deranged celebrity fan who intends to keep her favorite novelist to herself for better or worse, and in Sheldon's case, it's definitely for the worst. The scene I have to avert my eyes, I think you'll know it, is when Annie takes that big old sledge hammer and whacks Paul's left ankle with it to horrifying effect. Once was enough in the picture, as director Rob Reiner only offered up that visual a single time; Paul's right ankle suffered the same fate but what viewer could take it more than once?Bates won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal here, of a character who can be sympathetically understanding one moment and terrifyingly vicious the next. However I COULD relate to her extreme frustration with cliffhanger serials from back in the day. I've watched my share and have the same reaction she did whenever the hero of the story miraculously escapes from an impossible predicament under sleight-of-hand circumstances in the next chapter play. No such luck here, as Paul Sheldon's daily nightmare continues relentlessly until he's able to summon up enough strength to take out his lunatic captor.As far as Stephen King based movies go, this one ranks fairly high by IMDb viewers. Of the nearly thirty films based on his works that I've seen up till now, this one comes in at a respectable fifth place ahead of 2017's \"It\", as well as \"Carrie\" and \"The Dead Zone\", though 1980's version of \"The Shining\" is still considered a stronger horror flick. Strong performances by Caan and Ms. Bates are backed up by Richard Farnsworth as the low key sheriff investigating Paul Sheldon's disappearance, and Lauren Bacall in a guest spot as Sheldon's literary agent. A little credit also ought to go to Misery the Pig in a cameo role. She didn't overstay her welcome and maintained a suitable presence whenever called upon to perform, unlike some other sow who might have gone over the top with a ham performance.",

But I must say that this movie version of the novella is rather outstanding, and that is because of a combination of the story, the directors work and the acting performances of primarily Kathy Bates and James Caan.The story told in \"Misery\" is a story that should appeal to just about everyone, I think. It is a story of obsession, isolation and desperation. I enjoy the story and have watched the movie a bunch of times over the years, and the movie keeps being just as entertaining as the first time I watched it.I think that having chosen both Kathy Bates and James Caan as the lead roles of Annie Wilkes and Paul Sheldon respectively was quite good, because they are quite capable performers and they did great jobs in \"Misery\". And there is a great chemistry between the two on the screen, which worked well in favor of the movie and storyline. In all honesty, then \"Misery\" was truly Kathy Bates' movie, because she far outshone James Caan with her performance.The gradual revealing of the level of obsession and lengths that Annie Wilkes was willing to go to was so nicely constructed in this movie, and director Rob Reiner managed to put that on the screen quite well. And the scenes that involved violence were quite expertly choreographed and captured on the screen, and it felt like you were right there in the ordeal with Paul Sheldon.The ending of the movie, well it was a fairly generic way to end the story, but of course, it was as it usually is in such thrillers/horrors. Could it have ended differently? Certainly. The ending of the movie is the only weak point in the entire movie for me.",

This is a dark story, but one with many belly-laugh moments, and we agreed that it is best viewed as a dark comedy. Bates won the Best Actress for her role as \"Number One Fan\" of novelist Paul Sheldon.James Caan is author Paul Sheldon and has had a series of successes with a \"Misery\" theme, the name of the main female character. He always follows the same routine, he drives his Mustang from New York to the Colorado mountains, stays in the same place, writes his new book, and drives back to New York.Kathy Bates is nurse Annie Wilkes, living on the outskirts of the small town. She proclaims herself as Sheldon's number one fan. She knows his routine very well, and just happens to be following his car when he drives away in a snowstorm. When his car careens off the road (was it accidental?) and down a snowy embankment, Annie is right there with crowbar to get him out. A sturdy woman, she carries him out and nurses him back to health in her home.The whole movie is about this obsessed woman who has trouble separating fiction from reality when it comes to the \"Misery\" books. As Sheldon is recuperating she gets him to agree to let her read the latest manuscript, but she becomes very upset over some of the contents, particularly that Sheldon is letting Misery die in childbirth, and in her warped view accuses Sheldon of killing Misery. This begins the downward spiral which cannot end well.Richard Farnsworth is perfect as Buster, the low-key mayor and sheriff of the small community, helping to figure out where Sheldon disappeared to. Lauren Bacall is fun to watch as Marcia Sindell, Sheldon's publisher.SPOILERS, SPOILERS: Early on Annie decides to keep Sheldon captive for herself, and does not notify authorities or try to get him to a hospital for his broken legs and other injuries. As he begins to figure out how to sneak around the house when she makes trips to town, he finds her scrapbook and figures out that starting even as a teenager Annie would systematically \"eliminate\" people that may have been in her way for an honor or a job. He figures that she may eventually try to eliminate him. She does get rid of Buster when he becomes too nosy, but in an epic struggle at the end on the bedroom floor, Sheldon finally gets the best of Annie with, ironically, his typewriter!",

This film is a sublime plotting triumph in which the gore and action are largely replaced by psychological terror and pitch black humor. The adaptation works both as a demented psycho-thriller and a virulent criticism towards obsessive fan behavior. James Caan stars as the talented author Paul Sheldon who just finished his first personal novel in years, after a series of book focusing on one heroine \u0096 Misery Chastain \u0096 that nearly killed his artistic creativity. When a car crash during a blizzard nearly kills him, he's rescued and nursed by Annie Wilkes who also turns out his biggest fan. It doesn't take long before Annie proves herself to be an authentic psychopath who imprisons and mutilates John and even forces him into writing a new Misery adventure. Rob Reiner perfectly reflects the increasing feelings of hopelessness of James Caan's character. We witness how every attempt of his to escape fails and how every mental collision with Annie results in a creepy freakshow! The disturbing character of this film may mainly be caused by chilling dialogue and psychological warfare, the script doesn't neglect the horror and shocks entirely! I'm particularly thinking about this eerie sequence in which Bathes does something nasty with a miniature sledge-hammer\u0085 Granted, \"Misery\" wouldn't be half as powerful or memorable if it weren't for the top-notch casting job. Kathy Bathes truly deserved her Academy Award for this role and she's one of the most convincing psychos ever! She actually gives a bizarre sort of naturalness to her severely insane character and even playful words like \"whoopsiedaisy\" sound horrifying coming from her mouth. Caan is terrific as well and his character's oppressed frustration nearly drips from the screen. Last but not least, \"Misery\" has an excellent supporting cast with some famous \"elderly\" actors in their best roles in ages. Richard Farnsworth as the little-town sheriff and a still good-looking Lauren Bacall as the agent.",

Back at her farm where she lives alone Annie tends to Paul's injuries including a couple of broken legs & confesses to him that she is his biggest fan & has all of his books. At first Paul is relieved that she saved him but things take a turn for the worse when Annie reads his latest novel only to discover that he is killing the main character off, Paul soon finds out that Annie is a bit mad & will go to extreme lengths to make sure her favourite character's live on even if they're author doesn't...Co-produced & directed by Rob Reiner who also has a cameo in the film as the helicopter pilot, I thought Misery was a great watch. The script by William Goldman was based on the novel 'Misery' by Stephen King, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two, has a good pace to it, while it's slow & not that much actually happens it's very measured, effective & far from boring. The basic story is very engaging & very tense which is exactly what a dark psychological horror/thriller such as Misery should be. There are only three character's of any substance in the film & while everything works well I thought there could have been a bit more background to Annie, for instance it emerges as the film progresses that she may have been responsible for the deaths of babies at the hospital where she worked but it is never confirmed & seems almost nothing more than an afterthought just to make her more 'evil' as it were. I have no idea what the medical/mental condition is called that Annie suffers from or how accurately portrayed it is on screen but she's pretty scary at times & her unbalanced nature is both convincing & well used. I thought the ending lacked a little something & felt a bit rushed & I'm not sure if I'd want to see it again anytime soon but overall I think Misery is a fine film on various levels.Director Reiner does a great job at keeping the tension levels high & it's a film that draws you in & making you want to know how it ends. He keeps thing generally pretty simple, there's no flashy camera tricks or overblown set pieces but I'm sure that was intentional by the filmmakers. Whatever you may hear Misery is lacking as far as blood & violence goes, there's a scene where Annie breaks Paul's ankles with a sledgehammer although you actually 'see' virtually nothing on screen, it's a scene that sticks in the mind because of how it's achieved & frankly how painful it would be in reality. This is one area where the film is different to the original novel, in King's book Annie cuts Paul's foot off rather than breaking it. Trivia: ironically I hurt my own ankle badly at work two weeks ago & went to hospital where x-rays showed I hadn't broken anything but I had a fair amount of soft tissue damage, it hurt so much I was in tears & couldn't even stand on it properly. I cringed while that scene was playing & I can't even imagine how painful it must have been...With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Misery is as well made & polished as you would hope for, it does what it has to very well. The acting was good by a pretty small cast. Apparently the role of Paul Sheldon was offered to Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Richard Dreyfuss, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford & Warren Beatty all of whom turned the role down, now that's some serious knock backs. Kathy Bates won an Osacr for best actress in a leading role for her performance in Misery.Misery is one of the very best Stephen King adaptations & a great film in it's own right, definitely well worth a watch.",

            "content": "Stephen King's novel had a smashing premise that the film only partially succeeds in capitalizing on.It's clear that \"Misery\" is an author's (or at least King's) worst nightmare: a writer of disposable potboilers (James Caan) is in an accident and finds himself convalescing in the home of his self-proclaimed #1 fan (Kathy Bates). Trouble is, his #1 fan is holding him hostage, and does nasty things to him if he doesn't write exactly what she wants him to.Some of those things are diluted for the film (in the book, she chops off one of his feet, whereas in the movie she only hobbles him with a sledgehammer) and some missing altogether (the finger in the birthday cake for instance). But it's not the gore that made the book scary -- it was the helplessness of the main character, and director Rob Reiner is right to focus on that in the film as well.Kathy Bates is appropriately wacky as Annie, but she's a wonderful actress who's done a bunch of much better work elsewhere, so it's sort of a shame that this is the film for which she won her Oscar. Caan is good too, but he's shown up by Bates -- anyone would be shown up by this loony-tunes character.It's only toward the end that Reiner trips up, and the film goes lame, veering away from the book. However, in the film's defense, the ending to the book was pretty lame too, so Reiner was probably right to try to do something different, even if that something doesn't really work.Grade: B",

Caan and Bates deliver magnificent performances and play off each other perfectly. The subtle horror elements are very well executed and Bates just being in the room is intense and unpredictable. Her delivery of the personality traits were mesmerizing. The settings were well depicted and it is impossible to not love the sheriff and deputy and their dynamics too. The punishment scene in this is legendary and still makes me cringe every time I watch it. This picture does do a good job of delivering the nursing back story and the ending is absolutely awesome, both at the house and restaurant.Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece and must see.

Me I just want to be entertained and could not care one bit about what these people do in their spare times and such. Still, this movie has a nice flow to it, and has some rather darkly comic moments as our writer struggles to escape the clutches of his one true fan. How does he end up in her clutches, he has a car accident that leaves him severely wounded and the other person in the car dead. His fan is nice enough at first, but he makes the mistake of letting her read his latest manuscript where he has killed off a character that has appeared in a series of books for him. Her name being \"Misery\", which if I was a fan of the series I would expect that sooner or later a character named Misery was going to die sooner or later. So most of the movie is the interplay between the writer and his crazed fan. Not much in the way of death in this film, but the acting makes up for that as does the story. It is mainly a movie that kind of hangs around the house which says all the more for it that it is entertaining.",

            "content": "Misery is probably Stephen King's most frightening story because of the way it grounds in reality how one person can be living his life, and then suddenly be thrust into the most terrifying ordeal he has ever experienced. Its a refreshing change from King's supernatural stories.Don't be mislead by the title. Misey is far from a miserable experience. Its a gripping, tightly wound thriller from startling beginning to nail-biting conclusion.The film begins with novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) finishing a new novel. But one that is different from the \"Misery books\" he has become famous for. He feels that writing about Misery Chastaine for so long has stifled his creativity. So after he finishes his brand new novel, he checks out of the Silver Creek lodge, and goes for a drive. Unfortunately, a blizzard sends his car off the road.When he wakes up, he finds himself in the home of nurse Annie Wilkes (the superb Kathy Bates). As a result of the accident, Paul is now temporarily crippled. This is not a good thing, in more ways than one. Gradually, Paul (and the audience) realises that Annie is dangerously unstable. She claims to be his \"number one fan\". She's completely obsessed with him and his Misery novels. She is none to happy to discover in his latest novel, Misery dies. And she wants Paul to write a new novel, heralding Misery's return.So begins the battle of wits between Paul and Annie, as he desperately tries to find a way to escape. There is a real claustrophobic feel to Misery, thanks in no small part to Coen cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld's tight, unnerving camera angles. They do a great job of capturing Paul's horror at being at Annie's mercy. As most of the film takes place within the confines of his room, Paul must find a way to out-think Annie. But she always seems to be one step ahead.James Caan gives a good enough performance as Paul Sheldon, keeping a subtle, slightly cynical attitude while at the same time terrified of his situation. But the real star of the film is Kathy Bates. She is just brilliant, and steals every scene she is in. The audience is transfixed by how one minute she is a caring, slightly eccentric person, and than suddenly changes to a psychotic, homicidal lunatic. Sometimes she is downright evil.The \"hobbling\" scene is especially memorable. A demonstration of Annie's power over Paul. Thwarting his attempts to escape. Breaking his spirit. The relationship between the two characters is skilfully handled, as Annie tries to keep Paul to herself forever in the name of love!What terrifies you the most is the way Annie's delusions are the only thing keeping her from killing Paul outright. She would willingly sacrifice both their lives to ensure Misery lives. Although Annie Wilkes is a terrifying creation, she is a sometimes sympathetic character. One wonders what could have possibly happened to Annie to make her so demented. Kathy Bates deserved the Oscar for this film. One of the rare occasions the committee got it right.The novel told the story completely within the confines of Annie's home, but the film includes other characters too. Richard Farnsworth's Sheriff Buster is a likable character. His relationship with his sarcastic wife is fun to watch. Sometimes, it feels like he is the only person looking for Paul. Lauren Bacall puts in a cameo as Paul's agent. Its a pity she couldn't have got more screen time. But this was probably an attempt to keep up the psychological tension between Paul and Annie.The ending is extremely suspenseful, as things inevitably come to a head. The audience (unless you've read the novel) is kept guessing about the outcome. Almost like a Hitchcock film. Kudos to Rob Reiner for making a thoughtful, suspenseful, psychological thriller. Kathy Bates rules. Misery recaptures everything that made the novel so great. It beats the film version of The Shining hands down. Brilliant!",

Caan and Bates are both brilliant, especially considering that one is bedbound for the majority of the movie, and it's their battle of wits that keeps things as engaging as they are. The flick excels at putting you in its protagonist's shoes; it really makes you feel his pain and desperation. It's often incredibly suspenseful, especially in a few of its stand-out set-pieces. It's also surprisingly exciting when it needs to be, primarily in its brutal finale. Ultimately, it's a really well-made film. It grips you as soon as it opens and it doesn't let you go until its credits have rolled. It's great. 8/10",

            "content": "Only Stephen King can turn a basically one-room play into a full length novel of horror, originality and suspense. I've read the Misery book at least once and it ranks as my second favorite of his, behind The Stand, and though some things were changed in the movie adaptation and though some things angered King (Caan), Director Reiner did the same job on the film as King did on the novel. He definitively created a full length movie of horror, originality and suspense.After pulp-novelist Paul Sheldon (Caan) finished his latest story in Colorado, he heads home in a huge blizzard only to crash in the snow and be \"rescued\" by Annie Wilkes (Bates). She proceeds to nurse him back to health in her isolated cabin in the woods since he's severely banged up. Slowly, but surely, Sheldon begins to see the crazier side of his \"number one fan\" as she calls herself.See, she's upset Sheldon \"killed\" off her precious Misery Chastain character from eight novels. She died in child birth, not really murdered. Nevertheless, the character that actually never really lived is gone and no more Misery Chastain novels. Telling this to Wilkes is like taking Jason Voorhees's machete and saying \"no more killing, okay, Jason?\" How do you think Jason would react? Well, aside from a few brutal tortures she bestows on him during his stay at the Wilkes's farm, she namely reacts by making him write/type Misery's Return to bring back the character to life. Not that he had much choice, but he does write it and all the while concocts up feeble escape attempts until the inevitable conclusion.Despite the mainly one-room set, Misery is tight, interesting, beautifully shot and acted by the leads. I remember the Oscars attached to 1990 vividly. Though I was rooting for Dances With Wolves the whole way, it was absent from the Best Actress category. It was tough deciding between The Grifters's Anjelica Huston and Pretty Woman's Julia Roberts. But it was a no-brainer on who actually won: Kathy Bates in the best performance of her career before and since.I sure did love the book (and the book within the book \u2013 Misery's Return, that I objected to at first, but then grew accustomed to and interested in that story as well) and as almost always, the book's better than the movie with a lot more going on, including, again, the book-with-a-book. Still, Misery was an excellent example of film-making, and even holds up today after 19 years.Side Note: Though all I said about the novel, Misery, it appears Stephen King went back to the same general idea with Gerald's Game. Unfortunately, after I read that, lightening really only struck once. It wasn't terrible, but nowhere close to Misery and I sincerely hope they don't attempt to adapt Gerald's Game.",

This movie is a perfect psychological thriller, almost like a Hitchcock movie.Stephen King writes some great novels, but Misery is one of his greatest. In the late 80s, Stephen King novels were hot properties for films, and with the great success of Misery, it was only a matter of time before they made a movie out of it. The first good sign was that Rob Reiner took the helm. He had previously done a fantastic job bringing Stephen King's The Body to the big screen as Stand By Me. Next, the role of the author was taken by James Caan, who is one of the most talented actors out there. I really enjoyed William Goldman's screenplay, because it stayed true to the book while also adding some things to make it more interesting. The blend of terror and comedy in some scenes is perfect and it makes the movie really enjoyable. I especially love the scene where the woman brutally injures the author, and the next day she gleefully waves at him, and he just nonchalantly waves back...With his finger.The acting in this movie is great. There's only about 5 roles that really mean anything, and the actors are all great. This is one of James Caan's best performances, and it's only matched by Kathy Bates' performance as the crazed fan.Overall, Misery is a classic movie, and it is the best Stephen King movie besides The Shawshank Redemption.

Even though Kathy Bates definitely portrays a very scary woman, this movie (unlike \"The Shining\" for example) is also supposed to be FUNNY. Cann's rolling eyes and his good-bad overacting when he is trying to appease Bates' deranged character is undeniably comic. Judging from how rare it is, it must be difficult to balance dramatic tension with doses of humor, and Rob Reiner has pulled it off with unusual grace.

Yes, Rob Reiner has delivered one of the more finer Stephen King adaptations. Though I have never read the novel, King himself stated that \"Misery\" is one of his favourite movies based on his works. James Caan & Kathy Bates have a really hard job to do keeping us entertained throughout the film. But the chemistry between the author and psychotic fan is so incredibly intense and unflinching in its depiction, it manages to elevate beyond expectations and still remain profound in the thriller genre today.Famed novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan), is the author of a series of regency romance novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Whilst driving home he is caught in a blizzard and his car unfortunately goes off the road, leaving him unconscious. Paul is rescued from the wreckage by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home as Paul is broken and bed-ridden. She reveals to be Misery's \"Number 1 fan\", and inevitably Annie's fanaticism seems to go way beyond the norm, possibly leading to big trouble for the helpless Paul.It's so well acted and directed, you can get sucked in just like that. Even back then I loved how subtle and cool everything seemed in the beginning, then it just takes a turn for the worse until ultimately it turns into a battle of survival where the odds are completely stacked against you. Kathy Bates takes fanaticism to a whole new level, into the stuff of nightmares. She more than deserved the Oscar for such a career defining performance. James Caan does admirable work, I've always appreciated and enjoyed his performance and presence on screen. Final Verdict: Stephen King is my favourite author, and Rob Reiner adds another gem to his filmography. The performances alone are more than enough reason why I highly recommend seeing it. 8/10.",

            "content": "Rob Reiner adapts Stephen King's novel into a taut thriller that is intense, well paced, tightly packed and fantastically acted. The tension is well built and maintained throughout the entire film. The screenplay has a few predictable moments and overdone jump scenes but that doesn't stop 'Misery' from being a fine gripping thriller. I see influence of other classic works, such as Hitchcock's films, which is pleasant to uncover. But what really makes this an outstanding movie is the acting. The film 'Misery' really required very talented skilled actors to pull off the dialogue delivery, the subtle nuances and the transformation in character as they are vulnerable to being played as caricatures by lesser actors. Fortunately, Reiner and his casting director have done a superb job in selecting their actor. Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall are simply terrific in their roles. However, it is James Caan and Kathy Bates who own the film. While Bates has deservedly received immense recognition for portraying one of movie's most popular badass female characters, Caan remains overshadowed. But I feel he deserves equal credit. One only ought to notice his reaction to everything Bates's Wilkes says and does in order to understand the greatness of his performance. The acting and screenplay make the film so captivating and entertaining that I could easily rewatch this and enjoy it just the same.",

Caan is the consummate pro, just excellent, as always.I really like like Bates, but as another reviewer cited, the acting is over the top. I'd put it differently. For me, her little girl, up/down fairy-tale telling melody of a voice; particularly early on when she's first mesmerized by the writer of the misery series, (Caan), it just phony, and way too often, even if she is portraying a loon. And it becomes annoying fast.But I do like her mood swings and outbursts.Some wicked twists in the flick.Anyway, a great one-time watch.Bob R.",

            "content": "There are three types of people who frighten me: people who have an intense love of popular romantic fiction; people who can't bring themselves to swear and instead invent their own homespun swear-lite; and people who think they actually talk to god. All of these afflictions hint at an arrested development, an inability to deal with reality and a barely suppressed rage. So, needless to say, in light of her suffering from all three of these disorders, Annie Wilkes is a woman to be extremely fearful of.But of course, at first, she seems so nice. She rescues Paul Sheldon from freezing to death after crashing his car in a blizzard and then she gives him medical treatment in her own home. But no sooner has she opened her mouth than she's declaring him 'The World's Greatest Writer' and calling him a 'literary genius' \u0096 this she says of a man who loathes his own work and a man who hates the way he's become a manufacturer of bland product rather than a writer expressing himself. But even more worryingly she apologises for making him feel \"oogy\". The warning bells ring loud and clear.But Annie's insanity doesn't get its first overt display until after she's begun reading the manuscript that was pulled from Paul's car \u0096 it's more personal work and it's a breakaway from the Misery tripe he's been getting rich off. She admits that it's well written but she says the profanity bothers her. And she flies off the handle completely when Paul insists that slum children do indeed swear. It's a great scene and Kathy Bates' delivery is perfect. It's both comical and unnerving.However, more frightening than the loss of temper is the way that Annie apologises. She tells Paul she loves him. Paul's sphincter must be playing all kinds of tricks.After this the film plays the humour of the situation for a little while. We get a funny scene where Annie introduces Paul to her pig (which, surprise, surprise, is called Misery) and then there's a fantastic bit where Annie is talking about her failed marriage. At first it appears to be a serious scene, but then halfway through her spiel we find out that Paul has been urinating into a bottle while listening to her prattle on. And it becomes even funnier when Annie begins lecturing Paul while swishing the bottle of urine absently in her hand. The weird humour helps make Annie seem more believable (and therefore more terrifying).Another funny moment is when Annie is talking about 'Misery's Child' (unbeknownst to Annie, it's Misery's final book \u0096 Paul's killed her off). She's about halfway through and she calls it divine. And then she asks this wonderful question: \"What's the ceiling that dago painted?\" \"The Sistine Chapel,\" is Paul's incredulous response. \"Yeah, that and Misery's Child, those are the only two divine things ever in this world.\" It's a funny moment because it reveals so much about Annie's character \u0096 she's totally ignorant and she's casually racist, too (so much for being clean and pure).But the humour in the film comes to a bit of a halt when Annie finishes 'Misery's Child' and finds out about Misery's death. She terrorises Paul as he sleeps and then in the morning she makes him burn the manuscript of the new non-Misery book he's written. In a typically fundamental Christian sort of way she insists he must rid the world of this 'filth'. And in one of the most casually frightening bits in the film she walks around the bed absently squirting lighter fluid on his legs. It's only after this that Paul is persuaded to burn his book. And the look on Caan's face is wonderful. He's both completely heartbroken (he might as well have burnt one of his own children) and filled with rage \u0096 after this he quietly declares war on Annie.But after the burning the humour does return. However, it becomes more closely linked with the horror. For instance, there's a darkly amusing moment when Annie loses her temper when Paul shows that the expensive paper she's bought for him smudges. She begins shouting and then slams the paper into his lap. And then there's the rant she makes about chapter plays (\"He didn't get out of the cockadoode car!\"). I mean, it's nutty enough that a woman has her favourite writer held hostage in her house and she's making him write a new Misery book for her, but it's blackly comic that she becomes a violent one-person focus group. It must be every writer's worst nightmare \u0096 you've got to tailor your work to the whims of a nutball.A fabulous scene illustrating how precarious Paul's situation is is when Annie begins talking to him in a depressed state. She goes on about how the rain gives her the blues and she says how fearful she is of losing him. And then she pulls a gun out! Again both Caan and Bates are tremendous. Caan barely suppresses his alarm and Bates casually says that she might put bullets in the weapon. Once again it's a small off-hand moment that is horrific in the implied threat.And the famous hobbling scene is made that more unsettling but the way Annie tells Paul she loves him after she's broken his ankles. Nothing says \"I love you\" like smashed feet, eh? But although Bates rightly gets a lot of attention, I really must give Caan a lot of credit for his performance. He conveys the helplessness of his situation superbly and it's such a cathartic moment when he finally stuffs the charred remains of 'Misery's Return' down Annie's throat. But if I'm nitpicking I do have to say it's a shame that the fight at the end has the clich\u00e9d 'back from the dead' moment. It's the only wrong step in an otherwise fantastic film.",

            "content": "I doubt that any writer in history had so many film and TV adaptations of his stories. According to my account, there are about a hundred of them and, as King is one of my favorite writers, I went straight in. I do not know whether he's difficult to adapt to a screenplay or it's just an unhappy coincidence, but most of these adaptations are a big disappointment for the fans of \"king of horror\". However, there are exceptions. Ten years (and seventeen King adaptations of questionable quality) after Kubrick's masterpiece \"The Shining\", Rob Reiner treated us with magnificent \"Misery\".This psychological drama-thriller is so powerful that it borders with horror. The movie starts quite relaxed, but from the very beginning gradually builds a hypnotic atmosphere that will keep you pinned to the screen. From minute to minute it becomes more tormented and tense, and it does not ease up even for a moment. King does not need monsters, explicit bloodshed, shock scenes or sudden turns, to keep you on the edge of the seat and distort your stomach. Nevertheless, the greatest merit for this film's impressiveness does not belong to King's story, but to the magnificent Kathy Bates. Even without her rich acting career, the role of Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" would be enough to put her among the best actresses of all time. The persuasiveness of her instant transformations is amazing and she deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The masterpiece that everyone should see at least once.10/10",

            "content": "I didn't really want to watch this movie as it dealt with some disturbing issues. Namely false imprisonment and a psychotic fan actively preventing her prisoner from leaving. It seemed disturbing, but I decided to watch it anyway and discovered that it was not as disturbing as I thought it would be. What this movie does say, is what I see in a lot of Stephen King movies, and the books that I read, that horror goes far beyond nasty monster and lots of gore.A famous writer, Paul Sheldon (James Caan) finishes a book and leaves his retreat in the mountains in the middle of a blizzard and ends up crashing his car. He is then pulled from the wreckage by a passing nurse (Kathy Bates) who we first discover is a fan, and then learn that she had been stalking him. He at first believes that he is there recovering, but soon he comes to realise that he is not going to get out - especially since he killed off her favourite character in one of his books.What this movie explores is the dark, unseen side of the human psyche. We consider humanity to be generally nice, and prefer to ignore our darker side. Yet it is something that we cannot avoid with stories of horrid murders by apparently innocent people. Yet once they commit such an act, we ignore what drove them to do that act and label them as being bad. What we really ignore is that we are capable of being driven to that point at well.This is not the case in Misery. The woman has been twisted for a long time. We don't get to know her that well to know what caused her to go that way, but we do know that she has been married and the man whom she was married to was disappointing. We also soon discover some nasty secrets about her past, and maybe it was that which slowly drove her mind into the state that it is in, seeking the beauty of Sheldon's books to escape the reality of her true nature.What I like about Stephen King (and what people seem to ignore regarding his works) is that he explores the human psyche, and it is this that is truly horrific, especially since it is something that we choose to ignore. Many of us will say that no human can be like that, yet we look around and see that it is not true.",

            "content": "Misery is a great example of an unpredictable and disturbing story set pretty much entirely in one place that is seemingly in escapable. In 1980, Stanley Kubrick delivered one of the eeriest and best horror films of all time: The Shining, penned originally by Stephen King. Ten years on, James Caan is the trapped Shelley Duvall only it's not just the snow that forbids them to leave but the fact most of the bones below his hips are severely broken. Secondly, in true gender switch fashion; the psycho is that of Annie Wilkes (Bates) who does an equally good job as that of Nicholson in The Shining.Why The Shining was a better film is because it was eerie, unpredictable and genuinely scary \u0096 it was an out and out horror as the reason to be scared was due to ghosts haunting the hotel. That said, Misery is still a great film as it uses psychology to scare the audience or if not to scare then at least make uncomfortable. Annie takes care of Paul Sheldon (Caan); a writer wanting to wrap up his recent series of successful books about a girl called Misery, with very efficient professionalism that gradually becomes efficient obsession.The reason this film stands out so well is that individual brilliant acting performances and the way in which the tension is utilised to an effective manner stick out. We, the audience, know the ending to his new book so when Annie goes on and on about how much she loves his books and the character of Misery in particular is particularly outstanding as she's not going to like the ending to his latest book \u0096 rather a 'wrapping up of events' as far as the girl of Misery is concerned. Watching Paul's reaction to each individual praise Annie gives to Misery is as excruciating as it is entertaining since we don't know how she'll react. Along with this, you have to take into account the fact that Annie is living in a wooden cabin, by her self, in the middle of nowhere which is enough evidence to suggest you have to be weary.Thankfully, the film doesn't toy around too much with this convention and lets the film flow effortlessly into the bulk of the story \u0096 Annie's further decent into madness and Paul's further decent into survival. From here, a series of events some of which are managed by cause and effect, kick in but I got the feeling Annie was the real focus \u0096 she was the most 'entertaining' character and we learn more about her than anyone else in the film. Her mental state is hinted at when they are having dinner together and a shrine is visible directly behind Paul, dedicated to Paul. The framing here is the key thing \u0096 not only are we being presented with good material in front of the camera what with a character being developed during a simple meal scene but the framing emphasises Paul's character as his head fits in perfectly with the middle of the shrine \u0096 a sign of good direction.Paul seems to try everything in the book to try and escape but there is no need to tamper with a snow cat in this film \u0096 his broken bones make for an excellent suspense device as he is limited to a wheel chair. He has to do everything in stages when he tries to escape: first there's the getting out of bed, then out of the locked room, then out of the locked front door \u0096 maybe there's another way? Oh no, I hear a car engine approaching....... so you can see that suspense and the feeling of being trapped really work well together to create an atmosphere.Misery does well in its overall delivery. The story of the old trooper trying to crack the case in true Scatman Crothers style as well as the way in which he has a look around the house al\u00e1 Psycho (1960) may feel copied but it's just good suspense; a feeling of plagiarism that is partially erased by the extremely satisfying final fight scene which acts as a great payoff for the rest of the film. A tight and uneasy horror film that delivers in suspense over scares.",

There are so many plusses about this film that make it a wonderful, suspenseful film.  The writing is very good and very literate. The audience is treated with intelligence when supplied with subtle allusions and humour in dialogue.  The acting is top-notch all around.  The two leads are incredible and BOTH deserved some recognition for their performances.  James Caan plays the writer with two legs crushed and unable to walk in the home of Kathy Bates, a former nurse.  Bates gives the performance of her career as this woman capable of being incredibly nice one moment and then totally insane the next.  In fact the quality that makes Bates's performance all the more chilling is the innocence she seems to radiate through her perverse character.  Rob Reiner shoots her well too.  He uses very effective close-ups and the camera always seems to be looking up at her...thus making her seem bigger and larger than life.  The opposite with Caan who is always shot in a down position.  Actors Richard Farnsworth and Francis Sternhagen play a sheriff and his wife, and one wishes they were in the film a bit more for the witty reparte they employed.

The synopsis is after a famous author is rescued from a car crash by a fan of his novels, he comes to realize that the care he is receiving is only the beginning of a nightmare of captivity and abuse.We start this film in a cabin where writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is finishing up his latest novel. He has been made famous by his series of romance novels following a woman named Misery. They take place in simpler times, but he has decided to change it up. He goes through his ritual as he finishes the new novel with a cigarette, lit by a wooden match and a bottle of Dom Perignon. He then calls his agent, Marcia Sindell (Lauren Bacall) to tell her he has finished. He gets into his car and then leaves. The problem is a blizzard hits and he crashes. We do see someone helping him out of his car.Paul then comes to in the house of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). She informs him that she saved him and it was a good thing, because she is his biggest fan. Paul has two broken legs and separated shoulder. It is a good thing she found him as she is a nurse. She tells him that the roads are closed due to the blizzard and her phone line is down. Once they are cleared and fixed, she will alert the hospital about him. She has administered the best care she can to help him get on the path to recovery.Some time goes on and Marcia calls the local sheriff, Buster (Richard Farnsworth), being worried that her client hasn't been heard from. Buster puts her at ease and starts to look into it. His wife and deputy Virginia (Frances Sternhagen) helps as well. They don't find any trace of him, but Buster feels something isn't right.Annie asks if she can read the new novel that Paul wrote. He agrees, but things take a turn when she doesn't like it, as she considers it filth. She is even more devastated when she reads his newest novel about Misery and she has been killed off. We see that isn't mentally stable and hurts the man she is supposed to be caring for. She comes up with the idea that he is going to write Misery Returns and fix what he did, against his will. She also tells him that no one knows he's there or that he's even still alive. Paul has to find a way out of this nightmare before it is too late.It is pretty easy to see how this film was nominated for quite a few awards. The concept of this is actually pretty great. We have a writer, who is typecast by the works that he has been making. It has made a good life for him, but he isn't considered to be a good writer. What he is producing is just commercially successful. As an inspiring writer, I can see both sides of this coin here. I'd love to be a writer full time and knowing that my books would sell, but at what cost? If I am writing things that I don't like, would it be that much different from going to a job every day that I don't enjoy? It is an interesting concept here. Also the physical abuse he endures is pretty cringe worthy as well. The title has a duality to it as well, being that he's in Misery with the punishment he's enduring both mentally and physically as well as being the character he wrote about.Going from there, we have the psychopathic Annie. She is doing a good thing by helping Paul. The problem though is she is holding him hostage. She then is forcing him to write something that he doesn't want to against his will. On top of that, she burns the manuscript of something that he is really passionate about. She did say something that I completely agree with though. She complained about the serial shorts that would play before films back in the day. She hated when it would end on a cliffhanger and then the next one would retcon so they could continue it on. This is a big gripe I have with films when they make a sequel and change things so they fit, because a sequel was not in the original plan.The final aspect of the story I really want to cover is Buster and his investigation. I like that he doesn't jump in thinking that he's been taken. It is a gradual thing that feels completely natural. He finds evidence slowly and builds up to figuring out what is going on here. Now this isn't a spoiler, as you know that things have to come to a head. I even like that he starts to read the Misery series to see if he can find something there and when he does, I was all on-board for that.Next to move to the pacing of the film where I think they did a great job. It doesn't take long to get us into the story of Paul coming into the care of Annie. At first we just think that she is a bit socially awkward. I like that they don't show us she is full blown crazy too early, but we do get glimpses. There are some interesting reveals through things she says and does all the way to the point where we see just how insane she is. There is a great scene of Paul as he gets out of the room spliced with us seeing Annie in town. It is tense as we hope he can get what he's looking for and back into his room before it's too late. I also think the investigation by Buster builds at a solid pace to the climax where everything comes to a head. I like the ending and seeing the effects of this nightmare has on everyone.The acting for this film is quite amazing to be honest. Caan I think does a really good job at being helpless early on. I do like that he plays on Annie's emotions to keep things calm, but he's always looking for a way out. Seeing the disappointment and pain on his face are also really good as well. Bates was absolutely amazing. I can see why she won an Oscar for this performance. She seems unstable from the beginning, but the reveals of how crazy she is quite unnerving. Farnsworth and Sternhagen are great. I love their banter back and forth. Their roles definitely help build the tension. I also thought it was great to see a cameo by screen legend Bacall. The rest of the cast definitely rounded out this film for what was needed as well.To the effects of the film, they really didn't use a whole lot of them. This movie is really more based in reality and mostly psychological. The being held captive is where a lot of the fear comes from. The punishment to Paul though definitely made me cringe. It was done practically and looked so real. I also think the blood we get looks good. The wounds inflicted as well. I also think the make-up on Paul to make his car accident injuries look real which was a solid move. The film is also shot beautifully as well.Now with that said, this film is a classic. I think we had a great story here from the mind of King, but director Rob Reiner and writer William Goldman definitely bring it to life. It is terrifying concept to be kept alive like Paul is by this psychopath and forcing him to do something against his will. I think the pacing is great in ramping up the tension and the horror of the situation. Even the investigation by Buster helps in that as well. The acting is absolutely amazing and the effects they use are realistic. The soundtrack of the film doesn't necessarily stand out to me, but it fits the scene for what they needed. This film is great and would recommend it for horror and non-horror fans alike.",

And even Kathy Bates I felt was asked to do some things that any director worth his or her salt should not have asked her to do (grunting like her sow? Please...)

            "content": "The great Kathy Bates, a woman who somehow became a movie star on sheer talent alone, delivered her breakthrough performance after nearly twenty years in the business in MISERY, and won a well-deserved Oscar for it.I have sometimes played the game of predicting who will win on Oscar night. I'm usually wrong, but when I saw MISERY, I said, \"That woman is going to win on Oscar night.\" As I said, I don't usually call it, but I called it in 1990. And again in 1991 with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (all four awards; something of a personal best for me), 1993 when I predicted Tom Hanks for PHILADELPHIA despite formidable competition from Liam Neeson in SCHINDLER'S LIST, and once more in 1999 when I predicted Hilary Swank's win for BOYS DON'T CRY. Not much of a record, I know, but trying to predict winners is always fun.But I digress. Rob Reiner was not new to King; he had successfully directed STAND BY ME, based on King's novella THE BODY, some four years previously. But MISERY is as far as I know Reiner's only horror movie, a werewolf story without the werewolf.Paul Sheldon (James Caan), a successful writer of bodice-rippers (think Harlequin Romances) featuring a heroine by the name of Misery Chastain, has just put the finishing touches on his latest novel, his first foray into \"literature\" after killing off Misery in the final installment of the series. Or so he thinks.Heading for home, he foolishly tries to drive in a blizzard in a vintage Mustang, not the best car for hazardous weather conditions. Naturally enough he has a bad accident and runs off the road, the car flipped over on top of him and both his legs badly mangled.Enter Annie Wilkes (Bates), a former nurse who manages to rescue him from the wreck of his car and put splints and casts on him and tuck him into bed in the guest room of her farmhouse. We discover almost in passing that she is Sheldon's \"number one fan,\" a declaration that most authors have probably heard more than once, but there's something about the way Annie says it that is just a bit...off.At first, she appears fairly normal, if a bit odd (she has an aversion to cursing and some of the things she comes up with to replace curse words are laugh-out-loud funny), but it is not long before we discover that Annie is in fact the werewolf; in the right conditions, given the right provocations, she becomes a ravening lunatic with a dangerous look in her eyes that quite threw me the first time I saw it.I won't say anything more about what happens; this one would truly be spoiled by too many spoilers. Bates is a revelation, and Caan, who as an actor has sometimes coasted along on looks and charm, is forced here to actually give a performance, and it's a damned good one. Also on hand are delightful cameos by Richard Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen, and Lauren Bacall.But at the end of the day, it is Bates's monumental performance that is the engine that drives this ship. Right into stormy weather. Hang on to your seats and enjoy.",

Director Rob Reiner seems very happy to film a lot of moments in close-up. This leads us to appreciate every raised eyebrow, every wistful look into space and to determine exactly the kind of mood Annie happens to be in on her latest visit to Sheldon's sickbed. The camera often almost zooms into her face as she walks into a scene \u2013 most effectively following the film's most harrowing scene which guarantees more than a wince, when she coos 'God, I love you.' She has his books set aside as soon as they are released, she has a documented \u2013 notorious even \u2013 history of violent, murderous behaviour, she walks around town with her pet pig and is clearly a tolerated local eccentric. And yet it takes local Sheriff Buster \u2013 yes, that's right (Richard Farnsworth), forever to conclude she may have something to do with his disappearance. Farnsworth has also been blessed with eloquent features, and we immediately warm to Buster's kindly ways. Which is just as well, because otherwise our patience would be sapped by his inability to recognise the blatantly obvious.So while the story takes a lot of investing into \u2013 the coincidence of Annie's hero falling into her proverbial lap, and the Sheriff's hopelessness \u2013 the cast and stark direction gives the production its legendary status.",

When famous writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) flips his car during a blizzard, he is miraculously \"rescued\" by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) \u0096 his self-confessed number one fan. However, as he sits in her guest room with two broken legs, waiting for the snow-blocked roads to clear, he could never have imagined just how obsessed this woman actually is. Though Sheldon became famous for writing a series of novels featuring heroine Misery Chastain, he has since grown to hate this character, unceremoniously killing her off in his latest story, \"Misery's Child,\" and setting to work on a \"real\" novel. When Wilkes finds this out, she is absolutely livid with rage, taking Sheldon as her effective captive and forcing him to write a sequel in which her favourite literary character is resurrected.Legendary horror author Stephen King has often excelled at writing stories about characters who are themselves authors, some of them no doubt inspired (hopefully only partially) by his own personal experiences. Some of these have been translated to the screen with masterful results (such as Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'), whilst others have not been quite as successful (David Koepp's 'Secret Window' was saved only by a solid performance from Johnny Depp). 'Misery' is most certainly one of the former, a nail-biting suspense thriller that will leave you feeling both excited and drained.James Caan is very good as Sheldon, a man faced with a terrifying situation in which he is helpless to do anything. Likewise, Richard Farnsworth is very entertaining as Buster, the local town sheriff, who suspects that there might be something unusual about the author's disappearance. But full honours go, of course, to an Oscar-winning Kathy Bates, who is exceptional as Wilkes, snapping like clockwork between mild-mannered gushing and murderous animosity.

The actor succesfully uses body language and facial expressions as a realistic and fascinating mean of communication, thus increasing the bond between the spectator and the character.The plot is easy and the setting is basically a room in a cozy house, but the movie was able to keep the viewer's involvement high for all its duration.The figure of Annie Wilkes was also very powerful and the music and the framings strengthened her image: an impulsive, unpredictable, bipolar, aggressive and violent woman.Some features of the movie vaguely reminded me of Kubrik's masterpiece \"Shining\", for the theme of the isolated house and the deviated antagonist who threatens and holds hostage the few victims of the house... And also the presence of a typewriter!Specifically about writing, I must underline that I really appreciated that the movie developed around the topic of writers and creative writing: Annie forces Paul to burn his novel, which is very precious to a writer because it is the uninque result of his inspiration and creativity, and it took a lot of effort... And she monitors him, obliges him to write what she wants, taking away art, freedom (which are the elements that make creative writing special) from his work.I really felt the pain in those moments.In addition, I also noticed the parallel development of the sheriff's investigation: well made in the sense that they didn't feel non coherent with the rest of the narration and, finally, cherry on top, the small funny scenes during the movie (in general) didn't make it lose in quality.In a nutshell, what really made me appreciate this movie was the constant emotional involvement that it gave me for its whole duration: plausible and interesting development of the plot, appreciable and unexpected plot twist and an excellent interpretation and description of the two main characters.",

Of course, a few short moments before she had dragged her favorite writer's body down to the cellar.This is all from a God-fearing Christian. And this tripe is all from a leftist director who directed the flop \"North\" about a child trying to sue his parents. By the way, thankfully I never sat through \"North\" or \"The American President\".

Basically, it was the type of movie that shows that you can make the most of a limited setting and a (mostly) limited cast.

Living alone in an isolated farmhouse, nurse Annie comes across as resourceful, physical, observant, skilled, and competent. At the same time, she's naive, lonely, and delusional. Second, Kathy Bates animates the character with such verve and passion that we have no problem believing in Annie. She seems so real, so homely, such a kind, motherly woman, imperfect perhaps, with a slight temper. But hey, everyone is entitled to have a few imperfections.In addition, the script's dialogue exudes humor throughout. At a candlelit dinner on a card table, as a melancholy Liberace song plays in the background, Paul (James Caan) patronizingly asks Annie how she makes such great meatloaf. With great sincerity and pride, she responds: \"My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes ... and to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef\". Marvelous.The script's theme is likewise ingenious. Paul, as a famous writer, commands respect and power. By contrast, Annie is a nobody, common and powerless. Yet, the story flip-flops the power structure, and places Annie in control. We sympathize with Paul. But we respect Annie. And ultimately, this is a story about Annie Wilkes, not Paul Sheldon.Competent cinematography, detailed set design, amplified sound effects, and good support performances all enhance the film's production.My only quibble is the casting of pugnacious James Caan as Paul; I would like to have seen what Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford could have done with the role. Also, the film's climax is a tad over-the-top.\"Misery\" is a slow-moving story about a lonely woman whose outward humanitarian behavior camouflage sinister motives, as she traps a famous writer in her rural sanctum. It's a fine film. And Kathy Bates certainly deserved her academy award.",

Sheldon finds himself trapped with multiple injuries included compound fractures to his legs meaning that he is immobile and dependent on Wilkes to care for him. She also tells him that the telephone lines and down and roads closed, both of which are lies. Things take a darker turn still when Wilkes goes and buys the latest book by Sheldon which has just been published (yes the road to town has mysteriously been reopened but there's no mention of Wilkes taking Paul to a local hospital) only to discover that her favourite character Misery has died during childbirth. Wilkes isn't happy about this. This is bad news for Sheldon.Misery explores the obsessive, irrational fan devotion that was explored in very different circumstances in Scorsese's meisterwerk The King of Comedy, a film that bombed at the box office whilst Misery was a huge hit but is inferior in comparison. Oh, the irony.Before seeing Misery for the first time I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King's masterful novel of the same name. The film adaptation feels like the finer nuances of the novel have been erased to make a big screen shocker that contains great performances by Kathy Bates (Wilkes) and James Caan (Sheldon) with Paul's literary agent being portrayed effortlessly by the ever divine Lauren Bacall.But the film also feels like some kind of TV movie that lacks not just the depth of King's novel but also the cinematic grandeur that might have been envisaged and realised by another director other than Rob Reiner.Misery feels like an attempt to hit big at the box office by creating two dimensional characters and cheap shocks rather than delivering anything with real intelligence. And it worked. Misery brought in the money and earned Bates an Oscar. But watch Misery next to other, better King adaptations such as The Shining and Carrie and you'll see what I mean.

            "content": "A writer wants to make the step from writing (commercial succesful) pulp to writing literature but is afraid for the reaction of his readers. This theme forms the basis for the film \"Misery\" in which writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) becomes literally the prisoner of his number one fan Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates).The film which reminds very much of \"What ever happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962, Robert Aldrich) shows that adoration can be as dangerous as jealousy. In a brilliant performance of Kathy Bates her Annie Wilkes is not insane all the time but does have her outbursts. This only makes it scarier.The film is based on a novel by Stephen King. Most of the books of King become movies and as a general rule the less violent the book, the better the movie. \"Misery\", which only becomes real violent towards the end, fits into this rule. It was the second King adaptation by Rob Reiner, after \"Stand by me\" in 1986, and he is up to the task. According to IMDB ratings only Frank Darabont, who made the King adaptations \"The Shawshank redemption\" (1994) and \"The Green Mile\" (1999), is his superior.Cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who also did \"When Harry met Sally\" (1989, Rob Reiner) and sometimes works with Joel and Ethan Coen, did a perfect job. He alternates between wide shots of the (beautiful) landscape of Colorado with claustrophobic shots inside.The film heavily centers around the characters of James Caan and Kathy Bates, but there are a few notable supporting roles worth mentioning. The old sheriff of the little village where Annie Wilkes lives is played by Richard Farnsworth, who would be the leading character in \"The Straight story\" (1999, David Lynch). The agent of Pauls Sheldon is played by the icon of the '40s and '50s Lauren Bacall.",

He manages to keep the audience gripping the edge of their seats as he creates a real claustrophobic type terror through the situation of 'Paul Sheldon' (James Caan), a writer who finds himself trapped in the home of his obsessive 'number one fan' (Kathy Bates) after she rescues him from a car accident in the remote Colorado mountains.This film comes highly recommended to all suspense and Stephen King fans, especially given the outstanding Academy Award winning performance from Kathy Bates. Just imagining what will happen next will keep you glued to this, if you can handle it.Tuesday, September 29, 1992 - VideoReiner's taught direction and Kathy Bates' marvellous, unnerving performance make \"Misery\" a chilling, suspenseful film that shouldn't be missed by Stephen King and Horror/suspense fans.James Caan and the editing crew are also worth an honourable mention.

What is also very good is, that at no point does the plot feel unbelievable. Fans can be VERY disconcerting, as you can see all over the Internet.The acting is spot on. James Caan's performance is very believable and you can really sympathize with him. Kathy Bates is nothing short of brilliance and beats most of Hollywoods pretty faces by a mile. They way she perfectly comfortably changes from cheery and silly to outright murderous is great.Directing is nothing special. It's solid and it carries the good script and the great performances.Misery is certainly worth the time. It's scary, but not hauntingly scary, unless you're a famous novelist. 8/10.",

You must also read the book- even if you are not a fan of Stephen King- you will like this book, and find it horrifying.I just re-read the book again, and found many insightful passages. King's character \"Annie Wilkes\" is brought to life by Kathy Bates. A fictive personality, Wilkes is a schizoid psychotic, obsessed with writer Paul Sheldon (Caan).The setting is the isolated mountains of Colorado- Wilkes is a retired nurse, who initially helps Sheldon after a near-fatal car accident. It is not long before he realizes he is a captive audience, and Wilkes is his \"Number one fan\". Bates is believable because she is so unpredictable; one moment she is loving and protective; the next she is sharpening her ax.This film is suspenseful, and more terrifying because, unlike many of other King's adaptations, does not have the element of the supernatural. The fright factor is based on human nature, alone. That is one of the primary reasons most audiences will enjoy this film, even if they are not a fan of Stephen King.",

            "content": "In our post-Hitchcock era, it's often forgotten how much design and formula there is to this kind of thriller, how a picture like this requires precision of timing and technique, space and structure. No matter how ingenious your concept and storyline are, if they're not presented properly they will no more thrilling than a dry account in a newspaper.Of course, one can't underestimate the importance of a good plot, and this one happens to be just such a work of ingenuity. Steven King's novel upon which Misery is based is one of the modern breed of real-life horror stories. These tend to be very effective if they can suggest a disturbing and perilous situation which any one of us can imagine and fear ourselves getting into. Granted, not every one of us is a celebrated novelist as Paul Sheldon is, but we could all conceivably be held at the mercy of some obsessive sociopath. And the business of the writer seemingly doomed to write the same trash over and over gives the story an added layer of interest, the characteristic hook that a good psychological thriller needs. Screenwriter William Goldman retains the core and most of the key aspects of King's novel, but condenses it well for the screen, also adding touches which keep it moving well for the motion picture format, such as the angle with the sheriff's investigation.And a good thriller, no matter how expertly written or constructed, needs a decent cast. Kathy Bates's portrayal of a murderous obsessive is incredibly believable in its superficial charm, mood swings and constant hint of the bizarre, but what really makes it brilliant is the way she works it for the needs of the movie. Her timing and delivery seem expertly calculated to make us wonder just when she will kick off again. In those moments of silence before she speaks, her expression is mysterious, unreadable, and we can't tell whether she is about to tell Paul she loves him or to savagely assault him. She even seems aware of the comical aspects of her own character, emphasizing Annie Wilkes's stranger utterances for comedic effect, without ever losing sight of the underlying realism of her performance. James Caan is very good too. His part here may consist chiefly of pained grimaces, but there is a certain art to that too which Caan has mastered.But these things would be worth little if they weren't put together properly. Misery seems like an unusual assignment for director Rob Reiner, who began his filmmaking career with the acclaimed mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap and followed it up with a series of warm-hearted comedy dramas like Stand By Me and When Harry Met Sally. And yet Reiner is an adaptable fellow because he does not seem to consider himself an artist \u2013 he simply applies himself to the needs of the picture, and as he himself has stated he actually set out to learn the techniques of making a thriller when he got signed for Misery. He learned good. Crucial here is Reiner's distortion of space, with lots of confusing close-ups and wide-angle lenses which flatten the foreground and pull the backgrounds forward. In the occasional wider shots of the bedroom where most of the movie takes place we see there is actually a lot of empty space around the bed, which gives us a bleak sense of isolation, and makes the surrounding walls seem all the more oppressive. Reiner even makes sure the scenes outside the house, such as those in the sheriff's office, are not too wide open, with few big landscape shots or visible skies. The audience may be privy to other goings-on, but we are not allowed to escape from the feeling of claustrophobia.The value of these techniques may seem a little tenuous \u2013 but they do genuinely work. Space, timing, and visual arrangements can have a strong psychological impact. It is crucial for a picture like this that we share in Paul Sheldon's sense of entrapment and helplessness. Reading a plot synopsis wouldn't be scary, but seeing the plot visually presented in the right way can be a terrifying experience. And this is also why there are so many thrillers out there that have a good idea but simply don't work in practice, or why sometimes an original movie can be brilliant but the remake is an unfortunate waste of celluloid. And the reason we don't often realise that we are being manipulated is that the very best directors do it so well we don't even notice.* * *Note: This is not an attempt to disparage King's novel by suggesting that written thrillers are not as good as cinematic ones. Novels have their own techniques for enthralling us, ones which Mr King is certainly well-versed in.",

            "content": "I hadn't seen this film in years and wasn't quite sure how it would hold up, but it remains a strong example of a chamber-piece horror film that excels at slow burn horror and suspense. James Caan plays romance novelist Paul Sheldon, who's in a horrific snowbound car wreck, but is \"rescued\" by his #1 fan Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates in a brilliant and terrifying performance. Sheldon soon realizes his savior is in reality holding him captive, but there is little he can do due to the remoteness of her house and his wheelchair bound state. What ensues is a game of cat-and-mouse between Caan and Bates that is suspenseful, frightening, and utterly thrilling. The film is tightly directed by Rob Reiner (\"Stand by Me\" \"A Few Good Men\" \"The Princess Bride\" \"When Harry Met Sally\") and is smartly scripted by William Goldman (\"Magic\" \"Marathon Man\" and the under-appreciated \"Dreamcatcher,\" along with non-genre classics like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Princess Bride\") based on a Stephen King novel of the name. Goldman's script gets major kudos for making this chamber piece horror film believable. Sheldon is an intelligent character and Goldman has him try all of the things an intelligent person would do in order to try to escape, which makes the situation all the more terrifying. Caan is perfectly cast in the role of Sheldon, a tough guy macho on-screen personality who finds himself uncharacteristically laid low, making this plights all the more disconcerting. But it's Bates who steals the show as Sheldon's obsessed and deranged fan, determined to keep Sheldon all to herself at any cost. There are few other characters in the story, but the actors in those roles are equally memorable. Richard Farnsworth is excellent as a small-town sheriff investigating Sheldon's disappearance, as is Frances Sternhagen who plays his wife. It's also a treat to see Lauren Bacall in a small supporting role as Sheldon's publisher, but for the most part, the film is all Caan and Bates. Overall, \"Misery\" is a class act of a horror movie, which is a rare occurrence, and is essential viewing for fans King, Caan, Bates, or of horror films or thrillers in general. SPOILER ALERT!

            "content": "With every plus there's a minus. Life comes with scales and scales require balance. People want success but don't know how to handle it once they do. Being rich is great unless one doesn't know how to be fiscally responsible. The same goes for fame. It's great being the center of attention, but sometimes it's not so great. This film is a great example of that, despite the actual story being an allusion to the author's alcohol addiction. Ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things. Sometimes those things are of no benefit to anyone. So how could being a famous writer lead to such a situation? Try meeting a deranged fan who won't let up on the harassment.The plot is about famous author Paul Sheldon (James Caan) who just finished a new book he's ready to publish. On his travels he has a car accident and is rescued by a devoted fan named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). At her place she nurses him back to health, only for Sheldon to realize Wilkes is more than a fervent fan. Her desire is to be Sheldon's next character of focus. Meanwhile, Sheldon's family and agent Marcia Sindell (Lauren Bacall) are concerned about his disappearance. For help, they contact the local sheriff Buster (Richard Farnsworth) and wife Virginia (Frances Sternhagen) to see what they can do. Based on the novel by Stephen King and written by William Goldman who'd later pen Chaplin (1992) and Maverick (1994), makes this quite a watch.It's interesting that viewers get to know quite a lot about the main characters just by the trailer alone. Even with all that being revealed, there's still much to see that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. With Rob Reiner directing in this genre for the first time, it's all the more captivating. Before this Reiner had also directed Stand By Me (1986) and The Princess Bride (1987). Like mentioned before, the film has a balance between the high strung and more pleasing moments believe it or not. Seeing Paul Sheldon trying to find a way to escape his captor's home is beyond nerve racking because of how unhinged Annie Wilkes is. But then there's also the scenes involving Buster where his deductive skills play a major part in the story.However, a weak point in the story occurs when a plot device is used to tie two different plot threads together. These two plot threads share the plot device, but when looking at it from a bigger point of view, it seems very convenient. Almost like the probability of such a thing happening is completely unlikely. This doesn't take away the performances from the cast members. While Kathy Bates had been acting prior to this feature, it was here she made her breakout role. She plays her character well alongside veteran actor James Caan who was in hits like The Godfather (1972) and Rollerball (1975). The more intriguing scenes are delivered through Sternhagen and Farnsworth's characters. Farnsworth is also known for starring in The Grey Fox (1982).The camerawork is also well done. Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld, who would later on direct The Addams Family (1991) and Men in Black (1997), the camerawork here is shot competently for the film. The viewer truly gets to see how mentally unhealthy Annie Wilkes is in her home and the stress that Paul Sheldon develops because of it. The music was another great component. Composed by Marc Shaiman, the film score again has a stable mix of tones in different areas of the story. There are unsettling cues with piano and strings for Sheldon's hardship, as well as softer easy going motifs using horns for Buster's investigative scenes. Unfortunately, the score is a bit short in material but still captures the feel of the movie.Taking out one convenient particular part of the story that helps move the plot, this thriller will hold its viewers' attention. The tension only cranks up as time goes on thanks to the acting, camerawork and music.",

That this became the hit of 1990, bringing an unknown actress by the name of Kathy Bates into light as a Force to be Reckoned With, granting her an Oscar for her supreme, textured interpretation of what would and could have been (in lesser hands) a one-note role was rather surprising.1990 was a rather weak year for actresses -- few were the roles that really stood out from the heap. Annie Wilkes came to life on screen, and that changed everything. Thanks to the dark magic of Stephen King and the tortuous creative experience that led him to write about the ultimate fan and the nauseous ties that would bind Annie to her object of her desire, MISERY came to light, itself a distant descendant of the type of psychological terror depicted in WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? but nevertheless a powerful tale describing one of the most mobile moments in the history of horror: the hobbling scene.Originally described as one where Annie hacks off Paul Sheldon's foot with an axe (she of course, hacks off a finger and serves it as a birthday candle later on in the book, which is gruesome to the extent of being unreadable at times), it's effect is no less chilling and stomach-churning when shown in its more muted version -- the one which Reiner and Goldman translated onto the silver screen. Because Bates shows Annie as someone who really, deep down, has some extreme, twisted \"love\" for Sheldon and his art, the fact she has to make sure he will never escape her gives this moment a complexity it wouldn't have had any other way. Annie is a Creation, a Woman who is a mass of chaotic energy who wants to ensure this fictional world will survive and make her bleak, unlivable world bearable.MISERY works up right until its end, which is predictable -- a necessary event, because we've been waiting for a physical battle between Annie and Paul and Misery all this long. To see the comeuppance of such a dreadful character is the goal for any story. Not to show it would be anti-climactic. To show too much would be camp. Reiner and Goldman create a delicate balance, one that is extremely tense, riveting -- but the Final Scare comes as perfunctory... and that robs the movie of its Effect. (Of course, thank WAIT UNTIL DARK for this, although the climactic moment in the book flattens the story's emotional punch.) However, this is a classic of modern horror, totally enjoyable, and a complex character study of the battle of wits between two people who depend on the existence of an invisible third.",

For me, Misery ticks all those boxes and more. It's one of the most underrated thrillers, and movies, of the 1990's, packed with great dialogue, interesting shots and a killer ending. Rob Reiner's magnum opus, I'd go as far as saying. Some would argue it edges slightly too far away from the source material by Stephen King, but as I haven't read it, I'm going to judge solely on what I've seen, and William Goldman's script is brilliant.I could write for hours about Kathy Bates in the role of Annie Wilkes, but I'll endeavour to be succinct. It's a big, bold, brave performance that occasionally veers towards the more animated, but never, not for a single moment, loses its core of truth. Many other actresses would have toned it down, made Annie quieter and more inwardly intimidating, but the film would have been poorer for that. James Caan, usually the epitome of charisma, is more restrained here, physically and emotionally, which allows for Bates to really go for it. The result is, in my opinion, one of the most unpredictable and fascinating performances in film.There's a creeping sense of dread running through Misery from the beginning, though it's occasionally pierced with dark and often cheeky humour, almost used to disarm us. The camera shows things from everyone else's point of view, rarely, if ever, from Annie's, adding to that growing feeling of unease and making the whole thing so watchable. Makes you wonder what she'll do next. There are a lot of scenes inside the Wilkes house, but there are some beautiful and picturesque shots of the surroundings and nearby town, as well as Paul's agents office in the city, much needed to break that earlier referenced claustrophobia.The first ten minutes will hook you in, and the last ten will wear you out. As for all the bits in between, well... your ankles might jump a bit, you'll find new meaning to the phrase \"number one fan\" and you'll witness one of cinema's most captivating and disturbed characters come to life.",

But it was William Goldman who adapted the material and wrote the screenplay, his script is terrific. Misery is not a horror movie but it's frightening that uses the psychological-thriller genre to perfection.

            "content": "Misery is a horror, thriller and is a film very remotely similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock 1960 Psycho. The story follows Paul Sheldon, a successful writer off of his collection of books that goes by the name of Misery. After he had completed a copy of the final edition to the franchise he meets an unfortunate event in which he goes off the main road and crashes his car on the way to work. After the incident he got saved by Annie, his number 1 fan, which at first seemed like everything was going to comeback to normal once she gets him to the hospital. However what he doesn't know coming for hims is that Annie is someone who is totally obsessed with his Misery books, and wasn't going to have him get off so easily unless he concludes the series her way. Mean while, well all of this is happening, detective Buster has been notified by Paul boss about his recent absents, having him go out on the search.The majority of the film took place in one location which is Annie's house and was mainly told from Paul perspective. There will be cuts to Annie getting into a store or to the detective searching for Paul but other than that the audience is basically in the mind of Paul. This makes for an interesting premise since the main protagonist is helpless and there could always be fatal consequences if he doesn't escape or write the story to her liking.The one who carries this movie of course is Kathy Bates which can be seen by her Oscar win. What makes her performances so special is that, she was able to escalate her emotions from a calm and inviting person to full of agony and resentment when her character is proven wrong. James Caan is also great as the backbone of the narrative in which he was required to act as two different people in one character, a reactionary role, and a role where he has to pretend to like Annie. The reactionary road is harder than it looks in this particular story because it collides with him pretending to show affection to Annie. If he shows a lot of anger while not being able to take her on his own than he would risk getting hurt which James kept a good balance of.Overall I rate this film an 8/10 because although it has a neat premise, and a great main protagonist along with antagonist, I feel that the side characters don't add a whole lot to the story. There were times when the detective was given multiple chances to do the right thing but the writers had him not which was to obviously expand the runtime of the film. However this is a much watch film, even if you are not a horror fan!",

            "content": "Misery is a classic portrayal of top notch tension, and it is up there with such Hitchcock nerve-snapping classics that genuinely grab you by the jugular and don't let go. It is a film for thriller fans, although I warn that it is not for the squeamish, it has limited amounts of violence in it but when it gets going it sure hits you. For the first part of the film you feel all relaxed, and you begin to feel that maybe everything will be alright and that everything you've heard about the film is a load of old cobblers, you think she will heal his horrendous injuries and then release him... but still nothing is further from the truth. After a while you begin to get the signs that everything is not good. It has gone a bit sour, and as you watch the helpless Paul Sheldon (James Caan) try to escape you grind your teeth and bite your nails as he narrowly escapes being caught by his captor Annie Wilkes (played remarkably by Oscar winner Kathy Bates) as he tries to find ways out, and looks around the house she is holding him in whilst she is out shopping and do other such like activities. But why? Well Paul Sheldon is a novelist who has written a string of very successful stories about a heroine named Misery... Hence the name, although I guess there are other reasons for such a title. In his latest edition he has killed her off, and naturally Annie is not best pleased, she is paranoid, and outraged that Paul should write such a book, which as of yet he has not published, so she gets him to burn it and write a new book especially for her. After a while it gets a bit routine, you think she will hold him and then let him go as soon as the book is complete, yet something else is lurking. She is not just holding him to write a book whilst he gets better, but she is getting totally obsessed, and by the time he is getting back to health and he is about ready to go as the book is just about finished she snaps... Wanting to keep him she resorts to the infamous sledgehammer and... well you get the picture. The ending is quite fantastic and the overall impact of this brilliant film is quite overwhelming. It is a very good film with many resounding qualities, but still with flaws it being pretty decent but still pretty lax adaptation of what is a true Stephen Knig masterpiece it can only languish at 8/10. I guess it is hard to do justice by such a great book and I think that sure this film is well worth a few viewing, but there is more pleasure in reading the book than there is in watching the film.",

Little details add up that you're glad that you kept track of, and the suspense and timing were set up very well when Annie left the house and when she would come back with what Paul would be able to do in the meantime. She got exactly what she deserved in the end too which was satisfying. Aside from A Few Good Men and The Princess Bride, this is Rob Reiner's best movie!",

            "content": "I was very privileged to see this film in my youth. I am writing this review in my thirties.This film is a suspense thriller and not a horror film.Examples of Stephen King horror films are: The Dark Half, Graveyard Shift, The Langoliers, IT and Pet Cemetery. These films are classified as horror because they all deal with supernatural creatures.The theme of the film is a race for survival, a battle of wits and the battle between good and evil.Sheldon (James Caan) is good, and Wilkes (Bates) is evil embodied.Bestseller novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the writer of novels depicting a character, Misery Chastain that has become world famous. After finishing the manuscript of his latest novel, he leaves Silver Creek, Colorado to New York, but he is caught in a blizzard and his car sheers off the road. He is rescued in the nick of time by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) and brought to her remote home. Both of Paul's legs are fractured, and he has a dislocated shoulder, leaving him bedridden and largely unable to move.Wilkes role in the film is that of a pure dictator. For a woman starved of a mans presence and touch for many years, she shows a real hatred towards all men. She is not at all aroused by Sheldon, who is a handsome man. So her character is that of a frigid woman - a woman devoid of any sexual appetite. Sheldon tries to seduce her, during a dinner with her but fails.Wilkes pride and joy are Sheldon's novels. After reading his manuscript of his latest book, Misery's Child, which Paul intends to be the final Misery novel, she flies into a rage, brandishing a small table on Paul's head. She masters her temper however, and tells him calmly that she never contacted the hospital, or anyone Paul knows as she earlier claimed to have done.And here is where the film really kicks into gear. The race for survival has begun.Sheldon shows more character than he is given. Not many man in his situation would have dared half the things he did in order to survive. I am reminded of a certain die-hard character....The way he crawls out from his bed in his fatal condition brought the tears in my eyes. And the pain he feels in this film is real.This film has a disturbing scene in it: Wilkes breaks Sheldon's ankles with a sledgehammer in an act of \"hobbling\". Those of you unfamiliar with the term can \"google\" it up. This method was used in the South African Diamond mines to discipline workers that stole diamonds. Wilkes explains this to Sheldon before she hobbles him.Won't say any more of the plot. You will have to see what happens next. Loose no opportunity to buy this treasure of a film on DVD.Similar films: Midnight Express, Escape from Sobibor, The Great Escape, Papillon, Saw, Cube, Fortress, The Running Man, Surviving The Game and Escape From Alcatraz.

Upon watching the movie I realized that is the actual scene, the cartoon might have changed the dialogue but the events are the same as the original live action film. Most would describe the plot line as being about a psycho woman who is obsessed with an author, but that doesn't seem to be the case. She seems obsessed with power, his books and possibly the one character in the books but despite the claims she doesn't seem to love him just what he made. If anything she seems a bit delusional and might feel as if she is the character in his books, but it's never explored. The big hole in the movie is why does she love his books and this one character so much that she will go to such extremes to keep the character alive. It's a movie about this woman but never tells you much about her.",

            "content": "Following on the heels of The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, director Rob Reiner decided to try his hands at a much different genre. As we all know, Hollywood adaptations of Stephen King novels have met with varying levels of success, but Misery marked the second time Reiner directed a story from the prolific horror writer (his first film adaptation was Stand by Me). Upon its theatrical release in 1990, the film was met with wide critical acclaim, which many attribute to Kathy Bates portrayal of a psychopathic country bumpkin (she won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress). I've seen Misery at least twice over the years, and it continues to provide the same level of tension I experienced in my initial viewing.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a well-known author of romance novels centered on a character named Misery Chastaine. Having completed his latest novel at a country lodge in Silver Creek, Paul sets off through a snow covered pass to deliver the manuscript to his publisher. Along the way, he loses control of his car and crashes into a ditch along the side of the road. As he regains consciousness the next day, he looks down to find his legs severely fractured in the crash, and learns his savior is a middle-aged ex-nurse who runs a pig farm. Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) describes herself as Paul's number one fan, who relied on the stories of Misery Chastaine to make it through some tough stretches in her life and feels incredibly fortunate to have been given the opportunity to take care of Paul. Unfortunately, everything takes a turn for the worst when Paul's latest Misery novel is released to the local store and Annie finds out Paul killed off the star in the conclusion of the series. In a rage, she demands he make it right by completing a new novel that resurrects the heroine, locking him in her house until it's completed. Desperate for a way out, but physically unable to protect himself or escape, Paul attempts to weather Annie's psychotic outbursts and devise a plan to make it through the ordeal with his life.If you're looking for edge-of-your-seat entertainment, Misery will fit the bill perfectly. The tone is absolutely unnerving as Bates lulls the audience to sleep with her happy-go-lucky side, only to catch us by surprise with her pulse-pounding outbursts of uncontrollable rage. Watching her spiral out of control as she scolds Paul about the use of profanity in his new novel give us our first taste of what's to come, but it's not until she learns of Misery's death that we get a true taste of just how demented the woman is. Watching a film of this nature makes us ponder what we would do in Paul's situation, which steadily turns from bad to worse as the film progresses. He knows his captor is demented from an early point in the film, but as Annie so eloquently states \"If she dies, he dies\". Paul must constantly remember he's not only a prisoner by Annie's choice, but also a prisoner by his own physical circumstances. It gives the film an almost claustrophobic effect that adds to the building tension.One of the effective aspects of the plot in Misery, is the cat-and-mouse game that Paul and Annie play with one another in the second half of the film. I don't want to give away spoilers (in case there are readers that somehow missed the film up to this point), but Paul ends up becoming just as crafty as Annie through the final act. This is a culmination of his earlier attempts that either result in accidental failure or a tendency to always remain one step behind Annie. I won't divulge what happens, but every time the wine scene approaches, I cringe in anticipation of what's about to take place.From an acting standpoint, Misery is a grand achievement across the board. As I mentioned before, Kathy Bates won Best Actress in 1990 for her portrayal of Annie Wilkes, and I can't imagine a more deserving recipient. Moving flawlessly between innocent sweetness and vicious rage, Bates owns your attention every time she steps into a scene, keeping us guessing with the ever-shifting personality of her character. Caan is equally impressive in the role of Paul, which requires him to remain in a bed or a wheelchair through the entire length of the film. His ability to convey vulnerability over a tough-guy facade is a testament to his acting abilities, and I hope we see more leading roles thrown his way in the coming years. Lastly, I have to briefly mention the late Richard Farnsworth as the local sheriff. Though his part in the film isn't as extensive or challenging as Bates or Caan, he's the perfect choice for a role that demands little more than a soft exterior and a good heart. One of the pivotal moments in the film (and most shocking) involves his character, but I don't think it would be nearly as important if we didn't gravitate toward Farnsworth's charming portrayal in the early stages of the story. If anything, Misery is worth watching simply for the performances from the talented cast.",

I think Alfred Hitchcock couldn't have done a better job at creating a thriller. There is somewhat of an intangible spirit in King's books that doesn't come through on the big screen, most movie adaptations of his novels are inferior at best and downright laughable at worst, but this one is THE BEST adptation of his work that I have ever seen it is every bit as good as his prose even better. Since this film is set mostly in a lonely snow covered farmhouse, Kathy Bates and Jimmy Caan have to carry the film on their shoulders pretty much and both come thru in spades! Kathy Bates may not be very glamerous, but she is an awesome actress and rich deserved that Oscar. In a sense, she has to play four different roles. Let me explain, she plays Annie as good and kind, she portrays her as humerous (when she berates Paul for the swearing in his book), she also portrays her as a sympathetic lonely figure and then she portrays her as evil. Lets not take anything away from James Caan, although he has the easier part (a lot of his part is just acting like hes in terrible pain). He is one of the few actors who can play anything well. By the way, to the people who were chilled by the \"hobbling\" scene. It could have been worse, in the book she chopped off his foot with an axe and sprayed it with a blowtorch.",

            "content": "Of all the film adaptations of cherished horror author Stephen King's body of work, one of the man's all time favorites would have to be the feature based on Misery. Directed by Rob Reiner, written by William Goldman, and starring James Caan and Kathy Bates, the film was both a critical and commercial darling on its original fall 1990 release and awarded Bates her very first Oscar. King went on record to call the film one of his all time favorite adaptations of his bibliography, and the film has since remained in cult status for years. Looking back on the feature over 30 years later, is its legacy truly earned or not?The story follows famed novelist Paul Sheldon, who upon getting into a blizzard accident, gets abducted by an obsessive fan named Annie Wilkes. Being the biggest reader of Sheldon's Victorian Misery novel series, Wilkes holds the injured man hostage and forces him to rewrite the finale to the series. It has been very common for die hard fans of some famous creators to be picky with the work they make, but in the case of Annie Wilkes, her obsession with Paul Sheldone borders on more than just that of his books. By hiding her devious cruel nature behind a cheery facade, Annie's entire presence in the film becomes that of a sociopathic manipulator. Meanwhile, Sheldon fears her constant mood swinging behavior while also resenting how much she controls his own life through a book series he wants to move on from. Much of the time, James Caan has to do a lot of physical emotive acting rather than the broad gesture approach he'd normally be known for, presenting an incredibly relatable side to Sheldon that anyone could see themselves in if they also couldn't simply walk.With these scenarios in mind, despite how twisted and vile Wilkes is, the feature cleverly finds time to present a more sympathetic side to her. Despite her sick mind and aggressive nature, it's often hinted how depressed and misguided she truly is in her own view on the world, even if it means to have her favorite book series redone to fit her own needs. In addition to being debatably common to others who stalk celebrities, her irreverent violent tantrums come less from a place of malice than a place of logic foreign to the real world. In a way, Misery is a shocking portrayal of a tragically ill woman who simply couldn't see the grand picture. On another note, the late Richard Farnsworth is charmingly laid back as Sheriff Buster, as his subplot of searching for Sheldon by any means possible paints a relieving contrast from the claustrophobic madness inside the Wilkes residence. Admittedly, Sheldon's agent Marcia Sindell and Buster's wife Deputy Virginia have less screen time to really stick out, but since the main focus is on Wilkes and Sheldon, all is forgiven.Going into the aforementioned claustrophobia, Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography paints the dreary isolating aroma that a remote Colorado cabin would have. A lot of specific far away shots establish the uncomfortable nature Paul Sheldon faces trapped against his own will, by a diluted fan without a semblance of reality no less. On top of that, Robert Leighton's editing is appropriately reserved up until Wilkes snaps, to which it then goes haywire and becomes more intense than the tone already is. In allowing certain edits and shots to go at a jumpier pace every now and then, the filmmakers cleverly let the pacing take its time before the stakes would understandably get higher. Even when it becomes obvious what will happen to a certain character, the result can still leave an impact due to the high tension led by the overtly demanding monster that is Annie Wilkes. Aided by a somberly sinister score from Marc Shaiman and you have a film that knows exactly when to thrill the audience, by easing them into the fear through quiet subtlety and specific filmmaking.After all these years in the spotlight, Rob Reiner's Misery remains a top contender for the best adaptations of any Stephen King novel. In addition to subtle psychological filmmaking and some sweet side characters, the leads elevate the feature with their standout portrayals of two victims being stuck together under the more evil one's demands. If you haven't seen the film yet or have yet to read the original book, then giving them a go would be a tremendous honor amongst King enthusiasts and the psychological thriller genre. It may engage you more from the mind of a depressed madwoman than most out there.",

            "content": "After doing a creditable job of converting Stephen King's 'The Body' with Stand By Me, Rob Reiner goes one step better with Misery. This intense psychological thriller is genuinely shocking and shows the audience what lunacy does to people whilst at the same time, luring the audience in to a journey of fear that can not be escaped.What makes Misery so memorable is Kathy Bates portrayal of Anne Wilkes which is one of the most memorable performances of the decade. Wilkes is such a complex character; her apparent motherly nature is greatly complimented by her obsessive behaviour towards Caan. It is this obsessive nature that gives the first clue she is psychopathic. When her psychopathic behaviour dominates her personality is when the film really starts to become something special. Her constant outburst are often surprising and her body language shows more than her lines, just how on edge she is. Although not in the same league as Bates, James Caan is a great choice for Paul Sheldon. As an actor who often plays very physical, tough guy roles, his frustration at being bed ridden and chair bound comes across very well in his character and his shock and fear mirror exactly how the audience feel.The infamous 'hobbling' scene is a particularly gruesome scene and will be shown on television for many years to come. The lack of discreteness makes it so real to watch and you really feel the pain when you see it. When the plot unravels on Wilkes' character and her background is explained, the film becomes even more disturbing and shows that Caan is in more trouble than he ever imagined.With Bates' performance stealing the show and the fact it is one of Stephen King's better novels, Misery is a contemporary classic that has more than enough thrills and chills to keep audiences satisfied.",

But this was a great film. James Caan plays Paul Sheldon, a famous writer who is in a life-threatening car crash in the middle of a snowstorm. He is rescued by his \"#1 fan\" Annie Wilkes, played by an outstanding Kathy Bates. She nurses him back to health and tells him how much of a fan she is of his novels and of the lead character in them Misery Chastain. But when Paul lets her read his latest unpublished novel, and she finds out that Misery has been killed, she reveals her darker side and refuses to let him go. She forces him to burn his book and write a new novel involving Misery's return. Paul soon realizes that she's mentally unstable and much more than a #1 fan. She unplugs the phone, lies about calling for help, locks the doors, and refuses to let him leave his bedroom. But he still tries to escape and get help. There's the infamous \"hobbling\" scene where Annie breaks Paul's ankles with a sledgehammer after noticing her ceramic penguin has been moved. And she realizes that Paul has been out of his room. That scene is brutal! Definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But it's actually one of the most talked about scenes in the film. And while Paul is being held captive in the middle of nowhere, Paul's agents and book editors and the local sheriff are out there looking for him because he has been missing for quite some time. But Annie refuses to let anyone know that he is even alive. So once he realizes that Annie is dangerously psychotic, he has to fight for his life.I like Misery because it isn't very bloody and doesn't involve some demonic monster. The monster in this film is a human being! And it displays how far some fans of famous people can go to see their idols or even get close to them. This film portrays how dangerous mentally unstable people can be and how their personalities can change in an instant. I have never read the actual book Misery by Stephen King but I think this film was a great adaptation. Kathy Bates played Annie Wilkes perfectly. She was utterly creepy and convincingly psychotic. She deserved that Oscar win and I'm glad she received it. James Caan was also perfectly cast as Paul Sheldon. You felt so much sympathy for him and wanted him to escape so bad! And you just knew that Annie was going to end up killing him before the film ended! And the direction by Rob Reiner was right on cue. Misery is a great suspense film and I'm glad I watched it. Thanks for reading my review!",

            "content": "I have been a fan of the works of Stephen King for many years now but, sadly, they seldom translate well to the big screen. This is a rare exception and one I have seen several times before. It is best known for the stand-out performance from Kathy Bates, for which she won the Best Actress Oscar in 1991, and deservedly so (IMO). A very tense thriller, it grabs your attention and leads you down a dark path into the twisted mind of Annie Wilkes.Paul Sheldon is a writer; he has been writing a very successful series of romance novels featuring the heroine Misery. He now wants to write something new and has gone to Colorado to find some isolation so he can finish off his new book. On his way back he is involved in a car crash and is rescued by nurse, Annie Wilkes. It turns out that Annie is also his number one fan. After a few days, Paul's agent, Marcia Sindell contacts the local Sheriff, Buster, and he starts looking for him. Annie looks after Paul, who was quite badly injured in the crash, she is allowed to read his new book, but doesn't like it since Misery isn't in it. Fortunately the new Misery novel has just been published, but when she reads it, things take a nasty turn for Paul. He has killed off Misery and Annie really doesn't like the idea of that one bit.It's a pretty well made film with the action switching between Paul and Annie and Sheriff Buster's investigation. Great performances all round; I've already mentioned Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes, she was tremendous. James Caan did a pretty good job as Paul Sheldon too, as did Richard Farnsworth as Buster and Frances Sternhagen as his wife Virginia. I must also give a special mention to Lauren Bacall as Marcia Sindell, she's not on screen for long, but she still has such great presence.This is one of those films I could happily watch at least once a year. I love Kathy Bates in this role, she slowly becomes more and more psychotic as the film progresses, it's great to watch! James Caan does a good job too, trying to win her trust so he can make an escape attempt. It's not perfect though, it does get a little baggy in the middle and, I thought, a little too long, but it's still perfectly watchable. Over all\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10",

            "content": "Both Stephen King and Rob Reiner have lost much of their charm for me in the past fifteen years, but in 1990 they were still in top enough form to create this masterpiece. Having struck gold in 1986 with his memorable adaptation of King's Stand By Me, Reiner made another attempt at the works of the successful suspense artist, and brought along for the task screenwriter William Goldman, with whom he worked before on the film version of Goldman's own novel The Princess Bride (Goldman would later adapt King twice more, somewhat less successfully, with Hearts In Atlantis and Dreamcatcher).King's writing is clearly at its best when he keeps the supernatural to a minimum; the stark reality is what made Stand By Me powerful, and it worked even better in Misery. Not only does King keep things frighteningly realistic in this story \u0096 it's also clearly semi-autobiographical \u0096 not, of course, that he was actually kidnapped by a crazed fan, but King's experiences with over zealous fans of his work clearly seeps into the story, and like in The Shining, King writes best when he writes about writers. James Caan does a more than adapt job of playing the bitter, King-ish author Paul Sheldon; master-adapter Goldman (whose credits also include Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men and Marathon Man) did a fantastic job of translating the book into the big screen.As good a job as Reiner, Goldman and Caan did, this film clearly belongs to Hollywood newcomer Kathy Bates, who won a much deserved Oscar for the role of Annie Wilkes (over old-timers Meryl Streep and Anjelica Huston). Bates is brilliant, frightening and sympathetic in the role which remains the defining role of her acclaimed career, and she makes the character come alive like no other actress could have, proving that being blonde and skinny is not what makes a great actress. Annie Wilkes remains one of the most memorable villains in cinema history, and for good reasons. Caan is excellent in his part, and praise should also go to supporting actors Lauren Bacall and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story), but Bates steals the show from all of them.Thanks to Kathy Bates' masterful performance and Rob Reiner's wonderful direction, Misery is one of the most powerful and frightening thrillers in cinema history. If anyone needed proof that Reiner was capable of serious dramatic films and not just quotable cult comedies like This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, Misery proved that point, although it doesn't lack in its own quotable one-liners. It's a strong, realistic horror film that doesn't let go. A modern classic and highly recommended.",

            "content": "Misery (1990): Kathy Bates, James Caan, Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen, Graham Jarvis, Jerry Potter, Thomas Brunelle, June Christopher, Julie Payne, Archie Hahn III, Gregory Snegoff, Wendy Bowers, J.T. Walsh... Director Rob Reiner, Screenplay William Goldman.A Writer's Fan From Hell\"Misery\" was writer William Goldman's film adaptation of the popular Stephen King novel and directed by Rob Reiner. Released in December of 1990, this is now a nearly forgotten tale of terror. In truth, \"Misery\" was never as successful and memorable as other Stephen King classics- \"Carrie\", \"The Shining\", \"Children of the Corn\". The title \"Misery\" is a play on words- Misery is the fictional heroine in the film and also hints at the misery Sheldon experiences. James Caan portrays the acclaimed novelist Paul Sheldon, whose \"Misery\" series - about a beautiful and passionate heroine of the bodice-ripper/Harlequin romance kind- have stirred the imagination of millions of readers. Among them is Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a lonely widow and retired hospital nurse living in a secluded home in wintry Colorado. When Paul, en route to his Colorado home to work on his next novel, is caught in a blizzard, his car tips over and he is injured. Annie saves him and takes him home, where she nurses him back to health. But it doesn't take long for Paul to realize that this woman is dangerous and psychopathic. She has a criminal past- she killed several babies in hospitals where she worked. She keeps a grotesque pig as a pet. Far more than just a fan of his novels, she is obsessed with Paul Sheldon himself, keeping his photographs and articles about him. When she reads his latest manuscript, she is upset that he kills off his Misery character and demands he write a new novel in which she returns to life. Paul spends a long time trapped in her home, forced to write the novel and forced to battle the crazed Annie herself. At the time of the film's release, this movie received an R rating for the language and the violence. The violence derives from the character of Annie, who is mentally unstable and causes Paul bodily harm. This film is, for me, very engaging as a work of somewhat realistically drawn horror. The fact this film does not feature the supernatural elements that Stephen King is best known for (ghosts, demons, possessions)is a refreshing change. The horror in this film is found in the troubled nature of Annie Wilkes. She is a religious lunatic (she thinks God send Paul to her), socially maladjusted (doesn't have friends, family, job, her husband is dead) and her idea of love is warped. Too many viewers at the time of the release, her breaking Paul's legs and other tortures were too graphic to be seen on the screen. How times have changed! William Goldman, best known for great novels and film adaptations, seems to be in a kind of subtle battle with King's original vision. King clearly wants us to fear this woman and loathe her. But Goldman hints at a woman we should feel sorry for- she is a vulnerable, pathetic woman who is lonely and unhappy, desperate for social contact and love. Because she is so isolated and friendless, she becomes crazy. This madness, believe it or not, seems to derive from her fantasy life, from the life of her inner mind. In the character of Sheldon's Misery, she finds comfort, hope and confidence, as if she is living vicariously through a fictional character. She does not care that this role model Misery is a made-up creation. It would interest some people to know that such crazed fans exist. Some readers become so familiar with an author and their work that they become obsessed. This is a great film and if you enjoy Stephen King, you are sure to love this. Kathy Bates and James Caan have genuine chemistry on screen. Kathy Bates delivers a sensational performance, revealing depth and versatility as an actress. She far outshines James Caan and it is this film that appears to have made her a star that Hollywood took a bigger interest in.",

Maybe the many lousy TV-series like The Langoliers or It prevent that. But right here we have another example of a great story, and I must say, filmed superbly: Misery... How to make a movie this interesting with just 2 characters is amazing. Obviously, you need 2 good actors. No problem here: Caan and Bates are intense and brilliant. Comic relief comes from the ol' Sherrif's couple, now all you need is a good ending... which IS good (though not great, especially the leap in time at the end) with Caan killing off Bates with his typewriter...

The book is excellent, King's best next to The Shining, and has never ending terror. The movie version isn't as good.James Caan is a popular romance novelist, he writes the Misery books, about Misery Chastain, a rich 19th young woman. Millions of fans love her, including Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates, in an Oscar-winning role), who finds Paul Sheldon and brings him to her house after a car crash. At first, she's treating him nicely, but after she reads his first draft of a new book that she doesn't like, and she finds out that in his latest Misery book that Misery dies, Annie gets angry. When Annie gets angry, back away.She makes Paul burn the book she doesn't like, and then Annie keeps Paul captive to write a book: Misery's Return. Since Paul's bedridden with no use for his legs, he can't leave, and if he tries to, Annie will do things to him. One is with a mallet.If you haven't read the book, then most of this review will be worthless, since whenever I see a movie based on a book I have read, my review will be a comparison. Now that that's out of the way, let me go on. The book had nonstop thrills, while in this movie adaptation the thrills varied. Obviously, I knew what was going to happen, but what really made this a good film was the acting.Kathy Bates well deserved her best actress Oscar for this demanding role. Not many people COULD play Annie Wilkes, but Bates is the only person who I could imagine for this role. I was looking forward to seeing her do another great acting job, since I had just seen her in About Schmidt. Caan was also very good, but it's obvious why he didn't win an Oscar. It's really a two-person show, except Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall come in as a police chief and Caan's agent, respectively.To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and there is one brutal scene with a sledgehammer, but that's all I'll say. Much of the violence from the book is taken out, which makes it easier to read. To sum it up, Misery's thrills come and go, but there's some great acting here.My rating: 7/10Rated R for a scene of violence.",

There were people who looked at me funny when I was a kid because I liked to read more adult material like \"Jurassic Park,\" John Grisham, Stephen King. However, when I got older, the looks stopped and people seeing me read his work wanted to know more about him, my mom and a few of my grade school teachers in particular. Without giving too much away, this one is more psychological than anything. Sometimes you don't need fantastical creatures to get a story across. With this priceless piece, it is best that you watch it with the lights on. Watching it in the dark may make you very paranoid, I will tell you that. In fact, when I first watched it as a kid, I had to actually watch my back before I went to bed because I never knew who was going to be walking behind me or waiting for me in my bedroom.

That is something that I really like to see in movies based on books. Misery is a good film, but it lacks a lot of things, such as the ability to be scary. Misery tries to be scary but it is just not scary at all, I don't think that I came even remotely close once during the entire film. It also lacks the ability to express Paul Sheldon as a lively character. In the book, Paul Sheldon appears to be thoughtful and lively, but in the film he mostly appears to be boring and dull.In the end, I do not think that this is Rob Reiner's best film. He has definitely directed better films than Misery like A Few Good Men, but I do think that it is okay. In my opinion, this was a very big missed opportunity for Rob Reiner. I think that he had the chance to turn Stephen King's novel Misery into a very scary movie. But that is not what he did. Misery is a good film, but unfortunately it is nothing more than that.",

            "content": "Misery is one of a few choice Stephen King novels that has been successfully turned into a film. With the brilliant and twisted way Stephen King is able to bring forth a story and the exceptional directing of Rob Reiner, Misery is able to succeed. James Caen and Kathy Bates star in the lead roles and are both perfect for their roles.Paul Sheldon is one of the most successful authors in the country and is driving his car on a windy and snowy mountain road. Next thing you know, Paul has crashed his car and is being rescued by a large woman. Paul wakes up too find himself in a large house in a rural valley. A sweet woman by the name of Annie is tending to him.Annie explains how she found him and how she treated his injuries. She tells him he can't leave due to seriousness of his injuries. Annie also explains that she is Paul's number one fan and absolutely loves his novels about Misery Chastain. Annie is sweet yet she has a darker side to her. She is bossy, she's mean, and she always wants her own way. Annie eventually asks Paul to write a story just for her about Misery Chastain. Paul is fine with that considering he is injured and can't really leave until his legs get better. Over the course of months, Paul writes for Annie. But soon Paul sees how he may never leave. When Paul's legs finally begin to get strength, Annie breaks his ankles so he won't leave. She begins to show her true side. Now Paul must use his deepest intellectual ability to find a way out of the house and out of his own misery in the house. James Caen holds the lead of Paul and is quite appealing as an author. He has that tone in his voice of being professional and likeness to him. You are easily able to see why Annie and so many others like him so much. The way he is able to think, especially with his plans to escape, are sheer genius and show how smart he really is. Kathy Bates gave the performance of her life. At the start she seems to be like a favorite aunt type character, she would be the relative you could always have a good time and laugh with. She is also one crazy lady in the film. She gets a trance in her eyes and it is some of the scariest moments I've experienced. The scene where James Caen wakes up and she is starring at him holding the sledge hammer haunted me for weeks. Both actors literally carry the movie. Other than a small performance by Richard Farnsworth, the two actors are the only two on the screen for 95% of the movie. Caen is his likable self, with a sly voice and a crafty mind. Bates is haunting in her role. She is so... so crazy, that is the only word I can describe her as. Rob Reiner has made a masterpiece of horror but not with bloody murders and monsters. No the greatest horror he makes is the horrors deep in the human mind and the closed environment of Annie's house. This movie will scare even the most veteran horror fans and send most waking with nightmares.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars",

            "content": "This is another movie that could easily excel as a stage play. The focus is on two main characters deeply involved with each other in a dialogue rich context, while depending on a foundation of a small set of supporting characters. This calls to mind a few other memorable films. There was PHONE BOOTH (2002), which you will find a review of in TOWARD A NEW CINEMA. OLEANNA (1994), also comes to mind based on an actual David Mamet stage play and, of course, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE (1981) is a different kettle of fish with a lighter heart. But few pairings can match the horrific emotional fireworks that Kathy Bates and James Caan generate in this tense, riveting Stephen King tale of fan obsession.This is James Caan's version of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975) with all the Gothic trimmings courtesy of author King. Caan displays the subtlety, self-restraint, fear, dread, and mystified terror beyond the ken of the macho code of Frank the jewel heist master in THIEF (1981), or the hotheaded ferocity of Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972). Here Caan as the author Paul Sheldon is given an acceptable opportunity to portray a masculinely dominant male of subtle strength trapped in extraordinary circumstances beyond his control. I'm sure that as director Rob Reiner was perusing and reviewing the entire body of work of the Master of Suspense, he certainly grokked that this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorite themes. But in learning from the best, Reiner develops a style and an approach to terror, horror and suspense that is wholly his own.Kathy Bates is unforgettable as Annie Wilkes, the former trained nurse, who heroically rescues her favorite writer from a bone-jarring car crash in a blizzard covered ditch. When he regains consciousness, she is there hovering over him like a grim-faced angel of doom. She gushes to him that she's his biggest fan. The following scenes bear this out with a vengeance. Kathy Bates as Annie is a chameleon of female obsession. She is at times a hardworking mother figure, a grateful, gushing little sister, a jealous and envious girl friend, a hen-pecking wife, and finally a frustrated single woman desperately doing everything she can to murder her own loneliness and the diminishing opportunity to fulfill all of the above feminine roles in a wholesome, healthy and sane manner.This is not cinema for the faint of heart. It would be hard to imagine anyone else besides the granite-jawed Caan being able to sustain the kind of physical damage Paul Sheldon undergoes and withstands in hopes of living to write another day. It is also hard to believe he turned down the role that Jack Nicholson performed to Oscar winning success in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975). But no matter how gruesome things get in this film, and as you'll discover, there is plenty of that; it is considerably toned down from what Stephen King provided for his readers to discover in his novel. It's a bleak story about a novelist roused back to consciousness and forced to stoke the fires of creative inspiration in the pit of hell at the behest of his number one fan.The ensemble that rounds out the cast is as illustrious as it gets. What with the likes of Lauren Bacall playing Marcia Sindell, his literary agent, Richard Farnsworth as Buster the local Sheriff, and Frances Sternhagen as his wife among others. It would have been so easy to go over the top with this subject matter and surrender to the temptation to present it as high camp. Just giving Misery the Pig more scenes and screen time would have accomplished this task nicely. Instead, we have a gripping believable cautionary tale about A. Conan Doyle's worst nightmare. Maybe it's less about Love, and more about bipolar disorder and post traumatic stress syndrome mixed with sadism, but when you don't have visions and fantasies of Romance to retreat into; it just might be that all you have left is misery.",

            "content": "Misery was a nice little surprise for me, since I wasn't expecting to like it very much. I've always abhorred Rob Reiner as a filmmaker, feeling that he's too flat and vanilla to bring any kind of weight to his material, but the premise and execution here are so simple that it would have been hard for him to mess it up. Thankfully he didn't and what I got was an entertaining thriller with a superb cast all around.Of course Kathy Bates is on fire with one of the most terrifying performances I've seen. I was worried at first that she was going to go over the top and become this absurd and grating display of theatrics, but I was surprised by how well she was able to balance the menacing insanity of Annie Wilkes with her eerie Marge Gunderson side. James Caan doesn't have to do much with such a strong antagonist, but he makes it easy for you to root for him and he is a constantly engaging presence. Richard Farnsworth was a surprise for me, giving such an honest and genuinely likable portrayal as the Sheriff.It's a thriller in a Hitchcock-vein, building suspense out of little moments and never relying on shock gags to frighten the audience. The intensity is built out of real feelings, and it truly does build and build over the course of the film. It becomes more frightening in locking this character in such a confined area, making the fear come more out of his inability to act than what is going on around him. You can create something as scary as you want but the most simple of monster becomes more terrifying when you aren't able to run or fight. A simple story told simply and it shouldn't have been done any other way.",

Although Kathy Bates gives a stunning(and Oscarwinning) performance in her role as Annie Wilkes, the movie lacks what made the book as terrifying and suspenseful as it was. Misery as a book was more a psychological thriller than a \"cringe as you watch the blood fly\" thriller. What I mean is is that the book really got into the mind of Paul Sheldon. It gave you a sense of the loneliness, pain, fear he felt as the story unfolded. The movie version failed to bring the psychological terror that the book had provided. This happened for two reasons. First, James Caan, who portrays Paul Sheldon, is really a second-rate actor. It is a weak performance, and it draws away from the drama of the movie. Second is that a movie format would not allow for Paul to have thought out loud, or for his thoughts to have been projected to the audience. EVERYBODY I KNOW WHO LOVES THIS MOVIE HAS NOT READ THE BOOK. If you have not seen this movie READ THE BOOK and then watch the movie. If you have seen the movie and not read the book, READ THE BOOK then watch the movie again. I'm sure you will agree with me.",

And my, oh my was it worth it!How did I come upon this classic? Well.. I discovered Kathy Bates in the TV series American Horror Story. And needless to say she is a great actress. When I heard that she was REALLY famous for this classic adaptation of Stephen King's novel, I just had to watch it. Also, I've heard references to this movie in more than one TV episode of some TV series. (I don't recall which ones, but I'm certain it was referenced in either Suits or Castle, AT LEAST once.) I faintly remember some character having a dialogue with something along the lines of: \"Man! She totally went Kathy Bates in Misery over him!\"So, naturally I added it to my watchlist. Needless to say, Kathy Bates really knocked it out of the park. She is beyond amazing and really does justice to her role. She deserved the Oscar she got for this.Now, I'm not a Stephen King fan, considering how I've read only one of his novels. But I have seen a few of his works' adaptations, either as movie or as a mini-series. And most of the times they are interesting, and worth watching, AT THE VERY LEAST.So, don't expect any less. The story is good and yes, watching it in 2016 for the first time, I can say that it has stood through the test of time.Also, a few scenes, despite meaning to be \"thrilling\", rather provided comic relief to me. I found those climactic scenes not only exciting, but also funny at times. And no, that's not ALWAYS a bad thing, as most people feel. It's a type of dark humor. So, I don't know if everybody would like it the way I did.In short, this is a worth watching flick, and it's worthy of being called a classic.I give it 7.5/10.Give it a go, you'll (most probably) not regret it.

It probably still could have been cut a bit, but I do think it mostly nailed it. Weird aesthetic vibes. Very 90s acting, which feels dated and not so much unsettling as vaguely satirical, which I do not think is the intent.

I actually liked James Caan better in this than the Godfather, and he was great in the Godfather. Kathy Bate's performance was amazing. She totally deserved that Academy Award. I mean, her performance was spectacular.Here is the plot. Quite simple, really. The famous writer of the popular Misery books, now you know why the movie is called Misery, crashes his car and he is injured. He is rescued by a woman he helps him recover. No, she does not call the police. Anyway, that woman, ironically, is the writer's biggest fan. The writer is named Paul and the woman is named Annie, by the way. Anyway, after his new book comes out Annie finds out that Misery died in the book. Paul realizes that Annie is insane. She forces Paul to write a new book. When Annie is out Paul explores the house. Annie finds that out and tortures him. He burns the new Misery book and they get into a fight. He kills Annie and is treated at a hospital. Months later a waitress says she is his number one fan.Overall, this is a very tense, thrilling film. I liked Paul's remark after the waitress says that she is his number one fan. \"That's very kind of you.\" Also, there is the hobbling scene. I am sure that every horror fan knows what that scene is. It is one of the most disturbing scenes in a horror film ever. Annie puts a block between Paul's leg and smacks his legs with a huge sledgehammer. His feet swing like a door opening. That was not even in the book. His feet are chopped off in the book. Anyway, this is a fantastic horror film.8/10Recommended Films: The Shining.",

            "review_title": "Misery (1990)",
            "content": "The horror genre has been breeding so many wannabe psychological horror flicks this last decade. Embarrassingly twist-heavy turkeys with people from various walks of life being kidnapped and tied to chairs and incapacitated in all sorts of different ways. But none of them, no matter how twisted they think they are, have been able to re-capture the creepiness, the intensity, the all-out bravura of this little house in the snow, half-character study, half-\"balls to the wall\" abduction picture. You want torture? Annie Wilkes will give it to you. But she'll also give you a killer more tormented, more human, and more sympathetic than a thousand generic dorks like Frank Zito (the killer from 1980's sickeningly overrated Maniac). And her victim, Paul Sheldon, doesn't even half to go on a nightly binge of drinking and drugging in a European whorehouse first. Instead, he authentically heads into the right place at the wrong time. And his captor isn't an inherently evil person (even though she is a Republican), who sets out with an agenda to torture him. Rather, this is one of the few \"torture\" films where I really feel the killer is sorry for the victim and their self at the same time.Also sad is the current trend to feel all horror has to be realistic. Why? Misery already captured enough realism to make all similar set ups ineffective. Is there anything more realistic than a person doing terrible things for self-righteous or religious reasons? It has a wealth of historical precedence. It's a classic. And it's relevant to today's world as well. But most importantly, it gives the story dramatic weight and makes the situations more tense and nervy. Best about that, the movie doesn't become an out-and-out drama. So many of Annie's almost weepy confessions are pathetic and funny and so creepy, it's nearly bone chilling. At one point, she casually pulls a gun we didn't know was there out of her robe pocket and talks about putting bullets into it. The music plays it as climactic, but it's incredibly funny. While quieter scenes where she lets something she should keep hidden slip out, such as where she admits \"I love you, Paul\" or when she talks about how hard her husband's passing was on her, are almost skin-crawlingly uncomfortable or awkward.Paul Sheldon is the main character and the actor playing him, James Caan (of The Godfather fame) is the star (though I'd never heard of him before this movie). But, Kathy Bates is the real star here. Apparently, she was something of a stage actress who almost never acted in movies. If a director making a horror film now were to cast an actress like her in their film, they would probably relegate her to the role of a zombie with no lines or a simpering, senile old wombat (like any older or more chubby woman is in the current Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake franchise). Even at her age at the time of Misery's filming. It takes a smart director to know what an actress like this is really capable of. And not only is Rob Reiner a smart director (or, at least he was when in the 80's and early 90's), but he actually uses Bates in full powerhouse mode. Not only was this a star-making role, but it was a move to make a fuller figured woman more important in film history. You don't see that kind of thinking or initiative taken by today's class of student-director monkeys making horror films (or any film) now. Although many of them are pleasant enough people, I'm starting to think they're a bit shallow for deciding the Jessica Biel type is always more suited to be the star than someone like Kathy Bates.James Caan as Annie's unwitting, uninterested love interest is the modestly amicable, handsome face of a gracious guest. He may have a lot of \"time and place\" backstory going on, but he's not very important. He's really just a body in a bed. And that's the way I like it. Besides, who really goes to a horror film (or thriller) to watch characters wax poetic about some great experience they had- which men often do a lot anyway. Hoping to feel more important or liked by flexing their storyteller muscles. Babbling about romanticised scenes of being somewhere cultural while sharing \"a beer\" or some vintaged (insert Classy Booze Type here) in the company of some rustic, hard-edged, but life-affirming old fart...blah blah blah. That's what makes me so often think- who cares about Him? Whoever He is, I think you'll find this is applicable to any male character in film or literature who is shown as more important or interesting because they've been everywhere or done everything (everything Classy, that is). I would hope this covers Annie's supposition that he's a man of the world type.This movie is All About Annie. Oh, and Buster, the town's easy-going \"crusty old\" sheriff and his very horny wife, Virginia. He's the other main character in a way, because he's a very normal person as well as a great problem solver. Not only does he figure out most of the Paul Sheldon mystery, but he has enough common sense to fix a towns-person's dilemma with one 15 second phone call. He and his wife are not only real salt of the Earth folk but they provide much more skilled comic relief than the cops in Wes Craven's 1972 directorial debut, The Last House on the Left. Misery is simply a masterpiece. Perfect in every single detail. The product of a lot of hard work and dedication to good film-making. Almost no one involved with the film ever returned to the horror genre again. But they crafted one of the most satisfying psychological horror films I've ever seen. Even out-Hitchcocking Hitchcock. It's got needles, a shotgun, a sledgehammer, and a killer typewriter. What else does a horror film need?",

A two sided person, with a soft and a dangerous part, left alone with a writer, who happens to be the favorite writer of the person. And things happen and things change and it gets all messy and stuff. So there we have a man who is incapable of moving and a woman who is a little bit mentally unbalanced.

It's at the limit of tolerabilty, so I wouldn't wonder if some people had the exact opposite opinion than me.

            "content": "Rob Reiner is one of my favorite directors, and Misery is one of his finest works. I also saw it the day before Halloween, which added to the experience.Misery follows an author named Paul who is severely injured in a car crash during a snowstorm. A nurse takes him in, and claims to be his biggest fan. She seems sweet, especially with her cross necklace, but things are not always as they seem. Not many horror movies scare me, in fact I have no \"scariest movie I have ever seen.\" (The closest I can say is Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom, which is more disgusting than \"scary.\" )Misery does succeed at scares, though. There's a \"hobbling\" scene, where a man's heels are chopped off. (My Godfather told me that he used to rewind that part over and over.)Many scenes with Annie Wilkes are creepy in fact. You never know what she will do. As a Christian, I was a little bothered that the woman was committing these acts with a cross necklace around her neck-but I just reminded myself that it's just a movie. Gene Siskel said he admired that as irony. I agree, it's just a use of irony.There are many gripping scenes-like the dinner scene. I was upset with how that resulted. I'll let you see the clip for yourself. That's not a complaint, though, it was actually very clever for Reiner to NOT give me what I wanted. Another great scene is when Paul fights Annie. That is also another scary scene that succeeds.I should also note that I can recall all of this, and I saw it 23 months ago! That shows how great it is- I can remember a lot of it, even after under 2 years!Misery is a great horror movie that you should see. Misery really does love company, and you should definitely be a part of it.",

I didn't really thought it was possible to make a movie out of the novel, but what do you know, here comes Rob Reiner out of all people with fabolus James Caan and holy Kathy Bates. This movie is very frightening, and it is almost as **scary** as the ultimate Stephen King-movie (and one of the best horrormovies) THE SHINING, but not as great. It is also pretty creepy in a way, since Reiner did MISERY only a year after the fantastic romantic comedy WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... It makes your stomach turn a bit. Now, the big problem with this movie was what I suspected. Length. To make a movie about an invalid author lying in a bed, it can't stretch out to 107 min. Not even in a Kubrick-2001-way. But the savior is Bates. Her performance is one of the strongest and best I've ever seen. It lies very high up in the psycho-list, among Peter Lorre's and Anthony Perkin's performances in M and PSYCHO. Stephen King's novel-based movies should all be banned with the exception of THE SHINING and MISERY.",

            "content": "Misery! Probably my favourite story by Stephen King. I actually read the book first before seeing the movie. From memory, the movie follows the book pretty closely, there is only one part that really sticks out in my mind as being different, but with the results I can't complain. So, what's is all about?A famous author has just finished the final transcript of a book series when he is in a car accident. While unconscious, a mysterious yet strong figure takes him home in an attempt to make him better. But doesn't he need to go to the hospital? Nah, this mystery figure, who turns out to be Annie Wilkes (played brilliantly by Kathy Bates) is his number one fan! She'll keep him there as long as she wants. And he'll do what she says, or she'll hurt him...badly.The good! Follows the book damn closely. It's been a long time since I've read the book, so I might be wrong on a few things, but for the most part, I envisioned everything pretty closely, the only exceptions being I assumed the author would be a bit younger (I blame the book cover for that) and one scene which I'll discuss now. * Everyone has heard of the 'hobbling' scene, though I won't discuss it too specifically on the off chance that you haven't. This scene was a hell of a lot more gruesome in the books. At first I was disappointed that the movie didn't deliver here, but you know what, I LOVE this scene in the movie. Everything from the slow build up, to moonlight sonata, to the camera lingering just a second after the first blow. Sure it could have been more gruesome, but you know what, I thought it was damn near perfect in the movie. * Kathy Bates. Nuff said. * Great acting, lovely scenery, great story etc etc you get the point.The Bad! ...... um.... will have to get back to you on that! So, in conclusion, if you haven't seen this awesome movie, please check it out, you won't be disappointed. And if you haven't read the book, give it a read, it's brilliant! Thankyou.8/10",

And there's excellent juxtaposition from the suspense to the comedic relief. And you totally believe at when Annie goes from sweet caretaker to psychopath.The performances from Kathy Bates and James Connor both fantastic. Bates embodied the character of Annie Wilkes. She deserved that Oscar.The scenes that are meant to be disturbing hold up.The cinematography is fantastic and adds to the tension of the film.It is directed masterfully. Rob Reiner watched all of Hitchcock's movies in preparation for this and it definitely shows. The multiple opening close-up shots acre suspense-filled.Richard Farnsworth, may he Rest In Peace, was also great and the dynamic that his character had with his wife was very enjoyable.The music is used appropriately and also does a great job at creating tension.You don't feel the runtime at all.There is also some really clever foreshadowing and reincorporation:The urine bottle being waved around=The lighter fluid can bring waved around.The opening shot of the cigarette and match=Lighting the draft on fire.The pig coming through the door=The metal pig doorstop.The only real complaints I have is that the makeup effects for Paul's legs show their age, at least in one shot they do. And the shot where Buster is in the helicopter, they are so obviously in a room and not in a real helicopter. I'm not saying they should've been in a real helicopter but it was so incredibly obvious that it was staged and it was really distracting.",

Outstanding acting by Kathy Bates and James Caan. Shows you in an over exaggerated way how obsessed some fans are, and that is how some people are in real life, they sometimes forget about their own lives.\"Misery\" does not go over the top and horror is, you could say mild, but it succeeds to build tension and suspense, since Paul is in such a desperate and by the looks of it, inescapable scenario. This movie sort of over achieves itself, the plot is nothing special, the characters are kind of one-sided, but, in my opinion, Kathy Bates's performance is what really shines here, making this seemingly simple film a true masterpiece.People say it is the greatest movie adaptation of a Stephen King book, which personally i have not read, but that seems to be the case. Bizarre set of coincidences, followed by Paul Sheldon's suspenseful fight to stay alive in the miserable situation he was in. A decent thriller overall, going to be worth your while.",

It's been a while since I seen this movie and I've got to say that I didn't love it as much as I remember I did. I mean, it's a great claustrophobic thriller with some great performances. It just didn't have the same feel it did when I first watched it years ago.\nThe plot revolves around a famous writer, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), who gets into a car wreck and is saved and seems to be nursed back to health by a woman, Annie (Kathy Bates) who claims to be his number one fan. After ready a copy of his latest release in his famous 'Misery' book series, and finding out her favorite character was killed, Annie makes Paul write another story to bring her favorite character back to life, while also making his life a living hell.\nEverybody talks about Kathy Bates's performance in this movie, and while it is a scary and good take on Annie Wilkes, James Caan is break takingly good as the writer Paul Sheldon. In every helpless scene he is in where he is trying to escape or showing us how much pain, he is in when going in and out of his wheelchair. I was seriously in awe watching him work this character into his own creation.\nI love the camera work in this movie. I expected to because it is a Rob Reiner film, but he is so good behind a camera. He uses long and wide shots for extremely simple scenes. By that I mean it could just a be man sitting in the library looking up information and the angle he uses is so beautifully shot. Where the movie lacks is in its scare department. This is supposed to be a horror movie after all or at least a thriller, but where I see it, it's just a drama movie that has intense scenes. That's not to say the movie is bad or anything, just if your going to serve me a slice of lemon pie, make sure I taste the lemon.\nOverall, this movie shows that Stephen King is more than just a weird horror author that only writes about creepy monsters or supernatural elements. It still has a feel on a movie he would produce, but with a certain zest added to it.\n3.5/5",

Bates is perfect as Annie, a woman who is in love with the Misery character that her favourite author created, so much so that she willing to prevent any harm on this fictional character by putting the author in agonising pain to make ends meet for Misery.The best thing about Bates is that even though her character is One dimensional, you never know what she going to next. Because of this, some parts are truly frighting. When she loses her temper, you pray for the life of Paul Sheldon. Some parts you find her funny, not because she tries to be but because she so loony you can;t help but think she belongs in a loony bin. As the film progresses you will tend to hate her more and more James caan is also great as Paul Sheldon. You don't know a lot about him but you warm to the character very quickly. His facial expressions at times a faultless. Another mention goes to Richard Farnsworth who has to be one of the most likable sheriffs ever.With a great director and two strong actors, this film ends up being a successful thriller in which at times is unbearable to watch.

I was right. James Caan is wooden and completely unbelievable as Sheldon; i never believed he was in that much pain in any of his scenes. Yeah, Bates is good as Annie Wilkes, but i couldn't help feeling that she was too young for the part, and did not go far enough in portraying just how psychotic this character really was in the novel. Watchable, but you'll probably be disappointed if you've read the novel.",

This is, in my opinion, the second best of Steven King's book book to movies, the first being 'Stand By Me', and the third being the Shining.\nKathy Bates won a well deserved oscar for Misery, and she has proved that she can play many different rolls. The hobbling scene is painful to watch, and James Caan made it very clear of the pain he was in. The two did a great job in this movie. This is a scary movie in many different ways, the suspense of Paul racing back to his room before Annie gets back and making sure everything is exactly the way it was, or when Annie would suddenly become enraged and do rash things to Paul. This is a great movie if your looking for a good chill, because this movie has many of them. A great book to movie adaption, and a very scary movie. 9/10",

But, when she reads his new book in which her favorite character dies, he would be lucky to get out, alive.Kathy Bates really shines in this movie, arguably the best performance of her career; her mood swings are genuinely freighting.

Kathy Bathes played her part with brilliant malevolence, she really scared me! She scares the viewers with her fake tenderness! In this movie she was lovable, but at the same time you can only hate her for all the bad things she did to the writer played by James Caan, who should have been more dramatic to make this movie more intense! He should have cried asking Annie for mercy, that'd have been amazing, but this movie is outstanding anyway, when you expect that something good will happen, it never happens. For instance the scene where the writer tried to kill Annie by putting poison in her wine, but she accidentally dropped the glass was intense. It makes you feel somewhat sad that he couldn't get rid of her! Another chilling scene was when the chief tried to rescue him from the evil Annie, but Annie shot him in his back while standing right behind him! Those scenes were really gripping!The whole movie was outstanding, but there were some disturbing scenes like Annie breaking the writer's ankles with a hammer, that was also stressful and unfair, it shows how insane a person might be! I thought the ending was unexpected, but I must stress my surprise after realizing that many reviewers said it wasn't! It was unexpected because I never thought that the writer would be so smart to burn Annie's misery (The book)! That was truly amazing!, but the ending was somewhat unfair because he ended up as a lame and scared person! Overall this movie is dark, dramatic, thrilling, riveting, This is one of the best thriller I've seen! That's why i rate it an 8 out of a 10!",

She perfectly manages to capture the manipulation of her character, and performs both the calmer and crazier moments perfectly. I think the pacing is my favourite element - despite it taking a while for Annie to go full psycho, the pacing is still pitch-perfect, allowing for a lot of time to buildup to the climax. I also really appreciated the Hitchcock references - obviously you have the main character unable to move a la Rear Window, but I also thought the storyline with the Police Officer was very similar to that of Arbogast in Psycho which I really liked. The use of tension is just phenomenal and the eerie atmosphere is captured with near perfection. I also really liked the direction - despite not having the best directorial flair or style, Rob Reiner proved himself as one of the most consistently great directors of the 80's and 90's, and this might just be my favourite of his films. It manages to blend elements of mystery, horror and comedy in one fantastic experience. The only issue I have is with the police officer and the fact we got no payoff with his storyline. Other than that, this is a truly fantastic thriller. You could call it 'basic' but I think that's what makes it so effective, and I would definitely recommend it.",

When it was playing in theaters, I was about 14, and I managed to see it at least three times. Rob Reiner's direction is competent. James Caan's acting is surprisingly subdued. Even Richard Farnsworth, Lauren Bacall and Frances Sternhagen create sympathy for their barely shown characters.But, my God, Kathy Bates is brilliant, playing Annie as someone quirky, scary and even funny. William Goldman's script, which originally called for Annie to use a welding torch to remove Paul Sheldon's feet, does allow her the chance to go over the top, of course, but Bates' subtlety at key points in the film is what floors me. The little touches showing Annie watching \"Love Connection\" or dancing around to Liberace records. Through these scenes, Bates actually builds sympathy for Annie's character, her loneliness, her \"morality\" and her need to love a fictional character.\nAs a viewer, I cared deeply for her, even after she went nuts, tied a man to a bed, took a sledgehammer to his legs, held him captive, let everyone around believe he was dead and then tried to shoot him to death.Kathy Bates has been uniformly great in films ever since this one, but this one is my favorite of hers.

            "content": "Stephen King has written many novels that have made it as feature film productions. Granted some of them are bad, but for every bad one we get a good one. Look at The Shawshank Redemption or The Shining, both brilliant. Misery will have a bad Stephen King adaptation out there because it is one of the good ones, and probably one of the most frightening.Misery is about an author named Paul Sheldon (Caan). He is famous for his books about the lead heroine Misery Chastain. The only thing is he is bored of her and wants to write more darker and deeper stories. The Misery novel just about to be released, will be his last. He has made sure of this by killing her off at the end of the book. Determined to upgrade his writing credentials, he works on and finishes a new novel up in a secluded cabin where he writes all his novels. On his way to taking the finished novel to his agent he crashes during a freak blizzard. As he lays dying he is rescued by a random woman who happens to find him in the middle of nowhere. When Paul wakes a few days later he finds himself in a strange house with his arm in a sling and his legs boarded together. He then meets his rescuer, Annie Wilkes (Bates), 'his number one fan'. Annie is a former nurse and begins to nurse him back to health, even giving him criticism on his new book which hasn't been read by anyone but her. She deems his new book as garbage and tells him to stick to his Misery novels. The following day the new Misery novel is released and Annie heads out to buy and read, although when she finishes it and realises her favourite heroine is dead she loses control, blaming Paul for her murder. With Paul unable to walk, he finds himself forced to write the next novel, bringing Misery back to life with the threat of his life if he doesn't. Paul must find a way of getting himself out of this house before Annie's temper becomes worse and worse. The premise is very simple but it works so well. It does start off quite slow, with Annie's mental state slowly being revealed. It is really the last half an hour where the film really grips you and becomes horrifying. One scene towards the end had me clutching my fists together in pain and one had me yelping out loud. It brings a strange horror to the screen as there are no aliens or monsters, just this woman obsessed. Any of us could be this woman's victim and it is scary.The acting in the film is brilliant. Caan spends most of his time bed ridden or in a wheel chair but still manages to show pain and fear through his eyes. You will be clutching your legs throughout this film, he is someone you highly sympathise with. Strangely you do with Annie Wilkes, at the start that is. Kathy Bates manages to bring a calmness to the character at the beginning and you genuinely feel she is there to help. Slowly though she begins to turn and Bates manages to show Annie's psychotic behaviour spot on and all sympathy is quickly removed from her. At first she is a disillusioned fan but becomes a psychotic monster. She really is two characters in one, and when she is angry she really is scary. She may seem like someone we all believe we can beat in strength but she is more clever than us and has already beat us to that thought. You will see what I mean at the one scene that had me squirming. I really can't get that part out my mind. There isn't many negatives in the film. Perhaps the first hour is a little slow, but it is all worth it when the final half kicks in. The beginning shows you her layers slowly unravel and the crazier she begins to become. Bates plays the character with such believability.It is a very good film and will have you on edge throughout. The tension is filmed brilliantly. I don't think it is the best film to have been made from a Stephen King book, The Shawshank Redemption gets my vote there, but it is definitely one of the better ones.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I never had a clue how great an actress Kathy Bates was until I saw \"Misery\".  She can play anything.  She can switch moods in the blink of an eye and make it look believable.  As for James Caan, well I already knew he was a great actor even before I saw \"Misery\" and I was very surprised to see he didn't get a nomination for his role in \"Misery\".  The Stephen King adaptation is excellent as well.  I think it's the best I've seen after \"The Shawshank redemption\".  However, Rob Reiner has done some much greater jobs as a director than for \"Misery\".  \"A few good men\", for example, shows how much directing talent he has.  But he didn't use it all that much in \"Misery\".  Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a novelist who has invented a character named Misery Chastain and uses her name in each title of the \"Misery\" books.  Each time he finishes a novel, he goes up to a little lodge far from the city and once the novel is completed, he has one glass of champaign and one cigarette.  After having finished his latest novel, he starts to head back to the city.  However, a big snow storm starts and Paul has a terrible accident.  He wakes up in a house and the first thing he hears is \"I am your #1 fan\".  He comes to realize he is in the house of a woman named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) and who is a nurse.  It seems Annie has taken great care of him and has put bandages all over his body so that he can heal properly.  She tells him that as soon as the roads are clear, she will take to a hospital.  A few days go by and Annie and Paul have become friends.  One day, Annie asks Paul if she might be allowed to read the last Misery novel Paul has written before he sends it to his editor.  Paul lets her and she is very happy.  The next day, as she is giving Paul his soup, she tells him she has read forty pages of the story.  Paul asks her what she thinks of it.  She tells him she is no person to give him a critic but insists on the fact that she gives him the critic.  She tells him there is way too much cursing. Paul tries to tell her that the cursing comes from slump kids and that he was a slump kid and that is the way they talk.  Suddenly, she starts yelling at him telling him that they do not talk like that.  After a few seconds, she apologizes and leaves the room.  But the same night, Paul gets a rather nasty surprise.  Kathy Bates deserved the Oscar she won and James Caan deserved at least a nomination.  As for Rob Reiner's directing, well it is very disappointing considering the great movies he had done.  His directing truly gives the viewer the impression that this is not a theatre movie but a TV movie.  But the movie is worth seeing simply for the performances.  Richard Farnsworth does a great job as the local town sheriff in a supporting role and Lauren Bacall has a cameo role as Caan's editor and she is very good also.  It's worth watching.",

This is a psychological chess match of an encounter that's a thrilling, cinematic journey that might get you rubbing your legs afterwards or just plain ashen at the sight of a snow storm on the rise for reasons other than nature at its fiercest.The film has a certain building flow that escalates as it progresses. Annie Wilkes, Kathy Bates' character, starts out as an eager care taker and a bashful fan of the writer's work but as time creeps on she reveals a Jekyll and Hyde persona with one side being a polite small towner and the other a troubled women with a few skeletons in her closet. Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, keeps his wits and emotions in check with a sense of dark humor despite the impossible situation he's found himself in. It's imperative that he plays along to her demanding personality as with the extent of his injuries he can't prepare his own food, never mind emptying the bladder. Though even when the weakest animal gets pushed or cornered: Watch out.\"Misery\" carries distinctive traits of a Stephen King story as it starts as small as a seed, concentrates on character development and keeps you in the moment instead of worrying about technical jargon. Kathy Bates seems like she was made for the role of Annie Wilkes with her good-natured appearance and aura, but then what clenches it is there's just something you can't put your finger on, as if she's too welcoming. She's capable of pulling off both the pleasant and insane sides as if they were one and the same. This is a tale of circumstance: if two strong personalities intersect and how they ultimately interact with one another. When they first meet they have something in common on the surface, though as some find out personal information about the author or celebrity they so admire or that friendly neighbor or employee who appears normal on the outside, nothing could be farther than the truth. It's easier to fill in the blanks in our minds about others without really getting to know them...or their darkest secrets. (Also submitted on http://fromblacktoredfilmreviews.blogspot.com/)",

After not having seen the film in a while, last week my girlfriend and I, pulled it out and watched it on a rainy, stormy night.Misery is an excellent film, based on King's novel. Since watching the film again, I went to my bookshelf, and reread the novel in three nights. I'll tell you one thing. I'll take the movie Annie over the novel Annie, if I was in that situation. If you haven't read the novel, I suggest you do. In the movie, there are times when Annie Wilkes is quite likable. But not so in the novel.The movie is a great suspense film, greatly acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan. You can actually put yourself in Paul Sheldon's shoes, and picture it being you. At times you want to yell at the screen and say, \"Paul, don't say that. You're gonna make her mad.\" This poor man, totally disabled and at the mercy of the insane Annie. I read that James Caan said this was one of his toughest roles to play, because he was in bed or a wheelchair through the whole film. He went stir crazy. That probably helped him with his performance.These are some of the things that were not shown, and toned down in the film. The film never shows that Annie got Paul addicted to pain killers. She made him drink dirty dishwater to swallow his pills. In the film, the hobbling scene is quite horrid. But in the novel, he not only loses his foot with an axe, but other things as well. I won't ruin it. There are other things not depicted in the film, like Annie leaving Paul for fifty hours, forcing him to drink his own urine. Like I said, I'd take the Annie from the film over the novel Annie, without a doubt.The movie stays suspenseful because you feel so bad for this man. He's helpless. The only person keeping him alive, is a sick, twisted, f***, to use Paul's words. Annie Wilkes reminds me of a kid that likes to light kittens on fire, or tear the wings off butterflies. But always telling Paul she loves him, and it's for his own good.When I saw the film in the theater in 1990, the audience cheered for Paul at the end. My girlfriend and I cheered once again last week. \"You remember how nobody ever knew who Misery's father was, and if they'd ever be reunited?\" \"Paul, you can't.\" \"Why not, I learned it from you.\" CLASSIC SCENE.Well, I guess this isn't a review. Just ramblings on my thoughts of this great film. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you haven't seen it in a while, curl up on a creepy night, and watch it again. And if you really want to get scared, read the novel....Sincerely, Vincent \"What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. And what do I get? You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie. Well you better start showing me a little more respect around here, MISTER MAN.\"",

She is his self-proclaimed number one fan, which he laughs off at first but soon discovers to be eerily true. As she nurses him back to health in her snowbound house, she discovers that the next book in her beloved Misery series (which he writes) is the last. The pure greatness of this film comes from her shift from caring adoring fan to psychotic captor. Kathy Bates won an extremely deserved Academy award for her role. I mean she's just REALLY CREEPY. But there's a sincerity there that made the character semi-identifiable, as opposed to out-and-out psycho. \"You can't possibly understand how scared someone like me is of losing someone like you.\" James Caan, the trapped author, also does a good job with his role, and though sitting on his ass is his main job, you really felt his pain and torture (both literally and figuratively) in his hellish prison. The ingenuity of his attempted escapes was also pretty cool, though we all assume MacGyver would have been out of there the first night. There was a good bit of comic relief sprinkled in too. As Rob Reiner he is not a horror director, the feel to this movie is focused on the story and the characters, not constantly building up tension with dark and scary camera angles. All together, it's a very well written, very well acted and very well directed movie that is incredibly enjoyable and definitely worth seeing.",

It's the readers that the writer is worried about. This novel/movie plays on that fear. Paul Sheldon, the main character, decides to write another novel that's very different from what he's written (The \"Misery\" series, I assume it's a romance series oddly enough). So he writes the last \"Misery\" novel (honestly, that's the worst name to give to a woman) and kills the main character off. The crap hits the fan when he's rescued by a stalker-like woman who LOVES (literally) him from a car crash in Colorado. If you're a writer, read the novel first then see the movie.

            "review_title": "A structural breakdown of Misery",
            "content": "The horror thriller is one of Hollywood's most popular story combinations. But to do it well, the writer must explore deep into the minds of both the hero and the opponent. They are doubles of one another. The opponent's attack is the hero's weakness confronting him.In Misery, we get a slick, Hollywood story that hits the right beats on the surface, but never approaches its potential. To see why this is so, let's break this story down structurally, starting at the endpoint.Self-Revelation: The hero's self-revelation, the structural endpoint of any story, is not present in this picture. Our hero, Paul, is still haunted by fears of his torturer, Annie, implying that he will never be free of her.While this sort of ending is not uncommon in horror stories, it misses tremendous possibilities. The true point of this struggle should have been to give Paul, and the audience, some insight into how he too is a kind of violent torturer of those who read his books. Without that, Paul's experience is just an unfortunate couple of months as a victim to a psychopath.Need: Unfortunately, there is no need established for the hero at the beginning of this script.Paul thinks he needs to rid himself of the Misery novels and write a serious piece of fiction. But this need has nothing to do with what actually happens in the story.Paul's need should have been to realize his own responsibility to his readers. That would have made him an active hero capable of learning something from an ordeal he himself has caused. Instead, Paul is nothing more than a victim of a crazed attack.Desire: Paul's main desire in the story - what drives the action - is his effort to escape his slavery at the hands of Annie. This desire is clear and intense. But since our hero is bedridden, this desire, by itself, isn't sufficient to sustain audience interest for two hours. So the writers give the ally - the town sheriff - the more active desire of finding out what happened to Paul.Opponent: In horror stories the opponent is the personification of the hero's own greatest fear and weakness. Most horror stories have a machine opponent, such as the slasher who kills and kills again.At least in Misery the opponent is human. But just barely. We learn that the Misery books saved Annie from the despair of losing her husband. But we don't know what they provide for her other than escapism. By the time we find out she was arrested for infant deaths, we have written her off as a nut.This is a great loss. Because once the human element of the opposition has been removed, the story is nothing more than a fight to the death between a man and a monster.This story could have been improved immeasurably had Annie shown us, not only her weakness, but Paul's. What is his responsibility to his female readership? Is he abusing them by writing the Misery books? Is he abusing them by not writing them? Paul is presented as a good writer confronted by a Philistine. And in fact, the film is most interesting when seen as a microcosm of the censorship battle between artists and conservatives. But the presentation is so one-sided that the audience never sees the subtle violence that a writer can commit with his words and ideas, especially against those least able to tell the difference between lies and truth.To finish reading this review, and to find others, please visit http://www.truby.com/im_misery.html",

James Caan did very well also, for what he had to work with.Overall I don't think this is a bad movie at all... but I think most reviews on here giving this movie 8-10 star ratings are from people who haven't read the book... I will admit I didn't enjoy this movie that much for that reason alone. There are also many differences between the two, and I can't knock the movie too much for it considering I understand some of the challenges they faced in adapting it to the big screen.One brief thing I wanted to mention, is I didn't like the soundtrack to this movie. I feel like a soundtrack can sometimes make or break a movie. While it doesn't go either way in this case, it closely leans towards the \"break\" side for me. The soundtrack is just too intrusive and hasn't aged well.In summary this movie was okay and I can see why it's a cult classic. Had I watched this years ago before I ever read the book I probably would have liked it much, much more than I do now. As it is, I give this movie 5 / 10 stars. Not bad, but do yourself a favor and pick up the book. To simply say it's better is a wild understatement.",

            "content": "Kathy Bates was completely deserving of her Academy Award. She ( and Caan) shine in this movie. I was in awe that she could change her emotions so quickly: happy one minute, murderous the next. An example is when she tells Paul (after reading that Misery is dead) that no one knows he is with her & no one will come for him; she is purely evil. And then the next scene, she is purely loving! Like Paul said \"Crazy bitch.\" She claims to \"love\" him, yet smashes his ankles so he cannot leave her. Crazy bitch indeed! This is a must-see for true movie fans. Bates' Oscar-winning performance is high caliber, Caan is completely believable as the injured Paul Sheldon, & Richard Farnsworth shines as the wise-cracking sheriff, Buster. I really wanted to see more of him in this film. And kudos to the special appearance of Misery, the pig. Although in only one scene, she is a complete ham! So if you are in the mood for a psychological thriller, give this a try. Bates' performance is completely worth it.",

            "content": "I have long held the belief that most, if not all, of Stephen King's stories start out in his mind as 'what if' scenarios, we all have them, but King takes things to the most extreme conclusions possible and scares the daylights out of us in so doing. With 'Misery', he has given us a story so close to autobiographical horror that you could be forgiven for being duped into thinking it actually happened to him.Paul Sheldon is a talented writer who has been bashing out trashy pulp romances which take place in the early 1900's involving a woman named Misery Chastain. They are wildly successful novels which amass him a fortune, facilitate sending his daughter to the best schools and all the other luxuries that a writer of such success enjoys. But he feels as though he has sold out, he has a burning urge to publish his 'real' book and to be taken more seriously, and in this adaptation of King's novel, we are introduced to him as he finishes his opus while holed up in a remote cabin in Colorado. He then attempts to navigate his car through a blizzard and ends up skidding off the road and landing on a snowy bank, upside down. A figure appears and carries him out of the snowed in vehicle. This figure, we soon learn, is Annie Wilkes, and she is his self-proclaimed 'number one fan'. She also happens to be a nurse, and begins the long process of treating his injuries and nursing him back to health in her home. She tells him she has called a doctor and been given what seems fairly reasonable advice about keeping him there until the weather clears if she is able to take care of him herself. I assure you that sharing these plot details gives nothing away, they are merely set-up for the very dark path the story goes down.It turns out that Annie is not entirely of sound mind, and that is almost certainly an understatement. She comes home one day with the latest of his 'Misery' novels and when she discovers that he has killed her off, well, let's just say she is not a little annoyed! I can give no more of the plot away, save to say that this is a thriller of the highest order, and the way Annie's psychosis reveals is performed by Kathy Bates with such masterful skill that she quite literally disappears into the role.Rob Reiner, whose credits include 'The Princess Bride', 'This is Spinal Tap' and King's own 'Stand by Me', at first seems a strange director to helm a horror adaptation, but I rush to assure you he has crafted an incredibly effective thriller. He seems quite at home creating scenes of almost unbearable suspense, but this is not solely to his credit. The casting here is sublime. I have never seen anything Kathy Bates has appeared in, and I believe my lack of knowledge of her work only enhanced my complete belief in her characters state of mind. Other viewers may not be so lucky. There are playful scenes at the beginning of the film which hint that she may not be the full ticket, but then, quite suddenly, we are in no doubt: This woman is completely unhinged. Although some who have read the novel may feel that some of the more horrifying things she does to Sheldon have been watered down a bit, I thought the changes worked here. James Caan, who Reiner coaxed out of retirement and has spent virtually his entire career playing tough, virile and energetic characters, spends almost the entire running time of this film in bed. The dichotomy of having such a physical actor playing a helpless victim is absolutely inspired, and he carries his weight right along with Bates. The cat and mouse chemistry between these two is nothing short of fantastic. These are performers at the top of their game. The supporting cast is rounded out by fine actors too. Richard Farnsworth and the criminally underused Frances Sternhagen play the aging local sheriff and his plucky wife, and we are treated to Lauren Bacall as Sheldon's agent, who is dignity itself.A thrilling story by Stephen King, adapted screenplay by William Goldman, direction by Rob Reiner, performers of the highest standard, and a massively effective score all add up to one of the most suspenseful and effective horror-thrillers of recent years.

Her mood swings from hysterically happy to rage to depression are excellently acted.  Her performance literally gave me chills. I think one of my favorite lines of hers was when she returned home after attacking Paul and leaving a rage and said quite matter-of- factly something like \"you know, I've given it some thought and I'm convinced that the reason I was never more popular was my temper.\"  Gee, do you think so?????",

I don't really call this a horror movie because it's not scary but it's more like a thriller, there's drama. It was directed by Rob Reiner, who had also directed A Few Good Men (1992), Shock and Awe (2017), The Princess Bride (1987) and the screenplay was written by an author William Goldman, who had written novels like The Princess Bride in 1973, which was transferred into a movie in 1987 also directed by Rob Reiner, Which Lie Did I Tell?, ... It's about a psychotic fan who holds an author captive and forces him to write her stories.\nThere was James Caan as the author, Paul Sheldon, who wrote romance novels about a character called Misery Chastain, when he had an accident, he was carried to someone else's house. It was revealed that the house belonged to his number 1 fan, Annie Wilkes played by Kathy Bates, who won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1991. She acted exactly how the number 1 fan in this film should be like: psychotic, crazy, insane and sometimes can be like an a-hole. I hate her but she's well-acted and well-developed thanks to Bates. Caan did a well job too. I was just disappointed that he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor in 1991.\nBarry Sonnenfeld was really good with the cinematography. It was kinda old-school and also suitable for a 90s thriller. I also like the story though I haven't read the book yet. I was really surprised when Sheldon read the red book filled with newspapers and found out that Wilkes was a nurse murderer and killed many patients and the only jump scare I saw was when Buster, the local sheriff was shot by Wilkes with the rifle when he found out that Paul Sheldon was locked in a room or a cellar maybe? And also it's just a story, why did Wilkes had to scream so bad about a character's death? That's just annoying! The original score was okay though, Marc Shaiman was okay as well. I didn't care about the score much in this film because I didn't hear the music much, I just care about the screenplay and Goldman wrote it excellently. I like it even though I saw a few sentences were a bit too easy.\nMisery isn't really a horror movie, it's just a drama and thriller which had blood in there. There wasn't much scare but it was a really good movie. Stephen King wrote the plot really well, Reiner directed excellently, the score was played okay, the cinematography was also well-shot by Sonnenfeld and more... Caan and Bates were perfect for these roles making this movie one of the greatest Stephen King's adaptation.My Ratings: 9.15/10",

There was no background to Annie Wilkes, apart from the scrapbook detailing her previous crimes, nothing to show how she became what she was. Why does a baby-killing nurse become an obsessive fan of a pulp novelist? Why was she released into the community when she was so seriously disturbed? I know psychopaths are clever but Annie's verbal tics ('oogy', 'dirty-birdy') are a giveaway, not to mention her sensitivity to the weather and direct line to the Almighty.Not only is there no 'case-history' but at the climax Annie changes from cunning mad-woman to that cliche of horror, the stalking unkillable killer.I can't help feeling Sheldon gets what he deserves. After churning out Misery Chastaine novels with increasing self-disgust he is faced with his 'public' - a semi-educated, lonely woman with a human need for romance and companionship that has been warped into obsessive love.I admit it - I felt truly sorry for Annie. When Sheldon rams the burning manuscript in her mouth telling her to choke, the whole thing seemed unfair: this woman was ill, not a monster. Well, OK, she was trying to kill him at the time.The film also lost what I felt was the grandest irony in the book: the novel Annie forces Sheldon to write (Misery's Return) turns out to be the finest of the series.",

The direction was awesome and the storytelling was great as basically about 3/4 of the movie took place in a bedroom of a house... a snooze right? Wrong, nothing about this is movie is boring. Basically the story is easy to understand to the viewer; Paul Sheldon (Cann) is a famous novelist and he has made a career out of writing a bunch of books from a character named 'Misery.' He goes up to a house in the mountains to finish his final book of the Misery series and after he finishes, he heads back home. He leaves without knowing that there is a snow storm coming and while driving he gets into an accident. Afterwards, A 'fan' of his, Annie Wilkes (Bates) saves him from the crash and takes him to her house to recover. As he recovers from his wounds, Sheldon starts to realize that Wilkes isn't just a fan, but she is a crazed sociopath that is planning to keep him at her home forever. Sheldon must figure out a way to escape. Thats basically it. Bates really shines here as the super crazy fan, Wilkes. She can go from gentle, caring and loving to vicious and psychotic in a heartbeat. She kind of reminds me of Mommy Dearest but multiplied in the crazy department. Stephen King still knows how to terrify you, people that have seen the movie, all you have to say is \"Hobbling\" and a cold chill goes down your back. What an excruciating scene of pain and torture. An instant horror/thriller classic, I gave it a 8 because I think that it could have been better in a few small spots, but it is incredibly entertaining and horrifying all together",

Thanks.A great actor can take difficult dialog and make it seem completely natural. In \"Misery\", Kathy Bates doesn't use foul language; she substitutes odd little sing-song phrases, like \"you....dirty bird!\". The result is chilling. You realize this character is not quite mentally stable.Because the James Caan character is bed ridden in much of the movie, he is at a huge physical and psychological disadvantage. Being unable to escape is one of the most effective means of conveying true terror. Having a means of escape is like opening a valve on a pressure cooker. In \"Misery\", there is practically no possibility to flee, so the tension keeps building.This movie has not aged a day since it was made. It will take its place among the classics of cinema.",

            "content": "Excellent, fun, thrilling, and scary as hell thriller based on the novel by Stephen King, this movie is about a novelist named Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan), who is finishing up another book in his famous \"Misery\" series based on that character. Paul is at a small motel and gets ready to head up to New York to see his literary agent (played by screen legend Lauren Bacall), but shortly after he leaves the motel, he runs into a blizzard and loses control of his vehicle due to the storm and is in a near fatal crash. Sometime later, he is found and rescued by Annie Wilkes (his \"#1 fan\") (played by Bates), and she takes him to her house and nurses him back to health. But, sometime later, things get really nasty when Annie reads about Misery being killed off at the end of his latest book. From then on, Paul is being held prisoner in Annie's home, and he's writing to keep himself alive, while taking a lot of undeserved physical torment from her as well. One scene that I found the most disturbing was when Annie smashed Paul's feet against the wood log (hobbling, as she said while telling him about what happened to the workers of the Kimberly Diamond mines. Ouch!! That would make me scream to high heaven!!) I am a huge fan of Kathy Bates and I truly believe that she deserved her Oscar for her role in this movie. Her character, Annie Wilkes, is funny (in some instances, depending on how you see her), but most other instances, she is a really crazy and psycho b****, who has an obsession of Paul way beyond a general one. Poor Paul, having to deal with Annie and her sadistic behavior. I love the showdown scene toward the end where Annie and Paul are fighting in the bedroom, and she finally falls and hits her head on the typewriter. Paul then thinks the fight is over, but a few seconds later, she's at him again and he knocks her out with an \"iron pig\". Then she is surely gone, the abuse over and done with. Eighteen months later, Paul is up in New York meeting with his agent, discussing a book he had just published. He then starts to talk about his experience with Annie, and his agent asks him if he wants to write a non-fiction book about what went on in the home. It's not known, of course, if he had wanted to write such a story, but if so, there must have been quite a lot to say.

            "content": "I would rate this and \"The Green Mile\" as the two best King film adaptations ever made. In this case, our screenwriter is the great William Goldman (\"Princess Bride\" book & screenplay). He previously collaborated with director Rob Reiner on the film version of his own novel \"The Princess Bride\", and this is, to say the least, quite the change of pace for both writer and director.The story: novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is driving himself home one dark and snowy night after finishing his latest book. He is in a nasty accident. But he wakes up in the isolated home of retired nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates, well-deserved Oscar winner for this). She has basically converted a guest bedroom in her home into a hospital room for her patient. And, in addition to being a trained RN, she is a huge fan of Paul Sheldon's writing, ESPECIALLY his series of bodice-ripping style romances about a woman called Misery Chastain.What a lucky man, right? WRONG.You see, Annie is a bit unhinged (to make a massive understatement). While working as a nurse, she pilfered some presciption-only painkillers that she proceeds to give to Paul, who proceeds to become addicted to them. Also, she reads the manuscript of Paul's new book and is not pleased, particularly with the raw language. (Actually, she seems to make sense in their argument about whether \"people talk like that all the time in real life\"). But she takes her displeasure to the extreme, forcing him to burn the manuscript. But that's nothing compared to her reaction when she finds out that, in the last Misery book, her favorite character is killed off . . . let's just say that, if Annie has her way, this will be the \"last Misery book\" over PAUL'S dead body.Directing: A. Writing: A. Performances: Oscar for Bates, and Caan more than keeps up with her.Not to be missed, especially if you are a King/horror in general fan. Takes it to another level.Cheers.",

James Caan also gives a great performance, I could really feel the characters pain through the TV screen. The scene where she clubs his feet is so painful to watch, it's a shame they didn't keep the scenes where she actually cut the foot off.The pace is quite good, it can feel a bit dragging sometimes when it takes quite long for him to get around the house. It isn't so interesting to see him drag himself across the floors or use the wheelchair to explore. You already know she will return in the very last second and he will have to get back to the room, so you are just snoozing until you hear the panic music start playing.I thought the wife of the sheriff was funny and added some comic relief for the movie. Not because she was goofy, but because she was so sarcastically clever about everything. The downside of the movie is the sheriff, who when he has uncovered the horrible truth, decides to investigate on his own. There's so much evidence pointing to that Anne is evil enough to kill babies, so why would he want to go investigate on his own?",

About a successful romance novelist named Paul Sheldon, marvelously played by the late great James Caan in one of the finest performances of his distinguished career. One winter day on his way home from his writing retreat where he has just completed his latest novel, a blizzard suddenly appears sending his car spinning out of control and off the road crashing down a hill, severely injured he is rescued by Annie Wilkes, played remarkably by Kathy Bates in an electrifying breakout performance that earned her a richly deserved Oscar and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, as his \"number one fan\" who turns out to be a psychotic ex-nurse. She fixes his severely broken legs and holds him incommunicado because she is hell-bent on keeping her favorite writer as her personal prisoner for as long as he lives. Masterful direction by Reiner, with brilliant supporting performances from a fine cast that includes the late character actor Robert Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen and the late great Lauren Becall, but it's Bates' unforgettable show-stopping performance that steals the entire motion picture hands down. Striking cinematography by Barry Sonnenfled, and an absolutely brilliant screenplay by the William Goldman.

            "review_title": "Misery: Fun for Me, Not for Paul",
            "content": "\"I'm your number one fan\" Annie Wilkes tells famed writer Paul Sheldon as he wakes in her home. Annie (Kathy Bates) just rescued Paul (James Caan) from a car wreck, and Paul is told she couldn't get him to a hospital due to the blizzard that caused the crash. What develops is a situation that becomes increasingly suspicious, suspicious in that Annie was somehow there when Paul's car crashed, he is in her home instead of a hospital (his legs are broken), the phone lines are conveniently down, and the roads are conveniently impassable. What also develops is a simple but effective and engrossing, though visually lacking, story of suspense and tension, driven largely in part by the performances of Bates and Caan.It's probably better that viewers are kept in the dark about Annie's intentions for suspense purposes; this way they can experience everything with Paul. That, and it allows audiences to use their imaginations for a good portion of the movie, an effect that can produce dark, disturbing, and foreboding thoughts about what's coming, further adding to the tense atmosphere of Misery. The whole suspense factor is moreover compounded in several scenes when the stakes are upped, so to speak. A great example is when Paul manages to escape from his room and search the house for a phone, a scene that is spliced with shots of Annie getting closer and closer to her home, eventually reaching the front door as Paul high-tails it back to his room. A multitude of other subtle elements (a few clich\u00e9d, unfortunately) add to the movie's suspense, elements like stormy weather (including the obligatory cut to Annie's face as it's illuminated by lightning and accentuated by thunder), close-ups of slowly turning doorknobs, taut pacing, etc.Director Rob Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride) adapts the Stephen King novel. Considering that the bulk of the movie takes place in a single bedroom, Reiner does a good job of maintaining interest among audience members. James Caan (The Godfather, Thief) and, especially, Kathy Bates (Titanic, The Waterboy) assist in this endeavor. Caan plays it straight, for the most part. His character could have been a little more scared, a little angrier, or a little more emotional at some points, but at least this gives an even bigger payoff at the times that he is genuinely frightened or enraged (a scene involving a sledge hammer comes to mind). Bates is delightfully bipolar, instantly switching back and forth from sweet and caring to angry and unstable. And yet, she manages to never overact, making her performance that much more convincing and, therefore, disturbing. The police detective and deputy investigating Paul's disappearance play off each other well, too, providing audiences with a whole new spin on the \"buddy cop\" concept.The one drawback to the movie, and this is hardly a complaint, is that Misery could have been more visually exciting. Director of Photography Barry Sonnenfeld had just finished the Coen Bros. classic Miller's Crossing prior to working on Misery, and while the former's cinematography was both gritty and beautiful, perfectly fitting the film, Sonnenfeld didn't carry the same quality over to Misery. For instance, while both films feature the grain that comes along with older film stock, it tended to make Miller's Crossing a more memorable film with the visual vibe of an old, hard-boiled noir movie, whereas in Misery it only serves to remind that the film is nearing two decades old. This matter would normally be trivial, but since the movie is mostly limited to the inside of a house, it would have been nice to shake things up visually (see Panic Room).Nonetheless, Misery makes up for any of its shortcomings and then some. In fact, the cinematography wasn't even bad; it just wasn't as high quality as the rest of the film. And it is a high quality film. It bears a striking resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window in that the performances are first-rate, there's plenty of suspense, and there's a guy in a wheelchair with a broken leg. And because it's a damn good movie.",

The story details Annie's obsession with Paul and her peculiar schizophrenic personality that, ultimately, results in her believing that she and Paul are madly in love with each other and should die together.A strong plot from the off (although this is down mainly to King, with only a few tweaks) is combined with excellent character development by James Caan and Kathy Bates who play their characters with a thrilling excellency that absorbs the audience's mind in the story and allows us to relate to each and every action the characters make.The direction, the timing, even the music allow the film to grow and within the first half hour a full blown thriller/horror combo is born- this is the type of film that will have you hooked from start to finish, even when very little is actually happening as we are allowed to delve into the minds and personalities of the characters so much- every time Kathy Bates is on screen I am left almost in awe of her presence.

A lot of King's books are in my opinion too lengthy, contrived, and discursive, and the fact that this is a very simple story probably contributed to how well it translated into film. It's not trying to be anything more than it has to be, and the film follows a simple, straightforward story set almost entirely in one house. The concept is terrifying in of itself, and the film never fails to deliver great levels of suspense and tension. It's a thriller at its best, more effective than most modern horror: none of the scares are cheap as jump scare might be; the film has a constant threatening tension, terrifying unpredictability, isolation, hopelessness, and moments that will make your skin crawl and heart just drop... And the suspense and fear has weight to it too; there is true drama and emotion to the film, and the characters feel like real people. It lacks King's usual supernatural twist and I think 'Misery' is much better for it; it's pure human drama and terror, and depicts one of the scariest human situations imaginable. The acting is amazing, especially from Kathy Bates who won an Oscar for her performance, and the film is very well produced. Overall, it's just an amazing film that you should definitely watch; expect it to hook you and never let go with its relentless suspense, tension, and guttural fear.There is one scene - the 'hobbling' scene - which I have always found to be especially horrific; it's a masterpiece of suspense and dread in of itself as the inevitable slowly comes to pass.

If you have read the book and are expecting it to be as graphic and gory , you may be a tad disappointed as it has been toned down a bit.

The person who takes him in gets angry because in the writers latest novel in a series, he kills off her favorite character. The physical and phycological torture put on the main character makes that movie some much more suspenseful. This master piece wouldn't be possible without the main antagonist who is played by Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates brings so much to her role that it is scary. The way she can be happy and cheerful and then turn into a deranged lunatic in the same scene is just incredible.

Great script, great acting, great story, everything about this movie is perfect. There is not a single universal aspect that I find fault with. At the time of this film there will be no loud exclamations: Why? Why?

However, a recent blizzard causes Paul to lose control of his car and he subsequently rolls it off the road and down a snowy embankment, sustaining multiple injuries as well as knocking himself unconscious.We, the viewer, witness a passer-by free Paul from the mangled car with a crow bar and carry him off by way of a fireman's lift. We are given no clues as to the identity nor sex of the rescuer.All this occurs in the opening scenes but the real story gets going as Paul awakes in a strange room, slightly concussed and also confused as a strange, rotund woman comes into focus, declaring herself to be his \"Number one fan\". She also declares herself to be a nurse but, due to the blizzard, she declares the roads to be closed and the phone lines down, making it impossible for an ambulance to get to her remote farm...In spite of carer Annie Wilkes' inventiveness in stabilising Paul's legs via home made splints, she has a presumably illegal stash of various meds and equipment that she has hoarded since her days as a paediatric nurse.Very soon into Paul's incarceration, he allows Annie to read his new manuscript - something he has previously never allowed due to his superstitions but makes an exception due to his acceptance that she saved his life. Upon reading a few chapters, Annie returns to Paul's room with lunch and, when asked for her opinion, she quickly becomes irate about the profanity within. So much so that she launches into a verbal faux pas whilst consistently spilling hot soup all over her victim and subsequently holding him culpable. Realising she's gone too far, she attempts to redeem herself by apologising and thereafter telling Paul that she loves him, before adding 'Your mind, that's all I meant' Almost at once, Paul realises he is in the company of a sociopath and from that point on he plays to her tune in a bid to make good his escape.But escape is never easy when one has broken bones and when he shows signs of recovery he is disabled once again...",

Richard Farnsworth plays the lovable man we all want him to be and sets forth an inevitably lovable character. Kathy Bates stands out as one of the most frighting, outlandishly memorable female antagonists of all time. Her mannerisms and edgy approach to her character show the extreme ability and range of this Award Winning actress. Without any hesitation, I can say Kathy Bates deserved her Oscar. She is known for her brilliance because she lets herself be completely vulnerable to her audience, ensuring that we will see no uncertainty with her characters. She commits to every moment, as does James Caan in this film, and stands out as an actress superior to many others.Overall Rating: 9.8/10 - A+ Recommended: Yes",

Both actors help by putting on quite intense performances with plenty of subtle nuances(Caan struggling and failing at not showing outside signs of the terror Kathy's presence provokes on him). Sad to see poor old Richard Farnsworth shot in such a way but it put across well the point of Kathy going to walk that extra mile to keep Caan by her side.

Paul has encroached into the Colorado Rocky territory of his #1 fan Annie Wilkes to complete the bestseller romance fiction based on the character Misery Chastain, a controversial object of passionate affection.This time Paul has conceived of an end to the life and the fiction series of Misery Chastain in a way that is conceptually untrue to his reader fan.Paul completes the final manuscript from within a far removed resort and begins his return to New York to re-engage with his publisher, played by Lauren Bacall.On his way he is confronted with dangerous winter road conditions and his car is diverted off-road in a snowstorm. Later, he is rescued by a mysterious figure who plucks him from his snow covered wreck.Paul wakes up in the home of solitary nurse Annie Wilkes, who assumes charge of his recovery. Annie, as it appears coincidentally is a huge fan of the Misery series and becomes angrily enraged with the handling of the final manuscript. Annie explains 'You killed my Misery (Chastain), Paul, either you write a new book, or I kill you' (paraphrased). Annie employs violence against Paul to control his place in the new found order of life. Of course, this has nothing to do with Paul other than the fictional death of Misery Chastain. What is important to Annie Wilkes is for Misery Chastain to live for reasons of what this means for Annie Wilkes personally.Annie agrees with Paul to end their lives together over the final page of a revised final manuscript.A crippled Paul is secretly unwilling to cooperate with Annie and uses sabotage to undermine her plans when she is away.At the same time a local sheriff is on the trail of missing writer Paul Sheldon at the request of his insistent publisher. He finally pays the Annie Wilkes farm a visit after she fists her way back from town and he is shotgunned behind his back after he re-enters her home to locate the urgent voice of extra baggage Paul.As it turns out, Annie Wilkes is someone who is living under a longtime evil veil. She is a former maternity nurse accused of hospital baby killings.However, Annie is innocent and a good person as always. Misery Chastain is an extension of herself.In the end, Paul survives the suicide pact only to meet the ghost of Annie Wilkes when lunching with his publisher in a high-class New York hotel.",

He is badly injured and eventually rescued by his number one fan, at least according to her, Annie Wilkes. Instead of being taken to a hospital Annie brings Paul to her home, because \"the roads to the inner city are closed\". At first, Paul is very grateful but when he realizes that Annie will never let him go he starts to feel a bit anxious. A week or two before he crashed his car he had just had his latest book about Misery published, where in the end, Misery dies giving birth to a child. When Annie has finished reading Misery's Child, and reaches the big conclusion, she gets furious and forces Paul to write a new book where Misery instead survives.Paul Sheldon was played by the Godfather hero James Caan, and Kathy Bates portrayed the somewhat unstable Annie Wilkes, which for her acting she later received an Oscar. I think the movie was very well-done and the actors were all of them very convincing. Especially Kathy Bates was magnificent in the role of Annie Wilkes. There are many scenes where Annie seems to be a sweet woman, for example when she listens to Liberace or whenever she is in a good mood. Kathy Bates really builds up sympathy for her character. As a viewer, I actually cared for both Annie and Paul. I wanted it to work out just fine for both of them. For example when the sheriff was at Annie's house looking for Paul, I did not want the sheriff to find him.If I had to rate this movie, I would put it somewhere between average and good, that is to say, I liked it.",

His foot(left i believe) is *cut off* with an *axe*.****End of Spoilers****The acting of Kathy Bates is amazing because of how she can go from \"OOHHHHHH I just bought the first edition of Miserys' Child!\" to \"You dirty bird...YOU KILLED MISERY*shakes bed*, I Don't WANT HER SPIRIT, I WANT HER!\" is amazing. Although Kathy has done great acting in some of my other favorites(Waterboy(\"Did someone hurt you boy*picks up butchers knife*you just tell momma who hurt you\")).This movie has it's ups and downs, at points it has you dragging and bored but then a couple minutes(give it about 10-25)and Kathy Bates will come in as mean as possible creating one of the most feared and infamous 'horror'(more like suspense)character ever.Like Carrie you have to respect the stuff that's going on and look at the thrilling suspense stuff then complaining because it isn't scary and drags you at points until it gets good. 8/10",

I have nothing but positive things to say about Misery and recommend it to anybody who likes a good thrill. Kudos also should go to James Caan (For the Boys) who allowed the viewer to be scared out of their minds with him.  He just had to raise an eyebrow and I would jump.  Great thriller!!!",

            "content": "Set during the cold winter in Colorado; bestselling author, Paul Sheldon (James Caan) has just finished writing his final Misery novel. A series of novels about a woman n the 19th \u0096 Misery Chastain. On his way back to New York, he is caught up in a blizzard and crashes. Luckily he is saved by Annie Wilkes (The versatile Kathy Bates), who takes him back to her isolated cottage in the icy mountains, where she nurses him back to health. Unfortunately, Annie just happens to be Paul's 'number one fan' and upon discovering this is Misery's final novel, she reveals her instability \u0096 before imprisoning him and terrorizing him \u0085 Kathy Bates is as many people have already said \u0096 the star. Ignorantly, I'd only seen her in the famous 'Titanic' where she played a rich and upper-class American widow; here is a much better role. Where plays an obsessed psycho; but carefully conceals her psychotic side under a cloak of innocence and nice. She very rightfully deserved the award for Best Actress in a Leading Role she claimed later in 1991. James Caan, who I'd actually never heard of, is also excellent as the imprisoned writer. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen add a small, undisruptive comical side to the story as the bickering husband and wife/Sheriff and Deputy who are meanwhile trying to find Paul \u0096 who is missing form their perspective. Lauren Bacall gives a nicely acted cameo as Marcia Sindell \u0096 Paul's editor who appears at the very beginning and in the final scene.Those who are expecting a climatic horror \u0096 I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. But don't be put off. What makes Misery so scary and unsettling is that the viewers have absolutely no idea what the deranged Annie Wilkes is going to do next. And I can promise you will be trembling in your seats whenever she is on screen.What I also liked about Misery is that there aren't many characters; which is helpful as you are completely focused on the plot without being distracted by the large amount of people. The majority of the film is just Paul and Annie alone in the cottage; with the occasional glimpse at the Sheriff and his wife \u0096 who are looking for him.The script was well written \u0096 all down to William Goldman. One of my favorite script writers \u0096 I also recommend 'The Stepford Wives' (1975) to anyone who hasn't already seen it \u0096 another Goldman success.I first saw Misery on channel four, back in November; which I recorded over and bought the DVD. I strongly advise you to do the same, for there are a number of special features on which is always good, as Misery is nearly 16 years old. These features include interviews from Kathy Bates, James Caan, William Goldman and Rob Reiner and information on the musical that Misery inspired.So, in summary Kathy Bates is superb; as are the entire cast \u0096 from James Caan to Lauren Bacall. But, the backstage cast are equally good especially the director and screen writer. Which as I've learnt recently; is just as important. Another successful adaptation from Stephen King. I'd also recommend 'Carrie' and 'Secret Window' \u0096 two other excellent screen versions.A first-rate thriller entwined with an excellent horror.",

Anne Wilkes from the book connects with us more than the one in the movie. Kathy Bates for me, was a bit too natural in many scenes. That might be because she's a good actress (she got an Academy award for the role after all) but I felt that a bit more exaggeration might have actually helped this character more.The characters in the book told us many things - the rage and emotions felt by Paul as a writer, the level of Anne's insanity (conveyed beautifully through her past) and above all the agony of an accident victim. The movie was in a kind of \"run through every emotions as quickly as possible\" mode. Especially in the \"agony\" part. The 'wounded' wasn't that wounded in the movie.So in short, the movie is worth watching but if you've read the book then you might be left with that unsatisfactory feeling at the end.",

Local resident Annie Wilkes rescues him and he wakes up in her house on a farm. Annie seems very nice and is an unabashed fan of his but slowly her obsessive and unstable side appears after she has read a draft of his latest novel. Paul is unable to really get around. It really gets interesting once he makes several attempts to escape or incapacitate Wilkes. My only real critique is how Sheriff Buster connects the dots to Wilkes holding him captive or at least suspicion of this. There also could have been some added depth and not an 18-month lapse after he finally overcomes Wilkes capture. Still, a top-notch thriller and a great watch during the winter months!",

He was brilliant in my estimation.  His range of facial expressions taking the place of the internal dialogue that existed for his character in the book. He was definitely sympathetic enough to make us really care about what happened to him, which is what any good horror movie needs.Kathy Bates' performance was simply a tour de force.  She was just perfectly cast.  And she was masterful in her execution as the ultimate villain; a monster that seriously COULD be living right next door.  She demonstrates a common theme for Stephen King: That real monsters don't have tails and fangs and horns, but are instead regular people that we allow to get close to use who either are or become insane.Rob Reiner just proves that he is one of the best directors in the business, and that he can cross genres with aplomb.  I think it is interesting that two of his best are Stephen King adaptations, this movie (Misery) and Stand By Me.If you want to really be chilled to the bone, see this movie.9/10",

            "content": "It doesn't get any better than that. Anyone who has ever tried to write knows that often the only thing that saves you is escapism, the flight into the distance, the establishment of new places, new people and new problems, in the hope that this will breathe life into your story. This is also what the writer Paul Sheldon hopes in his own way, who achieved fame with his Misery series of books, and who sets off - though he always does - from New York to the solitude of the Rockies. There, quartered high up in a hotel, he puts the finishing touches to his dime novels. And when he indulges in the ritual Lucky Strike and a bottle of Don Perignon after his work is done and then heads back home, he is surprised by a blizzard, loses control of his car and ends up in a ditch. And if Annie Wilkes hadn't come along, his biggest fan, who sees this encounter as a divine coincidence, Sheldon would probably have been allowed to freeze to death peacefully in his wreck instead of being subjected to a horror trip of the highest order.Fans have it in them to be fanatical, and Annie is no exception. The trained nurse, who lives lonely in a cottage, at first only cares for Sheldon's wounds, but eventually also takes care of the writerly matters, because she does not like the twist in the case of the novel character Misery at all. Shelton's last novel, which is currently available in bookstores, was supposed to be the conclusion of the series - with the demise of the eponymous heroine. No way!....If it's risky for a writer to create a two-person chamber drama and expect people to want to read it, it borders on megalomania for a filmmaker to expect a movie audience to see it adapted for the screen. Instead of the house on the moor, we have a snow-white frame here as a black backdrop. Bright and peaceful and nothing intrusive or subcutaneously threatening that pushed one toward horror. Except for the vivid psyche of two people, the fear of the writer versus the fanaticism of his fan, incessantly pouring oil on the fire and keeping the cogs turning.Lead flies too, but the film also delivers a sequence that is almost unparalleled in brutality, which Annie carries out with calculated ruthlessness and all peace of mind. Truly demonic. If you haven't seen this film yet, you should make a note of the following sentence: \"There is a justice higher than that of man, I will be judged by Him!Rob Reiner converts Steven King's original congenially; in atmospheric density and tension, within the framework of its minimalism, unique.",

Kathy Bates is up there with Hopkins' Lecter and Joe Pesci's evil gangster characters in her portrayal of Annie Wilkes - a cross between the sweetest nurse you could ever imagine, and Satan.Reiner and screenwriter Goldman crank up the suspense with skill, pushing it as far as possible while keeping things plausible, so that by the time you reach the 'hobbling' scene you are going to undergo one of the most harrowing experiences of your life.

            "content": "The first time I watched this movie, I wasn't all that impressed. I mean, I thought it was good, but I didn't truly appreciate the film until subsequent viewings.James Caan plays the part of novelist Paul Sheldon, whose books include a series of novels with the character named \"Misery\". Paul is driving in his car one very snowing evening in Colorado, when his car slides out of control and flips off the side of the road. We see him being rescued by a person who turns out to be Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates. She brings him back to health at her house in the wilderness, always proclaiming to be Paul's \"#1 Fan\". We can tell something's definitely wrong with Annie right with the first few encounters with Paul, as she's definitely someone who's possessing a wee bit too much fanaticism with the novelist. Eventually, she forces Paul to write a new novel in the Misery series, keeping him under lock and key, not allowing him to leave, even after his injuries have sufficiently healed. In fact, in a possessive rage, she injures him even further, in one of the most grotesque on-screen injuries I've ever witnessed.I'll stop right there and not reveal anything further about the plot. It needs to be seen to really be appreciated. But what really needs to be appreciated is the acting ability of Kathy Bates. Watching scenes of her persona go from admiration of Paul, to quickly turning into rage through the help of psychosis, is something to behold. She really makes it believable. I said her moods turn quickly, but only in the sense of being in the same scene. Just watching her facial reactions turn slowly during these times, are not only truly believable and scary, but they are also the mark of a great actor. Under the direction of Rob Reiner, she pulls these scenes off flawlessly, and it's a beauty to see.James Caan is very good in his own right, but Kathy Bates steals this show. It's kind of a throwback to the great actors from the past, who can make you feel sympathy to vindictiveness in one scene.A Must See!!!",

My mother has read just about all of them, and she loves them all. This is almost identical to the book, therefore, it is a great film. We start with a writer, Paul Sheldon. He is on his way home when he is in a massive car wreck. An obsessed fan, Annie Wilkes (Bates) abducts him from the totaled car and begins to nurse him back to health. After discovering that she is a serial killer, he gets in a wheelchair and picks the lock, escaping while she is gone. He has killed off her favorite character, Misey, in his latest book, so she makes him burn a book that he has finished and has yet to be published. She has him write a new sequel, where Misery is resurrected. He knocks down a statue, and puts it back up. When she arrives and finds out that he is trying to escape, she ties him down and takes an axe to his ankles, shattering the bones. This is the most famous scene in the film. Anyway, he begins to plan her demise and his escape, through the new book that he is writing. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a great watch. Look out for some of her shocking but hilarious lines:Paul: Profanity offends you? Annie: It has no nobility. Paul: They're slum kids. I was a slum kid, they all talk like that. Annie: THEY DO NOT!!!

The director has brought the novel to life, and has created an extremely thrilling and entertaining film. He also did extremely well with regards to casting Kathy Bates as the freakish and obsessed 'Annie Wilkes' You couldn't find anyone else who could of done the job (and fitted the role) even half as good as Kathy did! Brilliant. In fact, i think all the actors fro the other characters were perfectly cast for this classic film. There's not much more i can say-that other haven't already put...Except i strongly recommend you watch this film if your into thrillers. One or two disturbing scenes (one in particular), so be warned! The film is directed brilliantly with a great screenplay based on yet another Steven King masterpiece. There is really good character development throughout the film-and you actually feel for main character 'Paul Sheldon' as he is held, helpless by his 'number 1' obsessed fan 'Annie Wilkes' If you haven't seen this yet...get a copy. You will enjoy it-if you like Steven King/ a good thriller/ Brilliant acting and good work by the director. Fantastic for those rainy/Snowy!nights in! A must for any collection!8/10",

Though crazy and psychotic, Annie reminds us of what we truly are, obsessive creatures.Leaving Paul in the bedroom also adds suspense. Throughout the whole time he is there, you start to wonder what is really outside of those walls. Annie Wilks' house is charming and sophisticated, which is ironic in a way, and that is what makes her so lovable.Even though her beliefs are totally out of whack, they make you hate her, but love her at the same time.Annie's unusual beliefs and Paul's struggle to survive make this movie a great thriller for those who can't stand ghosts and monsters.

When Annie Wilks hit Paul with the sludge hammer, I turned around and limped out into the kitchen that's how bad it hurt.When Paul finds the pin and tells her to go get paper for him, I thought he was really going to get out! I was cheering for him to get out and... the phone has nothing in it! It's nothing... there are no wires in it or anything, and then in the same scene when he gets to the kitchen and finds out it's locked... that part was scary. The expression on his face when he heard the car coming up the driveway... I was screaming at the TV \"Get back there, Hurry!\" The final scene when Paul burns his book, I was scared and happy for him. But when they were fighting, I think that was the best scene in the entire movie. I Really loved that movie and I'd give it a 1,000,000 out of 10 but that's not a rating so I went with 10/10.",

In almost every King's work we have some very warm characters of which you have more creeps than with the villains.

The plot is simple: A quiet writer crashes his car during a blizzard and is rescued by his \"number one fan\"-who's a little morbid. His legs are broken, he's stuck in bed and she gets very upset when she finds out her favorite character of his, \"Misery\", has been killed off. You can figure out what happens next, but the movie remains compelling thanks to good performances from Kathy Bates (who hits a nerve head on) and James Caan and Rob Reiner's professional direction. Because so much of the movie involves Caan playing straight man to Bates, the movie may seem too low key for some horror tastes, despite one key violent scene that's all the more effective because of the utter lack of violence before it. Caan's character and some others are dull compared to Bates; I'm told the novel has more fleshed out characters and a nastier finish. Still, I prefer a measured achievement like this than the messes that usually result from Stephen King adaptations.",

Then I remembered where I had heard it before. On the Steven King novel. I rushed out and bought the book, the film sounded interesting but I wanted to read the book first. It was wonderful a brilliant, tense thriller that had hints of humour. It was definatly the best Steven King book I have read (The others are Apt Pupil and Shawshank Redemption).I know this is'nt a book review, so i'll get back on track. I got the dvd for Christmas and was delighted at how good it was. Kathy Bates and James Caan are perfect in their roles and often funny aswell. Kathy Bates truly deserved her Oscar. She does'nt just play Annie Wilkes, her performance is so realistic, she is Annie Wilkes. She can turn from calm to total psycho, yet appears pretty normal. James Caan often goes unrecognised for this role, yet he portrays Paul brilliantly.The film has the same plot as the novel, but it is not really faithful to it's original source. Many differences occur, and the film is better for it. It is interesting to see a different view on the story, rather than just seeing the book. Differences are the hobbling scene, the policeman scene and the added bonus of the hilarious candlelit dinner.Annie and Paul's characters are different in on film than the book. For instance, Annie wasn't following Paul on the night of the crash. Also Annie does'nt predict things about Paul, e.g. cigarette after finishing a book, he has to ask her.On a whole the film is an excellent adaptation. It offers a new insight to the story. I don't think that I managed to get the most out of the film because I read the book first. The film would have been more enjoyable if I did'nt know what was going to happen.

            "content": "This is a SPOILER ALERT (for the book anyway)Misery was the first book that I have ever read that actually frightened me, I felt that Annie Wilkes would be lurking behind my door, waiting to put me through torture.The film Annie however didn't scare me in the slightest, whilst Kathy Bates IS Annie Wilkes the script makes her a far less threatening character, couple that with the pathetic characterization of Paul Sheldon and you get a film that doesn't even come close to the terror of the book.\nIn the film Annie is never quite nasty and insane enough, a good example of this is when she first gets angry. In the film she spills some soup on the bed and shouts, comes back to earth and apologizes. In the book she throws the soup across the room, comes back to earth, sweetly cleans it up with soap and water then makes Paul drink the dirty water before she will give him his pain killers. This highlights another problem with the film and that is James Caan, he is just too strong as a character and I never felt that he was in the amount of pain he should have been. In the book the pain was debilitating, the slightest movement would cause excruciating pain, there is no way he could have put both his legs onto one side of his wheelchair and lowered himself onto the floor, as he does in the film, without causing himself to blackout from the pain. The Paul Sheldon in the film was a nasty character who I never had any sympathy for, he was far too strong willed and unlikeable, in the book he is flawed but still very likeable as he gains a new sense of life from his expieriances.With a humanised Annie and an unlikeable Paul the terror was never going to be all it could have been and was in the book. The one scene from the book that turned Annie from having freaky tendencies to all out Psycho was the hobbling scene, in it Annie uses an axe to slice Paul's foot off,using a blow torch to cauterize the wound. This scene was originally written for the script but was replaced with the sledgehammer sequence by Reiner and Scheinman, the scriptwriter William Goldman said 'They were right{to change it} because if she'd cut his feet off, you never would've forgiven her' but that is the point, from that moment on there is no sympathy for the character, you shouldn't forgive her, it's what makes her such a horrifing and frightening character.I have read that the lawnmower sequence was considered too comical to be filmed, I don't think it would have been if done the way it was written, the effect would have been comic to start off with but with a slight change of expression on Annie's face and her shredding the arm of the cop first, showing his reaction and leaving time for audiences to feel sympathy for him before totally ripping apart his upper torso, the scene could have worked. Even if they couldn't achieve this they could have captured Paul's guilt at causing the cop to die. In the film he causes the Sheriff to bite the bullet but his reaction seems too selfish, no time is given for him to feel bad for being the reason the Sherrif died.I agree with a comment someone else made that it would have been nice to see the final irony of the last 'Misery Chastaine' book being his best. But I would put that down to the awful characterization of the Sheldon character anyway.The film is a good film, well directed and beautifully photographed, and adds the plotline of the elderly Sheriff slowly finding out where Paul is which is a very good innovation. Had I just seen the film I would have thought it was excellent, frightening in parts and well crafted. But having read the book first and seen what this film could have been I was disappointed.PS. The Libreace line was awful, I hated it. I suggest whoever is responsible for it should be made to listen to nothing but Liberace for the rest of their life.",

Nobody else could have played the role as well as Kathy Bates did and there is something likable about her even after everything. There was something that made you go 'awww' when she died and feel a little bit sympathetic for her. Well....I did anyway! I did think that there were some very atmospheric bits left out of the film that were in the book (even thought it isn't right to compare) such as the soapy, soupy water drinking scene. However the film is very well done and some of the shots where she is in the room with Paul when he is peeing and also the kiss-blowing were made quite sickening after all she did to him. I have also just helped backstage with the stage show of Misery which is more like the book than the film as there are only the main two characters throughout the whole play, but it does always manage to hold the audience and the best speeches such as the 'Rocketman' one and the part where she tells him she doesn't like swearing were included which brought a bit of humour to it.

James Caan gives a genuine performance as the captured author, Paul Sheldon, and because of this - we can really place ourselves in his shoes during certain difficult situations. But the real gem of the whole movie goes to Kathy Bates, who plays the psycho devout ex-nurse Annie Wilkes perfectly. Her performance can makes us laugh one minute, then make us feel very uneasy and scared the next. Annie Wilkes is, my opinion, one of the greatest villains of all time and Kathy Bates made her what she is. I think that this is probably the most simple psychological thrillers ever made - yet it still manages to affect audiences even to this day. 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

Especaily Paul Sheldon. There is no real character development baring Annie.But Annie is what makes this movie. Kathy Bates does a haunting job of Annie, and i can really tell why she won an award for it. The hobbling scene is so creepy i can barley watch it.Even the house is haunting, like when Paul picks up the phone and it is just a shell. there are some downfalls though in addition to the ones i mentioned earlier. James Carn does an okay job of Paul Sheldon but it is just okay. there is little if any music which can be good or bad. I also don't like the ending but i will not ruin that.all in all i think that Misery is a fine movie but has a few flaws when it comes to character and plot development. 7/10",

But, his number one fan, Annie Wilkes, who is known for killing the objects of people for many decades, rescues him from the car wreck. Annie takes him to her house and begins pumping medicine through his body. As the movie goes on, her temper and violence on Paul Sheldon goes up. She gets mad about the swearing in his book, she gets mad and shakes his bed and hits him with a board when she finds out that he killed Misery Chastain in his book. She gets mad when Paul tells her she got the wrong paper. She has also made him burn his new book and start another book the way Annie wants it. But then something happens to Annie. She is depressed and suicidal. She pulls out a gun with no bullets in it and then tells him she might put bullets in it, then leaves. Paul is left all by himself. He decides to go out of his room to get a knife, when he does he finds her scrapbook called Memory Lane which contains her over the decades where she has killed people and found behind bars. Paul is astonished and returns back to his room into his bed. The rain and thunder is able to be heard outside. After a couple of hours Annie returns then hobbles him.

The Bates character is EXACTLY as I imagined ... just a shame she didn't use a blow torch, tsk tsk tsk. I give the film only 6/10. This is exactly what Hollywood does with King's books (turning them into films), it's obviously just too difficult to put into picture.

Paul's frustration and desperation to leave his confines makes for quite a gripping watch, although there are some parts of the plot which may be a little slow moving for some people's taste. I suppose as time moves on, some film viewers may be more impatient than those of the past perhaps. The topic/theme of obsessive fans is, if anything, more relevant or contemporary than ever in the age of social media, I reckon and so it makes for a somewhat thought provoking watch as well. The presence of the typewriter made me think of The Shining (also based on a Stephen King novel), only in this instance its not the villain who uses it, rather the victim.\n\nThis is certainly a decent film that's, as I say, well worth a watch and so I would recommend it, yes.",

I never tire of it, and returning to it feels akin to visiting a reliable old friend. Scrutiny may reveal the scattered sources of the underlying secret to its allure; the performances are iconic and memorable, the scenario is obviously a personal one for Stephen King, the suspense is palpable, and the setting confers the charm and the danger of quiet isolation. Then, of course, there is the stunning creation which is Annie Wilkes and the frighteningly off-kilter manner in which Kathy Bates animates her on the screen. It may also be noted that a comic element belies the film's horror, always enrapturing us in a fashion that simultaneously scares and welcomes us. As the title of the film suggests, misery is certainly the name of the game for poor Paul Sheldon, but for the rest of us, the misnomer couldn't be more apparent.",

The screenplay is very fine, exploring themes such as fanatical devotion, artistic dilemmas and worthiness of commercial fiction without a psychological suspense context, while the story is always well paced and compelling.\n\nAlso outstanding is the direction of Rob Reiner. He adeptly exercises in chilling claustrophobia and allows a numerous numbers of genuine jolts. The acting is great, James Caan, Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall are all great but the film belongs to Kathy Bates who is monstrously scary and deservedly won an Oscar for her brilliant performance.\n\nOverall, Misery is a superb film and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "With sharp direction by Rob Reiner, a screenplay by William Goldman adapted from a novel by Stephen King, cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld, and a cast that includes Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth, James Caan, and Kathy Bates there's little wonder how Misery turned out so well. Even with all of this talent behind and in front of the camera, the key to Misery's success is the phenomenal and chilling performance by Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes, one of the most memorable and frightening non-supernatural horror movie villains.\n\nAuthor Paul Sheldon (Caan), famous for writing a series of novels set in the 19th century featuring a heroine named Misery, is badly injured in a car accident during a snowstorm in rural Colorado. Fortunately, he's rescued by a former nurse who also happens to be his \"number one fan,\" Annie Wilkes. She tells Paul that the road to hospital is blocked by snow but as the winter rolls on Paul realizes that Annie is dangerous and he is a prisoner.\n\nThe situation Paul finds himself trapped in is grim, but the film itself is not thanks to the still fresh feeling approach to the material. There are moments of dark humor peppered throughout that at times border on absurdist but are welcome breaks to the tension. They also help ground the story in the real world, where humor slips in at the strangest times in the strangest ways.\n\nAnnie and Paul are both clever and resourceful characters which really ratchets up the tension. We think one character has the upper hand, then the situation flips in a believable way. We're always rooting for Paul to outsmart Annie but we know he has his work cut out for him. Scenes of Paul's agent (Lauren Becall) in New York and the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) in Colorado keep the film from being claustrophobic and add to the tension as we wait for someone to figure out what has really happened to Paul.\n\nA very well played and uniquely scary scene, which also has humorous undertones, happens when Annie explains to Paul why he can't just change the ending to the last \"Misery\" book to fit the new one she is forcing him to write. Her reasoning is so clear and logical, and her disdain for being condescended to as an audience member is so intense, that it makes her all the more frightening. Tricks and plot holes won't work on her; Paul will have to be extra clever to outsmart her.\n\nPerhaps the most famous scene in Misery is the \"hobbling\" scene. Annie has discovered that Paul has broken out of his locked room and explored the house. She holds a sledgehammer and calmly and meticulously explains the purpose and method of \"hobbling.\" The scene is set to Beethoven's hypnotic \"Moonlight\" sonata, a perfect choice. There is no blood and you don't have to look hard to see the special effect, but the scene is heart pounding and shocking nonetheless. I still jump or look away every time. Overall, Misery is not an especially bloody movie which makes the few scenes of violence even more effective and shocking. Aside from the \"hobbling\" scene, maybe the most famous moment of Misery is the shot of Annie's face coming into focus as Paul regains consciousness from the car wreck. It's an unforgettable introduction.\n\nIn a rare instance of the Academy Awards recognizing and honoring horror, Bates deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress of 1990. Annie is never really likable but thanks to Bates, she is always interesting to watch and her swings from wholesome and vulnerable to psychotic and violent are believable and frightening. Even as she tortures Paul, you still believe her affection for him is real and that's what makes her so scary. She plays Annie Wilkes to such perfection that you can't imagine the character or the movie without her.",

Sheldon finds himself trapped with multiple injuries included compound fractures to his legs meaning that he is immobile and dependent on Wilkes to care for him. She also tells him that the telephone lines and down and roads closed, both of which are lies. Things take a darker turn still when Wilkes goes and buys the latest book by Sheldon which has just been published (yes the road to town has mysteriously been reopened but there's no mention of Wilkes taking Paul to a local hospital) only to discover that her favourite character Misery has died during childbirth. Wilkes isn't happy about this. This is bad news for Sheldon.\u00a0\n\nMisery explores the obsessive, irrational fan devotion that was explored in very different circumstances in Scorsese's meisterwerk The King of Comedy, a film that bombed at the box office whilst Misery was a huge hit but is inferior in comparison. Oh, the irony.\n\nBefore seeing Misery for the first time I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King's masterful novel of the same name. The film adaptation feels like the finer nuances of the novel have been erased to make a big screen shocker that contains great performances by Kathy Bates (Wilkes) and James Caan (Sheldon) with Paul's literary agent being portrayed effortlessly by the ever divine Lauren Bacall.\n\nBut the film also feels like some kind of TV movie that lacks not just the depth of King's novel but also the cinematic grandeur that might have been envisaged and realised by another director other than Rob Reiner.\u00a0\n\nMisery feels like an attempt to hit big at the box office by creating two dimensional characters and cheap shocks rather than delivering anything with real intelligence. And it worked. Misery brought in the money and earned Bates an Oscar. But watch Misery next to other, better King adaptations such as The Shining and Carrie and you'll see what I mean.

I felt the same tension I felt reading the book and thought Kathy Bates was a perfect choice for Annie Wilkes. She is terrifying and gives a great performance that truly deserved the Oscar that she won that year. My only gripe about the movie is that the book is a more engaging way to experience this story to its fullest, while the movie is a more straightforward thrill ride. As far as adaptations go, I still feel this is one of the better ones overall, but it still suffers a bit just because of the strength of the source material.

            "content": "Review: \n\u2018Misery' is an American psychological-horror film directed by Rob Reiner. It is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. It's been a while since I seen this movie and I've got to say that I didn't love it as much as I remember I did. I mean, it's a great claustrophobic thriller with some great performances. It just didn't have the same feel it did when I first watched it years ago.\nThe plot revolves around a famous writer, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), who gets into a car wreck and is saved and seems to be nursed back to health by a woman, Annie (Kathy Bates) who claims to be his number one fan. After ready a copy of his latest release in his famous \u2018Misery' book series, and finding out her favorite character was killed, Annie makes Paul write another story to bring her favorite character back to life, while also making his life a living hell.\nEverybody talks about Kathy Bates's performance in this movie, and while it is a scary and good take on Annie Wilkes, James Caan is break takingly good as the writer Paul Sheldon. In every helpless scene he is in where he is trying to escape or showing us how much pain, he is in when going in and out of his wheelchair. I was seriously in awe watching him work this character into his own creation.\nI love the camera work in this movie. I expected to because it is a Rob Reiner film, but he is so good behind a camera. He uses long and wide shots for extremely simple scenes. By that I mean it could just a be man sitting in the library looking up information and the angle he uses is so beautifully shot. Where the movie lacks is in its scare department. This is supposed to be a horror movie after all or at least a thriller, but where I see it, it's just a drama movie that has intense scenes. That's not to say the movie is bad or anything, just if your going to serve me a slice of lemon pie, make sure I taste the lemon.\nOverall, this movie shows that Stephen King is more than just a weird horror author that only writes about creepy monsters or supernatural elements. It still has a feel on a movie he would produce, but with a certain zest added to it.\n3.5/5",

            "content": "I hadn't seen this film in years and wasn't quite sure how it would hold up, but it remains a strong example of a chamber-piece horror film that excels at slow burn horror and suspense. James Caan plays romance novelist Paul Sheldon, who's in a horrific snowbound car wreck, but is \"rescued\" by his #1 fan Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates in a brilliant and terrifying performance. Sheldon soon realizes his savior is in reality holding him captive, but there is little he can do due to the remoteness of her house and his wheelchair bound state. What ensues is a game of cat-and-mouse between Caan and Bates that is suspenseful, frightening, and utterly thrilling. The film is tightly directed by Rob Reiner (\"Stand by Me\" \"A Few Good Men\" \"The Princess Bride\" \"When Harry Met Sally\") and is smartly scripted by William Goldman (\"Magic\" \"Marathon Man\" and the under-appreciated \"Dreamcatcher,\" along with non-genre classics like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Princess Bride\") based on a Stephen King novel of the name. Goldman's script gets major kudos for making this chamber piece horror film believable. Sheldon is an intelligent character and Goldman has him try all of the things an intelligent person would do in order to try to escape, which makes the situation all the more terrifying. Caan is perfectly cast in the role of Sheldon, a tough guy macho on-screen personality who finds himself uncharacteristically laid low, making this plights all the more disconcerting. But it's Bates who steals the show as Sheldon's obsessed and deranged fan, determined to keep Sheldon all to herself at any cost. There are few other characters in the story, but the actors in those roles are equally memorable. Richard Farnsworth is excellent as a small-town sheriff investigating Sheldon's disappearance, as is Frances Sternhagen who plays his wife. It's also a treat to see Lauren Bacall in a small supporting role as Sheldon's publisher, but for the most part, the film is all Caan and Bates. Overall, \"Misery\" is a class act of a horror movie, which is a rare occurrence, and is essential viewing for fans King, Caan, Bates, or of horror films or thrillers in general. SPOILER ALERT! The hobbling scene still shocks today and is just as cringe inducing as ever. ",

            "content": "Horror has never been my favorite genre because I do not really have the desire to put myself through a situation that will provoke fear and pain in me. I decided to watch this film however because so many of my friends who did not like horror really enjoyed it and had a lot of praise for the performances of Kathy Bates and James Caan. I am glad that I followed their advice and decided to watch this entertaining, suspenseful little film that rests on it's central performer, Bates, who is able to deliver an Academy Award worthy performance. I would recommend this film despite it not necessarily being to my personal tastes because it absolutely achieves what a film of  it's genre should and I enjoyed it in spite of myself.\n\nWriter Paul Sheldon, James Caan, is famed for a series of novels he has written that follow the adventures of a Southern Belle called Misery Chastain. He heads to Silver Creek Lodge, a holiday town in a secluded location, to finish writing the final novel in the series in which Chastain will die. He has a horrible car crash that breaks both of his legs when driving back to New York City and finds himself in the care of suspicious nurse Annie Wilkes, Kathy Bates, who calls herself his \"Number one fan.\" He slowly realizes that Wilkes is more sinister than she initially appeared and her anger at the death of Chastain in his draft of the book leads to a horrific series of events.\n\nThe film works both as a traditional horror film with a villain being slowly revealed in the lead up to a dramatic, bloody climax and more interestingly as a commentary on the difficulties of being famous and dealing with fanatics. It is easy to be charmed by Wilkes initially because we in the audience relate to her more than we relate to the successful and famous Sheldon. We all idolize some famous person who we hope to meet and because she appears helpful and kind at first we are willing to accept the slightly creepy statements she makes about having watched Sheldon work. When she becomes a full on evil psychopath we are almost upset because she had been the person we could most identify with on screen and we were rooting for her to gain respect from a man who she so desperately wants to prove herself to.\n\nObviously Reiner is very skilled at building suspense in the scenes in which we witness Sheldon plot to murder Wilkes with various items found around the house while he keeps an eye on her in fear of her catching him. The hobbling scene is deserving of it's iconic status as everybody winces in pain when watching it and the sight of Caan sweating while rolling around in a wheelchair is surprisingly effective. These scenes were probably the least interesting to me as they felt like something out of a very traditional horror film and while I know these scenes are necessary to please the fanatics of Stephen King they felt a bit generic at times. \n\nBates completely inhabits her role as she gives a very over the top, hammy performance but she fits the tone of the film overall and is simultaneously disturbing and sad. We are convinced by her warm bedside manner and luminous smile that she is a good person and Bates makes the shift very believable as she is chilling in the soup scene. Just the sight of her face giving a wide grimace towards the end of the film is terrifying and that is a testament to Bates' power as an actress. Caan is also very good giving the less showy performance as he gives an impressive physical performance with the audience feeling his pain through every gritting of his teeth and widening of his eyes. The two together are a wonderful pairing as they have an odd chemistry of sorts with Bates being willfully disobedient of Caan's lack of interest in her and Caan seeming ill at ease throughout, we enjoy spending time in the company of these characters because these two make them so interesting and so worth watching.",

What follows is typical King fare, a psychological game of cat and mouse that ranges from the surprisingly droll to the disturbingly brutal.\nAs Stephen King adaptations go, Misery is fairly well done, a faithful if slightly pacified version of a story that naturally hooks us in. It's really elevated by two fantastic lead performances with James Caan playing captive writer Sheldon with an understated brilliance. The real stand out, however, comes from Kathy Bates (an Oscar winner for her role), who plays the unpredictable Annie with a remarkable level of complexity and realism. A subplot involving Richard Farnsworth's Sheriff meanders along, but the bulk of the film is a two-player game, complete with scenes of biting tension, sporadic violence and unnerving tenderness. Marc Shaiman's score adds a chilling touch that suits the film's slow build from the typical to the terrifying.\nThere are enough gems of excitement in Misery to keep us interested (even at a slightly stretched 107-minute run time), but the film lacks both the introspection and horror of its source material. There are moments of greatness (the famous \"hobbling\" scene springs to mind), but much of the film is approached with a heavy-handedness, never as clever nor as scary as it seems to think it is. Nevertheless, the film remains pretty much consistently entertaining, with just enough surprises to keep it afloat. \nIn the end, Misery may be rather uninspired, but it's a loyal and well-crafted adaptation of a good story, elevated by a scintillating central performance from Kathy Bates.",

The story from Stephen King is as scary and sharp as ever with King's writing. Reiner takes the cold atmosphere, cramped spaces, and helpless situation and makes it even more frightening. \n\nJames Caan adds some much needed and appreciated humor as the hilarious and sympathetic injured author held captive by his intimidating fangirl Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Caan keeps you entertained through his character's immense suffering and patience. He gives an underrated performance through his use of many subtle facial movements and bodily cues with his limited dialogue. I love Caan in Misery.\n\nSpeaking of which, Kathy Bates is the star here as the obsessed devotee that puts the fan in fanatic. Her portrayal is so sweet and innocent that quickly builds into some far more sinister. You'll never look at Bates the same way again after Misery.\n\nI must mention the nice supporting roles from Richard Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen, and Lauren Bacall. Farnsworth is the quintessential small town sheriff with a quaint charm. His sincerity and intrigue adds some joy and suspense to Misery. I think The Coen Brothers must have seen Misery to inspire their similar detective in Fargo (1996). Misery is alike Fargo in its local mystery alongside the enclosed insanity of The Shining (1980).\n\nIn short, Misery is a well directed film that depicts how depraved fans can resort to if unchecked by decency. It is as upsetting and humorous as the first time I watched it. You will be rooting for Caan the entire time. So sit back and endure the pain of Misery.",

James Caan and Kathy Bates both give strong performances; particularly Bates, who does a good job at subtly moving from eccentric fan and psychopath.  And Reiner effectively builds tension and suspense quite well; especially in showing Sheldon's captivity and isolation.  Still, there are some problems with the script, such as the underdeveloped subplot of the sheriff's investigation and the rushed conclusion.  Yet despite its flaws, Misery is a frightening horror film.",

The pacing is perfect from beginning to end and nothing feels out of place, you get just the right amount of suspense and action. The acting from the two leads is fantastic and they both help to get us sucked into every celebrity's worst nightmare. As a writer myself I especially sympathize with James Caan's character and how he is deprived of his freedom of expression and mobility just to please a psychotic and prudish fan of his (played brilliantly by Kathy Bates). Kathy's character seems to serve as a bit of a personification of fan bases in general, praising and adoring an artist's work when it meets their arbitrary, often contradictory expectations, while going crazy when that artist decides to change things up and create something that challenges his intended audience. The terror Paul Sheldon is forced to endure becomes all the more nail-biting as Annie Wilkes seemingly loses more of her sanity as the film progresses (or at least does away with the facade of sanity), and it builds up to a satisfying climax. I can't believe I hadn't seen this movie before but I'm very glad that I did! Will definitely rewatch it in the future.",

There is this 'hobbling' scene in this film that is by far one of the most uncomfortable things I've seen in a while, that was something to watch.

When she didn't like what happened, she goes on psycho on Paul Sheldon (James Caan) and keeps him inside her house. In his young years, Rob Reiner used to be a big deal in terms of the films that he has made, but then he starts to slips away in his films that people wonder ask, what happened to Rob Reiner? When I watch his past films to see how it came to be, even though I didn't like This Is Spinal Tap, I come to a realization that he just surrounded himself with talented writers that know how to write a film, whether it be from Aaron Sorkin for A Few Good Men and The American President, Nora Ephron for When Harry Met Sally..., and William Goldman for The Princess Bride, and this movie. James Caan did a great job acting like a calm person trying to go through with the situation that he's in, while dealing with the pain of his legs. Kathy Bates did a fantastic job of her performance as a big fan of the author that is nice in one hand, but the other way she goes complete crazy, and also get depressed too in one scene, which I'm glad she got the Academy Award for it. The writing by William Goldman is really good that understands how scary people can be when they are a bit too obsessed with who they enjoy reading their books. It gets pretty tense at times as you really want the author to get out of her house despite his legs being in pain, and it can be hard to watch at times, but in a good way that makes you more invested in this.

Kathy Bates plays one of the scariest renditions of that one in-law in recent history. It lacks the depth of the original book, which is mostly unavoidable with the transfer from book to movie, but it also lacks the build of the book, meaning that the climax is unfortunately truncated and we don't get to establish a relatively normal relationship between our protagonist and antagonist before things get tense. But it is still TENSE. Even when factoring a lackluster score, stale visual scale, and datedness, the movie version of Misery remains a satisfying thriller that will get some to jolt out of their seats...even if their legs are broken.",

Some of my favourite things about this movie are the performances and the screenplay. James Caanes and Kathy Bates are both oscar worthy ( Kathy Bates won her one and only oscar and it sucks james caanes didnt even get nominated because he really deserved it) i did like the writing and direction but i could have felt that Kathy bates could have been written or directed a little bit differently, because for a movie that is near 2 hours long which isnt a bad thing, you have to have good characters, even if the movie isn't two hours long, you have to have good characters. Even though both stars had good characters i feel like kathy bates should have been a little less tempermental becausr it got kind of annoying, yet effective, so i don't really know how to feel about that. It really is a love hate thing with kathy bates because she had an outstanding performance, but there was just somthing about the writing. The death sequence, when she fell on the type writer i felt thats when she should have died, she was literally pooling blood out of her head, then she gets back up and tried to kill james caanes once again. that isn't a strong female character trait that she got back up, that is just unrealistic and i suppose that is the writers and the directors fault, but it's okay. I didn't hate that, i would have just prefered if it had a little bit more realism. If the movie as a whole had just a tad bit more realism, i think it would have been at a 5 star level. also, if the score/soundrack were better, that would help the movie alot too. Anyways, Misery was a good movie that i enjoyed alot and it is another great stephen king book-to-film adaptation and i was really impressed by it and had a good time watching it. I reccomend this if you haven't seen Misery yet.",

            "content": "\"Misery\" is kind of like \"The Shining\" lite - both are set in the winter, both have writers as the central characters, and both have villains that are totally insane. There are obvious differences; in \"The Shining\" of course the writer is the one who goes crazy, there are numerous supernatural elements that aren't present in \"Misery\", and \"Misery\" doesn't exactly have the visual or philosophical depth that Kubrick brought to \"The Shining\".\n\nStill, Rob Reiner's film is a very entertaining and often terrifying study of obsession, and its simplistic themes about Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates)' over-infatuation with Paul Sheldon (James Caan) still have a lot of relevance today in our age of fandoms and #Cut4Zayn / #Cut4Bieber. \n\nKathy Bates won the Oscar for her performance - the only Oscar ever won for a movie based on a Stephen King work - and so it's no surprise that her performance is hauntingly effective. James Caan is also great in his role as the writer. His performance is mainly physical, as many scenes are devoted to him trying to escape his imprisonment (Wilkes takes him in after he crashes his car during a snow storm, and pretends to \"care\" for him before forcing him to write her a new book to her liking). \n\nIt's a well-edited and nicely framed movie, though most of the entertainment value is down to the bare-bones, quickly-paced script and the committed performances from the leads. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen are also great as the local sheriff and his wife, respectively, who attempt to figure out where Paul has gone after he's declared missing. The comic rapport between the two characters reminded me a bit of the characters played by Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch in \"Fargo\", though with a slightly more sarcastic tone. It's hard not to root for the small-town sheriffs in these films, anyways.",

It's about when fans become unhealthly obsessed and the \"writer being captured\" thing is super-smart and it's lovely told. I like the story and how the characters develops. It got a touch of comedy in it, black'ish, and it's a great spice here. Great atmosphere, suspenseful and not overdone by cliches - not many at least. It feels natural and quite realistic. Many great details is also key for me.\n\nKathy Bates in the role of her life, she really nails it. While Bates has that crazy-vibe James Caan got that writer-look. Few roles here, but it's extremely well casted in other words. Scary film as well, and that ugly sledgehammer-scene has haunted me since I saw it as a kid for the first time. A modern classic in my book.\n\n9 out of 10 N-keys.",

            "content": "Wow, has Misery really been around for almost 25 years? It is a superb story of an author who gets in a bad car accident and then is dragged to \"safety\" by his his #1 fan. This is one of those films that I wish I could have seen without knowing anything about it, because that gradual turn the story takes from a simple drama into an all-out thriller is very subtle. It is such a great slow burn as you actually realize along with Paul Sheldon, that perhaps Annie Wilkes isn't his savior. In fact my only real complaint is that, when you know what's coming, it can seem like it is taking too long to get there. But once Annie shows her darker side the tension is heightened in every single scene. One of my favorite aspects is the fact that Paul over time starts to understand how Annie's mind works and he uses that knowledge to manipulate her into doing things she might not have anyways. It is a very unusual relationship because it starts out so gentle from both sides and in her mind the gentleness never goes away despite his growing paranoia, anger, and fear.\n\nJames Caan delivers an excellent performance as Paul Sheldon. I'm always complimenting actors when they perform in such a way that we can tell just through expression what they're thinking, and this is one of those times when it is nearly flawless. I also had to continue reminding myself that he was just pretending to be crippled because he did a great job of dragging his legs around like they were broken. Of course the real master stroke of Misery is Kathy Bates. Holy cow, does she ever deliver a terrifying performance. In those later scenes she says some things in the sweetest tone you can imagine and yet they give me the chills because I can feel the underlying threat. This might be one of the best films adapted from a Stephen King novel. If you have not seen Misery, hopefully I haven't spoiled it too much for you, because this is one I would recommend you check out. It still holds up 25 years later, because the story of obsession is somewhat timeless.",

You were never sure when the \"Dragon Lady\" would appear or what she would do. You weren't really sure how much she knew about Paul's schemes. I loved the camera work. Especially the voyeuristic shots that give you an unsettling feeling of anticipation and impending doom from putting you in her perspective before you know for sure that it is her perspective. I love the parallel scenes of Paul panicking not to get caught by Annie and then Annie panicking not to get caught by the Sheriff.

A lot of great actors turned down the role of Paul Sheldon, before James Caan accepted. All credits must go to the wonderful performance of Kathy Bates, a the psychotic Annie Wilkes. She won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for best Actress. Enjoy the movie, and remember: Not all friendly faces are trustworthy... \n\nSuccessful author of the Misery Chastain-series Paul Sheldon (Caan) has been staying at a remote lodge in the snowy mountains, waiting for the release of his latest book and working on a new manuscript. Heading home he is surprised by a blizzard and crashes with his car. When Paul regains consciousness, he finds himself in a bed with his wounded legs and shoulder taken care of by a nurse called Annie Wilkes (Bates), who rescued him. Because of the heavy snow, she took him to her house. As gratitude and because Annie claims to be his number one fan, he lets her read his new manuscript. The woman admits she doesn't like it as much as the 'Misery'-books. When the following day Annie comes home from shopping, she has brought a copy of Paul's latest book. Excited she starts to read it.  But when Annie learns that her favorite character dies in the end, she's in a total rage. Paul is no longer her patient. He's her prisoner...",

Stephen King's novel on fanatism and obsession gets a worthy rendition in this thriller very much dominated by the interaction between the two lead characters played wonderfully by Caan and Bates. It is thanks to these performances and the claustrophobic setting that the film can boast an original kind of sinister tension and gripping suspense.",

The shocking way she flips back and fourth between a sweet girl and a total psycho is incredible. It's always disturbing when she's around, and Bates' performance is worth nothing short of an Academy Award. It's no surprise she won.\nJames Caan makes an exquisite comeback in Misery, and as a character who has to act physically disabled and mentally tortured simultaneously, Caan succeeds in his role extremely well. He uses good vocal skill and line delivery in his dialogue scenes, as well as proper physical skill in his scenes that require use of character disability. Misery features one of Caan's best performances.\n\nA contributing factor to the success of Misery is the utter intensity and musical score, as well as the character development and the simplicity of the plot. It's also thrilling thanks to the sense of realism and the plot dynamics used to characterise the characters. Misery is a great and unforgettable thriller, and one of the better Steven King based films.",

I don't usually like the horror genre, unless it's something interesting and justifies its gore. This adaptation is more ironical, sardonic and absurdist than you would hope to find in a Stephen King film. That was something I particularly liked, whereas other films like Kubrick's \"The Shining\" are awfully accelerated and its impredictability doesn't reach a more monumental glance after you've first seen it. Or at least, that's what I think of it :P\n\nMy mom loves this kind of films and we saw it some days ago, after hearing some unbelievable lauds towards Kathy Bates' performance. Maybe it's me, but I laughed so hard everytime she talked or appeared. Not that she wasn't scary, she was just so over the top. I loved the way she yelled at Paul Sheldon calling him \"Mr. Man\", and how she changed on her attidue towards him was just as hilarious as frightening. A fine job indeed. However, I happen to like James Caan's performance more than Bates'. He was the man who played Sonny Corleone, for godssakes!\n\nI don't understand why Stephen King chooses to kill secondary characters so often. I also found the film unnecesarily too rude and disrespecting with several of its characters: why should all fans be stigmatized because there was one crazy bitch who forced the writer to keep her favourite fantasy alive? Now nobody can tell him \"I'm your favorite fan\", 'cause then the instant image of Annie Wilkies comes to mind. James Caan's face when he replies \"Thanks, I appreciate it\" is pricelessly descriptive. He should have been nominated for an Oscar back in 1990, for he did a job as grand as Al Pacino did in the last Godfather.\n\nNeedless I say, \"Misery\" is a hugely entertaining horror flick that relies in psychological subtlety to transmit its horror, and actually seems more consistent and surprising everytime you see it again.",

The elements are all in place to be claustrophobic and have an appropriate amount of thrills, and even to show the situations that can arise when fans go too far.

The obvious standout is Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning turn as the psychotic and slightly tragic Annie Wilkes, a bubbly celebrity stalker prone to severe mood swings and a vicious mean streak.  Her unreal cheeriness clearly disguises something, so from the moment she appears, there's a feeling of tension.  The cheery facade is quite thin though, and the devil within bubbles up unpredictably, yet the viewer is unlikely to be entirely unsympathetic toward her severe depression.  James Caan plays her victim, and even as his performance rarely leaves a bed or a wheelchair, he conveys his character's plight effectively.  An unfortunately less remembered performance is Richard Farnsworth as the local sheriff investigating the disappearance of Cann's character, who provides a healthy amount of wry humor to the dark proceedings.  Also of note is the chilling cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld, especially as the shots focus on Bates' face during her wrathful tantrums.  William Goldman, who wrote the script, was originally most excited to have Bates chop off Caan's feet with an ax in the infamous \"hobbling\" scene, but while plenty of feet have been seen cut off, the image of a sledgehammer knocking a foot well out of a natural position is not easily forgotten.",

            "content": "I've often wondered what it would be like to have a stalker. Personally, I'd find it flattering, but I guess my opinion would change if I was ever in that situation. \"Misery\" certainly doesn't make it look very fun.\r\n\r\nJames Caan plays Paul Sheldon, a writer who has finally decided to end his series of cheap romance novels by killing its title character, Misery Chastain. Driving home from a hotel in Colorado, his car crashes and he is found by a former nurse, Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who happens to be his number one fan. The phones are down, and it seems that no help is coming any time soon, despite the work of dedicated Sheriff Buster (Richard Farnsworth).\r\n\r\nKathy Bates won an Oscar for this film, and she deserved it. Annie is a terrifying creation, even when pleasant. ESPECIALLY when pleasant. The film is primarily a psychological battle between Annie and the incapacitated Sheldon, which quickly tuns physical when Annie gets violent.\r\n\r\nAll the acting is quite good, really. Caan is a magnificent straight man for Kathy Bates to play off of, and Richard Farnsworth is pretty delightful in his scenes. They add a light, gentle comedy to contrast with the horror and dark humor in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThere's also nice pacing to this film, never needing to go back when it escalates. There is a mystery to who Annie is, and it's nicely told without being explicitly stated. Also, there is a pig.\r\n\r\nIf anything could be said against the film, it's mainly that it's an extremely simple story. It doesn't take very many risks, and there are no real big surprises. The film grows a little ridiculous at the end as well, and... I really wanted more Buster.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a taut, fun, thrilling thriller. Sure, it doesn't really do anything new, but what it does do it does extremely well. How many modern day thrillers can say the same?",

Like Caan, Bates' character isn't exactly three-dimensional or one that we totally ever care about, but she nevertheless succeeds at being awkward and strange most of time, creating some truly unforgettably uncomfortable moments. \"Misery\" dwindles into predictable horror territory towards the end, but it's an enjoyable flick that's equal parts thriller and dark comedy.",

I know that sentence sounds a bit paradoxical, but allow me to explain; from what I had heard from friends and others, this was a piece of cinema that was groundbreaking and perfect in every sense. When I saw it, I wasn't blown away like I had expected, and this may have affected how I viewed it - I was expecting so much that I was never going to be fully sated by what was on screen, and that is my fault. Yet, this was one of the most solid and interesting films I've ever seen; directed by Rob Reiner, the man behind cult film Spinal Tap and the amazing Stand By Me, starring James Caan and Kathy Bates, it's the perfect tale of a person stranded with an enemy. What makes the film more than a simple moral tale, however, is the fact that we, as an audience, identify with Bates' character, even though we know she's a murderer and insane - we understand her lonliness, her isolation and her hunger for company, and we understand that Caan is the person to replace her husband. The atmosphere is intense and spooky throughout and, although not much in the way of gore or murder occurs, the menacing tone just never shifts - Bates' character is so unhooked and insane that her mood changes may come at anytime and, watching it for the first time, you're scared by when it might come. It's an amazing and impressive work, increased in spectacle by the dramatic turns by both leads and a solid adaptation of the Stephen King novel.",

Especially when it relates to Marcia and Buster. Caan was not as good as Bates was but considering that he was against a Bates character that overshadowed him, he was outstanding. Bates on the other hand dominated the film, she really got into her character and her Oscar was well deserved. I didn't fully loved the film, and the celebrity obsession didn't really work for me as good as it did in The King of Comedy. I now just want to see the adaptation of the The Dark Tower series already, its easily Stephen King's most popular and entertaining books.",

Kathy Bates is truly menacing here and her psychotic performance of an obsessed fan will stand the test of time, the more you learn of her past, the more frightening she becomes. James Caan is also fantastic playing the vulnerable writer trying to outwit his captor and he really sells the pain and struggle of his character. The film is absolutely solid, keeping the tension raised throughout and watching Annie's mood turn on a dime is quite exhilarating! The famous \"hobbeling\" scene is still hard to watch and there's plenty of other nail-biting moments. Definitely one of the best Stephen King adaptations that achieves so much, with so little!",

He always writes his books while staying the same motel in a secluded town. After he finished his latest book, he is returning back to New York when a blizzard has just started. He loses control of his car and tumbles down a cliff. Anne Wilkes (Kathy Bates), his self proclaimed #1 fan rescues and takes him back to her house and nurses his wounds. Except that she has no intention of letting him go and after she finds out he has killed off the main character in her favorite series, she burns the book and makes him to write the character back to life. Helpless and people assuming him to be dead, there is little hope that he would ever be found.\r\nMore than Kathy Bates, I was thrilled by James Caan's performance. Those subtle expressions of disappointment, deceit and sarcasm are priceless. Also liked the entertaining thread involving the aged couple who also are the Chief and Deputy of police for the town who are investigating the missing writer's case. Kathy Bates does a terrific job but her character at times is a little overcooked. The gory depiction of torture and suffering is a sight to behold. For a movie that has just two central characters, screenplay has to be perfect and perfect it is.\r\nWhat was so good here:\r\n1. Performance of James Caan and occasionally Kathy Bates.\r\n2. Entertaining thread involving the aged cop couple.\r\n3. When Anne Wilkes becomes the torturer.\r\nThrilling entertainment and Sonny did learn not to talk when he should be listening.",

The script by William Goldman is smart and sticks closely enough to the book to please King's fans. \r\nIt's basically a two-person show, and Goldman has created two very real characters here that are played to perfection by two veteran actors. James Caan is very sympathetic and easy to root for, but he's shown up every step of the way by Oscar winner Kathy Bates. This is the performance of her distinguished career. As psychopath Annie Wilkes, she gives what could have been a standard role depth and emotion. There's a lot more going on with her than meets the eye, and both actors bring a touch of class to this project.\r\nThen there's the direction by Rob Reiner, who is not at all accustomed to this type of film. He's made more than a few missteps in his career, but he's at the top of his game here. The suspense builds to the breaking point, and while the film does rely on a few cheap shocks near the end, it's still solid entertainment. The supporting performances by Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen bring a sense of realism to the picture with their down-to-earth appeal, and cinematographer-turned-director Barry Sonnenfeld's striking work here make this such a beautiful looking picture as well. It's work like this that made his move to the director's chair such a natural transition.\r\nWatching \"Misery\" made me wish that everyone involved with this film could go back and remake every other Stephen King adaptation before it. This is how it should be done.",

            "content": "Hey, more Stephen King movies that actually work!\n\nAt first I was like \"well, why did the guy who made 'This is Spinal Tap' make a thriller\"...and then I was \"oh my god. This is actually a really well-made thriller.\"\n\nInstead of relying on jump scares, which were starting to be heavily abused by most mainstream horror films, Reiner instead uses a more classic Hitchcockian way of scaring the wits out of the viewer. From the first minute you see Annie Wilkes, you know that Sonny Corleone is in deep, deep trouble. I blame Marc Shaiman's score for causing us to feel extremely tense - it's as if we're transported back to classic filmmaking, save for a few more swears and some extremely disturbing violence at the end.\n\nPlot: Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets into a pretty nasty car accident, worrying his agent and his unseen daughter. He's saved by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a livestock farmer who claims to be his #1 fan. Thinking she's sort of well reserved, Paul allows her to read his new manuscript (a little darker than the seemingly implied romantic tripe of the Misery novels). From there, oh boy...if I tell you that Annie doesn't really like Paul's new direction and wants him to write his new novel (to the point where she's willing to keep him trapped in her house under all circumstances), that would be an understatement of the highest order.\n\nFrom there, Annie wants Paul to write a new Misery novel - more absurd than the original, with gun duels and corpse resurrections and every trope you would find in a Stephen King novel. Paul does so, thinking that if he tries to defy her under any circumstances, he would instantly be killed. Annie, knowing that Paul's trying to get away from her, constantly drugs him in order to keep him in check. However, her plan to keep Paul forever doesn't exactly work.\n\nI think one of the more effective parts of the film in the acting. Yeah, cinematography is standard (nothing too stereotypically artsy or definitive of Rob Reiner's style - unless if you count making an exaggeration of real life his style), but it's the performances that got to me. Caan doesn't get much love in this film - after all, compared to Bates' all out and just downright demented performance as Annie Wilkes, he's extremely reserved - but in that regard, he plays a writer who's trying desperately trying to get away from the desires of his fans. Hell, even by writing this extremely terrible novel that satisfies this woman who thinks everything he writes is gold, you know Paul's up to something. You want him to get out and when he does, you ask yourself, \"Was it worth it? Yeah, Annie killed babies, colleagues, and the sheriff, but after all, she's human. Nobody deserves to die by the hand of another. Was Paul truly justified when he slowly bludgeoned Annie to death?\"\n\n...and on the flip side, I adore Kathy Bates' performance. At first a Marge Gunderson type who appears as if she walked off the set of \"Fargo,\" she slowly becomes insane. Like, \"what if La Tenia and Biff Tannen had a baby with Norman Bates and Phillip Garrido\" insane. All she wants is to love Paul. All she wants him is to abide to a set of standards that he clearly does not want to stand to. She wants him to bring solace to her life. She clearly cannot separate fantasy and reality - when Misery dies, her life's over. It's back to the big bad world that has disowned her because of her sordid past. She wants Paul to keep her in this state of disorientation so she can continue her fantasy life. Hell, it's somewhat implied that she's probably raped Paul. She clings to the guy - and she's deeply in love with him. Every time he asks her for a dinner with her, it's obvious that she swoons over him. Also, why is she constantly drugging him with painkillers and whatever that stuff is in that syringe?\n\nHowever, like most good films, this suffers from a bit of pacing problems. Also, we're not really given much insight as to what Paul's daughter felt during those four weeks he had been captured. I know everybody thinks he's dead, but at least show us Paul's daughter reacting to that obviously misleading news. Then again, that could be the case - after all, we're solely focused on Paul and the sheriff as his curiosity piques thanks to some evidence everybody else doesn't see. \n\nIn summary, though, \"Misery\" is a great film. Like most great Stephen King adaptations, this adds another dimension to the film - instead of making it solely about the problems with a rabid fanbase when they disapprove of a newer and better direction for somebody's work and a critique of wingnut Christianity (unable to accept the reality of their situation), this movie also adds a bit of an \"abandon all hope\" feel. It shows imprisonment - it gets you imprisoned. You want people to help, but you don't get help. In order to get things your own way, you have to force it. However, is forcing it really worth it?",

This film was just so perfectly done and Rob Reiner really did Stephen King justice.. The acting is perfect and the delivery of dialouge from Bates is meancing and equally brilliant. Misery is like the Carrie on the 90's, it is sharp, intelligent, and will leave you jumping out of your chair.

What follows isAdapted from Stephen King\u2019s 1987 novel, Misery tells the story of bestselling author, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), rescued from the wreckage of a near fatal car crash by his \u201cNo.1 fan\u201d the seemingly solicitous Annie Wilkes. What follows is typical King fare, a psychological game of cat and mouse that ranges from the surprisingly droll to the disturbingly brutal.As Stephen King adaptations go, Misery is fairly well done, a faithful if slightly pacified version of a story that naturally hooks us in. It\u2019s really elevated by two fantastic lead performances with James Caan playing captive writer Sheldon with an understated brilliance. The real stand out, however, comes from Kathy Bates (an Oscar winner for her role), who plays the unpredictable Annie with a remarkable level of complexity and realism. A subplot involving Richard Farnsworth\u2019s Sheriff meanders along, but the bulk of the film is a two-player game, complete with scenes of biting tension, sporadic violence and unnerving tenderness. Marc Shaiman\u2019s score adds a chilling touch that suits the film\u2019s slow build from the typical to the terrifying.There are enough gems of excitement in Misery to keep us interested (even at a slightly stretched 107-minute run time), but the film lacks both the introspection and horror of its source material. There are moments of greatness (the famous \u2018hobbling\u2019 scene springs to mind), but much of the film is approached with a heavy-handedness, never as clever nor as scary as it seems to think it is. Nevertheless, the film remains pretty much consistently entertaining, with just enough surprises to keep it afloat. In the end, Misery may be rather uninspired, but it\u2019s a loyal and well-crafted adaptation of a good story, elevated by a scintillating central performance from Kathy Bates.",

I don\u2019t really call this a horror movie because it\u2019s not scary but it\u2019s more like a thriller, there\u2019s drama. It was directed by Rob Reiner, who had also directed A Few Good Men (1992), Shock and Awe (2017), The Princess Bride (1987) and the screenplay was written by an author William Goldman, who had written novels like The Princess Bride in 1973, which was transferred into a movie  in 1987 also directed by Rob Reiner, Which Lie Did I Tell?, \u2026 It\u2019s about a psychotic fan who holds an author captive and forces him to write her stories. There was James Caan as the author, Paul Sheldon, who wrote romance novels about a character called Misery Chastain, when he had an accident, he was carried to someone else\u2019s house. It was revealed that the house belonged to his number 1 fan, Annie Wilkes played by Kathy Bates, who won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1991. She acted exactly how the number 1 fan in this film should be like: psychotic, crazy, insane and sometimes can be like an a-hole. I hate her but she\u2019s well-acted and well-developed thanks to Bates. Caan did a well job too. I was just disappointed that he wasn\u2019t even nominated for Best Actor in 1991.  Barry Sonnenfeld was really good with the cinematography. It was kinda old-school and also suitable for a 90s thriller. I also like the story though I haven\u2019t read the book yet. I was really surprised when Sheldon read the red book filled with newspapers and found out that Wilkes was a nurse murderer and killed many patients and the only jump scare I saw was when Buster, the local sheriff was shot by Wilkes with the rifle when he found out that Paul Sheldon was locked in a room or a cellar maybe? And also it\u2019s just a story, why did Wilkes had to scream so bad about a character\u2019s death? That\u2019s just annoying! The original score was okay though, Marc Shaiman was okay as well. I didn\u2019t care about the score much in this film because I didn\u2019t hear the music much, I just care about the screenplay and Goldman wrote it excellently. I like it even though I saw a few sentences were a bit too easy. Misery isn\u2019t really a horror movie, it\u2019s just a drama and thriller which had blood in there. There wasn\u2019t much scare but it was a really good movie. Stephen King wrote the plot really well, Reiner directed excellently, the score was played okay, the cinematography was also well-shot by Sonnenfeld and more\u2026 Caan and Bates were perfect for these roles making this movie one of the greatest Stephen King\u2019s adaptation.

He adeptly exercises in chilling claustrophobia and allows a numerous numbers of genuine jolts. The acting is great, James Caan, Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall are all great but the film belongs to Kathy Bates who is monstrously scary and deservedly won an Oscar for her brilliant performance.Overall, Misery is a superb film and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I suppose the jump scares, when they come, are a bit more impactful though, due to this, if that makes sense but I'd classify it as primarily psychological based. I found the characterisations probably the best aspect of the film, with great performances from both James Caan and Kathy Bates. Paul's frustration and desperation to leave his confines makes for quite a gripping watch, although there are some parts of the plot which may be a little slow moving for some people's taste. I suppose as time moves on, some film viewers may be more impatient than those of the past perhaps. The topic/theme of obsessive fans is, if anything, more relevant or contemporary than ever in the age of social media, I reckon and so it makes for a somewhat thought provoking watch as well. The presence of the typewriter made me think of The Shining (also based on a Stephen King novel), only in this instance its not the villain who uses it, rather the victim.This is certainly a decent film that's, as I say, well worth a watch and so I would recommend it, yes.",
