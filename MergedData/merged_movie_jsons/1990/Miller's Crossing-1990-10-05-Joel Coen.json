            "content": "In my opinion, \"Miller's crossing\" is by far the top work of the Coen brothers, and one of the best movies in the history of cinema. The huge Coens' talent being now fully recognized, I hope that this masterpiece will get the credit it deserves.The plot deals with the war between Irish and Italian gangsters, caused by the Jewish crook Bernie (the Coens like to joke with the rivalry of different ethnic groups). The crook's affectionate sister Verna is the mistress of Leo O' Bannion, the boss of the Irish gang, who consequently opposes to have him killed by the Italians. But Tom Reagan, the old mate and factotum of O' Bannion, has different plans... The story is extremely interesting, exciting, entertaining. There are no flaws in the development of the plot, despite its complications (a homage to the intricate classic film-noirs of the Golden Age). The script is sharp, cynical, sarcastic, full of memorable lines and of black sense of humor, with many delightful subtleties: the celebrated Coens' wit at its best. The photography is magnificent and very original. The music is great. The action scenes are superbly filmed: violence explodes suddenly and unexpectedly. The finale is perfect and splendidly crowns the movie.Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne, is one of the most memorable characters I have seen on the screen. A gangster who tries to use intelligence instead of violence (with alternate success), following a peculiar moral code. Cynical but devoted to friendship. A systematic liar, but capable of generosity. Despite his skills, he is not ambitious, he prefer to be subject to a big-shot. And then, with all his smartness, he strangely chooses to destroy himself with alcohol and gambling. A magnificent psychological design. With this sober, brilliant, subtle performance, worth of a Bogart in great shape, Byrne just shows that he is the best actor in the world (my opinion, of course).The aged Irish boss O' Bannion - Albert Finney is the opposite of Reagan: naive, sometimes dumb, with a strong love and childish attachment for his girl-friend, he is confident only in his own charisma and in brutal force. Speaking of brutal force, he will show in a gun-fight that he's still the number one, in spite of years passing (incidentally: this is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen). Also the other characters are shaped with outstanding intelligence and care, from the main ones (Bernie, his sister, the Italian boss, his right-hand Dane) to the last of the thugs. The whole cast is fantastic: Finney, Turturro, Marcia Gay Hayden, Polito, Freeman and all the other excellent supporting actors. A special mention for the scaring gangster Eddie Dane - J.E. Freeman: he really makes you shriver. Turturro is a bit histrionic for my taste, but this is his style of acting, suited for the role of the crook, mean and coward, but cunning and dangerous as a snake.To summarize, in \"Miller's Crossing\" fun, drama, action, suspense, mystery are masterly blended with deeper themes such as love, friendship and human loneliness. This movie is splendid, magnificent, unique, don't miss it.",

            "content": "It's the Prohibition era. Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) is an Irish mob boss who controls the city. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is his right hand man. Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) has the boss wrapped around her little finger. Only Leo doesn't know that Verna is also sleeping with Tom. Italian rival Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) wants to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) who's been taking advantage of him. Tom tries to get Leo to give up Bernie but he's Verna's brother and Leo refuses. Leo and Johnny go to war. Leo kicks Tom out when he reveals his affair with Verna. Tom goes to work for Caspar and he's commanded to execute Bernie in the woods at Miller's Crossing.It's the third big great movie from the Coen brothers and they show a real mastery of the cinematic arts. It is beautifully shot, ultra violent, and the actors are some of the best around. It is hard-boiled gangster noir and one of the best for fans of the genre. The mannerisms and dense dialog can put off some people and may lose some who don't pay enough attention. There are no good guys in this story. It is strictly anti-hero stuff. That may also put off some people. The audience is asked to pull for Gabriel Byrne even though he's still a gangster, just a more reasonable one.",

            "content": "One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history.  In my opinion, Miller's crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers' films, and one of the true classics of American cinema.On the surface, the story of warring gangsters in 1920's America is one that has been told many times before.  But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision.  The (rather violent) action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace, and the camera work is every bit the equal of \"Fargo\".I became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie, despite his best efforts to disappoint me since.  Byrne's Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character, who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history.  Men beat him up.  Women beat him up.  Collection men, bookies, gangsters, and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing, and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition (with one notably humorous exception).Albert Finney is tremendous as Leo, the local crime boss.  His \"Danny Boy\" scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed.  Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival in the turf war.  J.E. Freeman, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.I will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim.  As an example of the modern style of Film Noir, it has no equals (\"The Usual Suspects\" would rate a close second).  Among gangster films, only \"The Godfather\" can compete, and \"Miller's Crossing\" features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks \"The Godfather's\" epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and \"Touch of Evil\", the belated accolades it so richly deserves.",

It's witty in its dialogue, suspenseful in its action and violence, beautiful in its cinematography, and (being so like the Coen brothers) it can make you laugh and cringe in the same scene.The script is superb. The characters are absorbing and the dialogue (as some reviewers have already observed) flows like words in a book. You have to watch some scenes more than once to totally get what's going on, and even then you still might miss something.The acting is top-notch, even down to the lowest thug. Gabriel Byrne plays the antihero Tom to lonely perfection and Marcia Gay Harden's hooker without a golden heart is excellent. The rest of the cast is great as well, including good mobster Albert Finney and a funny cameo by Steven Buscemi. However, the show is stolen threefold by Jon Polito as the erratic Italian underboss Johnny Caspar, John Tuturro as the slimy \"schmatta\" Bernie Bernbaum and J.E. Freeman as Caspar's dark, vicious adviser/thug Eddie Dane. Jon Polito's monologue in the very beginning on ethics and Tuturro's desperate pleas at Miller's Crossing are both powerful scenes, and Freeman commands the screen whenever he is on.My rating is a 10/10. The best part about this movie is that it gets better and better every time you watch it. Oh yeah...the Danny Boy scene is reason enough to watch this movie anyway.",

            "content": "In my modest opinion, this film is the Coen's greatest achievement to date, even greater than Fargo. I was happy to see so many recent entries on this page, because that means something I predicted long ago is coming true: film buffs are finally \"discovering\" Miller's Crossing, an underground masterpiece that has dwelt in obscurity for ten years.The central motif of the hat, and Johnny Caspar's preoccupation with the altitude thereof, brings to mind another underrated masterpiece, Drugstore Cowboy. The complex Jungian symbolism of forests, doors and especially hats is my favorite aspect of the film.The only criticism I've heard of this film (and I think it's B.S.) has to do with the \"over-acting\"--a criticism that has been directed at more than one Coen film. Admittedly, Coen screenplays read more like novels than movie scripts and are not always actor-friendly. Gabriel Byrne, who appears in all but two scenes, does a great job playing an extremely complicated character. Tom Reagan is a smart guy surrounded by morons, and exists in a scenario where only muscle counts and brains don't. And he hates it. And he hates himself because he knows he's all brains and no heart. He tries to redeem himself through a selfless devotion to Leo, whom he hates. All this makes for an immensely challenging part, and the film could easily have fallen apart with a lesser actor than Gabriel Byrne playing the lead.But the acting is great from top to bottom: Marcia Gay Harden (in her big screen debut) as the hard-boiled moll; Jon Polito as the maniacal Johnny Caspar; Steve Buscemi as the hop-addicted Mink; J.E. Freeman, who is such a marvellous screen villain you have to wonder why he's still toiling in obscurity; and Albert Finney, an actor who embodies the term \"screen presence.\" But the Grand Prix goes to John Turturro, who carries the most powerful scene in the movie: when Tom takes Bernie out to Miller's Crossing to \"whack\" him.Another criticism frequently levelled against the Coens is that they are preoccupied with \"scenes\" and don't focus enough on plot coherence. This too is an invalid criticism, as far as I'm concerned. Some people are irritated by a film that you have to watch a couple times to fully understand, but that's precisely the kind of film that I love, and that's why I love Miller's Crossing so much. Every time I see it I pick up on something that I didn't catch before.Speaking of \"scenes\", the \"Danny Boy\" scene is the best. The second best is the following scene, where Tom and Terry walk through a hallway lined with goons. The third is the police raid on the Sons of Erin Club, in which Leo takes on the entire police force.I'll resist the temptation to call Miller's Crossing \"The Greatest Film of All Time\"--because who has the right to say that? But I must say that it is my favorite film of all time.",

Just let me repeat the usual: The casting is flawless; the dialogue is on the mark, with dozens of juicy bon mots; the humor is sublime; the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; and the plot, while complex, is still comprehensible enough not to detract from the action.This movie is as close to flawless as a movie can be.And one more thing, this movie has nothing in common with either \"Yojimbo\" (which was itself a rip-off of Dashiel Hammett's \"Red Harvest\") or \"Fistful of Dollars\". Well, OK, I'll grant that they both take place in towns dominated by two strong gangs of criminals (as if that's never been the case in any other movie,) but the other plot elements and the dialogue are completely original.**** out of ****",

            "content": "\"I'm talkin' about friendship. I'm talkin' about character. I'm talkin' about--hell Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use the word--ethics.\" So Jon Polito, as crime-boss Johnny \"Caspar,\" describes to his overlord, Albert Finney as \"Leo,\" his point of view while seeking permission to kill a double-crossing underling (played by John Turturro) in the opening lines of __Miller's Crossing__. Had the script sought only to explore the power relationship between the two chief mobsters (one the rising Italian, the other the diminishing Irishman), this would have been a very good gangster film. It portrays an earlier era in the nation's history of organized crime (perhaps Chicago in the late '20s), and one can imagine Leo as the Irish predecessor of __The Godfather__'s Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).Just as __The Godfather__ was really about family relationships and the ethical complexities arising when familial loyalty collides with the business of violence, however, __Miller's Crossing__ is actually about, as Caspar tells us, friendship and character put under the enormous strain of that same business of violence. The film, therefore, centers on Leo's trusted adviser Tom (played flawlessly by the Irish actor Gabriel Byrne). Tom is not a gunsel, but the brain behind Leo's muscle. His decisions carry life and death consequences, however, and we watch him try to live with himself, to preserve his character, as he works out a code that will help him and his friends survive brutally violent upheavals. Critics of the film have cited its graphic cruelty and the seeming coldness of its characters, yet these are essential features in developing the film's theme.Sentimentality might get any of the major characters killed, and one notes the pathos and dark humor that underline an ironic distance that each character, especially Tom, cultivates as a tool for survival.Clues abound as we wonder what Tom will do next. Follow, for example, the men's hats over the course of the film. Who \"keeps his lid on,\" so to speak, and who loses his? Note the number of times characters exclaim \"Jesus!\" or \"Damn!\" when saying the name \"Tom.\" What has he sacrificed? Has he damned himself?Spectacular action sequences, beautiful production values, top-notch camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld, a haunting musical score, and the best dialogue ever written by the Coen brothers make this a great gangster film. The fascinating and complex theme of friendship, character, and ethics make it one of the great films from any genre.",

What caused this, I'm not totally sure, and I really can't fault the film too much. It sounds like I didn't like it, but I did.

            "content": "The Coen brothers craft a loving homage to gangster pictures of yore with splendid results. Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.When the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade \"A\" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the Byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.Visually the film is superb, the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place, a place home to misery, a witness to the dark side of man. All the while Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito bring an array of characterisations to the party, each one his own man but each craftily proving the folly of man. Marcia Gay Harden, in one of her first mainstream roles, slinks about making the two main boys sweaty, and wonderful she is as well. While Carter Burwell provides a musical score that has a smug (in a good way) self awareness about it.Style over substance? Yes, on formative viewings it is. But go back, look again, see and sample what is not being said. Pulpers and noirers will I'm sure get the gist. 8/10",

            "content": "Gabriel Byrne is aces as Tom Reagan, a top adviser to Prohibition-era Irish gangster Leo (Albert Finney). Tom is absolutely cold-blooded, yet does have his own personal code. Tom and Leo end up having a falling-out over a woman named Verna (Marcia Gay Harden, in her first substantial film role). And so Tom ends up associating with Italian mob boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), incurring the suspicion of Caspars' number one henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman). As the elaborate story unfolds, Tom plays every angle he can think of to come out on top.Still, he takes a TON of physical punishment as this plays out. Although it may be a little difficult investing time in a character who's so antiheroic, he is a compelling character, and it would be hard not to feel SOME sympathy for him every time he gets a fresh beating.Overall, \"Miller's Crossing\" is well worth a look, especially for any fan of filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It's quite an absorbing story, and the impressive cast has such a field day with the Coens' memorable dialogue that it makes a one hour and 55 minute run time almost fly by. The Coens do a respectable job at recreating the period (what city or town in which this takes place is never really specified) while indulging in various amusing bursts of in-your-face violence certain to delight some people and repulse others. It's all enhanced by a haunting and lovely score by frequent Coen brothers collaborator Carter Burwell, still a somewhat under valued composer.Finney is quite likeable, while a young and fiery Harden leaves quite the impression in the only major female role. Polito is a scene stealing live wire, in contrast to the more icy cold Freeman as the brutish Dane. John Turturro is highly effective playing Vernas' brother Bernie, a truly wretched weasel if ever there was one. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Mike Starr, Steve Buscemi, Olek Krupa, Michael Jeter, and Michael Badalucco.A good, well-told, potent story of friendship, loyalty, and survival instinct, with characters doing whatever they have to do to get by.Look for Sam Raimi, a longtime friend of Joel and Ethan, and Joels' wife Frances McDormand, in quick cameos.Eight out of 10.",

The film has an intricate plot, and many people will find that characteristic very appealing, but the many intricate plot twists and character decisions somehow do not seem to spring naturally from either the characters or events on screen.This disconnect is an odd thing to see, because any, or at least most, individual scenes from the film are more or less viable and reasonable in and of themselves, but taken as a whole, you can see the puppet strings of the movie yanking the characters this way and that to achieve complexity and surprise. Because of this, while much of the acting is good, it feels false in context, with scenes failing to synchronize with one another, and with the only realistic characters, considering an individual performance as a whole, being the simple and somewhat stereotypical ones. If you are sensitive to this disconnect, you may well dislike the movie, but if you are instead, longing for a complex plot, you may love it.I should note that as usual in a Coen brothers film, the dialog is a treat, but cannot fail to mention that unlike their better known work, you are likely to miss a good deal of it, as the sound quality is not high enough to decipher many a clever comment.All considered, the easiest way of looking at this film is to see it as an early effort, pointing to future greatness perhaps, but not a complete and developed masterpiece.",

The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way.The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of \"Fargo\").A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is).Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose \"Miller's Crossing\" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a \"noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest.\" Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list.Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's \"Glass Key\", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" and Sergio Leon's \"Fistful of Dollars\". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters.How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.",

Gangster iconography meets laser printer, the plot plays out like a self-conscious attempt to capture the labyrinthal tone of early noirs. Characters beg and break down in tears...but we don't care for any of these people. They're robot copies, everything reduced to an aesthetic choice.More than Tarantino, Leone or De Palma, the Coen's are the poster-boys of cut and paste cinema. Their films are exercises in stylistic wit, more a series of vignettes that work in isolation as comedic short films, than any sort of comment on the world. Sample filmmakers, theirs is a cinema that can't look beyond its own stylistic myopia. That they sample legendary directors and iconic films does not by association make them part of that league of talent. And yet...And yet the Coens are honest about their dishonesty. Their films are cartoons, exercises in buffoonery (only a trickster would title a film, \"A Serious Man\"), which tend to wallow in comical nihilism. It's all a game because cinema has become a game. It's all pastiche, because Western cinema has become pastiche. It's nihilistic, because most of American cinema has lost all meaning. So why not wallow in the filth and do it with style? The Coens thus leave us only two choices: revel in their cinematic wit or reproach them for not trying.7.9/10 \u2013 \"Miller's Crossing\" has two great sequences, but it's also one of the Coens' most smug pictures, its overly glossy look (shades of \"Road to Perdition\") and heavily stylized dialogue diluting any long-lasting imapct. Worth two viewings.",

I'll admit I'm not that big a fan of Gangster films they have to really grab my attention to get me excited, but Miller's Crossing was one of those. Gabriel Byrne's magnificent portrayal of Tom Reagan is one for the record books as one of the greatest Gangster performances of all time, and I found his friendship with Albert Finney|Leo| to be wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. The double-crossing, the twists, and just the way that Tom had a heart of gold unlike most of the gangsters truly amazed me. I had many favorite scenes in this movie, but the best had to be when Bernie|Turturro| was in the woods with a gun to his head by Tom, it was really an effective scene that I won't spoil any more. I've found The Godfather overrated, along with many other Gangster films they bore me, but Miller's Crossing is truly one of a kind, and I loved every minute of it.Performances. Gabriel Byrne gives a performance for the ages as Tom Reagan. This guy has always flew under the Radar, but with this performance it makes him legendary, and rightfully so. His hard as nails act, with a heart of a gold underneath was really something special. Marcia Gay Harden is terrific as Verna. She is classy and I loved her sass. John Turturro is a revelation as Bernie. His Weaselish antics were great and made for memorable moments. Jon Polito is chilling as Johnny Caspar. His constant shouting, and his intense performance was great. Albert Finney is classy and great as Leo.Bottom line. Miller's Crossing is a film not to be missed if you love Gangster movies. It's authentic feel will pull you in quickly and not let go until the end. See it! 9/10",

Finney's character has a smart advisor (Gabriel Byrne), Polito's has a stone cold killer for an enforcer (J.E. Freeman), and Turturro's has a sister (Marcia Gay Harden) who sleeps with Finney to help protect her brother.All six of these characters are sharks who talk about friendship and loyalty, but we get the idea they might do anything to help themselves. Despite the fantastic moments Finney has in response to an attack on him at home, they are all flawed, and far from the all-powerful mobsters you might see in other films. Byrne's drinks and gambling too much and he takes quite a few beatings, despite being the lead character. Turturro's ethics flip on and off like a light switch (what a brilliant succession of scenes he has), and his sister's understated lust knows no bounds, apparently broaching her own brother in the past. The film is also cynical (and subversive) in showing the mayor and the chief of police to be hapless and in the thrall of the criminal element.While there is quite a bit of manipulation and double-crossing which give the film a certain density, the plot is isn't difficult to follow. It moves from one dramatic moment to the next with good pace while maintaining its logic, and without us really knowing where it's heading. The banter and the slang are entertaining too. It certainly feels like an updated noir film, and it does the genre proud.",

The main lead is a character named Tom Reagan who starts out as the right hand man for his boss Leo. Now Leo O'Bannon is one of the coolest mob boss in film history. Sure he gets his hands dirty but he treats the people that work for him right and he does have a heart. Well at least a heart when it comes to gangster bosses anyways. Anyways Tom is a smart, cunning skimmer that is a bit over his head. But also has this charisma and pretentious loyalty which leads him to be liked highly by whoever hires him. He is also has this bad boy persona that women find irresistible and keeps his cool for the most part. He is also very good at manipulation. He is a gambler that takes huge risks with his life and act cool continuously like he doesn't give a crap (which is another reason why some women find him irresistible). In another words he is a good bluffer, which is few of the reasons why you would want him to be on your team while also not wanting him on your team. The reason why I go about Tom's personality is because his personality plays a pivotal role in the plot. And when he sleeps with his boss's twist which leads things to intertwine and sets off in a very different path than what could of been. That acting for the most part is done quite well in this, but that also has to do with the well written dialogue and direction. The ending is pretty gritty, bleak and stays far away from the warm heartfelt wrap up. \"Nobody knows anybody, not that well\".9/10",

Second, seeing this as film noir, with Tom as the typical anti-hero shows that we have to classify every film by the terms we are comfortable with. Finally, Tom is one of the most complex characters I've seen in film. Why? Because he's real. It reminds me a bit of the American Splendor comics and film where Pekar don't have to give a happy ending, a sad ending, clear symbolism, a strong message. Just a story even if it does not \"fit\" into what we expect from books, films, magazines, etc. Tom is one of my favorite characters and I still don't understand him and neither do you. This along with everything people have commented on (dialog, editing, characters, etc.) make the film in my opinion one of THE greatest films period. What makes Godfather better? Brando's tired speeches? This is a flick you can watch over and over and I stand by those who respect the genius of this film.

Better even than Reservoir Dogs, I'd say...which is a great film too, but just not nearly the same caliber as this.In a nutshell, the whole movie is about loyalty, and the affect it has on Tom Reagan, as well as everyone else around him. Tom is the central character in this story, and we basically get to experience this movie in his shoes (or wearing his hat, which would be a more appropriate analogy, and you'll understand why I say this after watching the film). In fact, I can probably count on one hand the number of scenes that Tom Reagan (played masterfully by Gabriel Byrne) does NOT appear in.I won't go into great detail, because the story is full of subtleties...things that you won't notice even after seeing the movie several times. I think that's why I put it so high in my mind as a work of cinematic art. There has ALWAYS been something new that I discovered upon each viewing that I didn't see before, so the complexities of the story make it vastly more entertaining that, say, Titanic or some other Hollywood schlock that's being peddled in theaters. Which is probably why this film did poorly when it was first released, I didn't even see it until it came out on cable a year later.The script is truly marvelous, and the snappy dialog hearkens back to the good old days of gangster films from the 30s with great actors such as James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Bogart. In fact, go get the Warner Bros. Gangster Classics Box set before you see this film...it'll give you a better appreciation of this film, in many different ways (the wise-cracks, the over-the-top gun battles, etc.). The only way the Coen Brothers could pay greater homage to the old gangster classics would have been to have filmed Miller's Crossing in black and white...which they didn't need to do anyway, this film just can't be beat in it's set design and imagery.Oddly enough, there is almost no gratuitous sex in this mildly R-rated film...it's all implied, which is a nice touch given the way most R-rated films just give in to rampant sex and violence, just for the sake of being able to do it. Even the violence (which some posts have alluded to as excessive) just doesn't even compare with what most folks see on screen today...but that just it, the Coen Brothers use sex and violence in a subtle way that enhances (not detracts) from the film. We know more about what people feel about each other rather than just get to see to sweaty bodies going at it in bed. Don't get me wrong, I think sex and violence in adult films is not a bad thing...I just hate it when filmmakers just throw it in as a way of pleasing the crowd, especially when they don't show the consequences of what sex and violence can bring about in our society.Anyway, I could go on and on...go BUY (not rent) this film, it'll be the best clearance-rack DVD you'll ever own!",

We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves.Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all?We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds.

It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink.So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday.

            "content": "One of our first glimpses of \"Miller's Crossing\" is the stunning image of a worn black fedora coming to a rest in the middle of a forest, before a gust of wind sweeps it up and sends it sailing down an avenue of trees. Later in the film, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) recalls a dream he once had, in which he is walking through the woods and he loses his hat in the wind. So this is his dream, his nightmare perhaps. In his dream, he doesn't chase the hat, Tom firmly asserts: \"Nothing more foolish than a man chasin' his hat.\" What is the importance of this hat? Could it represent his self-respect? We notice that Tom loses his hat whenever he is in a vulnerable state: At a drunken card game, already with a hefty debt to dangerous people, Tom wages him hat and loses it. As a bloodthirsty hit man prepares to kill him, Tom's hat is cast aside. As a former friend pounds away at his face with heavy fists, Tom fumbles to keep the hat within his grasp. However, perhaps there is a much simpler explanation for the hat's prominent inclusion in the film:JOEL COEN: \"Everybody asks us questions about that hat, and there isn't any answer really. It's not a symbol, it doesn't have any particular meaning...\" ETHAN COEN: \"The hat doesn't \"represent\" anything, it's just a hat blown by the wind.\" JOEL COEN: It's an image that came to us, that we liked, and it just implanted itself. It's a kind of practical guiding thread, but there's no need to look for deep meanings.\" (excerpt: \"Joel & Ethan Coen: Blood Siblings\")Nevertheless, the unforgettable image of the hat dancing away in the wind is a poignant and fascinating one, whether or not the Coens intended anything significant by its inclusion. The film is positively brimming with stunningly beautiful moments and, indeed, cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld himself declared that the film must have a \"handsome\" look to it, as opposed to the wacky, energetic camera movements of such previous Coen films as \"Raising Arizona.\"The script, as always with the Coen brothers' films, is brilliantly written. Many critics have often complained that, though well-written, their dialogue comes across as unrealistic, and ultimately as though it has, indeed, been written. I don't really believe that this is relevant \u0096 this is merely Joel and Ethan Coen's style; they do not strive for realism in their films, only for delicately-scripted, immensely watchable entertainment. The plot of Miller's Crossing is not really very dissimilar to many other Prohibition-era crime dramas, but the Coens have most certainly made this film their own, despite several respectful homages to other classic films in the genre. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, \"The Usual Suspects\"), the adviser to an aging crime boss, Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney, \"Big Fish\"), does not quite fit into the world of organised crime and political corruption \u0096 he possesses a good brain, but completely lacks any heart. In a profession when \"friendships,\" loyalty and ethics are so important in staying alive, Tom is uncertain of his ultimate place in society.The acting in this film is wonderful, with each of the actors taking full advantage of another snappy Coen brothers script. Byrne, with his perfectly-fitting Irish accent, does a good job of portraying a complex character, in the process taking more unchallenged beatings than perhaps any other film character in history. Finney is brilliant as a Leo, with one of the most memorable scenes in the film arising when two fully-equipped hit men arrive at his home to assassinate him. Demonstrating admirable quick-thinking and agility, the aging Leo shows that he, indeed, \"can still trade body-blows with any man in this town,\" being quite an artist with the Tommy gun. Jon Polito is suitably crazy, powerful, stupid and threatening as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival crime boss in the town, as is J.E. Freeman as Caspar's merciless henchman, known as \"The Dane.\" Marcia Gay Harden is also very good as Verna Bernbaum, Leo's (and occasionally Tom's) girl. However, full accolades are awarded to a mesmerising John Turturro (\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\") as the slimy, double-crossing bookie, Bernie. The harrowing scene in which Tom leads Bernie into the woods at Miller's Crossing to be \"whacked,\" is a triumph of astonishing film-making and acting.It is unfortunate that \"Miller's Crossing\" is an often-overlooked Coen brothers film, especially as I consider it their finest film to date. Brilliantly evoking time and place, and bustling with style and substance and everything else we've come to expect in our films, here is a gem that deserves to be seen and appreciated by more people. It's only fair. \"I'm talking' about friendship. I'm talking' about character. I'm talking' about hell. I ain't embarrassed to use the word - I'm talking' about ethics!\"",

            "content": "SPOILERS.Gabriel Byrne's hat plays an important part in this movie. When he is about to be killed, an assassin takes the hat and scales it into the woods. When he's about to kill someone else and is wearing only his underwear, he grabs his gun and his hat and races outside. The last shot of the movie has Byrne pulling hit hat brim down low over his eyes then slowly raising his face to stare at a departing friend. In fact, everybody's hat is kind of important. We see the hat of a dead person half way down the stairs before the camera shows us the body at the top. Jokes are made about people's heads having outgrown their hats. A pudgy gangster keeps complaining about his rivals giving him \"the high hat.\"Obviously the hat seems to \"stand for\" something but I'm not sure what. Lives? Maybe. But in fact I couldn't follow the plot either, and I kept getting the names of the characters mixed up except for a few of the most important. The plot is all twists and turns, as stylized as the dialogue -- \"twist,\" \"bumped off,\" \"yegg,\" \"roscoe.\" The whole thing could have been lifted out of, or turned into, an old comic book, perhaps \"Crime Does Not Pay,\" which I remember from childhood.And, as in a comic book, it's hard to care much about who gets \"leaned on\" or \"bumped off\" since they're all cartoons anyway. Not that the story or the film is designed to be realistic. There isn't nearly as much blood as in most gangster movies. And Byrne takes several poundings, any one of them enough to hospitalize a rhinoceros, without any sequelae more than a bit of a wince as he struggles to rise from the floor.I guess, though, that I didn't want Byrne to get \"bumped off.\" I don't know why. Maybe it's his homely face and tragic demeanor, which made it easy for me to identify with him. With that mournful visage he should run for elective office -- maybe president of the United States. He'd at least have the political cartoonist vote in his pocket. And I suppose too that I was glad to see Albert Finney survive in one piece. He's a decent dramatic actor but he has an outstanding way with comedy. (That droll American accent.) And he must have a good sense of humor too, without any pride to speak of. When Byrne bursts into a lady's room he shouts that the other gals should get out. One of the \"gals\" in the background is Finney dressed in a maid's costume. He makes a hurried sign of the cross and rushes out along with the other girls. He also has a line, \"Dis is da kissoff,\" which is a repeat of a line he had in \"Two for the Road,\" some 30 years earlier. How can you not want a guy like that to survive? That line isn't the film's only link to the past. One character's name is Judy Barton. And an inconspicuous poster informs us that Lars Thorwald, a prize fighter, will be featured in an upcoming bout.So anyway I couldn't follow the plot exactly. But looked at as an exercise is stylization this is a pretty good movie. A good deal of imagination has gone into it, the dialogue, the location shooting, and especially the direction. I don't just mean bravura jump cuts or negative shots or simple-minded tactics that are meant to draw attention to themselves. I mean more subtle stuff, of which I will give just one example. While two henchmen wait on the road, Byrne marches Turturro into the woods to kill him. Turturro gets on his knees and begs for his life. Byrne, realizing that NOT killing Turturro is likely to get HIM killed, nevertheless relents. Turturro stumbles off into the woods and there is a long shot of Byrne standing alone among the longleaf pine. There is a slow dissolve and Byrne's figure is replaced exactly on screen by the figures of the two henchmen back on the road, standing next to their car, and choking with laughter.This is by no means a perfect movie, but it is a perfect original. And we give Academy Awards to blockbusting by-the-numbers disasters like \"Titanic.\"",

Never before in another mob film have these themes been so deeply explored than in Miller's Crossing, a Coen Brothers film mostly forgotten today but must stand as one of the very best of its genre of the last fifty years.Of all the elements of this film, I can only say that those that make it so strong are also the ones to be criticized the most. For my money, the plot is confusing but not hard to follow as it weaves and twists into a nicely convoluted story about a man double-crossing and being double-crossed involving nearly every gangster in town until it all comes together in the end. The dialog is unbelievable in the way it is both fun to listen to and very strong in establishing the characters speaking it. This was certainly a breakthrough film for the Coens in that they began to bring a certain polished professional touch to their films to go along with their usual indie swagger and style.Here, the elements come together, with the cinematography wonderfully capturing the Prohibition era and the camera work reserved but effective. The acting is superb; Gabriel Byrne is a true leading man whether he gets those roles or not. Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, Jon Polito and John Turturro all do their part and the result is staggering in the way it demands complete attention from the audience not just to follow the plot, but also to contemplate and understand the motivation of these people.There is certainly more here than meets the eye, but that is the beauty of all the Coen's films. Joel and Ethan have always been a team able to go above and beyond what we expect and stimulate us with something totally new and original. Here, we get an old-fashioned story-type brought to life with a twist. It truly is something to see and see again.",

Fellow mobster Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) approaches Leo to inform him that he intends to kill Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) for interfering in his match-fixing racket. Leo tells Johnny to back off as Bernie is paying Leo protection money, but Johnny refuses to back down resulting in the two mobsters going to war with each other. Tom unwittingly finds himself in the middle of the two mobsters doing his best to try and keep the peace (and more importantly stay alive).Miller's Crossing had an excellent sounding premise and has an impressive 5 star rating so therefore I fully expected that I would like it, but then again it is a Coen brothers film and I did wonder if the brothers would serve up yet another disappointment, and sadly, at least as far as I'm concerned they did...Let's begin with the positives; firstly, this film, like many Coen brothers films is exceptionally well-made; the camera work, editing, photography, costume and set-designs are flawless and it really is a handsome looking picture. The principal cast are all excellent (especially Finney and Polito) and the Coen's have really gone to town to get the best out of their cast - the film has a real authenticity about it and all the actors look, sound and act like mobsters from the era so full credit to the Coens in all of these respects. However...Once again, I'm finding myself with another Coen brothers film with a disappointingly weak, meandering and generally uninteresting narrative. When watching a lot of their films, it does feel like they're more concerned in their films looking good rather than actually being good by developing a strong narrative. In Miller's crossing, the Coen's move from story arc to story arc and from person to person without giving the story or characters much room to breathe. In essence what you get is some fighting, some arguing, some tough-talking, some he said she said BS and that's about it. None of the characters have any real depth or development and are completely uninteresting and as a result of all of this I found the story dull and found that I didn't care about any of the characters - to be honest the film went round the houses so often that I forgot who was playing what character half the time - to me they were just names that were shouted out on the screen.With a more involving story and with stronger and deeper characterisation this would have been formidable, but as it is Miller's crossing is another rather mediocre entry for the Coen brothers which deserves credit for its technical greatness and strong acting performances, but loses a lot of points for its rather laborious and uninteresting story.",

            "content": "I first came across the Coen brothers when I caught Blood Simple on late-night TV. There was one scene in that which made me laugh out loud (when one character drives into the middle of nowhere to bury a body and has done so by dawn, only for a moment or two to discover that he can't start his car and might be stranded: try convincing the cops who find you in the middle of nowhere next to a freshly dug grave that your are guilty of nothing). The film's elaborate plot, the double-crossing and double-double-crossing also impressed me at the time. I then saw Miller's Crossing and remember also being impressed. Next came Raising Arizona which did rather less for me (and I don't very much like Nicolas Cage). After that, in no particular order were The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink and Fargo. I admired Fargo - the Coen's are nothing if not stylish - but I didn't like the way the William Macy character, a schmuck in trouble who gets in way out of his depth, was the butt of the jokes. It was like getting easy laughs from teasing the fat kid in class and as, for a while, I thought of myself as 'the fat kid' - I wasn't half as fat as I thought, but I wasn't very slim, either - I didn't like it. I saw a couple more Coen brothers movies after that, for example The Big Lebowski and, more recently No Country For Old Men, but I found I had unwittingly joined the small club of those who aren't quite as impressed with Ethan and Joel Coen as so obviously Ethan and Joel are. Why not? I think it might be because, as one critic I read said of Fargo, they are heartless. There is cleverness galore in their films but each film lacks something essential to a great film. For my money the Coens are good at making good-looking films but those films are never as good as they might be. They seem more an exercise in Ethan and Joel demonstrating what smart kids they are than anything else. A year or two ago, I saw Blood Money again and it wasn't quite as good as I had remembered it. Miller's Crossing is rather the same: yes, you keep watching because - well, these lads make technically good films. But once the credits roll, you find you don't give a hoot. Miller's Crossing has another Coen-manufactured intricate plot, but it is all rather pointless. It is rather like watching a busy junction from an aesthetic vantage point: interesting enough for a while if you've got nothing better to do, but it eventually dawns on you you might well have quite a number of better things to do. Sorry, but I just don't think Miller's Crossing is all that good.",

I suspect he is a fan of the old black and whites and so he believes this is a spoof of them which it is most certainly not. This is a pure drama with perfect dialog and excellent acting all around. The film basically tells the events that unfold around a Gangland war between the Irish and Italian mobs of the late 20s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom, Leo's (Albert Finney) right hand man and adviser who disagrees with his boss's decision to protect the conman brother (John Turturro) of his girlfriend Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) and must work his own wily methods to protect Leo from this decision.This is a masterpiece of modern film and definitely shows that the Cohen brothers can do anything with film. The dialog and accents are all perfectly executed in vintage 20s style and flare, the sets are absolutely beautiful and the costume work is so good you almost feel like you stepped back in time. Anyone who doesn't love this film should go back and try watching it again. The musical score alone is enough to make it worth while.",

Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching.Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.",

Trouble is brewing between Leo and another mob boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), over the activities of a bookie, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) and Leo and Tom are at odds on how to deal with it. Meanwhile, Tom is in a secret relationship with Leo's girlfriend, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), who happens to be the sister of Bernie. In trying to resolve the issue, Tom is cast out from Leo's camp and ultimately finds himself stuck in the middle between several deadly, unforgiving parties.Fantastic storytelling from Joel and Ethan Coen. Clever, complex plot. Good ramping up of the intrigue, tension and claustrophobia as the movie goes on. You can feel how Tom is being hemmed in from all sides and how no matter which way he turns somebody is going to be out to kill him.Some good comedic moments too. Wonderful camera-work and cinematography. The forest scenes are particularly beautiful and haunting. The score helps there too.Great performances all round. Gabriel Byrne gets the icy coolness and wise cracking of Tom down perfectly, like he was Humphrey Bogart and this was a Sam Spade/Micky Spillane movie. The other standout performance is John Turturro as Bernie - his under-pressure hysterics are something to behold.A wonderful modern film noir-type movie, and who better to do it than the Coen Brothers. Until this movie they had shown, with Blood Simple and Raising Arizona, that they could make good movies, but there was a spark of genius missing. With this, their third movie, they showed they could make GREAT movies, movies that were incredible works of art. And it didn't end here. After this they would scale even greater heights with movies that rank among some of the best the world has ever seen - The Big Lebowski, Fargo and No Country for Old Men.",

            "content": "With \"Miller's Crossing\" Joel Coen and Ethan Coen made a gangster film masterpiece and arguably one of the best films of the 1990s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, the right hand man of prohibition era crime boss Leo O'Bannon, Albert Finney in a lion of a performance. The plot is far too complicated and serpentine to summarize in a few sentences, but essentially Tom finds himself between to rival gangs, ALA Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" or James M. Cain's \"Love's Lovely Counterfeit.\" \"Miller's Crossing\" is a beautiful homage to so many films, but manages to also become something wholly original. The Coen Brothers have taken genre archetypes and touchstones and make them completely their own. Handsomely shot by by ace cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (\"Raising Arizona,\" \"Big,\" \"Misery\") and bolstered by a lush Irish tinged score by composer Carter Burwell, the film would be worth watching simply for its rich production values, but it offers so much more. The film bristle with cracking dialogue that can be classic tough guy noir:Eddie Dane: You understand that if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.Or funny:Tom Reagan: I am awake.\nTad: Your eyes are shut.\nTom Reagan: Who you gonna believe?Or deep:Tom Reagan: Nobody knows anybody. Not that well.To even heartbreaking:Verna: I thought you said you didn't care about Leo no more.\nTom Reagan: I said we're through. That's not the same thing.The story is as cleverly serpentine as the best Dashille Hammett or Raymond Chandler novel, but unlike many throwback gangster or noir films, this film tells it story with a heavy reliance on visuals, where the audience shown things, whether it's a look or a slow pan across an object, rather than an over reliance on telling the audience everything, which makes this film an experience of pure cinema. The film also excels in characterization. There's not a single character in the film who does not see themselves as a the hero of their own story. It didn't strike me until repeated viewing that the seemingly villainous Johnny Casper is really a hapless victim. From the opening scene he is completely honest and open about his intentions and consistently sticks to his word. Ethics! The one character with zero ethics, John Turturro's Bernie Bernbaum. He's true to himself, which is being unashamedly out for himself. Or take the menacing Eddie Dane, who is nearly right almost all along and reads the situation just about perfectly. I've always felt the best films don't have black hat villains and have characters who are all the heroes of their own story, and \"Miller's Crossing\" is a great example of this. Overall, I will make the bold pronouncement that this film is one of the best film of the 1990s and is the best gangster films of all-time.",

            "content": "Dark, brooding and full of intrigue, \"Miller's Crossing\" was the third movie to be written, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen and in the opinion of many, was also their best. It's certainly good to watch because of its rather involved story, its eccentric characters and the droll humour that's such a trademark of the Coens' work. Typically, for a gangster movie, no-one can be trusted and there are plenty of betrayals, double crosses and deceptions. More surprisingly, however, there are also some occasions where certain individuals, uncharacteristically, show genuine loyalty and aspire to act ethically.In the late 1920s, Irish mobster Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) who has both the Police Chief and the Mayor on his payroll, is also the de facto political leader of an unnamed Eastern city in the United States. In his day to day work he values the sound advice that he's regularly given by his friend and fellow gangster, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) but when he's visited by his rival, an Italian mobster called Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), a situation arises in which he feels unable to follow Tom's advice.Leo learns that a bookie called Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) has routinely been disclosing information about Casper's fixed fights to other gamblers and in order to stop the losses that he's been suffering; Casper is intent on eliminating Bernie without delay. When Leo says that Bernie pays for protection and isn't to be touched, Casper becomes both furious and frustrated. The real reason that Leo doesn't agree to the hit is because Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is his mistress. Tom tries to get Leo to change his mind by telling him that Verna is a grifter who's just using him but Leo isn't prepared to listen.Everything changes after a failed hit on Leo triggers a gang war. Tom discloses that he's having an affair with Verna and then also switches sides to work with Casper. In order to prove his loyalty to his new boss, Tom is ordered to kill Bernie and although he makes it look as if he's done so, he actually lets the treacherous bookie go. This proves to be a bad move because the fact that the hit was not witnessed, puts Tom in a tight spot when he gets targeted by Casper's sadistic henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) and blackmailed by Bernie. Furthermore, in order to end the gang war and settle a few scores in the process, Tom not only manipulates the events that follow so expertly that he achieves his various aims but also does so in a way that unequivocally proves his loyalty to Leo.Jon Polito is terrific as the hot-headed Casper who despairs at the lack of ethics that he encounters in his business dealings and says \"if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?\". Marcia Gay Harden does well as the heartless, two-timing Verna and John Turturro is brilliant as the repulsive Bernie. Albert Finney as the tough gangster who shows more humanity than most and Gabriel Byrne as the story's great schemer, are also both perfect in their lead roles.\"Miller's Crossing\" is very stylish, well-written and features some magnificent cinematography which as well as being aesthetically pleasing, contributes so much to the atmosphere of the piece. What makes it most absorbing, however, is the quality of its story and the idiosyncrasies of its characters.",

His friend and counsel advises against this stance, which leads to their falling out and the rival gangster taking control and hiring the counsel to work for him. His first assignment is to kill the bookie. This tangled web of different agendas leads ultimately to double-crossing and murder.I've seen tens of thousands of movies, and can count on my fingers the number which were near-perfect. This is one of them. Technically, every aspect of the production is perfect - the period sets and costumes unobtrusively drip with style, Barry Sonnenfeld's photography is incredibly classy and Carter Burwell's rich, spare score, with its haunting flute theme, is one of the most memorable musical motifs ever to grace the screen. The cast are similarly wonderful. Byrne's complex, thoughtful portrayal of a man torn between loyalty to his friend and to himself is as rich a leading man as I can think of in any movie. Finney and Polito as the rival gangsters give two memorable and thoroughly contrasting performances, Harden is terrific as the moll, Turturro chews the scenery with relish as the jumpy bookie and Freeman is incredibly scary as the toughest, meanest gangster in any movie, bar none. But the real genius of this film is the writing and direction by the Coen brothers, which manages to simultaneously break lots of rules and yet deliver a film steeped in genre tradition. Their characters are simply unique. Tom Regan, the \"hero\", is a one-of-a-kind in modern films; a man who does not know his own nature and is figuring it out as he goes. The dialogue is quite simply the most consistently witty, brilliantly stylised and endlessly quotable I've ever heard in any movie (\"I get you smart guy, I know what you are. Straight as a corkscrew. Mr Inside-Outsky. Like a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders from Yegg Central.\"). This is one of those films where every element blends seamlessly into a beautiful work of art. It's a piece of pure poetry both visually and aurally, a fantastic story, a poignant character study, a rich and multi-layered thematic puzzle, and an unforgettable film, made by and for lovers of pure cinema.",

Byrne, Finney, Turturro, Harden and J.E. Freeman (as a fearsome thug) are all excellent; the stand-out is a deliciously hammy Polito as the puffy, sweaty, jovial boss with a huge chip on his shoulder and a comical obsession to run his business with an appearance of \"ethics\".Structure is interesting - the Coens introduce a relationship or a scene, then repeat it later but with a crucial spin. The interplay between Leo and Tom mirrors the one between Caspar and his right-hand man Dane; twice a man wanders through the woods at Miller's Crossing, once to kill, once to be killed; twice a man begs for his life on his knees; the various political figures, like a Greek choir of sycophants, bounce between Leo and Caspar as the power balance shifts. And the key dynamic of the main triangle is not Tom and Leo fighting for Verna's affection, but rather Tom and Verna fighting for Leo's.Then there is the Coens' genius for subverting expectations. Small moments become memorable: when Tom is awaiting a beating, he is left alone with a huge thug, who walks ominously towards him. Tom smacks him with a chair; the thug, shocked and offended, stomps out of the room holding his bloody nose, then a smaller, older guy storms in and knocks Tom out. The overall effect is darkly humorous, surprising, engrossing.9/10",

Things get ugly when Leo gets into a disagreement with an Italian under-boss who feels that he is getting a raw deal. Things also get more complicated when Tom falls in love with Leo's woman. Sooner or later Tom's going to have to decide who's side he's on and who his enemies really are. All of this leads to an uncontrollable scenario with the signature Coen twists and surprises. The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as the cold and heartless Tom, who always has something smart or sarcastic to say. There is no way I could see anybody else playing the role. It suits him that well. Turturro has some of the best moments. First when he begs for his life, and then when he cynically tries to quote his begging to save himself again. One of his better roles, I think. Everybody else in it is also terrific.A few brief words about some of the other elements of production. Barry Sonnenfeld's sure-footed photography, as always, is smooth and steady where appropriate, and frenetic where necessary. The set design and costuming make for such an astonishing illusion that were this not a color film, you might actually forget that it was released 9 and not 69 years ago. And even the sound from the music (diegetic and otherwise) to the crystal-clear sound effects that pierce the visual and draw you in by the ears, like they're supposed to is a presence in its own right throughout the film. I mean, when was the last time ice cubes dropping into an old-fashioned glass or the wringing out of an alcohol-soaked rag into a tinny dish felt truly woven into the designed effect of a scene in a movie?

            "content": "\"Millers Crossing\", directed by Joel Coen and written by Joel and Ethan Coen is arguably one of the most gorgeous films from the gangster genre ever made. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is the right hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), who is the reigning crime boss in an unnamed town in the 1930's. Hot on Leo's heels for control of the town is Johnny Caspar (John Polito), and to make matters worse, Leo is making bad decisions regarding crooked booker Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), whom Caspar wants dead. We find out that Leo is keeping Bernie protected because he is involved with Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). However, when it is revealed that Tom and Verna are an item, Leo and Tom break ties, resulting in Tom trying to play both sides against each other in order to ensure his own survival.While \"Millers Crossing\" does not yet show the signature eccentricities of their later films, the Coen brothers' dark humor is definitely present, as is their unabashed use of violence. Their excellent use of music in their films is on prominent display here, particularly in the incredible \"Danny Boy\" sequence that I remember rewinding several times the first few times I rented the movie years ago. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is beautiful, whether it is a forest scene or simply a short scene in Tom's apartment. The acting of the primaries, some of them later becoming Coen brothers regulars is excellent, particularly Turturro's performance. It was this film that put him on my radar and I have subsequently looked out for his work since then.I first saw this film in the theater because it was a gangster flick, and I have always been a fan of that genre. \"Millers Crossing\" was the first Coen brothers' film that I had ever seen, and even back in high school when I saw this one for the first time, I knew that they were special filmmakers. While not on the same level of oddity as David Lynch, they don't shy away from including bizarre moments (the goon in the chair screaming over and over for no discernible reason). Films like \"Millers Crossing\", viewed while in my mid-teens certainly cultivated my later love for alternative cinema and made me a near-obsessive fan of the Coen brothers' work, an obsession that continues to this day. 9/10 --Shelly",

            "content": "It would be so convenient to label \"Miller's Crossing\" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody \u0085 except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film.Indeed,\"Miller's crossing\" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of \"Miller's Crossing\" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in \"Miller's Crossing\", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why \"Miller's Crossing\" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance.And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish \"Barton Fink\" before getting back to \"Miller's Crossing\", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching \"Miller's Crossing\" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion.Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi.That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark \"Yojimbo\", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in \"The Godfather\" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes.And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in \"Barton Fink\". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in \"Miller's Crossing\" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny.And \"Miller's Crossing\" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : \"Goodfellas\", \"The Godfather Part III\", \"The King of New York\". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' \"Road to Perdition\", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making \"Miller's Crossing\" a sacred intersection between life and death \u0085 and nothing else mattered.",

            "review_title": "The Coen Brother's Take on the Gangster Genre!",
            "content": "To be honest, I did not truly understand or rightfully digest Miller's Crossing until hours and even days after I watched the film for the very first time. Going into the film, I knew it was a Coen Brothers film and was about gangsters. That's all I knew. Would it be compared to Goodfellas (which ironically was released the same weekend in 1990) or The Godfather? The opening scene where the two gang (Irish versus Italian) rivals met actually was an homage to the Francis Ford Coppola classic. In hindsight, I learned what a powerful film this was. It is a Coen Brothers film in every sense. That means sharp, lyrical dialogue, impressive if slightly oddball characters, and a style unique to the Coen Brothers. The cinematography from Barry Sonnenfeld is very impressive. The sequence with Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro in the forest is a sweat-inducing example of how Sonnenfeld shot the film. Being labeled as a gangster film, I was mildly surprised about the lack of action sequences. There are some, yes, including a fiery shootout with Albert Finney, but the Coens used their words to craft the story. Do be warned. When violence occurs, it is abrupt and sudden. That adds to the power of the story. When you have the head of the Italian gang talking about \"business ethics,\" you might want to put your thinking caps on. The Coens have their obvious gangster film influences, particularly from those made in the 1930's, but they also have their film noir influences. If anything, this film is a film noir packaged up as a gangster film. The film goes at its own pace and the Coens embellish in their style. People expecting something a la Goodfellas should prepare for disappointment. I originally felt let down, but the power of the Coens got to me in hindsight.The Coen Brothers last film was the delightfully quirky Raising Arizona. If anyone can maintain that level of quirkiness despite a complete 180-degree genre shift, it is Joel and Ethan Coen. I would not necessarily say humor is prevalent, but it has a similar tone. These characters are more oddball than one would expect in something like...The Godfather. Yet, there are scenes of tension that rank with the best of them, especially that forest scene. I was ready to say goodbye to John Turturro's character immediately. But the Coens, of course, are smarter than that. Goes to show how masterful they are at writing and directing scenes. It is impressive they were able to complete this dense script. They had to put the script aside because of writer's block. Before they came back to this script, they wrote their next movie about a guy who has writer's block in a span of three weeks. I know some people were irked but I liked how the film's location was unknown. It was shot in New Orleans given its Prohibition-era architecture. In addition, this is a fine character study. It is about one man, Tom, who has no ambition or drive. It is about a man who plays both sides because he wants to. He uses intelligence rather than violence. He has an ambiguous moral code. And, of course, a woman is involved. A woman that drives the deeds of the Irish boss.In this unknown city, all we know is that there is the gang war that takes place in the 1930's. Leo (Albert Finney) and his lieutenant Tom (Gabriel Byrne) control the city. Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) heads the Italian gang and drives for power. He approaches Leo to ask to kill lowlife swarm Bernie (John Turturro). Leo says no which upsets Tom. From Leo's viewpoint, Bernie is Verna's (Marcia Gay Harden) brother. Verna is Leo's girl, so we see the conundrum here. It turns out that Tom was fooling around with Verna and is kicked out of the mob. Because of boredom, he decides to join Caspar's gang. He arouses Caspar's right-hand man, Eddie Dane's(J. E. Freeman) suspicion when he discovers he still contacts Verna and Bernie. Dane grows even more suspicious when Tom is personally ordered to kill Bernie. But did that really happen?The Coen Brothers are able to make sharp, cynical screenplays but the actors need to breathe the words to life. They do more than that here. Gabriel Byrne never has been better. The film revolves around his character, and he has some fascinating arcs. His character is not out of place in a Humphrey Bogart film-noir. In a sense, this role reminded me of some of Bogart's more complex roles. Thankfully, Byrne is surrounded by a competent supporting cast. Bernie is written for John Turturro's capabilities! He is swarmy, a coward, and an important humor source. I did like Albert Finney's charismatic performance, even if his character is a little too na\u00efve for my liking.Coming off a successful picture in Raising Arizona, the Coen Brothers shifted gears to create a compelling gangster drama that requires patience. They maintained their style that gotten them popular in Hollywood. The cinematography is important for the storytelling (that forest scene, I tell ya). Let's not forget Carter Burwell's musical contributions. His score is based off traditional Irish music. Yes, you will hear \"Danny Boy.\" I originally had a sense of disappointment because it is not a quick, right-in-your-face epic like Goodfellas. This is a slow burn that will capture you in a different way.My Grade: B+",

It was especially exciting to watch the characters LEO and CASPER chew up the scenes like Edward G. Robbinson!

Generally speaking, I think the detail to the period was done quite well, but as a story, it lacked the ability to hold my attention. And, the best character was that little chubby, unintelligent kid. He should have been the star of the film. Maybe I will catch this again at some point to see if I feel differently about the film in a second viewing, but I must say that this film really put me off during the first viewing that you'd probably have to tie me down and force my eyes open (think Clockwork Orange) in order to rewatch this film.",

If you bother to do that, you will find it is a well plotted, well shot story that comes as close to a masterpiece as we are likely to get in this post modern age of instant gratification. It is a throwback to the film noir movies of the 1940s where everybody is guilty and there is no happy ending.The plot deals with the war between Irish and Italian gangsters, caused by the Jewish crook Bernie. The crook's affectionate sister Verna is the mistress of Leo, who is the boss of the Irish gang, who consequently opposes to have him killed by the Italians. But Tom Reagan, the old mate of Leo, has different plans......The story is extremely interesting, exciting, entertaining. There are no flaws in the development of the plot, despite its complications (a homage to the intricate classic film-noirs of the Golden Age). The script is sharp, cynical, sarcastic, full of memorable lines and of black sense of humor, with many delightful subtleties: the celebrated Coens wit at its best. The photography is magnificent and very original. The music is great. The action scenes are superbly filmed.Violence explodes suddenly and unexpectedly. The finale is perfect and splendidly crowns the movie.In my modest opinion, this film is the Coen Brothers's greatest achievement to date, even greater than Fargo. Movie buffs are finally \"discovering\" Miller's Crossing, an underground masterpiece that has dwelt in obscurity for so many years.The movie is probably not for those who want something with mile-a-minute pacing, crashes and explosions. I would say Miller's Crossing is the thinking person's gangster movie. It needs repeated viewing and you continue to find more in it the more you watch it.

The brothers Coen downplay their usual bag of camera tricks in favor of clever dialogue and countless double-crosses, loading their plot with so many characters that more than a few get shoved into the background (femme fatale Marcia Gay Hardin, for one). The colorful and lively story is set in a nameless city during an unspecified time of tommy guns and speakeasies, but the film adds nothing new to an already overcrowded tradition except state-of-the-art bloodletting and some oddly anachronistic stereotypes.",

He drinks plenty. He gambles a lot, but he has ethics. He feels like a sawn-off leg. In fact, this film is all about ethics; the ethics of crime, and gangsterism. Unethical gangsters don't last. Many of them are gay. This film was enjoyable and worth a watch, but somehow it didn't fully satisfy.

            "content": "Gangster films, especially ones set in prohibition era, usually follow an archetypal formula to please the masses. But Miller's Crossing is a Coen brothers gangster film, which means expect the unexpected, and get ready to be surprised, weirded out and thinking about it for days after. It exists in a world where there's no bad guys, heroes or even antiheros, just really morally depraved people making bad and worse decisions. The protagonists are callous hard cases and the antagonists are cheerfully psychotic. You might think that would set you up for an out and out action bullet fest with a healthy dose of adrenaline. Again you'd be mistaken, as the Coen's also subvert that clich\u00e9, for something a little moodier, and in the end, far more memorable. Gabriel Byrne broods through his charismatic turn as Irish mob enforcer Tom, a ruthless and enigmatic guy in the employ of crime boss Leo (a blustery, surprisingly sympathetic Albert Finney). Tom is outwardly loyal and perhaps even believes he is to the core, but circumstances have led to him having an an affair with Leo's girl Verna (a young, sultry Marcia Gay Harden). Leo's outfit is currently on the brink of war with the Italian faction of the mafia, led by rabid Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito, frothing at the mouth in the liveliest work of the film). Another bad dude, Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) is also muscling in on action. Freeman was a criminally underrated guy gone way before his time and he's a stone voiced, menacing monster as Dane. John Turturro shows up as usual, playing Verna's brother, a sniveling rat bastard without an honest bone in his body. The scene with him and Byrne in the lonely forest is spine chilling. There's also nice work from Olek Krupa and Steve Buscemi. The words flow with carefully crafted 1930's authenticity, the production design and cinematography hum along splendidly and the actors all knock it straight out of the park. There's several scenes, including a bombastic fistfight and a climactic final shootout that should go down in both gangster movie history, and rate with the Coen's best work. The secret to their success I believe lies in their constant yearning to tell a story naturally, with all the unpredictable little kinks and eccentricities that one might find in real life itself. As we all know, life is always never what it seems, and so much stranger than any film. The Coen's know this, and own it in all their work, even making it readily apparently in a line of dialogue from the trailer: Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems... at Miller's Crossing.",

I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers, and perhaps I expect too much of them. But they also happen to have some of the finest chops in working \"neo-noir\" out with great visuals pizazz and very natural screenplays. Miller's Crossing is a little different though, even as it's through and through one of their movies. This time, for their first time on their only 3rd film, they have here something very polished, with a cast that includes the most powerful of character actors and a star or two. And they even draw influence from Dashiell Hammett from a couple of his novels (Red Harvest one of them). So why does this feel so, well, self-conscious? Even more self-conscious than they usually do I mean? It's probably because at times there's such an icy-cold precision working with these characters, at least through Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), that the nuttiness that makes the film much more entertaining kind of has to muscle in for room. It's an homage that really walks that fine line of becoming too aware of itself, like a superhero constantly adjusting his cape and weapons belt.That's really the only liabilities I felt, or thought, from the film. And maybe it might be better on a repeat viewing (The Man Who Wasn't There, which I thought was very good on a first go-around, now I find to be one of their masterpieces). Still, there's much in the film that kept me watching it till the end. Jon Polito is in one of the very best performances of his entire career- which also includes other stints in Coen brothers pictures- as a half agitated, half talky-chummy kind of 1930s Italian crime boss, who sometimes in-between the problems with the gamblers and Bernie Bernbaum (John Tuturro) has to smack some sense into his pudgy son. But Tuturro too is once again striking some rich material with his performance, who is maybe even more of an ice-cold movie clich\u00e9 gangster than Byrne's character, as the two end up playing each and the other side back and forth. There's also some style from Finney and Marcia Gay Harden too. And some of these set-pieces are real knockouts, such as the shoot-out at Leo's place, or that first major scene in the woods at the crossing.But in the end maybe the only disappointment I could say is that it's so much of a good thing that the Coens almost forget about putting these people in the real world. Everything becomes so much akin to the old movies and novels in the world of Miller's Crossing that the pleasures of watching it- and they are available via Sonnenfeld's camera and the performances- get in danger of putting almost too many words in their mouths, with it being too, well, written out. I recommend it, but not necessarily as the first movie from the brothers, unless you're hankering for some gangster-movie homages all the way down to the cigarettes and Steve Buscemi's bit-part speech.",

Many film classics through the years can leave you confused if you really dissect them afterwords.The story revolves around the central character Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), who is the right hand man to mob boss Leo (Albert Finney).

Casper is not at all happy about this and neither is Tommy and he tries to warn Leo but Leo is smitten and vows to protect his lover's brother.This is where things start to get murky, who is really loyal to who, and why? Leo controls everything in the city but when he narrowly survives assassination, he suddenly starts to lose grip of his power. At one point a cautious Tommy tries talking sense into over-confident Leo with the memorable line \"you run this town because people think you run it, if they stop thinking it, you stop running it\". This is the type of dialog you'd expect from a movie made in the 1940s. Much of Millers Crossing seems like its paying homage to a bygone era of film, the jargon (take your flunky and dangle) the snappy byplay between characters and the emotional flatness of everyone involved...no one in this film seems to be having much fun. But they are fun to watch!I would have to agree that the best scenes of the film are Leo and the \"Danny boy\" scene and the title scene...Bernie's little ride out to Millers crossing. John Turturro is astounding in this scene, but I hate to single out any one actor in Millers Crossing because the whole cast is absolutely perfect.This brings me to my favorite part which is the climactic scene at Casper's house. To me, this is the most intense scene in the movie and actually makes the hairs on my neck stand up! Casper of course leaves us with the immortal words....something he tells all his boys....\"always put one in the brain\".Gotta love it, and yes it was overshadowed by Goodfellas and other films when it was released, but like fine wine the classics always age well....and if you've never seen Millers Crossing I ENVY YOU, because you get the sheer joy of seeing a perfect film for the first time!",

            "content": "An uncredited remake of \"The Glass Key\", the Coen Brothers' 1991 \"Miller's Crossing\" is in a number of ways an astounding film, (certainly one of the Coen Brothers' most tightly knit, narratively), full of black-humorous quirks, such as the marvelous set-piece of Albert Finney as the crime boss turning tables with a tommy-gun on would-be assassins in a car which he calmly follows on foot until at last the car crashes and explodes, while a classic rendition of \"Danny Boy\" plays over the soundtrack.The Coen Brothers' also take a minor scene from the Hammett text - where Ned Beaumont drunkenly gambles away his hat and then has to go hunting for it after he sobers up - and turn it into an over-arching metaphor for the emotional emptiness the anti-hero (marvelously played by Gabriel Byrne) struggles with throughout the narrative and which Hammett left as merely implicit.They also return the ethical bleakness to the finale, without actually duplicating Hammett's - now it is the crime boss who gets the girl and the anti-hero who is left to ponder the ruin of his friendship with his former boss. It should also be noted that the Coen Bros. return the alcoholism to the anti-hero, thus further problematizing an already difficult-to-grasp character.",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best.Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems.Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

Apparently the Coen's couldn't decide to play this rip-off of Hammett's \"The Glass Key\" straight or for laughs with the result being a dreadful mishmash that's virtually unwatchable. Gabriel Byrne's laconic performance is soporific. Jon Polito humiliates himself with an over-the-top performance and given his career of embarrassingly poor performances, that's saying a lot. The rest of the cast either sleepwalks or hams their way through this dreadfully paced piece of dreck. The Coen's script appears to have been written during an extended bender and is practically incomprehensible. The only positive I one can say about \"Miller's Crossing\" is that the cinematography was not particularly bad.",

It took me more than one viewing to approach understanding the mob lingo, character relationships, and story line of this movie, but it was well worth the work!! The movie is populated by men who are constantly trying to double cross each other in order to win (or gain) favor with one of the two warring mob bosses: the Italian, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), and the Irishman, Leo (Albert Finney). Only Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) and his sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), seem to lie clearly outside the lines of either mob--and present a thorn in the sides of both. The principal anti-hero of the movie is Leo's lieutenant, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne). Tom hates the way Leo is used by Verna (a hooker) to 'buy protection' for her brother. Tom keeps telling Leo that both Verna and Bernie are just grifters out for themselves. Tom is the real renegade of the movie who knows how to play both sides against the middle in hit after hit. He doesn't like being used or seeing his friends\u2014if he has any--being used either. Tom has his own problems with gambling debts but is independent enough to refuse help from either boss in order to win him over to their side. Of all the Coen brothers movies, this one seems to have the most plot twists, which surprise and shock the viewer at every turn.",

            "content": "I have to admit it took three viewings of \"Miller's Crossing\" to fully understand the nuance involved in the development and relationship of the characters, and just what Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) was doing to juggle the precarious balance between life and death in the middle of a mob war. Even then I made liberal use of the re-wind button to replay scenes and conversations to be sure I had it all right. When all is said and done, this is just a brilliant film, my favorite among the Coen Brothers movies.I don't want to get into a lot of the story details like others on this board have. What I'd like to consider are a couple of thoughts I had after my most recent viewing. I was wondering whether the movie would have had more impact if it ended right at the point when Tom begins to place that last bet after the hit on Bernie (John Turturro). It seems to me that would have cemented the idea that Reagan was as cold hearted a killer as Eddie Dane (E.J. Freeman). Not that the actual ending wasn't satisfying; it got to the heart of Reagan's loyalty, which after all wasn't so much to Leo (Albert Finney), but to himself.The other thought had to do with the Coen Brothers use of a classic element utilized frequently by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. A maguffin in film is a plot device that might seem important but winds up having no bearing on the outcome of the story. In that regard, think about how many times Tom Reagan's bookie Lazarre winds up being mentioned in the movie. Yet the character Lazarre never actually appears in the story, nor do we ever hear Lazarre's voice in connection with Tom's bets. True, a couple of his toughs work Tom over outside the phone booth after the phone call to Bernie, but that just adds to the mystique of the unseen bookie. Very clever actually, and something you don't even think about as the story unfolds.One of the things I got the biggest kick out of was Johnny Caspar's (Jon Polito) use of the term 'schmatta' to describe Bernie Bernbaum. Growing up with a Polish grandmother, 'schmatta' is a word I remember as referring to a dish rag. Which seems kind of appropriate, because Bernie seemed to have the temperament of a wet dishrag, especially in that 'find it in your heart' scene. Yeah, 'schmatta', that's just so colorful not to be part of the current vernacular.Anyway, \"Miller's Crossing\" is a great movie with terrific characters and an intricate plot that out-stings \"The Sting\" for witty dialog and a grand double cross. If you're looking for a rumpus, this is it!",

There was no chemistry between the girl and Reagan... the whole relationship made no sense. Oh, and the girl was singularly unattractive. What a waste of great actors too. I'd have expected Turturro and Steve Buscani (who only had a brief appearance, to be way more picky in the character's they played then the pathetic Bernie and Mink.

            "content": "A nice gangster movie marvelously written and set in the Twenties when Prohibition took place and full of perfect setting , colorful scenes and studied frames . Here Jewish , Italian , Irish mobsters spin cobwebs of treason , protection , murders and vendetta over themselves and their family . It deals with a mysterious protagonist who sets a complex scheme in motion , Tom Reagan : Gabriel Byrne is the brain behind the throne of an Irish ganglord , Leo : Albert Finney, but at a violent war against another mobster ; John Polito, the latter begins falling out . Meanwhile , there appears the girlfriend : Marcia Gay Harden stunts as the cunning woman who sleeps with Byrne and his boss , Finney , in hopes of a better life and protection for her small-time crook brother : John Turturro .Tom attempts to keep the peace an order between warring mobs , but things go wrong and he gets caught in divided loyalties. At the end it is a joy to watch the pieces of the jigsaw , here fitting perfectly towards the conclusion and it makes complete sense and well-closed plot .What's the rumpus? You can dangle. Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems. Nothing is what it seems at Miller's Crossing.The faultlessly paced film is a really dark entry in the mobster genre , being crammed with suspense , menace , violence , turns , as well as sharp, witty dialogue and Byzantine plotting ; though , overlong , and hard to follow, at times . It is well constructed and makes absolute sense ; adding both , emphasis and darkness to dilemma and resolution . It is a crime thriller with several roles complicating the twisted plot and it charts the gang wars between two mobsters in an American city during Prohibition . The action blazes in bursts between the workings of the script , and the merciless violence is relentlessly real , earning a movie without intercourse scenes , sex , or any profanity or bad language and adult certificate on its own . The movie is hugely inventive , with agreeable narrative , but it is also pays an enjoyable tribute to the crime literature , notably Dashiell Hammett novels and films of the 30s . And there's another level as a series of variations of themes of friendship , betrayal , ambition , trustworthy and ethics . At times , the criss-crossing of abstract and complex motifs recalls the formal style and complexity of Peter Greenaway movies . Being artfully poised between a subtle acknowledgement of hits own artifice and a sinister realism , including grilsy killings and high body-count . The engaged crossed dialogue between Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden remembers Humprey Bogart/Lauren Bacall couple . Armed with this gem of a script , the players give excellently weighted interpretations . Gabriel Byrne delivers a fine acting as Tom , Teo's loyal right-hand man , who is the lover of Leo's mistress , he is starring , but no hero , being as deeply flawed as the man he fights . Support cast is frankly top-drawer , such as : Jon Polito , J.E. Freeman ,Mike Starr , the early deceased Michael Jeter , Danny Aiello , Al Mancini , Steve Buscemi , Oleg Krupa , among others . And cameos from Sam Raimi , Michael Badalucco and Frances McDormand , Cohen's wife , as Mayor's Secretary . Wonderful and evocative musical score by Carter Burwell . As well as glimmering and brilliant cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld .\nFrom Cohen Brothers comes this extremely dark and flawlessly narrated flick , as Joel Cohen's filmaking never puts a foot wrong . The motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . Like \u00a8Raising Arizona\u00a8 and \u00a8Blood simple\u00a8 this works both , as a mobster movie , and an ironic comment of that genre . Both of whom have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of them are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) , among others . Rating : 7.5/10 . It is arguably an US mainstream first art movie .",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is an intricate tale of a gang war, about Irish criminals who are running an anonymous American metropolis in 1929 and a rising group of Italian mobsters who are tired of playing second fiddle. The central protagonist here is Tom Reagan (Byrne), who is the closest adviser of the big political boss in town, the vivacious Leo (Finney), who not only controls the police, but also the various mafiasos in town. One of them, run by the eccentric Italian Johnny Casper (Polito), is angry at Leo over the proposed assassination of a little gangster rat, Bernie Bernbaum (Turturro), who just happens to be the brother of Leo's girl, the tough-talking Verna (Harden). In the opening scene, Casper asks Leo to have the chiseling Jewish bookie killed, but Leo won't budge. This is partly because Leo doesn't want to let the uppity Caspar get his way. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Leo, Tom is screwing Verna on the side.However, Tom fails to keep things from escalating, as we soon find him and Leo at odds over her, and Leo kicks Tom out of his job. Subsequently, he crosses over to Casper's side, apparently in the hope of entrenching himself high up in the trust of the city's new mob boss, but it's immediately clear that whatever game Tom's playing, Caspar's success and well-being are of only incidental concern. As the film goes on, Tom tries to manipulate everything, but towards the middle of the film, rats on where Bernie is, and finds himself with the task of shooting him at Miller's Crossing. Here's where the big twist lies, and it sets the stage for the rest of this film, which reaches a fateful conclusion.Miller's Crossing attempts to both sum up, and revivify, the gangster genre. Guns, booze and fast women - all timeworn gangster film clich\u00e9s are given a fresh twist in this masterpiece from Joel and Ethan Coen. The Coens' play this icy gangster tale mostly straight, but they can't help throwing in a few of their dark, comic explosions; it's one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings. There's not a false move, a bad angle, an awkward line or a wanting performance at any point in their fascinating tale of gang warfare, family loyalty, personal loyalty and homo-erotic bonding set in some peculiarly insular, corrupt, never-identified small town in 1920s America - a sardonic neo-noir gangster story with a wicked sense of humor and unfettered violence. Capping the beautifully layered storyline is a barrage of wonderful performances from everyone, like Gabriel Byrne's wonderfully stone-faced performance, hiding himself under his facade; Marcia Gay Harden showing a different side of the traditional mob moll; John Turturro's wonderfully energetic performance; and, of course, Albert Finney brilliantly portraying Leo as not being a monster, but really being a tough but gentle man.A gleeful riff on a very old genre; the Coens make Miller's Crossing sing anew with wit, intensity, and irresistible black humor, thanks to a screenplay of pure gold. I still think it's the best Coens' film yet!",

            "content": "Tom(Gabriel Byrne)is Leo's(Albert Finney)right hand man and intelligent voice of reason. Being the city's top gangster, Leo depends on Tom's advice. The pot is stirred when Leo's moll, Verna(Marcia Gay Harden)has a pesky brother Bernie(John Turturro)who is stealing from rival mob boss, Casper(Jon Polito). Casper wants Bernie dead and will clear Tom's gambling debts with a local shyster Lazarre if he'll complete the task. Tom has another problem besides his debt and that is his sleeping around with Verna. Casper makes it known that he wants to be head honcho of the city and offers a partnership with Tom if he'll switch sides. Casper even tries, and fails, an attempt on Leo's life sending goons with tommy guns to kill him. Leo does lose his position, but won't go away. It appears that Tom has switched sides, but things are always uncertain in a Coen brothers film. The story unravels as circumstances surface such as Dane(JE Freeman), Casper's heavy who doesn't trust Tom and follows him. You have Bernie who is indeed a thorn needing removal even towards Tom. But, one figures that the \"cool-under-pressure\" Tom has a scheme brewing that will benefit himself first. Leo seeks blood for the death of one of his men, tailing Verna. Also, a pal of Bernie's, Mink(Steve Buscemi)plays a special part in certain key moments in the way the plot carries out regarding both Tom and Verna's annoying, thieving brother.As in most film noir, the characters are all flawed, imperfect and corrupt..there's no one who escapes unscathed without at least one skeleton poking it's head from the closet to wink. The protagonist, Tom, isn't exactly the kind of hero one roots for as he is, it seems, merely out for himself. But, the motivations of Tom and his manipulation, without the blood caking in the cracks of his hands, is the real reason to check out this nasty piece of work that represents the noir genre dutifully. The photography, and era detail are flawless. The complex story as it unwinds is a lot of fun. Twists abound and many characters will just about have Tom licked when it seems a guardian angel rescues him from underneath the tightening noose.",

            "content": "\"Miller's Crossing\" is the third film produced by the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, two of the modern masters of cinema. The film is based in large part on Dashiell Hammett's classic \"The Glass Key\", and its various film adaptations. I have always loved a good period piece, and the Coens transport us into the early 1930s, an era of gangsters, dames, and a whole lot of Irish cops. The film melds the 30s gangster movie with the 40s film noir, mixed in with the Coens' trademark dark humour. Gabriel Byrne stars as Tom Regan, the right-hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), who is the kingpin of the mafia in an unnamed city (that looks like Chicago). Both Tom and Leo are in love with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), which is a problem, because Verna's brother Bernie (John Turturro) is in trouble with local underboss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), and his henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman). Tom wants to sacrifice Bernie, while Leo fears losing Verna. The ensuing mob war threatens to leave no one standing. There are several standout scenes, the best being a classic gun battle between Leo and Caspar's assassins, set to the tune of 'Danny Boy'. Leo proves that he's still an artist with a Thompson sub-machine gun. The entire film oozes style, and is complemented by excellent performances from all involved. Real highlights among the cast are Albert Finney, looking quite convincing as a tough guy, and Gabriel Byrne, as the troubled Tom. I give this excellent film a 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Miller's Crossing\" is, in my opinion, the most accomplished of the Coen brother movies, which is saying something; they have made some very fine flicks.Among the criticisms I've heard about the Coens are: (1) they are too zany (\"Raising Arizona\"), (2) they are too offbeat (\"The Big Lebowski\"), (3) they are too dark (\"Barton Fink\"), and more recently (4) they have sold out to commercial Hollywood (\"Intolerable Cruelty\").True or not, none of those complaints can be made about \"Miller's Crossing\", which is one of the most well-crafted movies in Hollywood history. Perhaps because no one aspect of the film (scripting or directing or acting or cinematography or sound) stands out above the others, it's easier to overlook how superb every film element is accomplished.As a result, this is a movie I bought, and one that I watch over and again, especially when I'm trying to learn something about the craft of movie-making.",

And it treats its characters with respect and ... violence. Also love and dignity of course. Not to mention that the viewer is being respected too. You may be able to see things before they happen, but the actors still keep you on the edge of your seat. Great cinematography too and awesome set design. This is top class in literally all aspects.

            "content": "One of many mafia movies made in the early 1990's, this is a practically excellent film that in spite of its bloody structure is never dull and frequently laugh inducing. Gabriel Byrne plays his part of a mobster playing two rival mobs against each other and assigned to whack John Turturro out at Millers Crossing but after Turturro with him not to, he fires two Shots into the air and orders Turturro to run and never return. But Turturro views this as a weakness and comes back to haunt Byrne, and when he is dragged out to Miller's Crossing after reports that he didn't commit the hit, he's shocked by what he sees. Albert Finney and Jon Polito are both excellent, but don't play a drinking game for every time Polito dramatically says \"schmatta\".Beautifully film and including a gorgeous background musical score, this will make you think of the color green every time you think about it. For some reason, that is a major color scheme used in this film, mainly because of the woodsy area Miller's Crossing where numerous hits are said to have occurred. Marcia Gay Harden, as Byrne's mistress, is a great femme fatale. This film is fast moving and consistently entertaining, and the wisecracking way the fall of the characters speak gives it an almost cartoon-like feel. The music underlines a sweetness in the film that is obviously not there, but is one of the most memorable elements about it. Turturro is sensational, and the direction by Joel Coen terrific.",

            "content": "Films about crime always seem to get special attention, thanks to the success of The Godfather. Many anxiously attend every new crime movie, hoping to see heartless characters slaughter each other in new and interesting ways. Yet somehow it's always intriguing to watch, and one seems to get caught up in the action, as the outer conflict becomes a clear picture of the protagonist's inner conflict.Miller's Crossing is an interesting take on the \"crime\" genre that sets up Gabriel Byrne as the protagonist, playing Tom Reagan, a man who seems to have a kind heart and is caught between opposing sides. The Coen Brothers display the interesting story in a peculiar way, a way far more interested in the dialogue of the characters than in the action on screen. If you're looking for action, you'll find a few, well-shot scenes, but those scenes are far from being the focus of the film, which puts Miller's Crossing in a class along with some of the more developed films about organized crime.Another aspect that puts Miller's Crossing in this class is the superb acting. As previously mentioned, Byrne puts in an excellent performance as Reagan, but supporting him are an excellent Albert Finney as Leo, and John Turturro puts in one of his best performances as Bernie. Sadly, none of the performances won a single nomination from the Oscars. Furthermore, the film is very well-shot and displays its mood well via Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography and Carter Burwell's short theme.However, the screenplay of the film should've been improved upon, as the dialogue of the film is its focus. The dialogue is so caught up in descriptions and locations that it forgets to characterize anyone. Also, it manages to confuse the viewer, who has to view the film multiple times in order to understand which character is which, and how each character relates to the story as a whole.Overall, however, this film is worth a watch, especially if the viewer has time for multiple viewings. Try to pay close attention to the dialogue for better understanding.Overall Grade: A-.",

Think of \"The Sting\" mixed with The Godfather and you will have some idea of what they were going for. Let me warn all potential viewers that Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney are not leading men, but there were obviously no other takers despite the budget and production values. Can you smell the script from where you are reading? Gabriel Byrne has only one expression in every film including this one and that is \"dour..\" Some people think the strong silent type in good times and bad is a tried and true hero archetype, but with Steve McQueen there was a wide range of expression shown with subtlety that Byrne does not have. Finney is very good but he is Finney. No one is likeable and no one is interesting. Everyone is a gruff, irritating bore. The worst part however, is the lack of plausibility. There is no attention to detail and everything is way over the top as when a machine gun is firing a zillion bullets at Finney in a drive-by while he stands stationary shooting back. No evidence that bullets are hitting anything anywhere but then the car crashes and burns. This was not as hilarious as when Finney escapes gunners and then kills one of them. The guy shakes and jitters in the most laughable way ever put on film while being riddled with bullets. In some strange twist of physics the bullets do not push his body in any direction. The bullets simply cause him to dance. Watch it for laughs maybe.",

His best friend Tom (Gabriel Byrne) works with him and advises caution in dealing with Caspar. Leo's girlfriend Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) has eyes for Tom and she has a crazy brother named Bernie (John Turturro) who's getting out of control. Got all that? Convoluted but great movie by the Coen brothers (Joel directed and him and Ethan wrote the screenplay). This is an off putting movie to a lot of people. I've heard complaints that it's too dark, too quiet, gloomy and confusing. It is dark and gloomy but that appropriately fits the tone of the movie. It is quiet but that helps when there are bursts of graphic violence--it makes them all that more shocking. Also you need the quiet to figure out what's going on half the time! I loved the movie back in 1990 and still find it impressive today. It's very moody and stylish--they captured the 1920s-30s perfectly. The story is very complex so you have to pay strict attention to follow it. The cinematography is just gorgeous and this is very well-directed with some knock-out sequences. Byrne nicely underplays his role; Finney tears into his part with relish and chews the scenery repeatedly (and fakes an American accent credibly); Harden surprisingly is pretty bad; Polito and Turturro are both good and slimy in supporting roles and Steven Buscemi shines in his one scene. This is a very intricate film and not for casual movie viewing. It challenges the audience and always keeps you guessing and wondering. Next to \"The Godfather\" this is one of the best gangster films ever made. I give it a 10.",

            "content": "A black hat rolls pushed by the wind into a forest in the scene that opens 'Miller's Crossing', the 1990 film by the Coen brothers (officially only Joel is credited with directing). It is the first of several hats to roll in this film, and each of these frames emphatically marks the end of a scene. It is one of the visual motifs of this stylish film, the third in the Coen brothers' filmography and, in my opinion, their first memorable film. All the hallmarks of the 'Coen brand' are already present in 'Miller's Crossing': respect for the cinematic tradition of Hollywood's predecessors, including references or quotes from classic movies, a well-written story with clever dialogue and consistent characters that allow actors to perform some of the best roles of their careers, creative reconstruction of the historical period in which the story takes place, consistent visual design and an excellent soundtrack. The Coen brothers don't shy away from making entertaining movies, but the entertainment is always high quality.It's a gangster story, but complicated enough to require the viewers' attention to understand and watch it. The film's hero, Tom Reagan, is a rather atypical gangster in an American city during the Prohibition. Unlike those around him, he uses his brain more than his pistols or fists, in fact he even gets a significant amount of beatings throughout the film. The city is the scene of wars between two rival gangs, and Tom will in turn be the trusted man of the two clan chiefs. 'Trust' is actually a word with somewhat uncertain meanings in a world where betrayal and corruption are the rule, where money and thirst for power dominate everyone's actions. Like many lone heroes in 'noir' movies, Tom Reagan has a code of ethics different than the one of many around him. Added to all this are the complications arising from the fact that Tom has a love affair with the girlfriend of one of the mob chiefs. Survival is only possible by using the resources at his disposal - intelligence and a sense of humor.One of the special talents of the Coen brothers is to use actors who specialize in supporting roles and to give them generous parts. For some of them, their films have been launching or re-launching career ramps. Gabriel Byrne creates a leading anthological role and with it an iconic figure, who joins the genre roles created by Humphrey Bogart. Marcia Gay Harden is so mysterious, vulnerable and attractive that I wonder why she didn't have a more spectacular career. (The answer may be that she was not lucky enough to work with directors like the Coen brothers in more movies). Albert Finney and Jon Polito play the roles of the two mobsters, very different from each other, each very good in a very appropriate role. Last but not least, John Turturro, another supporting roles actor, also appears here in a supporting role, but it includes a memorable key scene with Byrne, a scene that those who have seen the film will not easily forget. The visual design, the sets, the music - each of them are treated with professionalism and contribute to the creation of a stylistic imprint that the Coen brothers will perfect in the next films. The two are very attentive to detail, but the reconstruction is not meant to be documentary. It's America of the Prohibition, but it's not about a specific city in a certain geographic area and in an exactly defined year. The historical period in which the action takes place is reconstructed through the personal vision of the authors of the film.The early 1990s were an exceptional period for gangster movies in American cinema. In addition to well-known directors such as Scorsese and De Palma, who continued to make very good films, David Lynch and the Coen brothers appeared with creative and different approaches, and Tarantino was waiting behind the corner. 'Miller's Crossing' is, in my opinion, the Coen brothers' first outstanding film. It came a little too early, but it grew in time and became part of a filmography in which other remarkable films were to appear. All the signs of the Coen brand are already present in this ageless film.",

            "content": "They wear heavy trenchcoats and fedoras, but remove them before a fight. They drag on cigarettes endlessly. It is prohibition era, but that does not stop them, and each clink of ice on gin glass is a sign of their luxurious freedom and power. They use words like dame, which swiftly becomes whore when necessary. They have gender-specific designations for guns. This is a pure distillation of Hammet and Chandler. Verna twice closes the door in the face of her secret lover, and when the thuggish Dane breaks it open, she doesn't shriek like the fat lady in the restaurant, but brandishes her weapon with scorn and venom spilling out of her mouth, as if to loudly signify her as the designated femme fatale (and Tom is just as spiteful in return). Does it matter? She is the only female character of any significance anyway. Like many Coen films, the dialogue is heavily stylised and easily quotable. And overly so, because we fixate on the snappy dialogue that comes in troves instead of the actual characters, and how cleverly and quickly they respond. Think \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\" but replicated a dozen more times. Tom, buffeted by a never-ending series of difficulties and double crosses and betrayals, has a ready made one-liner for any confrontation. It does not feel like he is under an intense moral and ethical dilemma. Verna and he dance around each other dangerously, attack viciously and never show an ounce of vulnerability towards one another. And then he grips her roughly, and they fall into each other's arms, but the Coens seem to do this more than twice without a hint of irony. There is less and less conflict each time. Coincidently, the one time he is silent is the one time he is under the most threat, and he vomits instead of firing out another quip. These gangsters run the town their own way. The best scene of the movie, Casper's wide-smiling, pompous presentation, immediately paints a picture of each side's entitlement towards what they feel they deserve. They are rivals, but both possess the same twisted sense of ethics that makes them so good at controlling those beneath them. Polito sells it earnestly; see how righteous and adamant he is in claiming that if he rigs a fight, he should expect a profit from it, and how he complains about the state of affairs that sees dishonest crooks corrupt this innocent little system and hierarchy. And observe the Coens weave in other little signs of this. See how pleasantly the gangsters greet the men in blue, and the delightful way in which the chief, when questioned of his loyalty, stammers a docile and polite reaffirmation, as if he was the one being questioned by a police officer: \"I-I was just speculating a hypothesis, sir.\" Watch how politicians cower and are bullied into obedience because of how they have been kept in office (\"I voted for him six times.\") And when Tom strides into the women's bathroom, it is as if he owns the place, and is walking right into enemy territory.Technically, the film is gorgeous, and perhaps this is where it betrays its intentions. Sonnenfeld's imagery and compositions are elegant and haunting; the opening credits peering through the treetops, the man with a gun and the cowering, weeping figure begging for his life from a distance, later a crowd gathering around the supposed corpse like a coronation, the twice reveals of Bernie, obscured by shadow and murky intentions. Burwell's piercing flute twists itself around the film and gives it a similar atmosphere. And the production design is intoxicating; the musty, dim oak-lined rooms with great big desks for formal affairs, a dinghy and green-tinged warehouse for dirtier deeds, and chairs and beds of increasingly ornate design. These point to a darker, brooding, more morally complex film that does not match Miller's Crossing. When Tom refuses to sell out Leo, he must fight his way out, but the Coens go for the humorous route, and the thug scurries away like a child running to his father after being teased. It is very funny, and very much tonally inconsistent. And when Leo is the target of an assassination attempt, mystery and tension is mustered and built-up via little hints given in close-ups, but again it descends into a farce. Leo dispatches the killers, and then in the most ludicrous and over-done segment, empties about a dozen clips of his tommy gun into one of the bodies, and it flails around beyond bodily functions as if having an epileptic fit, and in turn empties his own gun all around the room. And the plot too, is beyond comprehension, especially if you are watching for the first time. Tom is a muddled character, even for noir standards, and he chases something that is never fully described or realised within the narrative. So potentially, Tom is a man of his own ethics. He remains loyal even as Leo and him are through. He attempts to make sense of the world and survive, but sometimes jealousy and desire leads him to waver (see how Verna takes off his hat just before they sleep together). But this characterisation comes thick and fast and without any real sense of development. Turturro's sniffling and weaselling performance is fantastic but his character see-saws wildly from one demeanour to another, and does not really justify the shot to his head that was just so earlier causing so much emotional distress. He is physically intimate, but not mentally so, and his motivations are so highly guarded they never really appear, but in a better film the subtext would ring hard and true. Caspar is the most honest of them all. He knows what he wants, and as convincing as his speeches are, thinly veil the ends he will go to get them. And he babies his chubby little son, and slaps him, and then immediately comforts him.",

Once you have seen some of their classics you probably will wanna see ALL their other work too, without needing to read any reviews, because they are THAT good. The Coen Brothers are simply one of the best independent american movie makers of this century. \"Miller's Crossing\" however is NOT their best work, but is their best effort at making a vintage gangster movie. If you are not sure if you will wanna see \"Miller' s Crossing\", watch \"No Country for Old Men\" or \"Blood Simple\" instead. Those are both real grim hardcore Coen Brothers classics . Watch \"Fargo\" or \"The Big Lebowski\" if you wanna see a more humorous classic by these twin geniuses.Gabriel Byrne plays a cunning gentleman gangster who sleezes his way through the world of crime by double crossing anyone that crosses his path. The story is rather complicated and intelligent, but everything revolves around Gabriel Byrne's attempts at outsmarting the crime bosses he works for. Will he survive his cunning scams or will he have to face the bullet for his betrayal? That's the suspense.Acting quality is terrific. In ANY movie of the Coen Brothers acting is always paramount. The Coen Brothers respect and admire their actors and they bring out the best in them. Soundtrack by Carter Burwell, who scores the music for EVERY Coen Brothers film.

Small but important things, like Ned Beaumont/Tom Reagan's obsession with hats as a symbol of control, carry through in strange ways from the book to the movie. Cartoonish as it is, the plot to Miller's Crossing makes much more sense than that of Hammett's novel.This is probably the Coen's best marriage of lyrical, highly-visual storytelling and intelligent script. The Finney character's \"Danny Boy\" scene is both one of the greatest action scenes and one of the greatest satires of action scenes in American cinema. Be forewarned -- this movie doesn't really happen in a \"real\" world, so be prepared to see things working with a b-movie logic that lets square-jawed heroes take repeated blows the the jaw from sturdy irish cops. But the visual sense, from the opening close-up of ice cubes and scotch going into a glass through to the final shot of Finney & Byrne walking silently side by side down a perfectly framed lane of trees, is just overwhelming.In the Coen brothers catalog, only Barton Fink comes close.",

            "content": "I've seen several Cohen brothers films and I know they have a habit of making complex films, more or less between the commercial movie and the intellectual movie. The Cohen have the ability to go from one end to the other of this spectrum. The script runs during the Prohibition and in the context of an impending gangster war. Tom, the main character, is trying to avoid it, but ends up getting entangled in a web of crossed loyalties.Gabriel Byrne gave life to the lead role and was excellent. I loved his performance in a character who looks like an anti-hero. He has everything to be bad (he has no character or scruple and doesn't mind betraying friends) but he is pragmatic and seems to regard the bloodshed as something that should be avoided or minimized. That makes Tom a character we like. He is not a good guy, but he seems to be the most human person in the whole movie. Velma, on the other hand, looks like a cold, calculating, treacherous girl. The way Marcia Gay Harden acted also helped. The actress is good and performed well. John Turturro also shone in the role of Bernie, an opportunist little crook who gets in trouble by fooling a big fish. Albert Finney brought to life Leo, the powerful Irish boss with a good heart and full of kindness. He is a good actor, but his character seems too good to be a mobster. Much closer to the ruthless and cynical picture which we use to make of mob bosses is Jon Polito. He's the most dominant actor in the film, along with Byrne. I loved his work here. His cruelty, the easy way he kills or orders to kill gave me goose bumps. The rest of the cast also did a good job, but I think these actors deserve prominence, not so much for having the main characters but for the quality of their work.Another good thing are the technical details. Cinematography is very good and contributes decisively to the chilling environment that we like to feel in a true gangster movie. Some scenes are clearly homage to other films of the past, as well as the relevance given to fedora hats. In fact, if there is anything that we immediately link with the gangster world it's this particular type of hat (although it's also one of the most classic male hat models, still fashionable nowadays... I even have one). We can also see other iconic elements of the mob world, like Thompson sub-machine guns. It has excellent firefight scenes also, and the dry and ironic humor that is the Cohen Brothers trademark. The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack because I felt it cut through the pleasant tension I felt throughout the movie.\"Miller's Crossing\" is a good movie. It's not too complex or unintelligible, tells a good story, has a nice irony, a good cast doing a great job, good production values and positive technical details. It's worth watching.",

It's not one of their better known titles such as Fargo or Raising Arizona, but it should be highest on their list, as it is truly a masterful work of cinema.The film, visually, is beautiful. The cinematography has a very classic, noir look to it. The dialogue is sharp, the acting is solid. The story is pretty standard but done in such a professional way.Basically, two big mob bosses are feuding and the characters are either part of the feud or get caught up in it, much to their dismay. There are a lot of artistic touches the Cohen Brothers add that enhance the style of the film, such as a hat motif that extends throughout the work.Anyone who is a fan of the Cohen Brothers or film noir should definitely see this film. It astounded me and I consider it an underrated work by the brothers.",

In contrast, there is weaselly, whiney 'Bernie Bernbaum' (a perfect John Turturro) and motor-mouth 'Mink' (Steve Buscemi). Albert Finny is great as 'Leo', the aging Irish boss (but \"still an artist with a Thompson\" (my favorite line)). The moderately complex plot holds together well, the script is excellent, the cinematography striking, and the Coen Brothers production/direction is, as always, peerless. I found that the undefined place and time, the minimalism, the lack of people other than crooks and cops, and the Thompsons with unnatural magazine capacities gave the film a slight fantasy-noir feel that I really liked.",

The ratio of people hit to shots fired is probably pretty close to the truth.  A tiny anachronism is the presence of dial telephones in an American city before 1925 ( either that or some other problem with whatever it is that places the plot that early).  Another tiny plot hole is that if the outsider's bets on the fixed fight keep the fixer from profiting, the outsiders fail to profit too.The ethical gangster is pretty funny - heavier handed humor than later Coen, though. I wish we had a rating of 7.5 - I put the film better than 7, but it hasn't enough emotional impact on me for 8.",

The nice thing about the 30's is that corruption was so simple then. To the people who lived in it, personal loyalty was the only thing to hold onto, or not. This incredibly elaborate movie is simply about one man with that one motive. The plot, of course, is something else. A violent war between gangs gets won by wits after so many twists and turns that you wonder how someone can be so smart... oh, and there is lots of black humor.

            "review_title": "Boring, Derivative, Silly, Poor Acting, Did I mention Silly?",
            "content": "I gave this a 3 because it was not totally unwatchable.The main problem with this movie is that the story was silly and pointless. The problem with trying to make a good movie based on a silly and pointless story is that you are starting below zero, and everything else has to be excellent to even bring the movie up to good.That didn't happen here.As a first matter, the acting was terrible. The worst acting in the movie came when the guy from Fargo is at the bottom of the stairs talking to the lead character. I almost fell off my chair laughing it was so bad. He literally looked like what you'd expect at the High School talent show - forced, as if he was reading off of a teleprompter.As a further example of bad acting, the Italian actor who played the Jewish character was terrible throughout. The scene where he is on his knees and \"pleading for his life\" was laugh out loud funny - it was that unbelievable. Then later, when the same character tries to act tough, it's about as believable as Screech trying to act tough on saved by the bell.The acting of the Italian mobster is another low point - he overdoes it to the point of making Dinero look reserved.Beyond the acting, the story stunk.For example, in one scene the Italian mobster kills his, presumably, long time bodyguard and number 1 because the lead character has come over to the mobster's side and spun a tale about how the bodyguard is double crossing the mobster. Please. I find Clifford the Big Red Dog more believable than that. But the mobster is apparently so incredibly silly that he is willing to murder his right hand man because a guy who, 48 hours earlier, represented the enemy Irish mobster is now telling him his bodyguard is a traitor!!Sure.That'd be like Vladimir Putin's right hand man coming to the U.S. and convincing the president, in a matter of hours, that his VP was a spy.Those are just some examples - the whole movie is one long string of the ridiculous and improbable all strung together into a big mess.Another example is when the lead character is being forced to kill the Jewish character in the woods. It was obvious from the start that he wasn't going to do it. So he marches him out there, and the two guys who work for his \"new\" Italian boss don't even bother to keep an eye on him. They let him waltz off into the woods, they hear two gunshots, spaced a minute or more apart, and they think nothing of it.That is so stupid so as to be beneath dime store pulp fiction, never mind a movie on the big screen.Then there's the painfully derivative machine gun scene where each machine gun has about 7,000 rounds of ammo in it, and when a guy gets hit, he doesn't just fall limp, like what happens in real life, he stands there with his arms in a zombie reach and wiggles like a Shaker on Sunday for about 3 minutes and 3,000 of the 7,000 rounds are send through his vibrating torso. Ridiculous, silly, and boring.Another example. Hit men walk in front door of mansion, walk up to room for about 4 minutes, then walk in and Irish mobster is under bed.What would any non-retarded person do? Well, clearly then would fire 2 or 3 thousand rounds into the bed. Not!You'd hit the floor and spray under the bed or you'd get up on the bed and fire down, or you'd get back in the hallway and you'd take an angle . . .But not in the brother's movies. In the brother's movies, everybody acts like a complete moron all of the time.If a movie is made based on an improbable premise, then the movie can be enjoyable. Fargo is one example of this. The events of that movie are improbable, but not impossible. On the other hand, if a movie is made based on an impossible premise, then the movie has to either aspire to be Buckaroo Banzai - where it is understood that everything is unrealistic - or it is a flop, as in the present case.I find it funny that some people say that they watch this movie over and over and it \"gets better\".I can tell you that, were I to be strapped to a chair with my eyelids held open as in Clockwork Orange (great movie), I would not only NOT think this movie was better, I would think it even worse, because all of the bad acting, impossible behavior, and silly story lines would be even more obvious.Ayy.Absolutely terrible movie.",

            "content": "I will start by saying that I have always been a sucker for the finely-executed gangster picture. And until they came out with \"Intolerable Cruelty\" and \"The Ladykillers,\" I thought the Coen Brothers were an unmatchable team in consistently good and original films. So to call this one of their finest, I don't know, isn't really saying that much.But considering how good their movies have been, is saying something. And in tackling what is perhaps their first out and out genre movie, a 1930s gangster pic on a par with the best of Cagney and Bogart, they have created another masterpiece.With an environment borrowed from Dasheil Hammet's \"The Glass Key,\" and a plot turn borrowed from his \"Red Harvest\" (also known in the movie world as \"Yojimbo,\" \"A Fistfull of Dollars,\" and \"Last Man Standing\") they have brought back Prohibition-era gangsterism as less about a plague of heartless gangsters, and more as a game of power, where the one who has respect holds ownership over the police and the mayoral office. Leo O'Bannion (Albert Finney) is the political boss who enjoys this luxury. But he doesn't quite understand it. As he sees things, he is the only one who can hold influence over politicians, and no one can take it from him. His confidante, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, in his American debut) knows otherwise. And now Leo's about to throw it all away for a girl.Johnny Caspar (hilariously played by Jon Polito) is an Italian hoodlum whose ethics dictate how he handles his work. He is going to whack Jewish bookie Bernie Baumbaum (the unmatchable John Turturro), and Leo wants to protect Bernie. Bernie is a sexually-ambiguous con man who is also the brother of Leo's mistress, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden, as a tough-but-vulnerable femme fatale). It also turns out Tom is sleeping with Verna, a piece of information he only reveals when Leo, misjudging Caspar's power, initiates a gang war. This, however, puts tom at odds with his best friend, and he makes the most of it, digging himself in so deep he destroys any human emotion that could truly render him heroic. He becomes a classic antihero of the film noir, one of Hammet's godless protagonists who you still root for, because whoever he's up against, you know that person's worse.J.E. Freeman, as Caspar's menacing henchman, Eddie the Dane, turns in a creepy portrayal of a man who is twice as smart as his boss, but still only half as smart as Tom. This movie follows almost every rule of the gangster film, with a few modern additions. When people have sex, the camera moves to the window, keeping with the censorship of the early 1930s, before the Golden Era. You may hear a few g-d's, but nary an f-word is spoken. And while a great portion of the film has little or no violence in it, when machine guns open fire, blood flies. And even more so as we near the end.This is perhaps the beginning of the shock violence that would mark several of the Coen Brothers' later pieces. \"Blood Simple\" was shocking, but it was also their most serious movie to date, even more serious that \"Fargo.\" \"Raising Arizona\" had a slapstick quality about it. Here, while we know that these men are all killers, the violence is still a little shocking. Watching Albert Finney shooting a man to death with a Tommy gun, to the tune of \"Danny Boy,\" is in keeping with the pulp irony that would mark \"Barton Fink,\" \"Fargo,\" and \"The Man Who Wasn't There,\" as twisted masterpieces of bizarre humor and ironic drama.",

            "content": "This is one my favourite gangster pictures of all time and to say the least I am a big fan of the genre. The use of the camera by the Coen bros.,the cinematography and the detail of the mise-en-scene are first rate. Yeah yeah. Thats my sad attempt to show that I learned something in film school. Seriously though the sets are excellent. As in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coens really make you feel like your in a completely different time and place.Gabe Byrne is well cast as the softly spoken loner who by the end of the picture has danced rings around everybody yet doesn't seem much better off. Tom Reagan(Byrne) is a very original character because one can really relate to him. He hasn't got the stomach to murder, doesn't carry a gun despite all of the violence which surrounds and indeed threatens him every day and is prepared to take a beating as opposed to venting hell hath no fury style vengeance which would result in a much higher penalty. Essentially he's an everyman who is playing the cards life has dealt him and is more than aware its a shitty hand but knows the best way to win is not to go for broke.Albert Finney is excellent as Leo the boss of the Irish mob who run a very fictional Chicago-esq setting and who is a lifetime friend of Reagan who is essentially Leo's unofficial consular. John Turturro goes from a 'tough-guy' in 'Do The Right Thing' to an at times pathetic yet equally psychotic 'rat' in this picture rather superbly. J.E. Freeman represents a rather commanding and intimidating physical presence as the fearsome Eadie Dane who has to be one of the most memorably sadistic henchmen ever committed to the screen. However for me Jon Polito, a favourite of the Coens, just about runs away with the picture as the wise-cracking mob underboss Johnny Caspar, a tough talking and ambitious Italian who has become fed up of taking the scraps from Leo's table and launches his own bid for the crown as the town's head honcho.The film offers one of the most violent and memorable scenes in movie history when to the sweet theme of 'Danny Boy', two of Caspar's henchmen attempt to assassinate his now rival boss Leo at his home. The sheer ferocity of Tommy Guns has never been so well portrayed or indeed has this very cinematic weapon ever been so aesthetically pleasing.The theme of the film is, like many before, borrowed from 'Yojimbo' with a middle man, Tom Reagan, playing off two rival gangs. The difference is that Tom actually does have loyalty to one.Another difference is that there is a lot of well executed humour here. Thats not to say there wasn't some in the Kirisawa classic but it's a little more obvious here. There is a more direct comparison to this film which some may have noticed but believe me 'Last Man Standing', released several years later, does not hold a candle to this picture. That film took itself a hell of a lot more seriously and faded from the memory rather quicker quite possibly because you had seen it all done before but better.A typically Coenesque surreal edge is also given by the at times unorthodox camera use and blandness of the sets. As in 'Hudsucker' and 'Barton Fink' the minimalist and somewhat austere fashion of the pre-60s years is overemphasized to great effect. The film is after all meant to be a fantasy. Yes a very adult and violent one with obvious nods to the realities of Capone's Chicago and the 30s and 40s Cagney gangster films but still a fantasy non the less.Overall this is a very original take on the gangster theme and a visual gem. It also contains some important lessons for any aspiring gangsters. In the words of Johnny Casper \"Look at this kid. Something I tell all my boys.Always put one in the brain!\"",

            "content": "With \"Miller's Crossing\" Joel Coen and Ethan Coen made a gangster film masterpiece and arguably one of the best films of the 1990s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, the right hand man of prohibition era crime boss Leo O'Bannon, Albert Finney in a lion of a performance. The plot is far too complicated and serpentine to summarize in a few sentences, but essentially Tom finds himself between to rival gangs, ALA Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" or James M. Cain's \"Love's Lovely Counterfeit.\" \"Miller's Crossing\" is a beautiful homage to so many films, but manages to also become something wholly original. The Coen Brothers have taken genre archetypes and touchstones and make them completely their own. Handsomely shot by by ace cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (\"Raising Arizona,\" \"Big,\" \"Misery\") and bolstered by a lush Irish tinged score by composer Carter Burwell, the film would be worth watching simply for its rich production values, but it offers so much more. The film bristle with cracking dialogue that can be classic tough guy noir:Eddie Dane: You understand that if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.Or funny:Tom Reagan: I am awake.\nTad: Your eyes are shut.\nTom Reagan: Who you gonna believe?Or deep:Tom Reagan: Nobody knows anybody. Not that well.To even heartbreaking:Verna: I thought you said you didn't care about Leo no more.\nTom Reagan: I said we're through. That's not the same thing.The story is as cleverly serpentine as the best Dashille Hammett or Raymond Chandler novel, but unlike many throwback gangster or noir films, this film tells it story with a heavy reliance on visuals, where the audience shown things, whether it's a look or a slow pan across an object, rather than an over reliance on telling the audience everything, which makes this film an experience of pure cinema. The film also excels in characterization. There's not a single character in the film who does not see themselves as a the hero of their own story. It didn't strike me until repeated viewing that the seemingly villainous Johnny Casper is really a hapless victim. From the opening scene he is completely honest and open about his intentions and consistently sticks to his word. Ethics! The one character with zero ethics, John Turturro's Bernie Bernbaum. He's true to himself, which is being unashamedly out for himself. Or take the menacing Eddie Dane, who is nearly right almost all along and reads the situation just about perfectly. I've always felt the best films don't have black hat villains and have characters who are all the heroes of their own story, and \"Miller's Crossing\" is a great example of this. Overall, I will make the bold pronouncement that this film is one of the best film of the 1990s and is the best gangster films of all-time, standing alongside Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables,\" John Milius' \"Dillinger,\" and Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie & Clyde\" as the best modern incarnation since the Golden Age of Hollywood.",

He is also has a gambling addiction, bad luck and, in a very real way, has poor judgement when it comes to women. When rival gangster Johnny Caspar comes to O'Bannon for permission to kill bookmaker Bernie Bernbaum, ill-advised refusal sees a gang war breakout, with O'Bannon suddenly losing all his political support as the corrupt officials see a new master on the rise. Tom has no choice but to tell O'Bannon some home-truths in order to try and save the gang but finds himself out in the cold between the two gangs.No Country for Old Men's success had the knock-on effect of bringing the back catalogue to many film channels in the UK (specifically FilmFour) and took the chance to rewatch some of them again, but the one I was most looking forward to seeing again was Miller's Crossing. It has been pretty much fifteen years since I last saw this film and I did wonder if I thought it was good because that is how I want to remember it or if it genuinely is that good. Happily it turned out not to be my aging memory but rather the fact that the film itself is great. The central plot is a strong gangster twist on the duplicity of Jojimbo but with more of a straightforward flow to it but the material is unmistakably that of the Cohen brothers. The world of these gangsters is ripe with characters and cracking dialogue that makes it such a unique place to be \u0096 but yet also still very much a genre film.The dialogue is endlessly quotable and, although \"made up\", never sounds out of place \u0096 \"the high hat\", \"take your flunky and dangle\" it is all great stuff. The cast react well to both this and the engaging plot, turning in mostly very good performances. Byrne probably hasn't had a better role and he rules the film surprisingly well considering the sheer amount of time he spends being punched. Polito is the real scene stealer though and his quick-tempered Caspar is a great character. He is well supported by the black hearted Dane in Eddie Freeman, who again is a well-written character delivered with gusto. Turturro has a small but important role and delivers a memorable character. Harden, Finney and Buscemi all deliver as you would expect them to but in the mix are also some good turns from Starr, Mancini and others.Miller's Crossing is a great film that feels fresh and unique even nearly twenty years down the road. The plot is strong but it is the dialogue and characters created by the Cohen's and delivered across the board by cast and crew. Not to everyone's taste perhaps but easily one of the all-round best films the Cohen's have done \u0096 and that is a high standard.",

The Irish gangsters with no Gaelic accents?The Jewish fixer with a non kosher speech pattern? I mean WTF! Do your research and find out how they spoke ,then write it ,then get actors to pronounce it right.Are American audiences so idiotic they cannot tell the difference from 1930's speech patterns and 1990's forced idioms ?How many beatings does Gabriel Byrne have to cop before a bruise appears?The Italian mafioso who now runs the town,(Chicago) is stupid enough to listen to the smearing of his chief henchman from a gangster who only a week ago worked for the Irish mob and then to execute the great Dane like a dog without an interrogation? Viewers have you seen The Godfather?You probably gave it 10 if you are a gangster movie buff.Then you give 10 to this candy floss also?Where is the in between?Where are the shades of grey with scores in the middle?Of course the movie was stylistically good.It looked pretty.That alone will not make a movie interesting.The accents were not realistic,the plot was too unbelievable,and the characters all unlikeable.The ending was nihilistic.Why kill the brother of his lover(and the proverbial leak) and then not rejoin the Irish mob?I mean where is Gabriels payoff?The money he pocketed from the lone Italian Boss' pockets to pay off his horse gambling debt?The trip to the cemetery to tell his Irish boss he won't be working for him after all?The approbation from his girlfriend after she just buried her brother? Why did he go there for the ending?Was he hoping for a bullet between the ears in the final seconds of the movie to put him out of his misery?That certainly would have been an ending.",

            "content": "Why was I disappointed?1.) The Cohen brothers always develop unique and entertaining products. But this one in my view was a dud.2.) I am a fan of Gabriel Byrne so I was intrigued to see him in a starring role as an Irish gangster. Unfortunately he did not come across as a realistic gangster. I think he got beat up on at least three (3) occasions and he just seemed to cower in the corner and take his beating like a scared school boy with no retaliation.3.) I am also a fan of Albert Finney and the one scene where he gets attacked at his home and his mansion is set on fire, he jumps out of his bedroom window to escape the attack. Before he jumps out of his bedroom window he throws one of his assassins tommy gun's out of the bedroom window, which he turns on the assassins getaway car as he walks calmly down the road in his pajamas and slippers. After he sees the car run into a tree noting to the audience he killed all of his assassins I asked myself one question? In an earlier scene we see that mobster boss Leo (Albert Finney) has at least 50 of his hoods protecting him just in his hallway alone, but yet at his mansion it appears he had only one (1) bodyguard protecting him during the evening? 4.) Besides the above points it was hard for me to imagine Marcia Gay Harden as the only love interest of both Leo (Albert Finney) and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne). She certainly did not come across the screen as a vixen, nor seductress.5.) Lastly, I got the feeling that the film came across more as a stage play, than as a major motion picture release. There was so much emphasis on Gabriel Reagan's tough Irish portrayal of mobster Tommy Reagan, but yet his character came across to me as shallow and scared, and not as the smart thinking hard drinking/smoking Irish mobster made man that he was portrayed as.Overall I was disappointed in Miller's Crossing, and I am not trying to be overly critical but I find it hard to understand how over 110,000 IMDb users have an average rating of 7.8 for what I deem is a lackluster crime film release. I can only assume I need to watch the film again to see what I may have missed which places it in a near 8.0 IMDb rating?I can only give Miller's Crossing a 5 out of 10 rating. No more, no less....well maybe less, but I like the Cohen brothers body of work so a \"5\" rating it will stay.",

            "review_title": "A Huge Inside Joke",
            "content": "Because the Coen brothers style was relatively unknown when \"Miller's Crossing\" was released back in 1990, most critics and viewers took it to be just another run of the mill gangster thriller; notable only for the complexity of its story elements. The Dashiell Hammett type story is told from the point of view of Tom (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a prohibition era Irish crime boss named Leo (Albert Finney). Although it appears to be a serious (and violent) gangster film with a straightforward story, it is actually a huge inside joke with the Coens showing both reverence and irreverence for their genre. Or more correctly \"genres\", as there is mixing of 1920-30's gangster movie elements with the film noir style of the 1940-50's. \"Miller's Crossing\" has a very fabricated production design with the stylized dialogue to match; giving it an unreal feel, a bit like the \"Serenity\" movie which mixed space and cowboys. Albert Finney and Jon Polito (as Johnny Caspar) are especially good as rival crime bosses. The film can only be truly appreciated by those well acquainted with the film traditions of its two genres, but it still works on a basic gangster picture level.The obvious comparison is \"Reservoir Dogs\", if only because the Coens and Tarantino are serious students of cinema history and film theory who carefully wove this stuff into their respective films. Yet there is considerable originally within these otherwise derivative works, both self-conscious reverential tributes and biting parodies of film conventions. Both films fit the writer/director classification, where the director is responsible for translating his own vision to the screen. The Coen vision is translated into an expressionistic world, which is superficially convincing as being real. The pseudo realism is self-sustaining because the characters behave as if they believe in it. The repeated inquiry \"what's the rumpus\" works within the film's reality but would be a strange question to hear today on a sixth grade playground. As the film progresses and these phrases of stylized gangster talk are repeated in service to the plot, the viewer assimilates them and the world of the film becomes increasingly familiar, becoming a world they know. \"Miller's Crossing\" has a more complex story than \"Reservoir Dogs\" and more of a comic book quality. Its main exaggeration is the transitional device of having the hero get unrealistically beaten up between virtually every scene change. The sequences with the corrupt mayor and police are also comic book surreal. At the time of release critics and audiences were not familiar with what would become the Coen's comedy trademark, the disconnection between the way their characters should talk and behave (per film convention) and the way the Coen's actually script them. This was less apparent in \"Miller's Crossing\" than in their later films, coming mainly in the discourses by Leo and Casper on ethics and codes of loyalty, and in the caricature of Casper's fat spoiled son.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

That effect is usually to have the viewer cerebrally scurrying to try to remember who said what to whom when. Loyalties outwardly mean everything but get changed more frequently (it would seem) than undershirts. This is camp, all grown up.The Coens suck us right down into the plot. We think for a while that they're serious, but they're laughing all the way. Even finally realizing their manipulation of us doesn't dampen for one minute the enjoyment of the movie.

This is a skillful and very tongue-in-cheek parody of gangster films of the 1930's and 1940's and has about as much to do with reality as a Busby Berkeley musical.  Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden and the rest of the cast all keep a straight face during the proceedings and the outcome is highly entertaining.  The Coen brothers style here is very similar to their later hit movie \"Fargo\" and it's artistically miles past \"Blood Simple\" or any of their previous films.    As far as diverging from reality, in one scene Albert Finney fires his machine gun for five minutes without reloading (that's about 10,000 rounds, folks). Gabriel Byrne gets violently beat up every five minutes (this includes kicks to the face, being thrown down multiple flights of stairs etc.) and never shows anything more than a minor fat lip on his never-changing expression.  The gangsters are all \"dressed to kill\" and their dialogue is straight from \"Farewell, My Lovely\".  When one gangster asks another if he's going to have a rival killed, he answers \"Yeah. For starters.\"  The movie has more intentional funny one-liners and equally hilarious scenes than the average comedy.  Of special note are the exchanges between Gabriel Byrne's character and the crooked Police Chief. If the movie \"Johnny Dangerously\" had dialogue like this, it would have been a box office sensation.   Most of the people who saw this movie when it came out in 1990 couldn't figure out exactly what they had just seen.  The Coens deliberately interspaced scenes of deadly earnestness between the put-ons and many viewers left theatres shaking their heads.  Now that most folks are more familiar with the Coens and their unique blend of macabre humor and real life tragedy, this film will make perfect sense on second viewing. This is certainly one-of-a-kind film making at its best.",

Freeman, et al).Albert Finney was absolutely magnificent in this movie: The scene where the mobsters try to put a hit on him with the song, \"Danny Boy\" blaring in the background has got to be one of the best scenes EVAHHH! Marcia Gay Harden, the babe with a heart of coal, is excellent as the gun moll, who tries to save the life of her brother, played by Turturro. Jon Polito as the Italian mobster does a phenomenal job, and his intensity kicks up the action more than a notch.With beautiful cinematography, an excellent script, and not a slacking actor in the mix, I rated this film a 10.For those of you who like period action/dramas (this movie takes place in the 30s-40s) with a punch, and LOTS of plot twists, this film is for you.",

            "content": "Yep, you saw my title correctly! I believe MILLER'S CROSSING (1990) to be Joel (director) and Ethan (writer) Coen's real best film of the 1990s, not the monumentally annoying and overrated FARGO or the monumentally annoyingly too-cult-for-it's-own-good THE BIG LEBOWSKI. The \"fact-based\" FARGO is boredom incarnate disguised as quirky, \"original\" seriocomedy and stereotypical as all get out! The \"too-cool-for-school\" LEBOWSKI (anchored by the increasingly annoying Jeff Bridges) is just a plain empty \"stoner\" movie.But MILLER'S CROSSING is definitely the most interesting of the Coen's 90s films as it is a lot deeper than originally given credit for. I think the stylishness of the film hampered it from being given the recognition it deserved in 1990, especially with more star-powered gangster films like GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER PART 3, and DICK TRACY coming out the same year.There is real humanity in MILLER'S CROSSING...start to finish and it is mostly thanks to star Gabriel Byrne (robbed of a Best Actor nomination) as protagonist Tom Reagan, right-hand man to gangster Leo (played superbly by the great Albert Finney), the most powerful in town. Leo's main competition is Johnny Caspar (brilliantly played by Jon Polito, his best ever role), angling to take over as top gangster. Johnny wants Leo to get rid of Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro in possibly the best performance of his career), a 2-bit hood that double-crossed him, but Leo won't do it, because he is involved with Bernie's sister Verna (played with cold-hearted sex appeal by Marcia Gay Harden in the most lusty performance of her career). In addition to the aforementioned actors, J.E. Freeman is imposing as Caspar's right hand Eddie Dane and Steve Buscemi is a scene-stealer in a cameo role as fast-talking Monk. This has got to be the best cast that the Coen's have ever assembled.The dialogue in MILLER'S CROSSING is top notch, as it skillfully blends old-school noir and modern touches and is delivered with 100% conviction by the actors. This is truly a great screenplay, with a great deal of natural humor. I found myself laughing (for all the right reasons and at all the right times) just because of how true much of it rung. The film of course has a lot of style and several \"payoff\" scenes, but they just add to it's appeal. The ending is truly magnificent, as it belies the nature of the main character. So, as far as 90s Coen movies goes, as far as I'm concerned, MILLER'S CROSSING is it!",

The film does lack however, in setting the mood for the era and for the feel of the ethnic gangs. \"Gangs of New York\", \"The Molly MacGuires\" and \"Godfather\" do a tremendous job of this. This film is more like a stage play. \"Miller's Crossing\" is all pretty much good or excellent. But this is a film that is ultimately unsatisfying. That's because it carries you along and slowly builds up a double cross and hope for redemption in a very suspenseful and rewarding way, but there is no payoff in the end. All the potential that the film builds is just tossed away when Gabriel Byrne walks away from his life and everything he lied, cheated and killed for. So you are left wondering what it all meant. We get the foreshadowing of this very boring and unsatisfying ending when the Verna character off handedly said that the hat dream was a metaphor, how pursuing it would lead to a payoff, and Byrne cut her off and said there was nothing there, just a hat. Well, that's the movie in a nutshell. Just a gangster movie. It's not \"The Sting\", it's not \"Goodfellas\", it's just a lot of good acting in an ugly and violent world that leads to absolutely nothing. So I give the film a 6 out of ten.

Speed and stillness, peace and violence, noise and quiet work in a flawless harmony. The action scenes do not come often, but when they do they are shocking, hilarious and astonishing. I felt my jaw drop watching Leo defend himself against breaking and entering thugs. The scene didn't go at all the way i thought, and even though i was aware i was watching a Coen brothers' film, i was feeling all those emotions above. It's been a while since i've been surprised like that.I like the fact that the main character plays a tough guy in the world of tough guys, but we the viewers get to take a peek into the real Tommy, who is a human being with emotions. He simply is a gambler. To the very extreme. He knows of nothing else to do, so he just keeps going and tries his best to survive playing with death every day. And make it look cool, of course. Never reveal your true state to your opponent.A bit of a disappointment was the Steve Buscemi was in a bit part only, but Albert Finney was great on the other hand. John Turturro makes his Coen debut and is immediately interesting. Some of the dialogue went a little over my head, since (old gangsta style) English isn't my first language and i had no subtitles available, but i think i got through it all right. The plot twists and turns did not surprise me to the level the action sequences did, i've seen a lot of plot twists already and haven't been surprised in that department for a while.A solid effort that is a little behind Fargo and O Brother, Where Art Thou? in humour, dialogue and overall atmosphere (music & cinematography), but is still the third best Coen Brothers' feature in my opinion.7/10 - very good",

The screenplay was razor sharp, very witty and entertaining; there was also a good share of action, but to say that this is the greatest gangster film of all time is just asinine! The film was actually entertaining somewhat; the 'Casper' was excellent. But having Tom be beaten up throughout the film, was very annoying and took a lot away from the movie.  As said before, the Leo shootout scene was so unrealistic, to the point there was no way I could take the movie seriously. I was REALLY fooled by the IMDb rating, for this to be on the Top 250 list is really overdoing it.

I can't imagine anyone else playing Tom besides Gabriel Byrne. Of course this is more of a cynical film, where every character is looking out for their own self-interests, but that does often reflect reality even if we care not to admit it. Tom is at least honest with himself about his motivations and interests, there is no cognitive dissonance here. So, \"Miller's Crossing\" is undeniably a dark and gritty film but it is an effective ode to the mob genre, perhaps one of the best. 9/10.",

            "content": "Well the coens have done it againMost of the films the Coens have made contain their unique dialouge, energetic and bueatiful camera work and strong performances. Miller's Crossing is no exception.Director of photography bathes the film in deep, warm shadows. The plot is typically complex and the art direction is splendid. The performances are all around excellent. Special mention must be given to Gabrial Byrne who plays his character so hard boiled we are reminded of the heros of other classic Noir films like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe. The Coens love to pay homage to earlier films of these generes. With Miller's Crossing they pay homage to both the Gangster and Noir generes.Gabrial Byrnes character is so shrouded in secrets and yet his eys reveal that of a man that is constantly thinking about what is going on around him and yet is able to stay above it all. We never really understand his motivations for betraying his boss and releasing turturos character yet by the end we know that he is the smartest character in the film. Marcia Gay Harden plays her femme fatal role perfectly. Like most noir films, it is usually something involving a female that is the catalyst to the plot. Byrnes Character may be the most complex of the film yet his is not the flashiest. That honor goes to Abert Finney and Jon Polito.Pherhaps the reason behind the fact that these two are so easily manipulated by Byrne's character is that they act so impulsivly with mostly lethal results. Watching the film one must be amazed at how clever Byrnes character is seeing as how close to death he comes so many times in the film.\nSpecial mention must also be given to John Turtorro. While he plays a very dislikable character, the monolouge he delivers at \"Millers Crossing\" where he is suppose to be killed has a way of cutting into a  viewers heart and evoking so much sympathy. This is all turned around by his double cross.\nAnyone looking for the Coens trademark visual style will love the shootout at Albert Finneys house set to the tune of Danny Boy. Hands down, one must agree that Finney got the best scene of the film blasting down a dark street with a tommy gun staying perfectly calm. Finney plays his role with so much gusto we are reminded of other toughguy gangsters like Al Pacinos \"Tony Montana\", Joe Pescis \"Tommy Devito\" and \"Nicky Santoro\" and finally James Caans \"Sonny Corleone\"We are left with a brooding Noir/Gangster film perfectly molded by the Coen brothers that can satisfy any of their fans.In the end though, see this wonderful film for yourself",

Ranks right up there with the very best movies of all time. Fun on additional viewings.

He complains (in the nicest possible way, of course) that there is only one \"human moment\" in the film (I forget which). \"Human moment\"?!???!

They are interested in gangster films as a form of American mythology. They are interested in revealing what it is about gangster films that speaks to the American psyche.In the service of this interest, the movie takes place in a world of its own. The city is no particular city; the gangs are no modelled after any real gang. The characters are dense, complex, and eroded by the world they live in. The plot twists like a snake with it's competing interests and deadly repercussions. And the dialogue is a thing of beauty.

            "content": "\"Miller's Crossing\" is an intriguing mix of gangster and film-noir genres with small bits of the typical dark humor that usually found in the films only done by the Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel).The film is only focused around Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne - \"The Usual Suspects\"), the right hand man to Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney - \"Erin Brockovich\"), an Irish mob boss who runs the city of Chicago in his office (even though he isn't the mayor) who get themselves into a bitter and bloody war with Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), an underground Italian mob boss and his cold and calculating right hand man Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman - \"Wild at Heart\").Early in the movie, the war begins when Leo refuses to let Johnny kill Bernie (John Turturro - \"Cradle Will Rock\"), a small-time bookie who double-crossed Johnny over a few fights.  Tom and Eddie are also watching and see what goes on.There another interesting twist added to the film for more tension when Tom is sleeping with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden - \"Pollock\"), who is both Bernie's sister and Leo's girlfriend.What made me enjoy the movie is the tight line that Tom is forced to take when the war in town and between himself and Leo gets ugly and extremely fierce.  And in certain scenes throughout the movie, Tom takes some serious beatings from a few people including Leo, Verna, Bernie, Dane.Despite a few violent and unpleasant scenes, there are a couple of funny moments and the best one is when a young boy and a dog look at a man who has been shot in the chest and is now dead.  So the boy pulls the man's hair, stops, and sees it as a toupee.  Then he takes it and runs away with the dog barking at his side.The performances are both terrific and chilling, ranging from Byrne and Finney to Polito and Freeman.  Steve Buscemi and Sam Raimi appear in small roles and Frances McDormand also appears unbilled as the mayor's secretary.To be honest, \"Miller's Crossing\" is one of the best Coen brothers' films in my mind.

            "content": "As Blood Simple and Raising Arizona had previously done with the respective genre of film-noir and the screwball comedy, Miller's Crossing attempts to do with the American gangster film. Here, the Coen's aren't simply attempting to pastiche the style of Hollywood mob films of the 30's and 40's, but rather, create a customised deconstruction of every single narrative contrivance or characteristic prevalent in those films. Naturally, in keeping with the film's they'd made before (and those that they would go on to create throughout the subsequent decade) the various signs, themes and signifiers have been dusted off, stripped away and re-adapted with an equal amount of warm nostalgia and distancing post-modern irony, and then, finally, restructured with those trademark characters and idiosyncrasies that only the Coen brothers can really create.The style of the film is trapped somewhere between the straight (though perhaps stylised in order to meet the requirement of the genre) reality of Blood Simple, with the over-the-top characters and set-pieces of Raising Arizona. On top of this, we also have the gorgeous noir-like cinematography of Barry Sonnenfeld, which draws on genre films of the 30's as well as more recent gangster pictures like The Godfather and Once Upon A Time in America (to quote the two most-obvious reference points). It also seems to predate the slick, handsome style of a film like Road To Perdition, with both films sharing that same colour-scheme of muted browns and autumnal reds, as well as the use of dramatic lighting, which here seems a little more expressionistic than most other mob/noir films of the last few decades. As well as the gorgeous style of both the cinematography and production design, there's also Carter Burwell's fantastic and evocative theme music (which was used in a long running Caffrey's commercial towards the end of the last decade; see also The Hudsucker Proxy) and the standout performances from the excellent, ensemble cast.Like much of the Coen's earlier works, the story, and indeed, the characters, are both wildly over-the-top and the actors seem to be having a great time imitating the Hollywood genre stalwarts of the 30's and 40's. Gabriel Byrne as the laconic Tom is the protagonist, the \"man behind the man\", who watches over his careless boss Leo, perfectly rendered by a stoic Albert Finney. There's also fine support from seasoned character actors and Coen regulars like J.E Freeman, Jon Polito, Steve Buscemi and a career best John Turturro, all of which adds further layers of narrative tension, drama and strokes of broad, darkly comic humour to an already fantastic film.",

None of the scenes really stood out to me or stayed with me after the movie. It feels somewhat flat.Pacing felt good, the movie moves a long well and the 2 hour runtime is not very noticeable. Music is alright, but used somewhat disruptively and comes across sometimes as ''tacked on''.

(\"I'm sick of the high hat...in a pigs eye...racial slurs potato eater, yag, sheeny, shmatah kid etc....)\nWhen I first saw this film I was 20 years old and felt like I needed subtitles for certain sections.\nOnce you develop an appreciation for the language in a historical context it's sharp, snappy, and witty.\nThe story is slightly more unique as Gabriel Burn (Tom Hagen) has to dig himself out of a gang war triggered by a Fem Fatals attempt to gain favor for her bookie brother who's been ripping off heavy laid bets by the Italian mob on fixed boxing matches. He wants to save his \"bromance\" as the former underboss of Albert Finey, dig himself out of major gambling debts, and stir up internal strife in the Italian gang to save his former boss. He hits a few bumps which causes alterations in his strategy that he adjusts too albeit he is putting himself at increased risks.\nThe story is fascinating, the dialogue brilliant and it has that dark comedy aspect.\nI've seen reviewers upset about an implied homosexual love triangle between the Italian underboss, his bookie, and the bookie who created the situation the protagonist has to dig himself out of. The comments are about the lack of focus on those 1920s/30s homosexual Taboo. I disagree because outside of their being homosexuality prevalent in the time period and gang culture I believe outside of the connection of those characters and how the protagonists utilizes it to dig himself out of his problems their sexual behavior isn't relevant.\n**** To me The Godfather films are a romanticized view of organized crime but outside of Santino doesn't emphasize the activity aspect of the five families and the bosses are presented like a board of trustees.\nThis film, Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brosco, and the Sopranos have a much better depiction of the internal organized crime scene.",

How can he make an honest crooked living?  It is also evident in a couple of the gunfights where machine guns never run out of bullets and the good guy never gets hit.

Both opening in Sept 1990, GoodFellas proving big box-office while Millers we'd only discover years later, yet both styled so different beyond their respective Italian and Irish motifs, so unique that each might be called its own genre. Scorsese creates a wealth of memorable moments both funny and fearsome through imagery (Bass titles are genius) and compilation soundtrack that mitigate the post-War, mob-a-day life. The Coen brothers borrow a page from Dashiell Hammett's The-Glass-Key in featuring a traditional love triangle (Leo Verna Tom) interlocking with another variety (Dane Mink Bernie), only to see them separate like magic rings.Gabriel Byrne stars as an aide-de-camp to pre-War crime boss Albert (Leo) Finney, Tom the smartest guy in town yet makes luck o' the Irish sound an empty boast. When contemplative capo regime Caspar, played memorably by Jon Polito, discovers a bookie (Turturro) is chiseling-in on his fight fixing scheme but fails to elicit a punitive response from the biased boss, the family man goes to war (scenes with his son {Mounicou} are incredible). And keep your eyes peeled for an early, uncredited Frances McDormand performance as the Mayor's nonchalant secretary: AA: \"Where ya' been keeping' yourself? Tommy: Hither & yon.\" Millers has the same addictive violence as GoodFellas but the better story, more developed characters, displays its own rich, Depression-era imagery, a terrific score (Burwell) and most important to the Classics, made sentiment its central emotion through friendship, loyalty & love, all moving it nearer to perfection. Both uncommon class, I call Crossing the winner by a nose (4/4).",

I've seen this movie at least ten times and I still find it intriguing, beautiful and bitter at the same time.It's no secret it's made with clich\u00e9s and an all to gritty dialouge, and that what's make it beautiful.It's a bootlegger paradise and anyone romantic about the 1920's has got to love this.Lines like: \"He's still an artist with the Thompson\" and \"Maybe we can have tea some day.\" Is probably lines never said outside the world of movies and old Dashiell Hammet novels but it still works.And it has everything what one can want, Irish, Italian and Jewish gangsters, an imbecile boxer, a femme fatale, a plethora of costume and paraphernalia that just shines in every scene.The humor and the horror is equally present and makes this one for all breeds.SPOILERS: And to add to the classic setting of a fantasy, gangster cityscape it probably contains two of the most sadistic, horrible shoot outs in my regards. Albert Finney turning the Italian hit-man into lead-pie, a killing that never seems to end, suspended in time and than the army of police men turning the Irish Club Erin into Masada acts cayenne to this stew of pleasurable viewing.In my regards one of the best Coen-flicks and gangster movies",

            "content": "Millers Crossing is the Coen brother's take on the classic prohibition era gangster movie and it has many of the hallmarks of their unique style.The story is simple and quite clich\u00e9d really. The Irish American crime boss Leo (Albert Finney) has the authorities in his pocket as he runs his empire smoothly. However there is trouble on the horizon as one of the smaller gang leaders Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) wants his permission to kill a crooked bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro). However Finney is in love with Turturro's sister (Marcia Gay Harden) and refuses.The film is told from the point of view of Finney's trusted lieutenant, Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne. He advises Finney not to let personal feelings impact on business decisions, but to no avail and things spiral out of control.The film is full of the double crossing and violence you would expect from an old-fashioned gangster movie. However the distinctive Coen style is what sets it apart. They pay homage to the great gangster movies of the past rather than telling a gangster story per se. There are some great set piece scenes, almost cartoonish violence and razor sharp dialogue. The costumes and sets are perfect in helping to bring us back to the golden age of gangster movies.The Coens seem more interested in style at the expense of character development so the cast don't have to display their undoubted talents. However Turturro is worthy of special mention for his turn as the sleazy bookie. I thought Byrne's Tom Regan comes across as a wisecracking know-it-all and I found it hard to have much sympathy with him. I found the other characters more appealing, for all their faults.I hadn't seen this film in a while and was perhaps expecting too much but it is still one of the landmark movies in the careers of these geniuses of modern cinema.",

            "content": "In this bubbling Coen gangster story, Gabriel Byrne plays heartless hit-man Tom Reagan who struggles to keep the peace between his Irish boss Leo and the rival Italian boss Caspar. In the seedy 1930's prohibition and depression era setting, people are both morally and economically bankrupt \u0096 which means a whole lot of violence, hard-boiled jargon and complex relations that can set off the balance of an uneasy peace.Miller's Crossing successfully combines the gritty gangster tone of 1930's with the glossy noir of the 1940s, creating a film so sprawling with contemporary crime surges that every scene acts as an invitation to soak up the wonderful atmosphere. With all of its hard-edged gangsters and its token femme fatale (Marcia Gay Harden, a dutiful Coen inclusion), it becomes a downright pastiche of the morally corrupt underworld that so many directors have recreated in previous decades. It needs to be said that Coens greatly prefer individual scenes to continuity and as a result, the already dizzying plot becomes more difficult to follow. Names like 'Mink', 'Leo', 'Caspar' and 'Bernie' snapple and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. The audience is left befuddled at the mess but arguably this is a large part of Miller's Crossing's appeal \u0096 it offers a big slice of the era rather than a well-sketched story.The acting, by contrast, is simply top-notch. Gabriel Byrne brings calculating intensity to Tom Reagan, John Turturro goes the extra mile and gives an unspeakably emotive performance as he prays of his life and Albert Finney is amazingly hard-edged and no-nonsense as crime boss Leo. Together the triumvirate of skilled actors \u0096 along with a wide-ranging cast of mandatory Coen actors \u0096 blow smoke, down whisky, gamble, cheat, fix and beat up every chance they get. The dialogue between them is compelling, fluent and viciously quotable with token 30's expressions like \"chewing the fat\" that form part of the love letter to the depression era.Miller's Crossing in its entirety boasts of no mindblowing appeal and it is mostly talk and little action. Dissecting its individual parts, however, and it becomes a truly great film with scenes so memorable and poignant that it floors you. The warehouse chair fight. Albert Finney defending himself in his own house with a machine gun. John Turturro kneeling and begging for his life. Tom's ominous hat flowing off. This is Coen in his element and if you are even a slight fan of the latter I urge you to see Miller's Crossing.7.5 out of 10",

The over-complex plot lacked credibility, with the main characters behaving in such a dim-witted manner that they'd never have survived a day in the world of crime, let alone risen to the top. A lot of the violence is exaggerated, with a cartoon-like quality. As a result, the movie lacked any real dramatic tension. Perhaps the film was intended to be a pastiche, but it didn't work for me on that level either.The lead character, Tom Regan, spoke all his lines in a laconic monotone which became very irritating very quickly. It was also never clear why the gangland bosses valued his contributions so highly, or his lady-friend found him attractive.The dialogue between the characters was always very arch and snappy, but this had the effect of nullifying any impetus to develop our understanding of them as real people. The relentless nature of the script seemed to overwhelm the movie, rather than contribute any real energy.I don't think I've seen a movie where so much effort and indeed talent has been wasted. It is so much less than the sum of its parts, though I suspect it may be those parts, taken in isolation, that may impress some punters. Each to his own, of course.",

The comments here have touched on the many fine points that make this a paragon of the genre of film noir but let just say something about the music.  Carter Burwell, who has done a number of things with the Coens has outdone himself.  The opening credits begin with an oboe solo playing the haunting traditional Irish theme Limerick Lament which is spliced in several places throughout the film and then returns as the final credits role.  Now, as an oboist and fanatic fan of traditional Irish music, I was taken in from the start.  But, Burwell's other pieces and arrangements work so well with the whole film.

It is seemingly the tale of an amoral existentialist hero, Tom Reagan, negotiating his way through a complex situation, rather in the manner of a Jean-Pierre Melville film such as 'Le Doulos' or 'Le Samourai'. However the film is deeply concerned with questions of loyalty and obligation, and Tom's final choice is actually moral one. The film is carefully shot in an autumnal palate but is staged without extravagance and makes excellent use of the interior sets and few locations. The tight structure and deliberate air of unreality, which is heightened by deft comic touches, separates this from more portentous crime dramas such as 'The Godfather' or 'Once upon a time in America', and gives 'Miller's Crossing' its own unique place in the genre.",

At times, it's all three and can't figure itself out. Gabriel Byrne's performance was underwhelming. He looked as bored as I was watching this movie. The characters are all unlikeable. By the end, you want them all to die. Only pretentious, faux-intellectual, artsy types would like this film. I'm generally a Coen Brothers fan, but this movie made me very angry watching it, mainly because I wasted two hours of my life.

            "content": "MILLER'S CROSSING is an ambitious outing from the Coen Brothers, considering their previous credits included a low-budget Noir (BLOOD SIMPLE) and a hysterically ridiculous comedy (RAISING ARIZONA).  This film truly put them on the map of fans and critics alike on a broad scale.  They also did an ingenious job of casting by bringing the always interesting Albert Finney on to play the head of the Irish mob, Leo.  MILLER'S CROSSING is another mob movie from 1990, the year of the mob come-back with GOODFELLAS and THE GRIFTERS.  This one is shot in beautiful period style (1930's) and has some of the best nicknames of mafia henchmen in the history of the genre. Sometimes, the nicknames can lead to confusion as to who the characters are discussing or how the plot is evolving.  When you have a \"Caspar\" and the \"Dane\" mixing with \"Leo\", \"Tic-Tac\", and \"Mink\", you tend to lose some dialogue along the way.  However, the Coens have created a wonderfully original world and use a blowing hat to symbolize the film's most important plot elements.Barry Sonnenfeld is back to shoot with the Coens and adds to his ever-growing list of good-looking films.  It is no wonder he became a talented director later on with MEN IN BLACK and GET SHORTY.  If you notice, whenever a character is not wearing their always treasured hat, they are at their most vulnerable.  John Turturro, as the sad-sack gambler \"Bernie\", pleads for his life in the woods, bloody and hatless.  Miller's Crossing is where the mobsters take their unwanted prey and properly dispose of them. Some very suspenseful scenes occur in the innocent greenlands of these woods.  At one point, Gabriel Byrne (in a crass, wiseguy role) is walking towards possible doom at the Crossing when he looks up at the trees.  They signify nature and how disastrous and evil events can happen under the most simplest pieces of life.A blowing hat is the keystone of the film's title sequence.  It blows innocently away and, in essence, leads us into the underworld the Coens have created.  An awesome shoot-out scene with Finney is incredibly well-done. It all happens so fast you long for it to go on.  Finney does some pretty acrobatic things and appears impenetrable as he just follows his would-be assassins with a blaring tommy-gun.  Many shocking scenes of violence play out and pay off by film's end, a nod towards the famous ending of THE THIRD MAN. Joseph Cotten had his hat on when he lost out on life and simply tosses his cigarette in disgust in THIRD MAN.  MILLER'S CROSSING is more of a character study of the Gabriel Byrne character, because when you think about it, the story does indeed revolve around his questionable actions.  It is a good performance amongst some beautiful sets and old cars that echo, yet again, a time that seemed more innocent, but was just as bloody and reckless as society now.  If only it could be as bloodless as the blowing hat.",

            "content": "Undoubtedly one of the great contemporary noir exercises, MILLER'S CROSSING is a highly potent and quixotic mix of grossly exaggerated caricatures and subtly underplayed winks. The storyline is remarkably adept at confounding expectations while still playing basically fair with the facts, which is high praise, given the state of modern cinema. The production values are high, the cinematography is solid, the dialogue crackles, the red herrings abound, and there is sex and violence aplenty (including a raging love triangle between the two goodguys and a hooker, no less).And yet...this is still one coldblooded and convoluted Coen Bros. effort. There is not a single character who isn't working all the angles and there's quite a bit to track. Gabriel Byrne in particular is confoundingly inscrutable; we're never quite sure whose side he's on which makes the rooting interests confusing. Albert Finney is winning and likable in a flashy but over the top mafioso role. Marcia Gay Harden also shines as the hooker with a heart of hot lead. Jon Polito is hilarious and completely hamfisted as the man constantly being given \"the high hat.\" In the end, though, John Turturro steals the proceedings with his amazingly slithery and greasy portrayal of the ever adaptable Bernie Bernbaum. Turturro has the benefit of a great part in a great script and he makes the most of it. Still, with all of the triple crosses, it took two viewings for me to figure everything out and I suspect most might benefit from a second look. It's a bit confusing to sort.The overall result is an amazingly well-conceived script. Every main character is integral to the story and the Coen Bros. economy in their utilization and integration has never been better. Cold, dense and complex, MILLER's CROSSING is probably among the best three or four plotted noirs in the last quarter century. If you don't have patience for the cognitive dissonance in movies like MEMENTO or MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you may want to pass on this one. However, if you're a fan of this kind of pulpy noir / crime drama, this movie is a must see and one you'll probably review again shortly thereafter. 9.5 / 10",

Just the great first picture with the ice falling into the glass ...'Miller's Crossing' is not a common crime-movie. It has elements of film noir and mobster-movies from the first generation (1930's) rather than from the second generation (1970's). The Coen-brothers doesn't try to hide that they have been inspired by the novels of Dashiell Hammett. For the first time, a movie filled with different important characters works perfect. I could understand the complicated relationships between all the people, and because I did, 'Miller's Crossing' became amazing. Everything seems so realistic but yet twisted, which is the greatness with 'Miller's Crossing'. It is so unpredictable and unconventional at the same time.

Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough.I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "I've been on the fence about this one because on the one hand I tend to find the Coen brothers' \"genre films\" less interesting than their genre-crossing films (admittedly the distinction is vague to non-existent, but I feel like True Grit is Coens doing western, something like Intolerable Cruelty is them doing romcom and this is them doing a gangster film, whereas movies like The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou? find them doing more of their own thing), but on the other hand, they again and again prove that they can master every genre they take on, and perhaps none better than Miller's Crossing's gangster film. Here, the brooding mood and the dryly humorous dialogue really shine, and Gabriel Byrne's amazing character is so hard-boiled and taciturn that he would fit just as well in a noir. He rarely speaks, but when he does, he seems to be little concerned with whether or not his comment will result in a punch in the face; in fact, the way he gets slapped around becomes a running gag of sorts.The opening reference to The Godfather suggests that we're in for a traditional gangster fare, but as often with the Coens, they strike a balance between homage and subversion by exploring themes beyond the surface plot. Here, they use the amoral American prohibition-era setting to delve into questions of morality in a more philosophical way than other gangster films (that might sound a little pretentious but the film is anything but) \u2013 what place it has within the world of crime, and where our moral decisions take us. Ethics is \"what separates us from the animals\", Johnny Caspar (played by a sleazier-than-ever (perhaps bar Coens' own The Man Who Wasn't There) Jon Polito) speculates, an interesting hypothesis that sheds little light on how the intricate relations of Miller's Crossing will play out, but we do learn that the line of separation is thin and vague. A more straightforward question is raised by Caspar later in the film: \"you double-cross once, where's it all end?\" Miller's Crossing ends when there's no one left to cross.",

Most movies they've made have had great stories, a great entertainment value clubbed with fabulous performances.\"Miller's Crossing\" is no different.

Things take a turn for the worse when Leo refuses to comply with Caspar about getting rid of one bookie who he feels has been cheating him. The story continues and what follows is a thrilling tale of double-cross and shifting loyalties.Right from the opening sequence (\"I'm talking' about friendship....\"), in which the brilliant Jon Polito as Johnny Caspar is relating his problem to Leo (Finney), this film makes an impression and it is immediately clear that the rest of the film is going to be just as impressive!The performances are all top-notch, including John Turturro, Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Jon Polito and J.E. Freeman. Marcia Gay Harden is decent as well.On the technical front, cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld is superb...so is the haunting musical score by Carter Burwell. The film has been edited really well. The dialogs are superb and well-written!

Basically set in Prohibition era 1930s, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is the adviser and right hand man for Irish mobster and political boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney). Italian racketeer and Leo's partner Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) announces his intent to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (Quiz Show's John Turturro), against Tom's advice he extends his protection to Bernie, Verna Bernbaum (Pollock's Marcia Gay Harden) is Bernie's brother, she is in a relationship with Leo, but continues an affair with Tom. To end the war, Tom tries to convince Leo to give up Bernie to Caspar, he attempts to convince him he is being played by Verna to protect her brother, but Leo is not swayed, and after an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom reveals his affair with Verna to prove her dishonesty, Leo only beats her and turns his back on them both. Tom approaches Caspar for work, to prove his loyalty Caspar commands him to kill Bernie at Miller's Crossing, Bernie is taken into the woods, he begs Tom to spare him, saying \"Look into your heart\", Tom fires the gun to fake the murder, he tells Bernie to run and hide. Caspar assumes Leo's position as boss of the city, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations, meanwhile Tom begins settling disagreements between Caspar and his trusted but brutal and homosexual enforcer Eddie \"the Dane\" Dane (J.E. Freeman). Dane confirms that Tom's men did not see him murder Bernie, he is taken to Miller's Crossing to find Bernie's body, Tom nearly cracks as they near the location, but they find a body that has been shot in the face and birds have disfigured him. Tom finds out that Bernie returned, killed Dane's lover Mink (Steve Buscemi), also his lover, and placed his body in the woods, Bernie tries to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar. Eddie Dane denies betraying Caspar, after Tom uses Mink's unknown whereabouts to convince Caspar, he needs to decide who to trust and who to kill, in rage Caspar beats Dane before shooting him in the head, Tom then arranges a meeting between Caspar and Bernie, Caspar is under the pretext that he will be meeting Mink. Bernie gets the jump on Caspar and kills him, Tom arrives after this and tricks Bernie into handing over his gun, after a discussion of who will be blamed and the retribution for blackmailing Bernie again blames Tom to spare his life, saying \"Look into your heart\", Tom replies \"What heart?\" and shoots him. With Caspar and Eddie Dane dead, Leo resumes his position as top boss, Verna has her way back Leo's trust, but reacts coldly towards Tom, on the day Bernie is buried Leo announces he and Verna are engaged, he also offers Tom his job back, Tom refuses and stands back watching Leo depart, the future is questionable. Also starring Mike Starr as Frankie, Al Mancini as Tic-Tac, Richard Woods as Mayor Dale Levander, Thomas Toner as O'Doole, Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Tad, Michael Jeter as Adolph, Sam Raimi as Snickering Gunman and Frances McDormand as Mayor's Secretary. Byrne is brilliant as the cool, calculating man behind the throne of the boss, Finney is impressive, Harden gives a great Bette Davis style performance as the woman two men are in love with, and supporting actors like Polito and Turturro give terrific performances as well. I will be completely honest and say that I had to really concentrate to understand everything going on, but even if I didn't it had plenty of moments to remember, including the gory assassination attempt with guns blazing, there are some perfectly over-the-top violent sequences, it is a well written, well acted and has all the right ingredients to keep you fixed, a satisfactory neo-noir black comedy crime drama.

            "content": "A strange little film. Once again the Coen Brothers want to make an anti-genre film. This time they attack the genre of the gangster mafia in an eastern city that does not need a name but has to be big during prohibition. That mafia is working in clubs with bars and gambling tables, and in racketeering for protection. Two rival gangs and one chap taken in between Irish and Italian bosses or would-like-to-be-sole bosses. He has an affair with the girl friend of the Irish man and he shifts to the other side but then he is demanded to execute the brother of the woman, which he fakes and then this brother turns against him and he finally manages, after many sessions of punching and upper cutting that leave him every time healthy and strong, to trick and trap the brother who belongs to the Irish gang and the Italian boss into confronting each other at his own place and the brother kills the Italian boss and our man kills the brother and disguises the two deaths in a mutual gun fight and killing. He is back with his first boss the surviving Irish man who is going to marry the woman of before and forgives our man. But this one refuses that forgiveness that he has not asked and walks away. We will note a slight touch of Jewishness on that Irish man for the funeral of the brother. The cops in that prohibition situation are providing the street entertainment and the cleaning sessions in some clubs that are so wide open that a whole brigade of cops could run in without breaking the slightest piece of glass. But the best part remains the machine gun fights between the Irish boss and the hit men sent to assassinate him by the competitor. The chandelier turns into a \"windmill\" that is in fact a \"bullet mill\" and it is funny though it lasts only a second. Overkill is the motto and so many bullets and noise for just nothing is like using the space shuttle to go buy your daily bread at the next block bakery.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

Stylized and much atmospheric photography and direction. Music that gets under your skin and performances that stay with you forever.The film makers could have been influenced by \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) but they have made a one-of-a-kind film with Miller's Crossing. Its a story about a gambler with dark motives, who is taking advantage of the conflict going on between two rival gangster groups. He moves among the two groups, with a moral code all of his own, while carrying out a highly intellectual and dark Machiavellian plan.The script is excellent and along with the brilliant acting, all moving through a very atmospheric underworld, exploring themes like friendship, betrayal, once put together they all make a small masterpiece. Perhaps (in my opinion) the Coen's best film. Gabriel Byrne is FLAWLESS as \"Tom Reagan\". He creates the type of character that stays with you forever, and he does it with simplicity. Probably among one of the most complex characters ever written. Full of dualities (as most Noir characters should be) and of course \"damned\" and self destructive (by choice).To sum up, this is definitely one of those films someone has to see a second time (as with most brilliant films). It's a guarantee you will see new things each time you watch it.Excellent!",

            "content": "Famously pulling from other gangster films, film noir, and Dashiell Hammett novels, the Coens cook up a coldly volatile tale following Gabriel Byrne, a samurai-like Irish mobster who is right hand to stubborn crime boss Albert Finney, who dismisses Byrne's advice to accommodate the ambitious Italian, hilariously animated Jon Polito, and when caught in a gang war Byrne finds that he's more at home looking out for his own interests. Albert Finney was born to play a mob boss. That's just the way he's wired. He has the look and the personality that can take on a character like that. I've never been a very big fan of Gabriel Byrne and can't make myself like his presence, however he never ruins a movie for me, for he was in The Usual Suspects, and here in Miller's Crossing, there's no denying he is good. Miller's Crossing is the sort of film that you cannot stop once you start, because it creates an entire world and seclusively involves all of the actors, camera, dialogue, and tone.The dialogue, for instance, takes you on a long, fun, rhythmic ride, partially mimicking noirs like Double Indemnity or The Big Sleep and detective novels, but really using the familiar earthy style as a springboard to transcend it with its own lightning-quick, exhaustingly sharp semantic understanding throughout the film's created universe. It's just a riveting entertainment, boosted by very small clever touches in the story that turn into powerful blots.The movie's biggest highlight is the uproarious Jon Polito as the Italian boss whose temper and animation are those of cartoon characters that Bugs Bunny would outsmart much to our enjoyment.The score unfortunately guts the atmosphere that is promised by a magnificently stylish scene early on when Finney confronts hit men in a Tommy gun fight in and outside of his house while his Megaphone plays Ol' Danny Boy. But that's not to say it severs you from the movie's tractor beam, which is quite a strong one.",

            "content": "Widely regarded as the Coens' best film alongside Fargo, Miller's Crossing is a quite singular take on the gangster genre, worth contrasting to the more \"classic\" Goodfellas: ostensibly an homage to Dashiell Hammett, it is in fact a pure Coen brothers' movie (though not as pure as Fargo), replete as it is with their trademark sharp writing, cold but gorgeous visuals and superb performances.The incredibly complex screenplay revolves around a Jewish bookie, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro, in his first Coen film). Apparently, he has angered an Italian boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), a volatile fella who wants him dead, plain and simple. However, Irish leader Leo O' Bannion (Albert Finney) disagrees, mainly because Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is his mistress. And in between these two stands Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), a taciturn, calculating hit-man who has an agenda of his own, derived from a bizarre moral code and a tendency to favor rationality over violence. The full extent of his involvement is too complicated to explain - the fact that he's sleeping with Verna and has huge gambling debts is just the tip of the iceberg.The Coens' detractors often accuse them of creating beautifully framed yet hollow pictures, their characters being ice-cold constructions instead of human beings. Miller's Crossing proves, perhaps better than any other film, that statement's lack of veracity: it's the characters and their interactions that carry the narrative. In fact, more often than not they're what keeps the viewer alert in spite of the labyrinthine plot. Exactly who is double-crossing who and why might not seem clear at first, but seeing those people talk and act in a universe that gets more violent by the minute gives the film that special something that separates it from lesser crime movies.Byrne, being the one who has to guide us through the entire feature, is cold and seemingly merciless, but beneath the icy facade lies a warmth that makes his performance all the more effective. Finney plays to similar strengths, giving the impression of his godfather being an old fool and then showing he is actually the most dangerous person around. Polito, Harden and J.E. Freeman (Eddie Dane) are asked to play their roles (edgy boss, femme fatale and psychotic henchman respectively) by the book and do so while still adding that peculiar Coen ingredient, and Steve Buscemi's one-scene appearance provides some fun amongst the mayhem. And then there's Turturro, the man without whom the movie would, in a way, fall flat: his character is the MacGuffin that sets everything in motion, an opportunistic, unreliable scumbag to whom the actor gives life with a subtle, creepy intensity. Perhaps he's the reason the Coens are accused of coldness: the critics saw how chilly Bernie was in his actions and found it apt to brand everyone involved with the same adjective. How wrong were they: Miller's Crossing is a piece of cinema that will mesmerize, move and terrify in equal measure, a gangster picture that diverts from conventions by sticking to them.

It has to show some aspect that other movie's don't, or else it's just your average mob movie. \"Miller's Crossing\" takes from all the mobster and gangster films, along with other movies, but at the same time it's so original. The cinematography is beautiful, and the characters are uniquely molded, as is the plot. This is one of the Coen's best films, and one of the better mobster movies ever released.Two gangs are fighting, and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is right in the middle. He first works for Leo (Albert Finney) and his Irish mob, but after sleeping with his lady Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) he is kicked out. He then goes to Johnny Caspar (John Polito), the Italian crime boss. Tom's first order of business is to kill bookie, Bernie (John Turturro). Bernie is the brother of Verna, who Tom has fallen for. In the end, what we have is a tale of finding compassion, and having morals (no matter how backwards they are).The highlight of every Coen brothers film is the lovely camera work. They always have good acting, an original and darkly funny story, but on top of everything, the camera work always stands out. Each shot is set up as perfectly as it could be and this is a great looking film.Gabriel Byrne is a very good lead, and my only gripe is sometimes I couldn't decipher what he was saying beneath that thick Irish accent. The accent was necessary for the character, so it's not even really a gripe. Albert Finney didn't have a whole lot of screen time, but he grabbed all he could from what he does have. Whoever knew a scene with Finney shooting a nobody with a tommy gun could be so dramatic. John Polito is menacing. John Turturro is excellent as a coward posing as a slick tough guy. Marcia Gay Harden gives a wonderfully reserved performance. Wonderful performances all around.This is the Coen brother's first film to be both humorous and dramatic. The drama is plentiful as is the suspense, even with characters who weren't created to be cared about. When Tom stands in the forest deciding whether or not to shoot Bernie, my heart was racing, and I could have cared less about Bernie. The cops who give into the mob's every whim and tip their hats to Tom are humorous. This is more action and drama, but there is still a perfect amount of humor thrown in.Overall, this is an excellent mob movie, with inspired performances, an original plot, nice looking cinematography and typical Coen brilliance found everywhere.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 115 mins.

The story is pretty clever and everyone does what's expected from him. The little things make this movie a little better than just good. The opening shot is one of them. The dialogue is another, although sometimes it feels a little too clever for real people. I also had that with 'Pulp Fiction'. There it worked really well, here it works really well for most of the time. As you expect from the Coens everything looks great. I mentioned the opening shot but there are more. In one scene a whole police force is shooting at a club because there is someone in that club shooting at them. It looks beautiful. And I must not forget the performances.

            "content": "To this day, it still amazes me how much this film went by the wayside in 1990. Granted, Goodfellas was a masterpiece, but I find Miller's Crossing to be beyond brilliant. The Coens accomplished something in this film that Scorsese could never begin to imagine. While being an underrated classic, Miller's Crossing is a triumphant tale of expecting the unexpected. As the tag line states, \"Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems\". Gabriel Byrne's performance of Tom Reagan is flawless, genuine, and unforgettable. Jon Polito, John Tuturro, Albert Finney, J.E. Freeman and Marcia Gay Harden also deserve the same recognition for their stunning performances. No other film, in the history of cinema, has ever felt so magical and alive. From beginning to end, MC is filled with twists and turns that make you feel like you hope the movie will never end.The scenes themselves are like something out of a Picasso painting. Rather than rambling on, I'll name a few of my favorites: -the opening scene with Caspar, Tom, and Leo -the unforgettable \"Danny Boy\" scene with Leo -\"Bernie's walk\" into the depths of Miller's Crossing -Tom opening up to Leo about he and VernaI could go on forever. Every scene is instantly classic, with a touch of gold from the Coens.In addition to the beautiful cinematography, the dialogue is sheer genius. While I enjoy every single line in the film, I particularly loved what Tom, Leo, and Caspar had to say. If there was ever I movie that I could nearly quote from beginning to end, it would most certainly be Miller's Crossing.What else could possibly add to a flawless movie? Carter Burwell's score. While Burwell is known for his excellent scores in Fargo and Barton Fink, he truly achieved greatness with the Miller's Crossing score.The thing to walk away from with a film like Miller's Crossing can easily be summed up by the film's tag line: \"Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems\". Not only does this concept apply to the plot of the film, but it applies to the viewer's expectations. Most people who walked into the theater in 1990 were expecting a typical gangster film, like The Godfather or Once Upon A Time In America. What they got was the exact opposite. Rather than seeing one-sided mobsters carry out the wishes of their boss, we see a rebellious Tom Reagan who has had enough with Leo's stubborn and egotistical judgments. With that in mind, the viewer sees an organized crime boss turned on his heels and thrown to the whim of an ex-underling.",

            "review_title": "One of the most powerful uses of dialogue in modern film!",
            "content": "A rare gem of film that has remained relatively unacknowledged (when compared to more commercially successful Coen brothers films), Miller's Crossing stands alongside The Big Lebowski as the Coen's best film to date and indeed as one of the finest examples of it's genre whether that be the Gangster or Noir genre. This is a film that boasts perfection from all quarters from the acting, the casting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, to the scoring.Of course, its standout strength is the dialogue which is not only the best example of Coen dialogue but perhaps the most powerful use of dialogue in modern film. The main thrust of the film's quick and steady pace comes from the lyrical and relentless back and forth between the film's characters (and in typical Noir fashion, this is usually between Tom and someone else).As is the case in most films, the level of the writing raises the level of the acting. Each of the actors' performances are first rate and indeed there are many career bests given here. When I lament the fact that the likes of Pachino and De Niro don't consistently produce the quality they did in the 70's and early 80's, I remind myself that we just don't have the quality of writing as we did then and while films have become better in other respects they've never quite reached the same heights from the point of view of the writing. Joel and Ethan Coen are amongst a relatively small number of contemporary writers who are consistently working on that level and Miller's Crossing is the perfect example of great actors being fueled by great writing. Finney and Polita clearly revel in the expounding of their luscious lines while J.E. Freeman simply burns a whole in the screen. Of course, this is Byrne's film from start to finish and he carries it well with a distinct and unique brand of cool as he delivers immortal line after immortal line with pure gusto.Those who claim the violence in this film is gratuitous need to re-watch. For example, in the most violent scene involving Casper and the Dane, the violence is used to illustrate the complex aspects to Casper's character (e.g., his paternal attitude towards his 'boys' and his sociopathic attitude towards killing; his adherence to ethics and his vengeance against those who betray theirs). On top of that, speaking from a technical point of view, violence in Coen films is typically choreographed into the action scenes in a relatively artistic manner where it is used as a counterpoint or visual exclamation mark to augment and punctuate the action and/or tension of a scene. Nowhere is this more true than in Miller's Crossing a film that boasts some of the Coens most memorable and best choreographed action scenes.As for the symbolism of the hat and the dream sequence where Tom must chase his, I heard before that the Coens claim there was none. This is difficult to believe as the film is very much about thinking oneself out of problems and not loosing one's head and Tom himself explicitly equates thinking to hats during the film. But that's the great thing about symbolism in clever films - there's a lot one can make of even a hat.",

            "content": "Tom:  \"I don't hate anyone.\"Verna:  \"Or like anyone.\"Tom Reagan is a smart guy.  Easily the smartest gangster in the circles he travels in.  He sees all the angles and knows all the right plays to make. But he is a terrible gambler, as his outstanding debts to Lazarre will attest.  Why is that?  Simple:  this is a man who wants to lose.  He has brains, but no heart, he knows it, and he can't stand it.  How else to explain the actions of a man who could easily run the whole town yet who manages to screw himself out of everything?This, I believe, is what gives Miller's Crossing its resonance for those of us who champion the film to the mostly indifferent masses. The movie itself is a caricature of a gangster film, with a nicely twisting and turning plot, as should be expected from the Coen brothers, but at its center is Tom, tragic in his own mind.  How a viewer reacts to this character will determine his or her feelings about the film.  If you see some (maybe even too much) of yourself in his cynical nature, his orchestration of events which lead to his being repeatedly beaten and having his life threatened, and culminating in the complete loss of his former stature and the woman he almost loved, can be pretty affecting.  On the other hand, the character might understandably leave the viewer cold or even contemptuous of his behavior.  In this case, someone might admire some aspects of the film but feel the movie is without a heart, and this person would not be wrong.Regardless of how one feels about Tom's apparent masochism, the film has some undeniably wonderful scenes (which I won't spoil here), first-rate acting all around, and another beautiful score by Carter Burwell, who has yet to disappoint me.  And despite the impression someone might get from my analysis of Tom Reagan, this is a movie with sometimes hilarious rapid-fire dialogue, especially whenever Tom is dealing with people he doesn't like. Which is nearly every scene he is in.  Like Rick Blaine in Casablanca, Tom Reagan is a master of projecting his cynicism onto others with effortless sarcasm.And also like Rick Blaine, he always does it without a smile.",

In it, a mob war erupts when an Irish crime boss foolishly takes a stand to protect his lover's brother. It soon becomes apparent that just about everybody has an angle to play and it's up to the one man who sees all of the angles to try to keep the peace.The cast is excellent.

There's also quality work here from Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro & J.E.

At the end, Leo walks away from Tom, at Miller's Crossing ...And that is the summum bonum of the entire film ... the slow turning of the tables. The entire experience remains unforgettable even for the unpredictability and ambivalence Byrne brings to his portrayal of Tom Regan, imbuing the character with an underlying menace which pervades his portrayal throughout, so that his query, towards the memorable close of the film, \"What heart?\" assumes a significance all its own. Though John Turturro's turn as the homosexual Bernie Bernbaum is often touted as the star performance in the film, I myself was not so enthralled by it; the character appears to me to be a bit sketchily drawn, with some gaps remaining to be filled in. And Turturro, in my view, pitches his act just a wee bit overboard, so that it does not remain entirely credible.No ... The film, in my view, belongs to Byrne and Byrne alone. Further, it is also memorable because it essentially abandons the usual bullets-and-bloodshed formula which most gangster epics adopt, and concentrates on the psychological aspect of the whole thing ... it's a fascinating exercise in mindplay and, perhaps for that very reason, is intellectually draining as well.What was going on in Tom's mind at the end of it all?

The complex plot may require an additional viewing or more to capture all the nuances that make up a terrific story, that at it's core, is less gangster movie and more of an existential meditation. I can think of no other movie with writing as good as this. Simply masterful, it is laced with dark humor and acerbic wit, and once you put all the pieces of the puzzle together, you realize what a tremendous achievement the film really is.

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is the superb gangster drama not necessarily covering the exploits of a man who is a gangster. Certainly, the lead is surrounded by organised crime and folk more apt to the gangster or criminal way of life, but he is more shrewd; he's the weakest, and certainly one of the more soft bodied characters in the piece, but almost certainly one of the more intelligent. If most crime dramas, of this ilk or otherwise, appear to revolve around tough guys doing what they do and throwing their weight around in getting what they want, using their minds only when they're required to get the upper hand in an aggressive conflict, Miller's Crossing is about a guy whom trembles at the thought of having to kill someone, but is instead able-bodied enough to balance several relations with some rather unremitting people. We enjoy the film that is born out of this notion, the film driven by a man getting on with things via his mouth and his mind, not his aggression; items which bring about great dialogue and twisting, turning narratives we are asked to keep up with rather than wall to wall stunts.Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, a likable Irish-American rouge in amidst the filthy upper echelons of a crime syndicate in an unspecified American city during the time of prohibition. He stands, in his bosses office, as the Coen's open their film in a fashion akin to that of The Godfather: a long take of a man speaking in a gangster's office relaying a 'pitch' to a rival gangster; a man outlining this-and-that to someone whilst going on at length about an issue which means a great deal to him. We cover a chapter in the life of a middleman, a middleman intermingling with several parties more broadly representing the amoral American dream; a guy hopping around from camp to camp and ultimately getting himself up to his neck in trouble as a result of his actions. When the time comes for Tom's boss to speak, the film has both men clash over what it is that either party desire, establishing conflict but either of their respectively stubborn natures so as not to be threatened in what is a threatening environment. The individual whom speaks first, the Italian-American Johnny Caspar (Polito), wants a man dead; Tom's boss, Leo (Finney), a power-mad gangster with delusions that he is invincible, doesn't, and the film constructs Tom's own manoeuvring around the screen in a fashion that has him blend into both mob bosses compositions \u2013 thus, alluding to a greater extent of cross pollination which will come about later on.There is a theory more broadly linked to that of writings on the genre of film noir that classical leads of said genre struggle to come to terms with their environment when they are let loose from the locale of the urban, crime drenched city and placed into a countryside. Historically, leads of film's such as Miller's Crossing have flagged in rural-inclined places of trees and fields and farms, or whatnot; the film's unnerving cut, to what looks like the perspective of someone looking directly upwards at the sky during a process of being carried on something, greets us after this office-set opening \u2013 is it a person's literal perspective? Is that person perhaps dead? The locale will come to play a greater part in the film later on, the name of this place being the titular Miller's Crossing; a zone on the outskirts of the city in which those therein are permitted to extend their travels in another direction; a fork to other place, if you will - a later scene of great intensity acting as the stepping stone to a bleaker, more cold blooded existence for our lead Tom away from the path to that of what he's presently on.The narrative is what it is, a water-tight labyrinth that takes care of itself; we enjoy our lead's company and aligned ourselves with him enough to become greatly enthused in his ventures that come to feature an array of other lowlifes as a mob war comes to break out around him. Other prominent players in Tom's life lie in the form of the girlfriend to Leo in Verna (Gay Harden), as well as John Turturro's feral gambler Bernie Bernbaum; Verna wears very little when we first see her interact with Tom, and the tone of their conversation encapsulates the nature of the world they occupy: blunt and dry in spite of the fact they're quite close. We identify that he's there to collect his hat at her place, which he left having been too intoxicated to remember to take it, and there is this prominent sense of Tom walking a fine line in his life when it becomes obvious he's seeing Verna behind his bosses' back; a man, in Leo, to whom he is so close that either character appears to just be able to visit the other at whatever hour they desire if there is a problem needing fleshing out.Turturro does well with his character, a guy whom we first observe just seemingly 'appear' in Tom's dwelling \u2013 sat there in a chair, as his presence catches us all off guard. His attire has him eerily blend into the furniture within which he's perched, while his nature of manoeuvring around as he does and getting the jump on us all alludes to a greater extent of trickery and slipperiness which later becomes apparent when things intensify, and Bernie does not play by the rules laid down to him. The film is an often spellbinding crime drama; a glorious period piece weaving its way down challenging avenues and indulging us in the sort of narrative filmmaking with which we ought to engage.",

I quite like the Coens' work, but this is one that has escaped me thus far, hence the borrowing of said DVD. It's very definitely a Coen brothers script with some excellent dialogue and plenty of plot twists. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take that guy out into the woods & deal with him while I write the next paragraph).Tom Reagan is adviser to Leo, the mob boss who runs things around here. Rival boss, Johnny Caspar wants Leo to give him permission to have Bernie Bernbaum killed because he's making problems for his gambling syndicate. Now Bernie's sister, Verna is seeing Leo and so Leo is reluctant to upset the apple cart (if you know what I mean). Also, Verna is seeing Tom on the side and if Leo ever found out about that there was gonna be some big trouble for him. Add to this the fact that, Tom is also a bit of a gambler and has run up quite a debt, but insists on paying it off without any help. So, one day Casper makes Tom an offer and, as you can probably guess, this is where all the fun starts\u0085 I hope you understand that lot! I'm gonna leave it there so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.As I said at the beginning, this film has a truly excellent script with some great dialogue and clever plot twists. It's a very well made film with a very appropriate soundtrack (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.Although it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have. Or maybe films have been made since that do what this does, but better. I don't quite know what it is, but this one seems to lack the punch that other Coen brothers films have. I felt that, although he is very good, Gabriel Byrne seems very subdued all the way through and this appears out of character for someone in his position. But aside from that, it's well worth seeing\u0085 Recommended (if only for Albert Finney wielding a Thompson Machine Gun to great effect).My score: 7.5/10",

            "content": "BEWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW I found this film painfully slow and wondering around pointlessly up to about the first hour. The second hour was more interesting though not brilliant, it began to get somewhat interesting from the time Byrne was asked to shoot Turturo his Jewish girlfriend's brother.The plot was muddled and hard to follow in many of its details while it lacked real depth and tension and many of the major characters came across as very cartoonish and wishy washy, Polito and Finney for example weren't at all convincing as authoritative top mafia bosses in their city though Byrne's character was quite satisfactory.The study of human reactions gave it some depth e.g the refusal of Byrne to shoot Turturo and the latter's behaviour towards the one who spared his life at enormous risk to himself.Overall a very mediocre film that's just about worth watching and while granting that in the subject of films personal tastes can differ enormously and one may find a film as being excellent and another as being totally dull I just can't understand why this film is considered as one of the greatest mafia films ever made. It just doesn't have the attributes of a great film particularly an easy to follow yet deep, coherent and suspenseful plot.",

            "content": "I'm going to speak plainly. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I loved every minute of it. It is one of the most underrated movies ever made in comparison to how good it really is. It got the respect of the critics but after one week it kind of just disappeared. An injustice to this movie.Plot: This movie has a very strong plot. I takes about two viewings to really appreciate it. The reason being is that it is hard to follow until the very end when everything comes together. I applaud both Joel and Ethan Coen for their writing, with the excellent dialog, and the major twists that always keep you guessing but never knowing until it finally happens. Is Tommy betraying Leo and joining Johnny Caspar or does he have other plans? I didn't know until the very end and I doubt you will either. Top notch story which will keep you glued to the screen to the very end.Acting: I love Albert Finney, as Leo, the boss of the Irish gang and the boss of the city. He's one of my favorite actors. I also love Marcia Gay Harden, as Leo's fianc\u00e9, Verna, and John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, a bookie who Caspar wants dead but is the brother of Verna. They all did fantastic and gave very believable performances But the performances that really blew me away were from the equally great actors Gabriel Byrne as Tommy, the protagonist, Jon Polito as Johnny Caspar, the Italian boss, and J.E. Freeman as The Dane, the adviser and 2nd in command to Johnny Caspar. Gabriel Byrne gave a performance that like the story always kept you guessing. Combining him and the script is what made this movie. Jon Polito was Johnny Caspar and the Italian boss. J.E. Freeman played the most intelligent guy in the movie along with Tommy. Known only as The Dane he was cold, calculating and ruthless. I also loved the quick scene with Steve Buscemi. Enough Said.Genre/Quality: This is a crime film. But it is unusual in that it deals with the Irish mob. It involves a war between the Irish mob who currently control the town and the Italian mob who want control. One of the great points in this movie is the music. The Coen Bros. have always had great music in their movies, but this may have been the best score I've ever heard in a Coen Bros. movie. The camera work was excellent as was the set and art direction. Mixing these four together made this film a low budget but technical masterpiece. The music always fits the scene and the scene always fits the music.Overall this is probably the most underrated movie I've ever watched. It got praise but not enough. I think that the only recent praise I've seen from a critic was Time Magazine where it was included in their Top 100 Movies of All Time. This is a well deserved position. Forget The Godfather Part 3 for the Best Picture Nomination that year. While a great movie it was not better than Miller's Crossing. Goodfellas deserved Best Picture that year but had it not been made that year, Miller's Crossing would have deserved it. This film is all around spectacular and it's a movie that I can watch over and over and over again and never get tired of it. This film receives my highest praises.10/10",

Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is a Chicago/Irish consigliere to Albert Finney's town capo di tutti capi. Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is the love interest of both of them, and really, hers is the only sympathetic character, though very thinly written. Gabriel Byrne plays Irish-super-cool-dishy for all it's worth, but the character is neither hero nor antihero, which may be the intention, and it doesn't really work. The ending kind of fits, though.Anyway (SPOILER) Tom switches allegiance (or does he?) to preserve whatever he's got going with Verna, but it takes a full hour to establish all the dynamics. If you concentrate up to then, the whole tension of the story becomes apparent, but they certainly made heavy going of it.

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is not your typical gangster film. Its gangsters, Coen Brothers style. Gangsters film noir (not that uncommon you might think, but there haven't been many gangster films in recent years you could classify as noir; while Goodfellas was an amazing film, would you class it as noir?). The gangsters have principles and ethics. And its taken for a given that all the cops are bent. The police chief simply works for the top dog \u0096 the man who really runs the town.Leo (Albert Finney) plays the aforementioned top dog, and is an honourable man who keeps his promises. He is constantly supported by loyal lieutenant Tom (Gabriel Byrne), and the two have an almost father-son relationship. When rising mob boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) comes to see him telling him he is going to kill someone under Leo's protection, instead of giving up his charge in order to keep the peace, Leo refuses to allow the hit. What follows is a slow descent into gangland war, with Tom caught right in the middle, trying to prevent all-out war (and Leo finding out about his relationship with Leo's girlfriend, played by Marcia Gay Harden).Tom (Byrne) is an original anti-hero. Caught in the middle of a brewing turf war between rival gangsters, wanting to keep the peace and stay out of it. Unlike most gangsters, he operates with his brain rather than his muscles. Byrne plays it superbly (as we have come to expect from him), with just the right amount of melancholy and self-destructive nature mixed in with honour to ensure he doesn't appear to heroic. In fact, Byrne is the undoubted star of the piece, playing it understated while everyone else finds license to cut loose and overact. Albert Finney, while underused, is terrific, and utilises a wonderful gangster accent \u0096 with, rather originally, hint of John Wayne in it, whilst Polito and the rest all have the stereotypical indistinct gravelly voices.What makes the film so atypical of gangster films is its contradicting nature. For instance, early in the film there is a ferocious shootout at Leo's house, but it is played out to the strains of 'Danny Boy', and almost in slow motion. It never appears to be over-dramatic, while the shootouts again hark back to 30s gangster films \u0096 lots of tommy guns, with lots of loud bangs, flashes and smoke but very little claret. Further, the Coen Brothers, in keeping with their unconventional tone, utilise a sense of old style filming, with fade outs between scenes \u0096 reminiscent of Dad's Army and Golden Age Hollywood films such as Gone With The Wind. The violence is also reasonably restrained for the most part (at least until the end anyway), again in fitting in with the old-style filming.The relationship between Finney & Byrne's characters is also refreshing; they are close confidantes, trusted friends \u0096 something not often seen in gangster films. Leo is also a gangster with ethics and principles, and keeps promises to protect people; again not a common gangster trait.But for all it's praiseworthy points, the story itself is a bit of a slow-burner; when compared to classic gangster films like The Godfather and Goodfellas, or even modern ones such as Road to Perdition, the story produces little adrenaline or excitement, and it is hard to become too wrapped up in the story and the plight of the characters.The Coen Brothers seem simply unable to produce a standard generic picture; everything they make always appears to be slightly off-kilter, and Miller's Crossing is no different. So if you want a gangster film that isn't in the 'badda bing badda bang' tradition of Goodfellas, then Miller's Crossing is perfect. But just don't expect a white-knuckle ride.",

The movie benefits from a dark and powerful performance by Gabriel Byrne in a film of like substance that tells an unusual tale of the life of a manipulative, clever gangster. Supporting cast are strong, including Marcia Gay Harden, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito.The plot from brother Joel and Ethan Coen is fantastically worked and, after a slow start, really hooks you in as it is put to full use by director Joel. We need more powerful cinema like this; it truly blew me away.Saturday, February 23, 1991 - Forest Hill Chase\"Millers Crossing\" is still as entertaining second time around. The Coen brothers have produced a film rich in funny, sharp dialogue and with a plot so well worked that one can certainly get full value more than once. At the risk of repeating myself, the performances from Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, Jon Polito and John Turturro are fabulous!

The hell you say!

In Miller's Crossing, Joel and Ethan Coen have once again hit one out of the park with their tale of 1930s mobsters doing battle with the police, and each other. Not an easy feat when you consider that another all-time great and much better known Mafia movie, Goodfellas, was released the same year. Not to mention the Untouchables just three years before. But Miller's Crossing demands its own place in the gangster spotlight, featuring Gabriel Byrne as the wise- ass wiseguy who can't quite decide whether he has it better under current bossman Albert Finney, or Finney's rival (and Coen Bros. mainstay), played perfectly by Jon Polito. Other than a mismatched romance between Byrne and love-interest Marcia Gay Harden, this film fires on all cylinders, and will surely creep into your thoughts for days on end. Byrne is effective with his typical nonchalance, but it's the supporting roles, which include John Turturro and Steve Buscemi, that give this film the depth that most attempts at conquering the genre lack. J.E. Freeman practically steals the film as \"The Dane,\" Polito's unforgiving enforcer. Has it been done before? Yes. And arguably, it's been done better. But rarely is it done this well.

In an intricate interplay of shots and cuts, the dog makes the boy realize that the man he thought was drunk is in fact dead. The scene has no dialog, but displays and evokes a wealth of emotions that has since become one of the Coen brothers' hallmarks. At the same time, it touches on their philosophical trademark theme of perception and reality. In this respect, the alley scene is a variation of the movie's major mystery, a murder that may or may not be what it seems, depending on how (and when) you look at it. - Also watch out for Frances McDormand's nearly silent, uncredited appearance as the mayor's personal assistant in one of the final scenes.",

I enjoyed the film a lot and thought it was great but in my opinion they did not achieve the term \"masterpiece\" until Barton Fink a year later. But anyhow, this film was great too, I can see why many love it, great performances, written very well. It is very different from other Coen films though, i thought it was much more brutal and Tarantino-esquire than ony other Coen film. But it worked, a great cast especially Turturro and Gabriel Byrne, as well as Polito and Finney. The entire cast was perfect in this film and really made it work, a great atmosphere and also nice cinematography from Barry Sonnenfeld. -- IMDb Rating: 7.9, my rating: 9/10",

Coming from innovative Coen brothers, this movie will stick with you because of its brilliant lines, twists, acting and directing. There isn't much to say about the actors, top class names like Byrne, Finney, Turturro, Gay Harden, Buscemi and in here great Polito, speak for themselves just like brilliant script from Coen's. Also music is one of the reasons why I gave this movie excellent grade; version of 'Danny Boy' is just outstanding!!! To compare this movie with other gangster movies is all right but not to untouchable \"The Godfather\". Although I have a great sympathy to one of the best Coen brothers movies ever, I must also say that it doesn't touches sky high Coppola's \"The Godfather\". But \"Miller's Crossing\" is a movie that everyone should view and judge for themselves.",

The impressive art direction, the performances, and the violent nature of each scene really drag you deep into the film's setting.

This is a neatly woven, gorgeous film, written almost a little too smooth.Gabriel Byrne finds his perfect role here as the noir-ish troubled loner who lives by a code and despises himself when he breaks it for anything (love, friendship). Albert Finney is Leo, his boss, whose love of Vera (recent Oscar Winner Marcia Gay Harden in her fist role) has clouded his judgement and caused his empire to crash down. The movie follows Byrne walking a thin line of lies and loyalties, but to whom.Jon Polito and JE Freeman make perfect pair as Italian underboss Johnny Casper and his henchman Eddie Dane. Dane is the violent, loyal second in command who really carries many of the films best scenes.\nI highly recommend this film. It is very enjoyable and the kind of movie that cries out to be watched over and over again. See the Coen brothers before they were perfect (Fargo), but still better than most.\n***1/2 out of ****.",

            "content": "'Miller's Crossing', the third film from the Coen brothers, opens with a monologue from the pig- like Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito). He is discussing ethics, and is also trying to see if Irish crime boss Leo (Albert Finney) will do anything if Caspar were to take someone out. After seeing that Leo would, Caspar leaves along with his brutal henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman), and in a sense has threatened Leo by saying he's 'sick of the high hat'. Leo's advisor Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) disagrees with Leo's decision, and knows he refused Caspar because he is dating the target's sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Things began to get messy as a war begins to take shape, and Tom is afraid Leo will not be able to hold up against Caspar anymore. More-so, the target Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) begins to meet more with Tom, causing him problems. The main factor in 'Miller's Crossing' is the superb writing. The dialogue is quite refreshing and flows extremely well, (also see 'The Man Who Wasn't There' for an example of this). The characters are individual, living, breathing human beings and most of them want different things. The dialogue comes alive the most in several scenes between Tom and Leo. The performances are also good too, most notably Finney as the like-able Leo, a kind man who doesn't realize what trouble he's starting for everyone. Also worth mentioning are Bryne as the somewhat cold Tom, a man who is extremely intelligent and knows what he's doing. The supporting cast puts in some refined work as well, Polito as the temperamental Caspar, Turturro as the slick Bernbaum, and a nicely done cameo by Steve Buscemi as Mink, one of Bernie's friends. The photography by frequent Coen collaborator is also very nicely done, with some very beautiful shots. The action scenes in the film are also great to watch and the music by also frequent collaborator Carter Burwell is a nice touch too. Joel Coen also did a good job directing, making the scenes work out dynamically and getting the viewer into the film all the while building up momentum and throwing some surprises to the audience. The style of the film also was a different approach for them, it came after the dark and suspenseful thriller 'Blood Simple' and the whacked out comedy 'Raising Arizona', and instead transferred to a more smooth looking feel. 'Miller's Crossing' is definitely a must see for all fans of the Coen brothers, a nicely styled little masterpiece and a refreshing look at the mob of the 30's. 10/10",

This one just has so many layers that make it interesting, and I don't think you can catch all the witty rapid-fire dialog after one or two viewings.For me, there is one scene that I rewind and watch over and over again because I think it's truly one of the great cinematic orchestrations ever: I speak of the Albert Finney (Wow, what a consistent pro he is!) scene in which he's home relaxing with a cigar and \"Danny Boy\" (the definitive Irish-American anthem) playing on the Victrola near his bed. Then all he** breaks loose and we see Finney/Leo dashing under the bed as he senses the gangsters slipping up the stairs, dispatching them quickly after carefully extinguishing the cigar. He then grabs a sheet, swings out the second floor window as the house burns down, grabs the confiscated Tommy gun and dispatches the gangster army one by one with great precision while standing outside in his robe and slippers. Satisfied that he's vanquished the enemy, he tenderly pulls out the cigar from his robe pocket, torches it up again, and proceeds to enjoy the final refrains of Danny Boy as the house burns. Amazing scene! Not only was it incredibly well-constructed by the Coens, but Finney plays it with such a sense of \"just another day at the office\" that you can't help wanting to light up a cigar of your own to enjoy it with him.I can't get that scene out of my head and have even dreamed about it. A few years ago, I would have rated this film around an 8, but after watching it and the entire, almost-perfect film repeatedly, I have to concede it's become an all-time favorite, and I'd rate it 11 if I could! Great cast (particularly Finney, Byrne, and Harden), great screenplay, fantastic cinematography, and the Coen Brothers are the only team that could have pulled this one off so well: about the best in American film.",

I loved the way he played every character in the film, and basically drove all the events of the story; the fact that we connect with him, and then feel his terror when he thinks he's been caught, but then revolt him when he spins his webs, is just brilliant. I also liked the undercurrent of really dark comedy that runs throughout the film. Technically, it's superb, and for pure entertainment, you can't do much better. A real treat.",

It's somewhere in between for me. While everything in this movie was pretty much perfect, I was missing some sort of sympathetic figure. There was no single good guy in this movie. It shouldn't make a movie worse, but it's sort of hard for me to evoke feelings of tense excitement if I barely care for the actors. This movie is far from good and evil. If you like that, this movie might become one of your favorite.

A time when a good head and a smart plan could take you to the top, if you wanted to be there. Our main character here, Tom Regan, decides he doesn't. Maybe too smart, Tom gets mixed up with the boss' girl. He never shows disloyalty; he just does what he wants because he can. With a few memorably awesome scenes, the story moves relatively slow until we are finally shown the portrait of a man who knows his time and his place. The story takes us through a month or so in the life of Tom as he plays all sides of a hairy situation to his advantage.\"Miller's Crossing\" suffers from one or two sub-standard actors. This would be fine in most Coen brothers' films, but here, it really shows because the film is meant to be taken so seriously. Marcia Gay Harden is terrible as the gangster moll girlfriend. She hams it up and overacts. I thought the guy who played Johnny Caspar was bad also. Too funny and he should have been more serious. It didn't fit.All in all, \"Miller's Crossing\" is a well-done piece that has a wonderful ending that makes all the bumps in the road getting there worthwhile.8 out of 10, kids.",

It did not perform well at the box office, but in later years was an art house hit on DVD.Maybe the complicated plot was responsible for the disappointing performance on the big screen. After all on a DVD you can revisit crucial twists of the plot if necessary. Honestly, I don't believe this explenation. Complicated plots are nothing special for film noirs. Look at \"The big sleep\" (1946, Howard Hawks). The story is almost incomprensible, but the film nevertheless was received well.The problem in my opinion is not that the film is too complicated but that it is too artificial. It seems as if the Coen brothers were making a film for film aficionados and not for the average moviegoer. Look at the opening scene with a discussion about business ethics within the maffia business. A clear reference to the opening scene of \"The Godfather\" (1972, Francis Ford Coppola) but that can only be appreciated if you have seen this film (and other films the film is refering to).

            "content": "The Coen bros. previous efforts (BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA) showed their capability of producing films in a small budgeted quirky landscape, but MILLER'S CROSSING did much to prove that they had a unique vision in serious film making. This film set the tone for the bros. more dramatic projects to come: BARTON FINK, FARGO, the talent heavy missed opportunity MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, and the high-concept HUDSUCKER PROXY. The true source of genius in this film is the look. Barry Sonnenfeld's photography, and Dennis Gassner's sumptuous production design (you can almost feel the woodstain soaking into the paneling in Leo's office) help to make this one of the most visually distinct films in recent memory. The pan shot of the tree tops, the hat in the wind, the shoot out, all great scenes developed with a resonating style. Carter Burwell's score helps to create a bucolic aural backdrop to the on-screen happenings. The performances are all A-list: Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan, the film's oft abused protagonist; John Turturro's scene at the crossing is worth the price of admission; Albert Finney's Leo is wonderfully single-minded and bullish; Jon Polito's rival gangster is scene stealing; Marcia Gay Harden is perfect in the film's only center stage (if underdeveloped) female role; and J.E. Freeman as the Dane is chilling and nuanced.The plot of the film is not perfect, however. It revolves around Tom Reagan's machinations (many of which seem to happen by chance or dumb-luck) to help Leo, his boss and friend, out of a difficult situation, involving love, betrayal and gangland confrontations. The plot, which becomes a bit more lucid upon repeated viewings, is helped along by the quick and fun dialogue (terms such as \"twist\", \"dangle\", \"insky/outsky\", \"yeg\", etc) and keeps things moving. The absence of sex and foul language help make the scenes of intense violence even more so, by allowing the Coen bros. to make these instances more graphic. I must admit that I am not that big a fan of the bros. more recent popular work (THE BIG LEBOWSKI was a funny-in-places surreal romp and O BROTHER, I think, is their worst film to date), and I choose to look back at MILLER'S CROSSING as setting the standard. I'm sure by now that you are bored of listening to me gush about this movie, check it out and decide for yourself. It at least is a gorgeous pulp drama with clever dialogue; I think it is one of the best films of the 1990's and I tend to distrust anyone who says otherwise. There have been instances where, having found myself in the same room as someone such as this, I will transfer the money I have on me to my sock at the first available opportunity...for certainly they would cut me off at the heels if there were two bits in it for them. 10/10",

The real story focuses on Reagan's falling out with Leo and his joining rising boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), but it is still unclear where Reagan's real loyalty belongs.You'd think it was impossible for movies to get this good, honestly.  The performances and script make the movie.  Byrne created what's definitely my favorite anti-hero in the character of Tom Reagan, his manor cold and his cause menacing.  Harden makes a character you love to     , and Finney is cool as the childish Leo.  Of course, other great performances come from Polito, who's Caspar is Oscar worthy.  Also, J.E.

It features smart dialogue, occasional humor (sometimes broad, sometimes not), and fine performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Albert Finney, and Gabriel Byrne. It pays homage to the gangster picture of the 1930's and 1940's and to the pulp fiction of Dashiel Hammett, and gangsters, like grifters, are as American as cherry pie. So far, so good. On the other hand, the plot, with its crosses and double-crosses and double-double-crosses, is virtually undiagrammable. No wonder the Coens found completing their script so difficult. Is \"Miller's Crossing,\" as a perceptive reviewer suggests, really a meditation on honor, friendship, and ethics? Is it, as another reviewer asserts, really about \"chasing your own hat,\" that is, about seeking and finding independence? From a mob boss? From a two-timing moll? Without giving up killing? Maybe so, but it's hard to take pleasure in such rarefied notions when the storyline here is so tangled. \"Miller's Crossing,\" with its production values, holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end, all right, but the plot is driven by the rapidly changing machinations of Tom Reagan (Byrne), the lieutenant to Irish mob boss Leo O'Bannon (Finney). Those machinations, springing from the mind of a thug and not of a Nobel Prize winner or Wall Street derivatives specialist, are intended to be realistic and plausible, and -- more than that -- convincing to other thugs, and they plainly aren't. 7.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Yet another stylish but relatively empty Cohen Bros study of the wretchedly brutal lives of worthless underworld gangsters. Direction, characters, and dialogue are as measured as they are familiar and seem to be copying many gangster flicks that went before it. Take away the obviously slick scene set- ups and it's just a shell that's strung together in order to cram in as many killings, bashings and double crosses as three or four other movies just like it.The movie's main character (Byrne) is somewhat like a cartoon character, who gets knocked down several flights of stairs, bashed so badly (and often) that it's amazing he can ever stand again but the next day he's on the street looking fresh as a daisy. The only wound ever visibly inflicted is a cracked lip (that he's had since the movie started!). It's all reminiscent of a Sergio Lorne spaghetti western, the type these movie makers would have grown up watching.Fans will not see the flaws through being blinded by the trendy stylistics but judging by the poor box-office returns, many others were not being so fooled. Carter Burwell's score, adapted from a Celtic classic is most effective but deserves a better subject. The last scene, this time reminiscent of a far better Carol Reed classic, also features a Hat scene that looks like it belonged in a dark, Disney remake of the story of Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet. A good cast wasted in more over the top nasty silliness.",

This is the Coen brothers attempt at a plot movie. They put all their eggs into one basket and if the basket breaks they're out of luck. Personally, I thought the movie was so-so. It added little to the gangster genre. The only thing keeping me attached to the movie was the fact that I am a big Coen fan and was interested in seeing their take on gangster film.\nIf you've seen 'The Big Lebowski' a few times, you'd be amazed at how complex the plot is because there are so many other perks to keep you distracted. In 'Miller's Crossing,' it is plot and nothing else. If you don't like the plot you don't like the movie. I think I was most disappointed with the homogeneity of the characters. Everyone from the girl, to the police chief, to the mayor, to each and every gangster is shown as cold, calculating, and arrogant - just like every gangster film. Without novel characters or dark humor, this movie looked devoid of its Coen-ness.",

Like many Coen efforts every moment plays out too slowly. Every moment drags. Its tone is so only half funny you're always wondering whether its a parody or serious: and it ends up not effective as either.The cinematography was the biggest disappointment, and the biggest factor in making this looking like a tele-movie trying to do a gangster movie. From Barry Sonnenfeld, who everybody talks about, I expected something flashy. I expected Godfather-quality evocative pools of light: what I got was the Coens' usual cartoony over-bright, too-colourful look, which suits a gangster story about as well as the music does.The gems are few and far between: the scene where the little boy pulls the wig off the corpse twenty minutes in is a gem. Steve Buscemi. John Turturro. When Turturro returns at one hour fifteen.This was a laboured, uninteresting movie experience for me.4/10.",

While the Coen's clearly give this film a particular style-which isn't entirely based on absolute reality-it doesn't feel overly injected or manufactured. And though this flair isn't completley based in corporality, there's enough to it that at least makes it work if you're open to their unique mannerisms.Such as how picture is a gangster film with many trademarks of the type, yet it hardly feels like one in some ways. While it does contain things like murder and deceit, instead of the hard-edge style you might automatically associate with it, the film has a suprisingly mellow tone.And an inscrutable plot.Perhaps the picture's fatal flaw is that too much is happening too quickly and too often to give you time to comprehend it all.

And there are plenty of other comedy characters here, as well, as there also are some rather funny scenes (check the confrontation in the warehouse, the interactions between Johnny Caspar and his son). I'm not sure what the Coens intended this to be (the only genres here on IMDb are crime, drama and thriller), but perhaps they had some 'black comedy' in mind, also.Of course, the mixing of comedy with the crime (and drama) genre doesn't have to be a problem, but for me, it just doesn't work here. In that respect, this a rare Coens film, because it is actually their 'worst'... though it still is a more than enjoyable flick, let's call it an over the top ode to the good ol' crime and film noir genre. And there where the drama element peaks - Bernie on his knees in the woods, pleading for dear life with Tom, and later when they return to the woods again, and Tom is just 'sick' of it, and, finally, when Tom decides he has no heart left for Bernie) - the film is simply brilliant. It really makes me wish they hadn't put in those extravagant comedy elements.Other than that, 'Miller's...' shows some terrific acting, some tasteful costumes and settings (although a couple of trees steal and a hat the show), and some clever and funny dialogues - unfortunately, a great amount of others didn't work for me at all.A good 7 out of 10.",

I don't like Gabriel Byrne, he's not much of an actor, but he's half decent here, just barely. Marcia Gay Harden is atrocious though. They are making this fuss about this plain broad, the guys who own every working girl in town. Give me a break. It's very easy to tell she got the part from the window, good connections though I ll grant her that.What else. Ah, again it proves that most film viewers are morons if they proclaim this thinly written and forgettable story as a masterpiece. Fairwell my lovely is a great film, and so is the other raymond carver film they shot, the big sleep, but this is just trite. Of course its not the disgrace with Stuart Cox characters that the Cohen's write these days (malcovich in burn after reading) but it ain't good either. Of course as per usual some brilliant Cohen wit every thirty minutes or so, and the usual great cinematography but that's about it.I am giving it four stars while it should be five or six just because I had high hopes for it and didn't meet the expectations at all.A very disappointing film all in all. It really bugs me how a film like this gets such high grades, a film so vacant and soul less as this, a gangster farce, and vapid in its own genre really. Who cares about a half wit small time gangster who never as much as emotes to anything in the film, at least give us some clever twists here, everything is so boringly predictable. Well, the Cohen's being the jewry they are got all the funds they could to keep making more films after this and luckily we did get a masterpiece in Lebowski.

I just can't get past the violence this film delivers. Its too much, not in quantity but in quality, and just stays with you in a bad way. And I don't think that is a talent moviemaking-wise. In fact, I think it would be rather simple to do. But all of the major scenes that involve death bother me greatly, to the point where I won't watch it again. The fact is, that this stuff didn't or doesn't happen in real life. So why do we make films like this? I mean think about it, is this any more redeeming than filming people having consensual sex?

Once was on Broadway after seeing Tom Stoppard's \"Arcadia.\" The other time was my first viewing of \"Miller's Crossing.\"Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous.  Yes, the production design is lush and rich in masculine colors.  Yes, Carter Burwell's music is haunting and perfectly suited to the story.  And Yes, the performances are all spot on perfect.But I had to see this movie several times to figure out what happened and why.  Gabriel Byrne's character of Tom is as complex a character as you're likely to see on screen.  As Vera says to him at one point, \"Christ, Tom, all ya had to do was ask.\"  And yet, he is someone who is incapable of asking for any sort of favor, whether it's from Leo, Vera, anyone.  And the mechanisms he puts into play to resolve his problems are complex, interwoven and not a little self-destructive.  He someone who is capable of taking a punch (and he takes plenty) and yet seemingly incapable of delivering one. Ultimately he gets what he wants and loses everything he values.The Coen brothers said this was a story about men in hats.  And clearly it is, but what the hell does that mean?  Tom is clearly \"chasing his hat\" which means he is seeking something that escapes him.  But he refuses to ackowlege that he's chasing it, and by refusing to accept that there are things he wants, he loses that which matters most to him.The Coens are routinely criticized for being brainiac manipulators of their characters, more concerned with the conceits and gimics of their gags than with the humanity of their characters.  What a crock.  They are not maudlin sentimentalists and thank God for that.  The fact is they have a great deal of compassion for people who don't seem to have any themselves.  Jerry Lundegard in \"Fargo\" was clearly the character they felt the most for and his increasingly desperate and tragic actions were the heart of that film, not Frances McDormand's chirpy sheriff.The Coens make movies as well as anyone.  They write scintilating dialogue, they use the camera as well as anyone, they use color like a painter.  But they have always been shortchanged by people like Owen Gleiberman of EW because they \"have no heart.\"  Like Tom Regan in \"Miller's Crossing\" they have a heart, but you have to look to find it and it might be a troubled one.",

            "review_title": "\"Miller's Crossing\" Is A Homage To Classic Noir, Whilst Consisting Of Every Element Which Makes A Coen Brother Film Instantly Recognisable",
            "content": "Much of the Coen's films frequently contain evident homages to classic crime-capers, from The Big Lebowski being an ode to The Big Sleep, to Miller's Crossing being a homage to long-established American noir, such as The Glass Key. Miller's Crossing is the film which indisputably established the Coens' talent as a pair of film-makers who would go down in history, following their prior success of Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. The tangled web, fuming with deceit, betrayal and vengeance has now become a fundamental trademark for the Coens' films.Gabriel Byrne performs as Tom Reagan, an adviser for the mob, who thinks before he speaks, yet is prepared to speak his mind, whatever the cost, something he learns is dangerous in the company of the men he is surrounded by. He is essentially a man who lives in a world surrounded by crime, while being a criminal himself, nonetheless he does not attempt find trouble, but rather trouble finds him due to his fraternising with countless mobsters and the dangerous use of his tongue. Due to the frequent swaying of Tom's loyalty it is inevitable that he is going to make enemies; eventually \"changing sides\" and turning-the-tables on his long-time friend and business partner Leo (played by Albert Finney). Leo is the king of the city, yet because of a disagreement and rejection of a \"hit\" proposed by fellow mob-boss Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), Tom and Leo fall out. Set around America's prohibition in the 1930s, the film charts the tale of gangsters abusing a corrupt system of injustice and moral decay.Tom Reagan is an immoral man who is striving to gain a meaning to his unethical lifestyle, attempting to balance his apprehension, guilt and moral-values. If problems such as never knowing who to trust and choosing whether to \"dispose\" of a friend are not enough, he is also subconsciously seeking to build a relationship, something which is painfully difficult under his circumstances. He is struggling to find values beneath his brutal lifestyle of criminal activity. Tom Reagan has \"friends\" as such, but most of them are with him for protection, or in some cases, the other way round. Acting is one of the countless aspects of flawlessness in Miller's Crossing, considering everyone from Gabriel Byrne, to Albert Finney, to John Turturro and Jon Polito give career-defining performances of enthusiastic supremacy.It is fact that the characters of Miller's Crossing are all intelligent people, in some way, even unexpectedly. Everyone is in search of something and hold some sort of initiative and hidden prerogative behind their decisions. Written with an almighty gusto, the characters roll off the screen from both the hard-edged, bitter script and the unsentimental, glaringly robust performances. Miller's Crossing, as with most Coen Brother films follows a dialogue-driven narrative, invigorated by dark humour, blunt, snappy one-liners and quick-fire conversations which feel humanly laboured and distant. All this helps to create the cold ambiance of the film; capturing the period through convincing set-pieces, props and costumes of the time, giving the film that extra level of accuracy.As expected with a film of this kind, Miller's Crossing has scenes brimming with grandiose violence, which is blood-thirsty and brutal in capturing the irrational foolishness of a human's lust for brutality. Shot in a method which is almost fantasy-like, the now-timeless imagery will become lodged in your mind for eternity. The cinematography is moody, smoky, edgy and cold. Miller's Crossing successfully captures the meaning behind a scene through evocative environments, which etch varied tones of emotion into the viewer. Many of the film's key themes are told through metaphorical imagery, a key image being the hat, a metaphor which is open to interpretation. The film benefits from morose lighting and shadows, emphasising elements such as the furniture and architecture of buildings. Camera angles are also a leading importance for Miller's Crossing, with moments of uncomfortable, gawky positioning, serving to accentuate the thorny, paradoxical plot. The use of zooms, slow fades, quick-cuts and stretching shots make addition to the film's stunning technical achievements. Gracefully placed editing alleviates the low-brow humour and tension, and not forgetting the beautifully poetic score, which fits the characters' distant desires.Complicated, high-strung, cold-blooded storytelling, which is unlike anything you will ever see. Miller's Crossing does stick to its film-noir and \"gangster movie\" roots, but ultimately it is an illustration of an individual's principles and the senseless violence of gangsters struggling for power. Twists and turns can be rarely executed with such perfection, Miller's Crossing offers viewers much to ponder, meaning revisiting such an underrated masterpiece is obligatory.",

This kind of thing can be exasperating for a chronic film-goer, but the way the Coen's have set it up we are so involved in the story that anything incongruous with reality is immaterial- the Coen's have made their own reality.",

It sets the theme at the beginning with a monologue, a howler of convoluted logic, by racketeer Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito):  if you can't trust the mob to put in a fix, who can you trust?  \"It's about ethics,\" he says to Leo (Albert Finney), the local crime boss, who sits quietly rolling his ice in a glass of scotch. A sullen Gabriel Byrne is Tom Regan, Leo's best friend, confidant, and hatchet man who keeps his cool and whispers sound advice into Leo's ear, advice that Leo too frequently ignores. Poor Mr. Byrne!  I've never seen a protagonist get beaten up so many times - he's even sucker-punched by Leo's girlfriend!  Tom is a black-hearted Irishman in a black hat, and therein lies the imagery of the film: say \"heart\" with a bit of an Irish brogue and you have \"hat.\" \"There's nothing so ridiculous as a man chasing his hat,\" Tom snarls, and the image of a black hat rolling across the countryside, propelled aimlessly by the wind, recurs frequently.  Tom's a man who goes through life chasing his \"heart.\"  The supporting cast is flawless with Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, Leo's cynical, hard-boiled girlfriend; John Turturro as her brother Bernie, the born loser who sets things in motion by upsetting Johnny's fix, begging for his life on his hands and knees (\"Look to your heart, Tom! Look to your heart!\" and Steve Buscemi, always a joy to watch, as Mink, a fast-talking two-bit hoodlum. Like all the Coen's films, the characters and situations are surrealistically over the top. The image of Albert Finney, with the map of Ireland all over his face, wearing a yarmulkah at Bernie's orthodox Jewish funeral, is hysterical; likewise the machine-gunning of an innocent bystander whose body is pumped so full of lead during a police raid that he bounces on the sidewalk like a rag doll.

            "content": "The Coen brothers are known as quality filmmakers and while this movie is one of their best it failed miserably in the box office when it first came out but has now become a cult classic.Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne in his best performance) is a consiliere (trusted adviser) who gets into a heap of trouble when his boss Leo (Albert Finney) decides to protect shyster Bernie Bernbaum (John Torturro) from up and coming Italian mob boss Johnny Caspar (Tom Pollito). You see, Leo is in love with Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) whom Tom happens to be having an affair with.The plot is convoluted and complex as Tom is in a love triangle but also ends up having to take on another love triangle, this time a discreet homosexual one concerning Bernie, a fast-talking bookie named Mink (Steve Buscemi) and Johnny's top enforcer, The Dane (JE Freeman). It's a clash of idealism versus reality as Tom outwits them all, somehow staying above the fray as violence and chaos swirls all around him.Every character is unique in which they have their own quirks and vices. Tom is far from perfect due to his gambling problem and yet he is superior to all the others due to the fact that he is a realist while everybody else is an idealist, meaning they tend to trust their allies and lovers too much while Tom knows the evil that lurks in the hearts of all men (and women). In the end, it is Tom who is the most ruthless of them all because of his cynicism.If you like period drama, complex plot machinations and gangsters, this is a must see film. Don't be afraid if you don't understand it all, it takes several viewings for most people to get it.",

To say that MC is a gangster movie is like saying that \"Harvey\" is a movie about rabbits, however large they may be.Superlative writing, acting and directing. Not one false note. Each character has motivations that are revealed gradually, through their words or through their actions or through their eyes (hidden by hats or not). Gabrielle Byrne has never been better, Marcia Gay Hardin terrific, and Albert Finney? Well, let's just say that he's absolutely convincing whether he's playing a mob boss or a ladies room attendant.Of course, if, like Leo, you \"don't like to think,\" you probably won't care for this movie.

            "content": "It's time to take a balanced view of MILLER'S CROSSING. It is a very good film, with some approaches and scenes touching on genius and pointing ahead to some of the great Coen Brothers work to follow.However, on its own, it is a well-realized film in most regards. Mode, narration, dialog, performances, music, cinematography, and direction are all first rate. MILLER'S CROSSING finds its own \"feel\" for its topic, for its times, for its genre, and that is a noteworthy achievement for a movie as dark, uncompromising, and uninspiring as it is.The movie seems to say we must live within our destinies--efforts to overcome, or, in Tom Reagan's (Gabriel Byrne's) case, straddle between one destiny or another can be fatal. Tom is razor-smart, smart enough to see several moves ahead in the big game of gangster politics, but also smart enough to see the emptiness of it all. He constantly tries to fight off his own sentimentality, and it gets the best of him, as he needs to be smart or sentimental, not both. And that sentimentality proves fatal for some.What keeps this film short of greatness, in my opinion, is that MILLER'S CROSSING seems to straddle that very line of sentimentality vs. intelligence. In turn, it is a great send-up of gangster pictures, a terrific historical commentary on the ethnic dimension to American gangsters, a wonderful depiction of characters within their era, an existential neo-noir. In the end, however, it seems to fall short of having a lot to say, being content at putting on its show. This makes it, as I said, a very good movie because it has put the show so well.Highly recommended--but beware of the over-praise. It also drags in spots, and at times its over-the-top satire cuts into its effectiveness as drama, or maybe the other way around. In my mind, FARGO remains the most complete Coen film, in a fine body of unusual and idiosyncratic works.",

Luckily, Miller's Crossing only takes one of these characteristics, and is, along with some others, considered mob masterpieces. Many will disagree with me, but I found this to be a more entertaining and well-made film than The Godfather and Bonnie and Clyde, but not as good as Goodfellas or The Public Enemy. It has situations that are uncomfortable, suspenseful, and grim, and turns them into black comedy hilarity. This film not only succeeds on the gangster picture level, but on a number of other levels: black comedy, suspense, and a dab of film noir that it seems the makers enjoyed referencing to. Not only that, but it is brilliantly written. This has perhaps one of the most clever screenplays I've ever encountered, with dialogue and situations. The Coens make this film hilarious, bleak, and very violent all at the same time as we try to decide just who we are rooting for and, every once in awhile, what exactly is going on during this complex black comedy. For intelligent viewers, you got one for the brain here. The intellectual film buff should view this film immediately as it is lots of fun and likes to trick it's characters and sometimes the viewer into thinking things that are not. Seeing what our anti-hero will do next is quite worthy of the money spent at Blockbuster. I highly recommend the film. 3.5 stars out of four. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen. Directed by Ethan Coen. Cast: Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Albert Finney and Jon Polito. 1990. Rated R for language and violence.",

            "content": "The deep-focus in almost every scene combined with the consistently Rembrandt-like cinematography, with faces lit or half-lit against a dark background, make for a compelling visually satisfying aesthetics in this film. Yes, there is blood galore, but never is it gratuitous. Killing is not pretty. Guns have consequences. The dancing figure of a mobster being riddled by machine gun fire makes death a reality, not a glamorous event. The Coen Brothers reference the 1930's gangster films, especially Public Enemy and White Heat, as well as The Godfather. Their own twist is the element of a homosexual love triangle, the irony being that the most brutal and conscienceless mobsters are not heterosexual macho men. The issue of having a heart is raised again and again through the film, and the consequences of having one in such a brutal world provides another irony in this often sentimental, but honest look at man's greed, at man's essential lust for power. Only Verna has a heart and seems capable of love. Tom, too, has a heart, but his love for Verna can easily be dismissed as lust. However, he and Verna both have unswerving loyalty, loyalty that is assuredly misplaced, but loyalty nonetheless. The theme of family which is part of the gangster genre also has a postmodern twist here. There is the ludicrous family of Johnny Caspar, the sibling connection between Verna and Bernie, and the father-son relationship between Leo and Tom. This last verges on the homoerotic in the last scene. The haunting musical score is reminiscent of old movies, with Tom's theme, a melody played at the beginning, the end, and points between when Tom is on screen and in trouble. One is reminded of Tara's theme in Gone with the Wind. The dialogue is fast paced, so much so that even my students, normally highly acute when it comes to movies, found it difficult to follow on the first viewing. Actually, the subtlety of expression adds to this difficulty. Listen, for instance, to the clues to the fact that there is a gay love triangle. If you don't catch them, the plot makes little sense. The homosexuality is never overtly stated, nor are the comments about the gay relationship ever highlighted in any way. There is no use of words like \"faggot\" to finger the gay characters, but it is clear who they are if you're listening. This is a movie that has to be seen more than once. It itself, so referential to older gangster movies, has been referenced by more recent ones like Road to Perdition. To date, I think it is the best of Coen Brothers' movies and I like almost all of the others.",

The only reason why I gave it a 6 was because it could have been a good movie if they had just had a real ending. Tom had absolutely no personality that one could connect to in a certain way. He protects this mob boss and then he decieves him to protect another for no given reason at all. It just doesn't make sense whatsoever.

It doesn't hurt the viewer, but it doesn't have to, because film noir was never a genre of forced realism. It's much more a genre that examines the \"dark side\" of humans, the way he treats his unmoral wishes and drives. The Coen Brothers add to this mix a comic-y approach to this story, which isn't quite my taste, although they build up some great moments that remain.

            "content": "Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers.Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role.Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay viewer, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them.First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order:Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's \"boy\". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual.Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another \"amigo\" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him.Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, \"There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved.\"Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's \"different\". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes.As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.",

I personally thought it was a weird film at first, kind of strange film. The plot a little too hard to follow and you get thrown right into it. And a little hard to catch up on all the dialgue and remember who is who. But when I got into it, it's was very impactful movie, very well made.

It also has that very dark and not so obvious humor, when you're not really sure if it's suppose to be funny, that the Coen brothers are masters of.It's also very well shot and very well acted by all actors involved. I liked how strong and independent the leading lady was, Marcia Gay Harden did that very well. I also thought John Turturro was really good. And off course Albert Finney was good too. I also have to mention this film uses music very sparingly, but the score that is there fits very well and is dramatic and beautiful.My biggest complaints about the movie is that it gets a little slow and boring, it kind of have this dimmerd down depressing tone, but you still have to stay focused or you won't get a thing of what's going on. I guess that it's style, so it might work also, if that's what you like. But if you're like me, it was kind of hard to get into and it took me probably 30 min or more until I was invested in the story enough to care or enjoy myself, almost turned it off actually thinking about watching something more fun and entertaining instead. But as I said, I really did come to like it. Also, I didn't really get who the leading man was suppose to be, is he a smuck that just gets lucky sometimes or is he a complete badass? Well, might give it a second viewing to make up my mind about that and see what else I missed also.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie to someone that wants to see a gangster movie.

As it is usually the case in movies by the Coen Brothers, humor is present by appears only in small and secondary scenes. These moments of comedy seems to come at some points where the directors were probably bored by what they were showing. This story of loyalty and betrayal (between Tom and Leo and Tom and Verna) doesn't go straight to our hearts because we have no sympathy for the characters. Gabriel Byrne with his beaten-dog eyes is good but his performance has nothing exciting. Only Albert Finney and John Turturro are above the rest of the cast. This movie was inspired by the `Glass Key', an excellent movie by Stuart Heisler with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake (and also an adaptation of a novel by Dashiell Hammett).

What I loved the most were the larger than life characters (obviously parodies from the old gangster movies with James Cagney) the beautiful cinematography, the Coen's artistic sense of direction (one in particular was the long shot of Albert Finney's character turning his back to Tom, right before he beats the tar out of him), the over the top, campy violence, and of course, most importantly, the dialogue.  Never have I ever heard such impressive dialogue...sorry Kevin Smith, though some of your films are funny (like Mallrats), they can't hold a candle to this one.  This one is so intelligent it is a pleasure to watch.  Gabriel Byrne was incredible in the role of the 'heartless' crook, Tom, who plays a deadly game of switching sides between two rival gangs.  Always a pleasure to watch, and without a doubt, his best performance, ever.  I must say that J.E. Freeman's 'The Dane' character was just too cool.  He was so brooding, so calm and precise, yet, you could feel his thirst for blood just by the look in his eyes.  Definitely a memorable character.  I was pleased to see John Turturro and Steve Buscemi turning in yet two more good performances for the Coens.  All in all, every actor was excellent, and the film was very entertaining.My only complaint is the same as many others who have reviewed this film on this site.  That feeling of 'huh?' at the end, and often, during the film was honestly a turn off.  I know the Coens always have a message about the human condition or human psyche in their films, but save for the fact that Tom is obviously trying to find his heart throughout the film, it is never quite clear, nor is the resolution.  To tell you the truth, I don't even know why he told his boss of the affair he was having with his girlfriend (which starts the whole crossing/double crossing/Miller's Crossing acts), perhaps futility?  I definitely need to see this one again, which I definitely plan to.  Unfortunately, though, the wonderful film Memento, though it grips you just like this one does, Memento at least gave you a hint that there was something deeper to things, and after about three viewings, you suddenly get it and it makes the movie ten times better.  I did not get this feeling with Miller's Crossing, primarily b\\c I saw very little of the vulnerability of the main character.  Every now and then, his girl would mention how cold his heart is, but other than that, you really don't see him struggling, nor reach an epiphany at any point.  The only part that gives any indication of a dawning moment of comprehension, or clarity is the final scene, which to me it totally ambiguous...but perhaps that was the intention.  If so, kudos for making the audience think, but at the same time, it feels a tad bit like a cop out.  Is he running away from his life and now starting over again?  Did he feel that he was incapable of love at the end and decided to keep his loyalties, but not his love?  I just don't have the answers, but hopefully I will after rewatching it again, soon. Another minor gripe was how they kept referring to all of these other characters, some of whom we hardly see...with the local color from Irish, Italians and Jews, the accents alone, in addition to the countless characters mentioned can cause a headache, and good use of the rewind button.  But despite these complaints, I can't help but feel like this was a good movie, and for me to say that, that is definitely a rarity, indeed.Anyway, on a first viewing, I give it a 7.5, b\\c it is very entertaining to watch.  Because of the incredibly intelligent dialogue that comes at you a mile a minute and had me in stiches or sitting in awe more times than I could count, I give it a strong 8.  For anything else, see this as a somewhat 'satire' of gangster films, while still being a good one...yet, like all of the Coen films, don't take the situations seriously or it will ruin the experience for you.  8/10 stars...That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",

Of course, the role of Johnny Caspar is delicious and Polito knocks it out of the part in ways few actors could, and coupled with the savvy of Finney's mob boss, you quickly and clearly gain the gist of the dilemma that Tom faces, and immediately snuggle in for the rest of the movie. Too bad the Brothers abandoned their faith in plot and headed towards a wild disregard for any coherence after \"Fargo.\" I miss the sense of fate that plays a part in their best movies, stories that seem like they are headed towards a serious and inevitable conclusion.

            "content": "No question, this film feels contrived - too contrived, actually. More than one viewer has ended up like Verna. \" I don't understand. I don't care!\"But if you like puzzles - the more intricate, the better - this is for you. It's rich in manipulations, betrayals, doublings and triangles.Some viewers may sense a void at the heart of the film. The characters, with their dry, hard-surfaced performances, give very little away. Where is the emotion powering the whole complex machination? The name for it, in Leo's words, is 'joy de veever,\" and Verna, the 'angel,' embodies it.The story, unfolding in scenes that play almost like tableaux, introduces its themes at once. For starters, there's the lighting: bright for public spaces, dim for private. Then there's the color scheme: green for Tom and 'friendship', red for Leo and passion,The driver of the plot is, as Casper declares right at the beginning, ethics, i.e., moral choice, right and wrong. Accordingly, Leo asks Tom 'which side' he's on today. That is also why there are so many scene doublings as the choice is repeated in a slight twist.The characters represent at least four standards of morality. 1) Beasts, like Mink, who have no sense of right and wrong, merely acting on their drives, creating anarchy, the jungle. 2) Caspar, who uses the 'fear of god,' i.e., threats of violence or death, to establish order. 3) Leo, the Lionheart, who helps friends and hurts enemies. 4) Tom, who icily judges gains and losses. Tom - and only Tom - is addressed, 'Jesus, Tom,' or 'Christ, Tom,' and he can raise the dead.'God invented cards,' declares Tom, and he seems to believe choice is limited: you have to play the cards you're dealt; but you have a moral choice about how you play them.Money, as often in Coen Brothers movies, corrupts relationships. That's why Tom rejects Leo's offer to square his accounts with his bookie.Maybe in the end the key to the secret motive is to be found in the dreamlike sequence of the wind-blown hat (like so many scenes, doubled later in the film). Oddly, the dream hat is not Tom's. Tom wears a gray-brown fedora. The dream hat is black. Who wears a black fedora? The Dane? Leo? My interpretation is that the first part, with the green title cards set against a cathedral of green trees and accompanied by intensely emotional music (I leave it to the viewer to put a name to the emotion.), represents Tom's 'friendship' with Leo. The second part, with the red (Leo) title card \"miller's crossing' leading to the hat sequence, represents Tom's apprehension that the relationship is threatened..There follows a brief black-out, and Tom is shown waking from his dream. Returning to a world of lies and manipulation, he asks, \"Who're you gonna believe?\"",

And the Coen Brothers play around with a lot of irony, as they usually do in their movies. In the movie we see Tom (Garbriel Byrne) switch sides to the other mob in town, but secretly he is still loyal to his old boss Leo (Finney), even though Leo doesn't know it. His new boss (Polito) thinks he's loyal to him, but Dane, Polito's 2nd in command, sees through Tom. Yet Dane in the end gets killed by his boss for something he did not do, and then get betrayed by Tom anyway.Another one is Finney's relationship with Verna. He would never cheat on her but she's cheating on Tom. Also Tom is loyal to his friend Bernie and, ironically, Bernie ends up being disloyal to his friends, especially Tom.(SPOILER ENDS HERE)It also shows that trust (or distrust) should be well founded and not taken on what people say because trust, as truth and loyalty, depends on how it is perceived by an individual.Then there was the \"Danny Boy\" sequence.Other than this, Miller's Crossing was disappointing.",

Because they understand and portray humannature so well, their films will remain timeless, as Shakespearehas.  Has Tom got a heart? The answer becomes clear, and hismotives become clear in the very last shot of him pulling his hatdown and staring down the track in the forest. Tom survives byusing his brain and tact; some live by instinct, such as Verna, most rely on guns and violence, or a perceived code of underworldethics, or talking alot  ( Bernie )... all of which Tom is very reluctantto use. His mind is his weapon. He also has maintained contactsin high places. He doesn't say too much or perform heroics; heknows how to survive in this dog eat dog world. The soundtracksuperbly complements the mood, with its Irish melancholy. Theperformances are immaculate. The plot is rich, and as complicated as allegiances and trust.

I still don't think I'd put it on the top 250 list, but I'd definitely give it a 7/10.My one qualm in this was realism. It was very realistic in many senses, and the characters were realistically portrayed, but it's the minor details that bugged me while I watched. My best example for this is Tom's apparent invincibility. It seemed like every time he stepped out of a doorway, phone booth, room, building, car, etc etc etc, he was getting punched in the face, and then kicked in the head, and then punched and slapped around and just generally having the crap kicked out of him. Repeatedly. Okay, I can believe that someone in his line of work would get beat up sometimes, especially if he's not a big guy. But you *have* to show some bruises if you get beat up that badly. The best we got was some short-lived blood, and once a small split in his lip (which vanishes very quickly). In general, two seconds after the baddies finish knocking him around he's back on his feet and totally fine, not even disheveled.The other problem I had was more with me than with the movie, but when someone is standing right next to you or in front of you or over you with a gun three inches from your body *telling* you that you're about to die, the least you can do is grab the gun and hit the guy a few times and see if he drops the gun. Everyone in this movie seemed too afraid of the all-powerful handgun held half an arm's-length away, and unwilling to even try to escape its narrow range of effectiveness. It could be that I'm too well trained and am overanalyzing the potential combat situations which were to further the plot and not act as plot themselves, and it's true that this isn't a Jet Li action thriller, but the least they could do would be to take away the possibility of stopping the gun-weilder by having them step back one pace.In all I enjoyed the film and marveled at its intricate construction and effective visual style, and everyone delivered excellent performances. My qualms with it are primarily superficial, so although this movie in my opinion isn't top 250 material it is still very good.",

And I also love, as a fan of classic cinema and a constant reader, their constant references and winks to books and films.This one features the enormous Gabriel Byrne playing the part of a cold-hearted assistant for a gangster who surprisingly has never killed anybody and has a recurrent dream in wich he's standing in the middle of the Miller's Crossing forest and his hat is taken away by the wind to never come back. The funny part of it is that during the whole movie this stands as a metaphor, for the hat is constantly falling from his head but he always manages to get it back when it seems it's too late. Finally, is really too late because he does murder someone (and for no reason at all). But in the end he goes to the guy's funeral in Miller's Crossing and the hat stays in his head all the time. Again we find a completely meaningless subject paid too much atention.There's also a lot of laughing-out-loud parts, specially the ones featuring Jon Polito and constant witty remarks, just like on the classic film-noir novels by Dasshiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.The acting is another chapter entirely. Gabriel Byrne's superb in his role, but the supportings really deserve the palm. John Turturro, Jon Polito, Albert Finney, Garcia May Harden and a short but well-played Steve Buscemi character.However, I still prefer the Coen's most recent works (and I'm talking about \"Oh Brother\", \"The man who wasn't there\" and specially \"The big Lebowski\" here).

Tom is the right-man to a powerful Irish Mob kingpin and political boss named Leo O' Bannon, magnificently played to the hilt by the late great British actor Albert Finney in an absolutely phenomenal scene-stealing performance. Tom's secret is the sexual relationship with Leo's gal pal, Verna Bernbaum played wonderfully played by Marcia Gay Harden in her screen debut. It will test his loyalty to Leo, who he has a major falling out with over Verna, then forges a shaky alliance with Leo's chief rivals, a psychotic Italian mobster named Johnny Casper, played impressively by the Jon Polito, and his sadistic lieutenant Eddie Dane, memorably played by the J. E. Freeman, who are both threatening Leo's racket. Impeccable supporting performances from Danny Aiello III, Joey Ancona, Michael Badalucco, Steve Buscemi, Kevin Dearie, and Esteban Fernandez, with special kudos to John Turturro who delivers a noteworthy performance as Verna's slimy gay brother Bernie Bernbaum. There is a tour-de-force unforgettable sequence of sheer filmmaking brilliance when two Tommy gun armed assassins try to murder Leo in his own home, it is one of the finest gun shootout action scenes that I have ever seen, where Finney's tough kingpin character shows why he is still number one. The period recreation is flawless and the screenplay by the Coen bros is brilliant. Impressive cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld, and a magnificent production design by Dennis Gassner.

It contains all the usual plot devices a typical gangster film has like gang rivalry, excessive violence, brutal hit-men, double crossing, and a smart-mouthed hard-boiled protagonist. Unlike other gangster films, the Coen Brothers infuse this film with their hallmark surrealism and dark comedy.Many critics have speculated on the meaning of the opening scene with a hat blowing in the wind and when asked about it, the Coen Brothers simply replied that sometimes a hat blowing in the wind is simply a hat blowing in the wind. When discussing how to photograph the film, the Coen Brothers told cinematographer, Barry Sonnenfeld that visually speaking, they wanted it to be a handsome movie about men in hats. Indeed, Tom's hat could be considered the central character of the film.The only drawback to the film is the difficulty of following the complex story; much of that has to do with the use of vernacular specific to the era it takes place in.

I think the perfect villain is Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) the whole story revolves around him. Tom first wants him separated from Eddie Dane so he can get Verna but then circumstances changed, Tom teamed up with other mafia boss Johnny Caspar but it was just Deception. Tom plays both Bosses but he likes Eddie more, all he cares about was Verna. The story line is just gr8 and very strong, i like the way Tom manipulates both bosses all credits goes to story and direction.",

And if you like seeing John Turturro whimper in fear and seeing Gabriel Byrne be beaten to a bloody pulp every ten minutes or so, this is definitely your movie.",

I didn't pay much attention to the film and, as a result didn't \"get\" much of it.  When I watched it again, years later, the movie really seemed to come to life.  Even though I've now watched this film well over a dozen times, I still catch new details with each additional viewing.  For instance, how many people have noticed the creaking trees from Miller's Crossing in the last scene with Tom and Bernie outside of Tom's apartment?  At first I simply thought it was the floorboards creaking.  If you watch and listen carefully, you'll notice that it's not in sync with Tom or Bernie walking -- or even moving.  How many people have noticed the silver ring on Tom's right hand?  It's an Irish wedding band, turned to signify that his heart belongs to another.  To whom does it belong?  Verna?  Leo?Anyway, as almost everyone here has said, this is a great film with a lot of great performances and cameos.  I know I'll never forget such memorable characters as Tom, Bernie, Verna, Leo, The Dane, Jonny, Tic-Tac, Frankie, Terry, Mink, Drop Johnson, and Tad.",

Anyone who thinks this film is second rate simply doesn't understand it...and it is hard to follow the first time around which is a justifiable criticism (for example, the first time I saw it I had no idea that there was a huge homosexual subplot to the story).\nThis movie involves a gang war during the Prohibition era between the entrenched Irish mob and the growing Italian mob, with a sleazy bookie (who is homosexual and Jewish) caught in the middle.  You will never see a more brilliant performance by Byrne or Turtorro and Harden is fantastic as well.\nComparing it to the Godfather is accurate, because both are romanticized versions of the mafia (e.g., handsome mafia dons in tuxes and machine guns). A comparison to Goodfellas is silly, which portrays a more stark and gritty view of mafia life with ugly people in ugly clothes getting addicted to drugs, and therefore totally different in character.  There are many homages to Godfather throughout, the most obvious is the opening scene:  both involve a bald, mustached italian man coming to the godfather to ask for a murder.  The second most obvious is at the very end, right when Tom is walking up to his apartment after setting up the final killing and a TRAIN runs by (even though it is 4:00 AM), an homage to the scene in Godfather I when the train goes by and Michael wacks Salazzo and the Police Captain.\nStylistically, it doesn't get any better than this with simply gorgeous camera work panning over the shoes, the clothes, the cars of the era.\nThe triangles of love betrayals exist on every level:  Tom betrays Leo, through his affair with Myrnah.  Myrnah betrays Leo, through her affair with Tom.  Tom betrays Myrnah, by almost wacking Bernie the first time.  Mink betrays Dane, by his affair with Bernie.  Who among the principal characters remains \"true\"?  Caspar.  So Caspar's funny talk about ethics, which most write off as humorous dialogue, is central to the issue of moral code in this film.",

The dialogue is terrific, although some people I know seem to think it's a little cheesy. The story is both wonderfully told and filmed.  The most memorable scene from the film, in my opinion, is when Tom is walking Bernie into the woods. Never before have I seen the dilemma of taking a man's life so well portrayed.

I have always read it that he did love Verna; you can see it in Gabriel Byrnes subtle acting and in the willingness of his character to keep seeing her. He is fighting his reason and lying to himself about his level of detachment in having even started the affair with her. Tom sees love as a weakness and sacrifices it. At the end he has won - but really, all he has left is his hat and his cunning.That this came out of writers block on Barton Fink..gotta love the Coens.",

'90, MC happens to be the best script of the three, sorry Mario, and while it can't match the sheer verite' thrill of a Deniro Pesci improv, the Hammettesque dialog transports you to another place entirely. Godfather's style is equaled as is the (GASP) cast. Finney-Brando (edge to Brando) Byrne-Pacino(edge Pacino), Keaton-Gay Harden (edge Gay Harden) Polito-Duvall (pick-em), Cazale-Turturro (edge Cazale), Caan-Freeman (edge to Caan)..

Don't get me wrong, the performances were magnificient, but other than Casper the rest of the characters were quite dull and unlovable. That 'Irish' charm is missing in the Mob and the Mafia didn't even seem Italian. I guess if you had mixed 'miller's' plot with 'godfather's' class and character you'd get the best movie ever conceived. Anyway, I enjoyed this more than 'the Godfather'.Just a suggestion: In the end of the movie when Bernie pleads to Tom to look into his heart, Tommy should have replied something like 'Not today' instead of 'what heart'. That would have captured the impulsive nature of the storyline. That much like anyone else, a gangster will make decisions based on impulses at the time.",

(I DON'T generally re-watch movies, but I've probably watched \"Millers Crossing\" at least 7 or 8 times.)Script - PERFECT. The 1920s/30s underworld slang is wonderfully entertaining. The script is just one witty line after another, many of them delivered perfectly by Gabriel Byrne. On the one hand, it's one of the darkest movies ever - yet it never ceases being relentlessly funny: At one point, Jon Polito's character says to Tom (Byrne) that he's only going to tell him something if Tom PROMISES not to say, \"I told you so\"...Tom, with a deadly serious frown on his face, gesturing with his cigarette for emphasis, assures him, \"I never say that - and I don't like people who do.\"...Polito tells what he has to relate...there's a perfect half-second pause...and then Tom casually drawls, \"I told you so.\" :)Acting - EVERYBODY is awesome (outstanding Albert Finney performance)...but Byrne still manages to steal the show. I think it's easily his best movie ever - (yes, even better than his awesome performance in \"The Usual Suspects\"). His Irish accent is like listening to great music, and he's got so many great lines - like after he's lost $500 betting on a horse that broke its leg coming down the home stretch of the track, and the bartender asks, \"Did they shoot your horse, Tom?\" - Byrne growls his disgusted reply, \"If there's any justice.\"Cinematography/Production Design - It's a beautiful movie to watch. The alternately swanky and drab interiors are all works of art, and a late night scene in the rain is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.Editing/Directing - The Coen brothers have never done anything better than this. Every scene, every line, every shot is just flat out perfect.If you haven't seen this flick, do yourself a huge favor and go grab it right now. - That's another thing that tells you how good this movie is - I've never met anybody who didn't like it - didn't LOVE it.",

But every films genre that the Coen Brothers make It turns into a gold work.First: The casting, I don't very like Gabriel Byrne's acting but this time he surprised me, in the role of Tom Reagan he made the difference. Jon Polito, John Turturro (in the role of a Jewish gangster was good as usually), J.E Freeman, Steve Buscemi(It's almost a cameo, he appeared in one scene and die again in this film) and finally the great Albert Finney plays in this film too. He's \"the guest-star\" of this film, he's pretty terrific in the role of Leo.The Story : I was a little disappointed (just a little) by the script I was expected a more complex story, but The Coen Brothers I think have a best written with Comedy Script even if there are funny dialogues. Some scenes remind me some gangsters films, The Coens certainly wanted to make a homage of the classic gangsters films.The directing is again excellent with this time more poetic and slowly shots (The \"hat shot\" is beautiful) to show the drama feeling of the film cause 70% part of the film is drama, the other 30% are Action and Comedy situations.So, to resume It's again an excellent film By the Coens. You're genius guys!!",

There have been a few that were not up to par, but the movies weren't horrible. This is my third favorite Coens film. The acting in this is brilliant, Gabriel Byrne is by far the best. The way he plays the character, and the way the Coens have written it, you never know what he'll do next, and it will always surprise you. Jon Polito gives a terrific performance as Johnny Caspar. The scenes with his son are hysterical. But what I think I like most about the film is that is really isn't a gangster movie, it focuses more on emotions and the way people feel for each other. Whether it be Leo's love for Verna, or the double-crossing that happens throughout the movie, and the emotional strains it puts on the characters. This being my first review, it may not sound great, but believe this. You won't be disappointed by this film if you are a fan of film.",

Also William Macy was in the movie for a brief while who played a major role in Fargo. The whole double crossing game became boring at some point.

From little details like the shine on a gangsters shoe as he puts out a cigarette to the scene that can only be described as loving depiction of Thompson artistry - this movie is frame by frame gorgeous. In the Big Sleep when Lauren Becall first meets Humphrey Bogart she tells him he's not very tall to which Bogey replies \"I try to be\".  I'm pretty sure W.

It uses the genre to portray in an endearing manner the several themes that are constants of the Coen Brothers -- Crime doesn't pay.  Violence doesn't solve anything.  Deceit collapses on itself.  Cleverness is only useful when it is not self-centered.  People are frail and prone to evil, but are capable of surprising goodness.  Miller's Crossing is my personal favorite from the Coen the Brothers.Coen Brother films divide into two categories:  Dark Films with comic undertones (like this one and Fargo), and Comic Films with dark undertones (like Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Art Thou?).  One or two split the middle (like The Big Lebowski).  Miller's Crossing is definitely as dark as they come, but it is also mystifying, witty, enchanting, alluring, and yes, even romantic in a weird way.Okay, it draws character traits and some one-liners from one or more Dash Hammett novel (which I also enjoy), but this is also a wonderfully creative, memorable, and (aside from the Hammett borrowings) original work.I give it a \"9.\"  I would give it a \"10,\" but then what would I give to the Coen Brother film that someday tops this one?",

I might say that it even presents more cinematographic eye candy... But I LIKE Miller's Crossing. It breaks every rule The Godfather established. Miller's Crossing shocked me in my first viewing. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It treads upon a line of surrealistic flavors. But as for the movie itself: Tom is one of the best characters in cinema history. His character is sly, cunning, douchey, scummy, and still lovable. The supporting cast each fills their role perfectly. The Coen Brothers have crafted a bizarre and oh so slightly absurd masterpiece with this film. But most importantly, perhaps, they showed us a film with a heart, with charisma, and with intention.",

It's a film that should be watched many times, not just for the pleasure of the acting and how it flows, but because it makes one deeply think more deeply about human virtues. Can a criminal have virtues? In a simplistic world view in which things are either black or white, good or bad, one would have to say no. But this film challenges this notion and sees the contradictions inherent in our humanity. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is a criminal, a gangster, yet in spite of that, he has a strong sense of ethics and this film is largely how this man maintains his ethics in a world that is not. There is a consistent sense of justice in how this character acts, even if it is not apparent at first.

And even so, once you think you've penetrated the multi-layered cinematographic \"surface\" of this story, you will find that it's actually very far from an allegedly postmodern rip-off of gangster movies and novels from the 40's (although it uses Hammett in particular to great effect): below the slick surface there's an intricate psychological \u0096 indeed a psychoanalytical drama in disguise \u0096 being played out, the complexities of which may take you the better part of your life to work out. What is intriguing about it, not least, is the way the plot seems impossible to work out, at least from Tom Reagan's point of view: as he asks to his boss Leo, at the end, \"do you always know why you do things\"?

A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin.I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new.This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. \"Look into your heart!\" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings.Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna.Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.",

GOD! That was to me the best scene of the movie! Kudos to COEN brothers yet again for giving a master piece.",

            "content": "**** Serious spoilers ahead *****I highly anticipated watching Millers's Crossing because I am a big fan of Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and anything with Gabriel Byrne. But, having said that, I feel really let down by this film. I understand that it is a modern day version of the 1930's gangster genre but I found it lacking in all respects.The dialogue is poor and you may need an Irish interpreter to appreciate the rare good lines, as Gabriel Byrne lays the brogue on pretty thick. The screenplay is supposedly worthy of accolades but I found it to be another example of a film maker's vain attempt to define a genre for the viewer.The saddest part of the film is the waste of Byrne's talents. He is the only redeeming feature of this film yet he's hindered by whatever scraps the Coen brothers give him. Albert Finney is a consummate professional but it's painful to see he is just performing to pay his bills with this film. John Turturro is a great actor and he seemed believable in his role, but the script made his contribution difficult to appreciate. Marcia Harden is forgettable as the love interest that provides conflict between Byrne's and Finney's characters and the cameo from Frances McDormand was ruined by her obvious smile into the camera as she made her exit. Steve Buscemi has 10 seconds of screentime as a gambling hoodlum, and 5 seconds of screentime as a faceless corpse. Don't see this film for the acting.\nThe sets poorly depict a 1930's setting and the odd splash of depression era vernaculars seems contrived. The \"plot twists\" that are supposed to set this film aside from it's peers are as predictable as they are unbelievable. If you want to see the Coen brothers at their best see Fargo. If you want to see an entertaining gangster flick with great acting, see Goodfellas.",

It is rare to come across a disappointing Coen Brothers film (Intolerable Cruelty, anyone).When you combine the Brothers with this cast you are likely to come up with a masterpiece. Miller's Crossing delivers on this expected outcome in spades.Gabriel Byrne is an actor of rare intelligence, with a smouldering on-screen presence that draws the viewers attention in every scene. He has been woefully treated in Hollywood over the years, with the honourable exception of The Usual Suspects. Here he gives a career highlight performance in a role that allows his outstanding qualities to shine. Tom Reagan is a complex, taciturn, flawed but razor sharp man who is the brains behind Leo's (Albert Finney)Irish mob operation. Byrne is the undoubted star of the show.Finney and Polito (Johnny Casper) are flawless as the feuding hoods. Hardin is wonderfully world weary, strong willed and sexy as Verna trying to protect her brother and juggle her relationships with Tom and Leo.Turturro is magnificently believable as a complete sleaze-ball.The rest of the cast are uniformly excellent particularly J. E. Freeman as Eddie Dane.The plot is complex and draws liberally from Hammett. The script is tight, well written and occasionally hilarious. It is certainly the most consistently well scripted film from the Coens.Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is vivid and illuminates the setting beautifully.I could go on ( and on and on...) but, look, just sit back and savour two hours of cinematic genius!",

Each character, even the less-developed one, is an important building block. Even Steve Buscemi's character, with literally a few seconds of screen time, manages to make an impression on the viewer.  Along with Buscemi, there are faces familiar to other Coen films, such as John Turturro andJon Polito, who turn in dynamite performances. Gabriel Byrne is superb in the lead role, and Marcia Gay Harden gives a firey performance as the woman torn between a mob boss who can protect her brother, and his right hand man(Byrne).  The really amazing performance though, is Albert Finney's as an Irish mob boss.  Other than Joe Pesci in \"Goodfellas\", Finney's performance in a supporting role is the best of 1990.In a year of mobster flicks, (\"Godfather III\",  \"Goodfellas\", etc.) the originality and beauty of \"Miller's Crossing\" stand out, making it an essential piece of American film.",

We want more of these independent film producers, like the Coen brothers, it redeems the movie industry, gives it back all its splendor, its dreams. The strive for perfection is here sustained, not only by money, but first and above all by the creativity and the genius of a man, of men, here of two men: the Coen brothers.About the movie Miller's crossing, I have watched it three times in two days (I had never seen it before, cause I just start to discover this style of movies..) and I adored it. You need to watch it more than 1 or 2 times to really get inside it. The dialogues, the amounts of details with the meaning you want to give them, are just perfect...Like the \"hat\": did anyone notice that, how many times an hat appears in this movie? At the beginning it is blown away by the wind, at the very end, Tom (alias great Gabriel Byrne) pulls it closer to his eyes, trying to hide what? Is it to hide his broken heart, as his friend Leo walks away from him to live with the woman he secretly loves? This gangster does have a heart! It touched me deep inside!In between it (THE HAT) plays its part, like a real actor, being put or removed from people's head, and telling his part: I wear it, I distrust, I remove, I (kind of) trust... It is indeed, as many have said, a drama about love, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and yes, what you see and is necessarily what you get. So goes life!Gabriel Byrne is not only, as usual, wonderful: in this movie, he is perfect! So are the others actors. I especially loved Polito and Turturro's performances.Go America, Go Coen brothers.

In both tales, the wise advisor to the cities' mob boss crosses over to the 'other side' when his cautious council is ignored by the boss for 'personal' reasons. Then all hell breaks loose, and the Coen's treatment of the story becomes it's own weird morality tale.\n\nThe script crackles, the acting fizzes (especially Jon Torturro's Bernie Birnbaum), the camera dances and the story unfolds (not entirely 100% airtight, but good enough). The music is beautiful and so are the set pieces. Fixer Gabriel Byrne's Tom Reagan (the good cops' first name married to the bad cops' surname in the Maltese Falcon) gets the s**t kicked out of him throughout the story but outsmarts everyone in the final analysis. The ending carries a bit of the Glass Key and Chandler's Long Goodbye. You can't know or trust anyone. He saves boss Albert Finney, but loses the girl they shared.\n\nI love this movie, forgiving it's chilly pessimism and slightly incredible script. It is not a B movie, but an A- movie, notable for nearly everything. It's one of the best noirs, despite being in colour and made 40 years later.",

But then Steve Buscemi shows up in a Coen Brothers movie. \n\nMiller's Crossing is the quietly popular Coen film, in that it's got name recognition but often ends up filed as one of many decent crime films of its era, when in reality for longtime fans of the filmmaking duo or the genre this projects ranks among the very best. Filled with the Coens' classic distinctive character design, snappy dialogue, and great period stylings, the film is an homage to the gangster and noir classics (and not exclusively American ones, either) that gave rise to the premise. Gabriel Byrne (who I have to keep reminding myself is not a serious version of Glenn Howerton) is caught in a web of dueling loyalties at the center of the Prohibition-era crime world, relying on deception and smooth talking to gradually pit larger forces against one another while the risk of death waits around each corner. The film is a bit narratively dense with its several crossed wires, but it's absolutely worth it to see John Turturro's classic pleading for his life, or Albert Finney turn the tables on a pair of Thompson-wielding assassins. \n\nAnd through it all, the actions of our antihero protagonist take the status quo back to where it was. There's a bleakness and a beauty in that sentiment. (4.5/5)",

Direction, characters, and dialogue are as measured as they are familiar and seem to be copying many gangster flicks that went before it. Take away the obviously slick scene-set ups and it's just a shell that's strung together in order to cram in as many killings, bashings, and double-crosses as three or four other movies just like it.  \n\nThe movie's main character (Byrne) is somewhat like a cartoon character who gets knocked down several flights of stairs, bashed so badly (and often) that it's amazing he can ever stand again but the next day he's on the street looking fresh as a daisy. The only wound ever visibly inflicted is a cracked lip (that he's had since the movie started!). It's all reminiscent of a Sergio Lorne spaghetti western, the type these moviemakers would have grown up watching. \n\nFans will not see the flaws through being blinded by the trendy stylistics but judging by the poor box-office returns, many others were not being so fooled. Carter Burwell's score, adapted from a Celtic classic is most effective but deserves a better subject. The last scene, this time reminiscent of a far better Carol Reed classic, also features a Hat scene that looks like it belonged in a dark, Disney remake of the story of Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet. A good cast wasted in more over the top nasty silliness.",

            "content": "An enthralling journey into the shadowy underworld of treachery.\n\nJoel Coen's direction for his neo-noir crime drama Miller's Crossing (1990) is drenched in nighttime mood and uneasy atmosphere. \n\nYou never quite know where Joel and Ethan Coen's story will go in Miller's Crossing. The Coen Brothers' writing leaves you gripped by each moment with turncoats and snitches everywhere. They show how the criminal world never has ethics truly because if someone did, they'd surely die for their honesty. Ethics and virtues are for the lawful as everyone else is corrupt and cynical in Miller's Crossing. It's not just a place in the film where dead bodies can be hidden, but a reference to the main character Tom Reagan's endless string of double crosses. \n\nGabriel Byrne is fantastic and subtle with his performance as Tom. You can always tell what he's thinking by his expressive face, while you can never guess what he'll do next either. Miller's Crossing unfolds like a crime mystery that you're constantly getting pieces to put together of what life is like on the other side of the law. Albert Finney is phenomenal as Leo O'Bannon with his surefire temper and quiet ruling of the Irish mob and rackets in the city. When he unloads lead with a tommy gun is one of the greatest action sequences ever captured on film. Jon Polito steals every scene as the goofy and short tempered Italian mob boss Johnny Casper.\n\nMarcia Gay Harden is a no frills lady who doesn't take any hits without retribution in Miller's Crossing named Verna Bernbaum. It's all for her love of her awful brother Bernie Bernbaum, played hilariously and sinisterly by John Turturro. His tearful begging for his life never fails to make me laugh, while his turn into a selfish rat is highly entertaining. J.E. Freeman is super intimidating as the peerless henchman with great suspicions named Eddie Dane. Steve Buscemi cameos as Mink, who is involved with fixed fights. The cronies Frankie (Mike Starr) and Tic-Tac (Al Mancini) are a riot as they and everyone else beats up Gabriel Byrne every few minutes. Sam Raimi and Olek Krupa have nice cameos, but Frances McDormand has the best cameo as the mayor's sweet secretary.\n\nMichael R. Miller's editing cuts when needed with a flashy style that makes Miller's Crossing a quick feeling 115 minutes. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is gorgeou with these seedy and dark looking wide shots outside. His close-ups and medium shots are so focused and compelling. Dennis Grassner's production design looks like the prohibition era America with Nancy Haigh's period accurate and lavish furnishings for Miller's Crossing's set decoration. Carter Burwell's score is dreamy with a stark gravitas to his melodic masterpiece. Richard Hornung's costumes look cool and striking on every man and woman. Katherine James' make-up artistry ensures each actor and actress in Miller's Crossing has never looked better. I've never seen Gabriel Byrne so handsome or Marcia Gay Harden and Frances McDormand look so pretty.\n\nIn all, The Coen Brothers have humor and violence aplenty with enough drama to ensnare any viewer into their lively world of crime.",

My favorite scene was when they go to the cite where Tommy supposedly killed Bernie and they believe he carried out the deed as there was a body but no recognizable face. That scene shows how in that time period they would use doubles and how some actions you make may benefit you later on. I rate this film 4 stars because it would capture the action at great speeds and would always keep you watching and questioning who truly had the most power.

After a confrontation in the office of well-known Irish mob leader named Leo, who denied an Italian Mob Leader, Johnny Caspar, the opportunity to kill a double-crossing bookie, named Bernie. The main reason Leo said no to the killing of Bernie, was that Leo is dating Bernie's sister, Verna. In addition to dating Leo, Verna is also seeing Tom on the side which forces him to switch from Leo's mob to Johnny Caspar's mob once he admits this to Leo. This switch then creates a change in how the mob's are run. Caspar puts all of his faith in Tom now that he joined the Italian mafia, causing a change in who's giving Caspar the advice in listening to his lessons on how to run a mob and in life lessons. Tom's switch in mobs also causes many escalations in the gang wars, causing a shift in power over which mob runs the unnamed town. \n\nMy favorite scene from the movie begins near the 40 minute mark when two members from Caspar's mob are sent to Leo's home to kill him. The reason why this is my favorite scene from the movie is because of how cool Leo is in this scene. The scene starts off with the mobsters setting the lower level of his house on fire and the two mobsters began to creep up the stairs. Leo meanwhile, was sitting on his bed blasting the song Danny Boy, which happens to be a popular Irish funeral song. Leo notices the smoke rising through the floorboards of his room, which would frighten most people. However, what makes this scene is that Leo climbs under his bed to shoot the one mobster in the leg and then in the head to steal his gun. This is important because this then starts an escape from his room while his house is burning. Shortly after he escapes the room he then starts a shootout with the living mobster and kills him after the mobster gets shot multiple times, all of this goes on while the Funeral Song is blasting in the background. Which makes this scene very ironic because we hear this classical music being played while a violent shootout is occurring. This scene also has a lot of ramifications for the entire film as it proves that Leo still runs the town. Caspar thought his gang was on the rise and sometimes thought they ran the town, but Leo's dominance proves him wrong and shows he's still got it. \n\nI would give this film a 4 out of 5. The reason I would give the film this ranking is because it was really written and those subtle pieces of comedy that is why I enjoyed the film. I'm very particular about what type of mob movies a lot and this specific movie brought back memories and reminded me of the movie, The Irishman. Especially when Tom was delegated the role of killing Bernie. Tom was receiving instructions from Tic-Tac and Frankie on how to kill Bernie was very similar to the Irishman when Robert De Niro's character was explaining the instructions given to him in the movie. What I really enjoyed about the film was the convoluted relationships between each character and how they tie into the mobs and which side they were on. These relationships between the characters keeps the audience interested in the film. I only have two issues with the film which is why I would give it a 4 out of 5. Despite it being a major component in my favorite scene, I feel the violence was a tad bit over-shown in the movie. I understand that the violence shown was common throughout the time period this movie takes place in. I thought maybe it could've shown the aftermath of the violent event sometimes like other films rather than showing the violent act in progress. The only other complaint I have is with the convoluted relationships I mentioned earlier, unless you are 100% dialed into the film, the relationships can get really confusing and the audience can get lost really quickly. That being said, by creating these complicated situations, the Coen Brothers actually make the audience watch the entirety of the film and pay attention so that they can understand the plot of the movie. Which on the Coen Brothers part is really smart. Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie as I think this is underrated among mob movie films.",

Bernie ends up killing Casper and is square with Tommy until Tommy decides to kill Bernie also so that the crime does not trace back to him. One of the most Iconic scenes that occurred in this movie was when Leo almost got surprised attacked by 4 of Capsers men at his own house, Leo ends up winning this 1 vs 4 in a glorious and thrilling way which just makes the movie better as a whole.

The film stars Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan and Albert Finney as Leo O Bannon. \n\nThe actors in the film I personally think fit the characters really well. The acting is also really strong especially John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum I felt that he gave a really good performance of a scared but twisted bookie.\n\nThe characters are written really well and are also really enjoyable to watch. The characters are also very memorable including the ones that only appear for a couple scenes. \n\nThe cinematography is strong with some great shots from start to finish. The cinematography also fits with the colour scheme of the film whether it be a slow scene of a fast paced scene.\n\nI personally very much like the mob setting from the bleak tone to the way the characters all interact. \n\nThe set design and props are very good and fit with the film near perfectly.\n\nThe costume design in my opinion is so close to being perfect, but sadly there was one scene where one of the extras was wearing something that didnt fit with the other characters.\n\nThe style of the film is strong with its colour scheme to its pacing. \n\nThe practical effects are done really well from the shooting of guns to the way the blood is done.\n\nThe action in the film is directed and pulled off extremely well. One scene in particular was a scene where they play the song Danny boy.\n\nThe dialogue in the film is very sound and quotable like the line What heart?\n\nThe editing is steady with some cool edits now and again.\n\nThe music in the film was by Carter Burwell. The music I personally really like and I also think that it fits really Well with the film. \n\nThe story was very good and enjoyable to watch fold out. What made the story even better was the characters and acting.\n\nThe film does also have some comedy which I found quiet funny especially one scene in which Tom is left alone in a room with someone els from an apposing mob. \n\nThe film also has some very good atmosphere at points especially toward the end. \n\nThe film in my opinion is really enjoyable and one that I will be watching again.\n\nThe film does have a couple things wrong with it luckily it doesnt take away away that much.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - so close",

Barry Sonnenfeld did a great job as DP, with lots of bright primary colours to emphasise the simplistic but prominent nature of many of the characters. Gabriel Byrne gave a stellar performance, as did the whole cast really, and it's their performances and the immense style brought by the Coen's that make this such a memorable and worthwhile experience.

So what I'm saying is rating their best works out of a catalogue of consistently stellar films is the most tedious splitting of hairs. \n  \nThe overwhelming awe packed into overhead shots and panning landscapes of nothingness to serve as characters themselves, along with many other signature traits in their work, is enough to make any film great at the 5 minute mark. Better than what James Cameron has ever done with his billions of dollars in overrun budgets and absurdly self-centered production approach - for one example. Never forget that the James Cameron won Best Picture with Titanic over Good Will Hunting, and somehow still has the power to get all the backing he wants to make FOUR (unsolicited) Avatar sequels in 3-D, (also something no one asked for as we are no longer in the year 2004 anymore and no 3-D film has ever looked better than its regularly projected counterpart...but I digress). \n  \nMiller's Crossing is a great film that is as hard to follow as my review's thoughts are - though Crossing doesn't rant and complain about how awful James Cameron is for no reason, it does leave you wanting to start it again the moment it's over. And also you'll stop & rewind scenes some times like 5 times (John Tuturro is a force majeure in a supporting role that makes you wonder how the same man also played that guy with writer's block in the ever-relevant satire commentary noir film Barton Fink, where the movie making industry is a living hell and you're only hope for getting out alive just might be the the friendliest man you'll ever meet who gift wraps severed human heads - among other things - for his blue collar line of work we're so used to ;) Watch Miller's Crossing & burn every James Cameron movie you find in life after reading this review.",

I do think, however, this movie somehow missed the mark of rising to the level of the Godfather, Goodfellas and the other triumphs of the genre. Do not get me wrong, this is still a great film. I cannot, however, shake the feeling that it could have maybe made it to the giants, if only a couple things had been different. \n\nThe acting is top notch. Albert Finney really shines as Leo, a gruff untouchable gang boss. Jon Tolinto also does an excellent job of playing Leo's rival, Caspar. I think in a lesser actor's hands this part could have been a real miss. Caspar is an over the top manic sociopath that Tolinto captures well. Gabriel Bryne also does an excellent job as the lead. The action sequences are also stylistically brilliant and captivating. One element that the Coen Brothers have always had a real knack for is a tight and well executed visual style. Moments of brutal violence are used with authority, and the action plays out with a deft hand. \n\nMy real criticism of the film, and I feel this is maybe an odd thing to say, but it tries too hard. The dialogue is too punchy, quick and witty. There are so many good exchanges and memorable lines, but they become almost overwhelming. The characters really lose some punch as the show drags on. They stop being characters and become caricatures. The sets are also beautiful and immaculate, but, again, almost too much so. You almost feel like the characters are self-aware that they are staring in a big movie set. \n\nI sense this was maybe by design to make the film a bit of a parody on this iconic genre. I am not sure that part of the film works. The film has so many excellent purist moments. The showdown at the end between Tom and Bernie, the long walk into the woods. I appreciated some of the flair of the movie and the screen play had some excellent moments, but it sometimes was just \"too much\". \n\nIts a hard thing to say such brilliant film makers who, again, made a good film simply tried too hard, but I think that is the core issue holding this film back.  I sort of liken this movie to an overly complicated fancy dinner. Even if it was delicious and expertly crafted, at some point the gimmicks and mastery go too far and I just want a cheeseburger. I think Miller's Crossing engaging in that overindulgence, on occasion. Still, an excellent film overall.",

Nothing much really happens where we as audience members care much about the storyline.

            "content": "\"You ain't got a license to kill bookies and today I ain't sellin' any. So take your flunky and dangle\".\n\nIt was in 1984 that we were introduced to (what would become) two of cinema's finest writer/director's in Joel & Ethan Coen. Their darkly cynical debut Blood Simple grabbed audiences by the crotch yet their wacky follow up, Raising Arizona, managed to tickle said area. By their third film, Miller's Crossing, there was no denying that this was truly a creative partnership that knew how to construct and deliver films of great substance and enjoyment.\n\nIn an unnamed town during prohibition times, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is the right-hand man to crime boss Leo (Albert Finney). Leo is heavily involved with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) and losing his judgement as a result. When rival boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) comes to Leo for permission to kill Verna's brother Bernie (John Turturro) for double-crossing him, he's refused. What follows, is a war between gangs and Tom finds himself shifting allegiances while playing one side against the other.\n\nWhen it was released in 1990, Miller's Crossing was a box-office failure. It took about half of it's reportedly $10 million budget and I often wonder if this could have been influenced by Martin Scorsese's more realistic gangster film, Goodfellas, being released in the same year. In hindsight, though, it has achieved somewhat of a cult status and celebrated for depicting it's criminals and their unlawful activity in a very different fashion. \n\nThe Coen's have been known to reference a few hard-boiled crime writers throughout their films: James M. Cain had a heavy presence in The Man Who Wasn't There and Blood Simple while Raymond Chandler coursed through The Big Lebowski. In this case, it's Dashiell Hammett and, most notably, his novels The Glass Key and Red Harvest that Miller's Crossing references and intertwines.\n\nSet in 1929, Barry Sonnenfeld's rich cinematography is a thing of sumptuous beauty. He captures the time and feel of the 20's to absolute perfection by utilising a very particular gradation of colour in deep red, green and brown hues. This is arguably the Coen's most visually stunning film to date and that's saying something considering the meticulous attention to detail throughout most of their work.\n\nThe characters are just as rich. I'm not normally a fan of Gabriel Byrne but at the centre of the  labyrinthine plot he delivers a solidly reserved performance as consigliere Tom Reagan, while those around about him have the more colourful, offbeat roles - the kind of which we have now become accustomed to with the Coen's. From Albert Finney's hopelessly romantic kingpin, Leo O'Bannion to (Coen regulars) Jon Polito as his hotheaded nemesis Johnny Caspar, John Turturro's shady bookie, Bernie Bernbaum and his cohort Mink, a small but important Steve Buscemi. All of them deliver memorable work and play like caricatures from the gangster sub-genre. Their dialogue is just as colourful as their characters and the Coen's ability to write snappy, witty lines has never been more present than it is here. \n\nFrom some corners, the film received criticism for being too self-conscious in its approach. There are metaphoric images of Fedora's tumbling through autumnal forests and hilarious discussions on the \"ethics\" of corrupt business but these moments only add to the film's originality and it's ability to carve it's own niche. Admittedly, there isn't the sense of realism that you'd expect from a gangster film but when the characterisation and pallet are as striking as they are, then it's an approach that's very welcome indeed.\n\nThose who have a particular appreciation for the film-noir's of yesteryear will, no doubt, be the kind of audience that Miller's Crossing will appeal to most. However, those that appreciate smart storytelling while basking in gloriously visual filmmaking will be in safe company too. Miller's Crossing was one of the Coen brothers' earlier works and, to this day, remains one of their best.\n\nMark Walker",

And they do come through with good performances.  Turturro in particular was his usual great self.\n\nAlso some nice plot twists, and kept you guessing as to the outcome. \n\nHowever, it suffers from a fatal flaw.  It is inconsistent tonally.\n\nAt times the film dips into their trademark, quirky, darkly comic style.  (Cases in point: the sounds of explosions and gunshots in the background of one scene, the almost comical number of cops outside of a building, the way that the cops raid some establishments, all done in that exaggeratingly comic style characteristic of the Coens).  However, most of the time, it moves along as was is by far the most dramatic of the Coen's films, perhaps, and much more straightforwardly so, taking itself very seriously.  This contrasting combination makes it difficult then to take the proceedings -- which are rather overly melodramatic at times as well, and not in that Coen style -- very seriously.  It makes for an odd mix.\n\nPerhaps it is also due to casting actors that don't quite fit that Coen style.  While talented, the Irishman Bryne and the Brit Finney are playing it straight, and aren't capturing that uniquely American Coen style.  But is that what they were going for here?  That's the problem: it's unclear.\n\nMy response may also reflect my mixed feelings about the gangster genre generally.\n\nI finished it because I was curious as to the fate of the characters.  But not because I felt very invested in them, really compelled by it, or was really \nentertained by it.\n\nIn any case, I was underwhelmed.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI did not start on the Coen brother's filmography on the best of terms, seeing their so-called magnum opus \"No Country For Old Men\", which frankly left me underwhelmed and utterly disappointed; but I still had hope for them and was still willing to branch out through the rest of their films, hoping I would find that specific film that would make me believer of their genius. Afterwards, I turned to films like True Grit and The Big Lebowski but sadly no dice; though True Grit did come close. Nevertheless, I was still moving forward and now I have seen a much earlier film from the directors, Miller's Crossing. The film is by no means perfect but it didn't seem to underwhelm me as much as the rest, as I did not see this film with a high pedestal, hoping to see a masterpiece.\n\nMiller's Crossing brings back the gangster genre through influences from the films that ruled Hollywood during the 70s and pre-60s. The film is all about style, found through its detailed costumes, abundantly hard-boiled dialogue, and clever usage of locations, allowed the atmosphere of the genre to flourish with every frame. Though the film is drenched in this style, I cannot also state that it does not carry the substance to match it, but it never reached me to a peak interest that other films within the genre have successfully achieved; The Godfather being a notable one. Miller's Crossing possess the same problem that I had with The Godfather films during the first time I watched them, it features an abundance of characters that are set up through words, not seeing them until much later on the film, leaving me confused and disorientated with the film's story. I even watched the film with subtitles on, just so I do not miss out on anything substantial behind its gritty dialogue, and even then I still had to take a minute to figure out who was who. It also took me a bit of time to find interest in the film's protagonist, Tom Reagan, and it was not until the latter half of the film where the character starts to push the plot forward, did I start finding myself engaged.\n\nMiller's Crossing's story speaks about the importance of loyalty within the gangster business, and how one could also use loyalty as a weapon to defeat their enemies; I truly thought that was quite clever as most films would have trouble in drawing the character's lines in regards to their loyalty, as in films like these they are normally black and white. Though I did have trouble getting through the film's pushy dialogue, as it constantly reminded me of the values and drives of its characters, when it was long ago established in the earlier portions of the film. By now, I have understood the Coen brothers' use of comedy within their films, as even their most serious films has a hint of dark comedy scattered in there; Miller's Crossing is no exception, with multiple moments showing the directors have fun with the explored genre or create particular moments that pushes a certain element, whether it would be the acting or the execution, and all of this keeps the film from being completely self-serious; demonstrating respect while also a sense of fun.\n\nIf there was something that left a strong imprint on my mind after seeing Miller's Crossing, it would be its musical score, which was composed by Carter Burwell. The theme music of the film is so light and graceful, which makes a lot of sense because though the film is considered a gangster flick, there is not of elements in there that is excessively violent or thematically dark. Though the track is not as powerful as say Thomas Newman's score for Road to Perdition, but Miller's Crossing is a much less sentimental of a film. Burwell's score does a wonderful job in shaping the world that the film is trying to convey and the lightness in its tone never at all hurts the way we see its characters.\n\nThe acting performances in this film is no doubt strong but there are a couple instances in there where I felt they push the personalities of their characters way too much, and by too much I mean going past beyond the area where it feels funny and instead comes off as cartoonish or artificial. Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro was both great in this, committed to making their characters feel distinct and identifiable. Jon Polito also does a wonderful job in the film, by constantly making his presence known when within the frame, managing to make his character to come off as both slightly funny but also menacing. Albert Finney as Leo, was the weakest link in the film's casting; showing very little of what makes his character special, standing stale and generic when placed side by side with the other actors that I have just mentioned.\n\nMiller's Crossing does have a number of positive things that runs it, but it is not without its narrative flaws. I feel that this would be a film that may potentially grow on me through multiple viewings, as its complicated storyline requires patience and effort from its viewers in order to comprehensively understand the layers that shape it.",

Trying to keep track of the characters and who's doing what, and why Tom is doing the things he is doing, it's downright exhausting. By the end I felt like the story really wasn't all that complex but the way the dialogue is thrown at you rapid-fire, and so many characters are talked about when they're not on the screen it all becomes a bit harder to track. I could see myself watching this movie again a couple of times now that I have nailed down which nicknames belong to which guys, and I've become accustomed to the lingo they use. Sadly, despite that desire to watch Miller's Crossing again to suss out all the details, there was just something about the movie that didn't click with me. It's hard to put my finger on what fell short. Perhaps it's just the genre, since I'm not particularly fond of gangster movies. Maybe it is the way the movie walks the line between drama and comedy, and I'm always struggling to see which side they are intending to fall on.\n\nThe acting is all great. John Turturro, and Jon Polito are particularly brilliant and I wish I could have seen even one scene with the 2 of them together. Gabriel Byrne gives a very measured performance as Tom, and I like how he speaks so little but is clearly thinking so much. My favorite aspect of the movie actually came as the end credits rolled and I was left to wonder how much of this was planned out by Tom, and how much was simply him rolling with the punches (literally.) As you can see, if nothing else, Miller's Crossing made me think and that's something that a lot of films just don't accomplish. I can definitely see why people love it, but I also can see why it wasn't so successful at the box office. This movie is an acquired taste, and might take more than one viewing to fully appreciate.",

I was inspired to see this film at the recommendation of Matt Sloan of Welcome to the Basement.\n\nThis movie feels like it was pulled straight out of the thirties and transferred to a 90's production- that is to say, it feels incredibly authentic. The dialogue feels almost foreign because of the time removed between the then and the now. There's jargon and lingo that leave you pondering the meaning of phrases, much like in A Clockwork Orange (but not quite as opaque.) \n\nIt's a slower churn of a film- the movement doesn't really pick up until the third act- and all of the nicknames and turns of phrase can leave you scrambling to keep the plot together- but in the end you're left with a very genuine feeling gangster picture from the masters of dialogue. So many great one-liners. (\"What's the rumpus?\")\n\nBy today's standards, it's one of their lesser known works, but if you're interested in exploring some of their films that came before Fargo, this is worth the two hour time investment.",

I remember really enjoying the movie the first time around but this time I enjoyed it much more. I could better appreciate Tommy's intricate plan and his relation to the entire movie. Tommy is a smart character that is so cool and together he's almost passive (except for fleeting moments of desperation) we don't know much about him other than what we see him do. Tommy is defined strictly by his actions. As is everyone in the film, considering it's totally character driven. And what a colorful cast of characters it is! A character can only be as smart as his writers (that's why the new Sherlock Holmes films are short on detective work and big on action), and the Coen's are always incredibly clever. The movie looks absolutely beautiful as well, the 1920's iconography, photographed by Barry Sonnenfeld is exemplified perfectly in a scene where Tommy squeezes a soaked towel into a bowl near a bottle of liquor. That shot almost sums up the entire film. It's static, beautiful, incredibly well composed and has a lot of character to it.\nWhile it's more of an actor's picture, there are a few great set pieces in the film. The repeated speak easy busts by the police, bursts of graphic violence, and the wonderful suspenseful scene of Albert Finney's character Leo's attempted assassination. The movie is just wonderful, clever dialogue. ('He's got a heart and he's kind\". \"So it's true that opposites attract\") All the scheming and double crossing is brilliant as the movie unfolds. This movie is incredibly watchable and subject to many repeat viewings. I'd have to say the key to its success is atmosphere, which is something I really identify with in a film. I identified this trait after having watched Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo later in the day. The movie creates a great world for the characters to occupy (we are never told what city we are in).\nBy the end of the film, Tommy has wrapped up all his woes using his cleverness and ability to \"play an angle\". But I'm not entirely sure he has changed as a character. His one emotional connection in the film, Verna, has left him and he quits working for Leo. I'm not entirely sure why. What has he learned? How has he changed? It's not a fault of the movie, because I leave completely satisfied by the end. I'm sure it's a question that has an answer and I'll have to watch it again!",

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is, as of now, my least favorite Coen brothers film, yet that's not saying much because they're among my favorite filmmakers of all time. There's definitely a lot to admire here, and I could easily tell as to why someone would adore this film. It has all the typical elements of a classic Coen brothers film, including the unpredictable twists, the sheer style, the quirky characters and dialogue, and the absurd morbid, dark humor. Yet for some odd reason that I can't quite exactly pin down, Miller's Crossing failed to resonate me, and although it certainly had its moments of amazement, it was thematically weak. You would think that if the gangster genre, which is one of those ultra-cool, stylish, and complex genres, and a Coen brothers film, which are all different but are all so unique in the best way possible, combined, the results would be groundbreaking. Evidently, many other people that have watched this film love it, many even claiming it's one of their best, and as I said, I could definitely see why. However, I'm in the clear minority here, and I wanted to love this movie considering how refreshing it often is to see a Coen brothers film, but it didn't quite work for me. This is one of those films that I'll have to re-watch at one point in order to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nMiller's Crossing has a plot similar to Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, where the protagonist, in this case Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is conflicted between two rival gangs, and he must play off of both sides. Miller's Crossing takes place during the 1930s, and tells the tale about a conflict between Irish boss Leo (Albert Finney) and Italian boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito). Leo's right-hand man, Tom Reagan, has the same love interest as Leo, Verna Bernbaum (Marcia Harden). However, things get worse when Tom refuses to get rid of Bernie, who's a bookie (and Verna's brother) that Johnny has intentions to kill, and instead attempts to protect him. It's hard to explain the plot from there, because there are tons of unpredictable twists and double-crossings due to the fact that Tom is stuck between these two rival gangs. It's very ponderous and convoluted for such a simple story, and the plot was used far more effectively in Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and Kurosawa's Yojimbo. I must admit that from the very opening of the movie, I knew that this wouldn't quite be up to par with other Coen brothers classics, mainly due to the fact that everything felt and looked so drab and bland. I don't mean that by the style, because I've heard lots of people saying the style was used to great effect, even many saying that this is a style over substance film. It's certainly not the stylish production's fault, it's the characters' fault.\n\nSome of the characters here were unfortunately less than compelling here, especially the protagonist. I felt like the protagonist was very boring and monotone, and it felt like he wasn't attached to anything- whether it was the love interest, the mob bosses, the money, or anything in general. He felt like an emotionless robot, and I honestly can't tell if he was acted well or not for that reason. In other adaptations of Yojimbo (and Yojimbo itself), the protagonist was compelling and exciting, such as the Man With No Name. He has a stoic personality, and he's mostly a man of few words, but whenever he talks, it's easy to tell that something amazing's about to happen. For Tom Reagan, however, I could barely hear (or care) about what he was saying. I wasn't too big of a fan about Tom's love interest, Verna, either. The two practically felt emotionless and drab, and that was a big shame (especially for Tom) because these are the people that you're supposed to be rooting for. A few of the other characters, including Johnny, Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman; Johnny's assistant), and Bernie were just as quirky and exciting as you'd expect from a Coen brothers film. There's plenty of dark humor, but I felt like this film didn't know if it wanted to be a riveting drama about the gangster era and morals, or if it wanted to be a darkly humorous gangster drama. The ending was apparently supposed to be really meaningful, supposedly symbolizing the change of moods and lifestyle of characters, but honestly, I felt no attachment to these characters to begin with, so in the end, I really didn't care about what was going to happen to them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however, because like all Coen brothers films, Miller's Crossing has moments of brilliance. There are darkly hilarious moments that were seriously hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing watching them, or even thinking about them. There's one moment in particular involving Leo, a few hitmen, a mansion, and tommy guns, and I'd rather not spoil it, but it was brilliantly, morbidly hilarious. There's also another scene later in the movie involving Eddie Dane and Johnny Caspar, and that was macabre but hilarious (although I'm not sure if I was supposed to be laughing at that scene). The stylish production is great to look at and feel here, whether it's the cinematography, the brilliant soundtrack by the Coen brothers' frequent collaborator in music, Carter Burwell, or if its the portrayal of the gangster era. There's one location with a forest that looks breathtaking (and the scenes used along with the location are great as well), the music is beautiful, and the whole film is incredibly stylish. There are shots where a fedora is floating and sailing through the forest, and the suits, the guns, the set designs, and everything when it comes to the overall look of the film are very well-made. There are even cameos by Steve Buscemi, Sam Raimi, and Frances McDormand in very minor roles, and the signature style of the Coen brothers is obviously here, with cleverly written dialogue and great performances (when they needed to be, anyways), but I honestly couldn't get invested in the conflicts of the characters.\n\nThis is one of those films that I'll definitely have to re-watch at one point or another if I really want to get the full experience offered by this film. However, it honestly just felt overly-convoluted and drab for a plot like this, and I'm not going to call it overrated by any means, and I still admire this movie purely because effort was obviously put into getting down the feeling of the era. I honestly wish I liked this movie, because as I said, it has all the elements to be a groundbreaking Coen brothers film, but it didn't quite click for me. This is a hard film to review because I'm clearly in the minority here and it's quite hard to really pin down as to what I didn't love about this film, yet despite all the flaws I'm listing here, I can't rate this film as a bad or even mediocre movie. It's certainly a film that should be seen whether you're a fan of the gangster genre or the Coen brothers, because many will probably (and evidently, they have) adore this one more than me. It's most likely my least favorite Coen brothers film to date, but don't get me wrong, it certainly had its moments of brilliance and it had the style down, but I couldn't get myself invested into the characters nor the plot. Miller's Crossing is definitely an admirable effort that I can't hate, although I'm going to have to re-watch it if I really want to get hooked into the plot.",

I watch every frame and just know the devotion that went into filming this movie, every new filmmaker should marvel at what is one of the greatest films ever made.

Now I'm mad at myself for waiting so long.\n\n\"Miller's Crossing\" is yet another well written, shot and directed Coen Brothers film. I've never seen anything that they've produced that I haven't loved or at least not really liked. Everything is so well done. Gabiel Byrne, Albert Finney and John Turturro are all so good. The dialogue is spot-on and the cinematography is beautiful. Watching this reminded me of the old gangster movies of the past, which I'm sure was part of the Coen's point. There was so much double-crossing, so many mob hits, and pointless gangster violence...it was great.\n\nThe only shortcoming I had with the film is the ending which was a little too open-ended.

May be hard for viewers not interested in crime films to follow the back and fourth scenes of mob and bookie talks. Gabriel Byrne is just short of evil but still charming. Lots of walk away one liners that Joel and Ethan Cohen expert in. Turturro might be the most compelling of all the actors with his slick talk bravado and sick attitude. The cast ensemble in general interacts together maliciously. The film lacks the deepest of meanings but is always entertaining, well written and cleverly comical. Reagan proves to be powerful but still a drunk who's soft around the edges for co actress Marcia Gay Harden's character Verna. The swift but bloody shoot out between Leo and the Tommy Gun yielding mobsters is one of my personal film favorites. He is unaffected by wizzing bullets with a poetic feel accompanied by the Italian vocal song playing. Reagan's hat symbolizes his constant loss of control over the things around him, including keeping his cap on his head. Turturro could have received nominations just based on his 'beg for life' scene. The concept of three of the mobsters being gay is almost refreshing and completely different. The end of the film is fast paced and exhilarating in a gloomy manner.",

            "content": "I don't think this would rate among the best of the Coen brothers I've seen but this is still a pretty great film.  The Coens have always found a way to take what influenced them and manage to add a new little twist or nook to it that gives it that flavor that the Coens are known for.  Whether it is the idiosyncratic characters, their darkly comic dialogue, or their stylish cinematography.  This film is obviously, in part as noir films also had a great influence on this film, influenced by Yojimbo at least as far as the story goes.  You have Tom Reagan playing the Irish mob and the Italian mob against each other like Toshiro Mifune does in that film.  But, again, the noir genre also had a big part to play in how the film was written.  Unlike their next film, Barton Fink, which was covered in so much subtext that multiple viewings of that film are a must if you want to catch all the little details, this one is much more straightforward, though that's not to say the film won't reveal more information in multiple viewings.  It still has that trademark Coen brothers humor as well as some topnotch writing, simply topnotch dialogue here.  The story, on the other hand, while solid and having some interesting twists and turns, simply isn't wonderful.  It's great seeing Tom manipulate both sides against each other, I just think they tried too hard to incorporate many different characters into the 'main story' so to speak.  This is something they improved GREATLY upon in Barton Fink.  That film had fewer characters and it was still a very complex story with a lot information to digest.  I just think they spend too much time trying to get some many characters in the film that Tom's character, other than playing both sides against each other, isn't really that memorable.  Especially compared to Barton Fink.  I realize it's unfair to compare the two films as they're clearly very different, but the story can be a bit of a mess sometimes.  That's not to say the film isn't great because I still really liked the film and I would definitely recommend it.  It's just that in the Coens' filmography, this isn't close to one of their best.  Still an excellent film though.  Funny, clever, stylish...everything you can expect from the Coens.",

It takes place place in the 30's in a city where a mob war is about to break out between Irish gang boss Leo (Albert Finney) and Italian gang boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), because spineless bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) has been manipulating and divulging Caspar's fixed fights to others involved. Leo's right hand man, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), is with the same woman as Leo, and keeps tabs on everybody before he seemingly changes allegiances. The plot is a dense one, and the key to understanding it lies in the expertly and cleverly written dialogue delivered by the ensemble of talented actors. The film bears the marks of the Coen Brothers' signature style with moments of dark humor sprinkled on its otherwise serious and brooding overtone. There is also a focus on morals within the gangster world as well as the use of hats to symbolize both clarity and status. What sets Miller's Crossing apart from other films of this genre is its ability to show and reflect on what drives these characters and its subtlety in doing so is what makes the movie so enthralling.",

Actors get lost in their roles; Turturro's scene in the woods with Gabriel Byrne is quite possibly the finest bit of acting in any Coen brothers film; raw emotional power at it's most hard-hitting.

Two scenes stand out in particular: one with mob violence set to opera music and the other being the bloody climax movie, which was very well-done. I felt like it should have ended after the latter scene, but there is a five minute scene after that is sort of underwhelming. It would have been better if it had ended with a bang rather than the quiet ending that the last scene is going for. Still, if you're a fan of movies by the Coen brothers, this isn't likely to disappoint.",

While it doesn't shy away from racism, it doesn't glorify it either, more or less it pokes fun at the racism of the times. Sometimes Albert Finney's character, Leo, doesn't seem like the kind of man who could control a city, but he more than makes up for it and the characters behind him are a testament to that. Instead of focusing on the family and the business, Miller's Crossing is more interested in ethics, noir, philosophy, and more existential issues. This is one of the best of the Coen Brothers films, it's filmed fantastic, the dialogue is top notch, and the characters are memorable. If William Faulkner teamed up with Dashiell Hammet, the result would look a little something like this.",

            "content": "Riding the resurgence of the gangster genre from the 1990's at a similar time to Goodfellas but before Bugsy, Miller's Crossing is amongst them as a lesser known effort.\nThis is unfortunate, as Miller's Crossing is an impeccably stylish and involving gangster film with a gripping story and involving characters.\n\nThe effort of The Coen Brothers is maximised in Miller's Crossing, as the applied style boasts the benefit of astounding visual quality combined with Academy Award worthy cinematography from Barry Sonnenfield which establishes the combined atmospheres of noir and gangster films, a crossover iconic of The Coen Brothers' efforts. The cinematography and visual style are impeccable, and the production design and costumes render Miller's Crossing impeccably set up for critical success. \nSo with the atmosphere already established by the excellent visual qualities of Miller's Crossing, next in line comes the story. Although the story is a small scale one with a complex amount of inner character dynamics serving as the front to establish importance, it works. Certain viewers may be thrown off by the slow pacing of Miller's Crossing and the allegorical dialogue may confuse them at times, but frankly Miller's Crossing tells its story impeccably well, combined with various themes and a strong level of violence to capture the brutality of the gangster world. The violence is never used to excess, but deals wonders to the drama of the story and actually is some of the finest violence I've ever seen in a film in my life, because its built on the foundation of great action scenes, spectacular sound effects and immaculate editing. Miller's Crossing constructs it weaponry brutally excellently and keeps it at a sophisticated level to enhance the atmosphere and keep the film alive. The sleight of hand that directors Joel Coen and Ethan Coen had with handling Miller's Crossing is impeccable, and I am stunned it was ignored by the Academy Awards because a film written so skilfully, directed so effortfully and designed with such absolute tenacity is worthy of a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture, among others.\nThe acting too was ignored, and that is despicable considering the acting in Miller's Crossing is some of the most intense and engaging acting I've seen in a film in a long time. To be frank, Miller's Crossing deserves two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.\nThe first nomination goes to John Tuturro. His performance is a strongly emotional one where he grips absolute fear and injects empathy straight into the heart of the viewers, only to turn it around instantly with a sleight of hand and emotional manipulation. He only has a brief time on screen, but his scenes are amongst the finest of the film due to his acting and ability to play such a strongly manipulative character who can fearlessly trip and kick a man in the face without giving it a second thought and then suddenly be on his knees with crocodile tears. John Tuturro is unforgettable in Miller's Crossing, and its his single finest performance throughout his career.\nThe second Oscar nomination goes to Joe Polito, because his physicality makes him an intimidating figure, but he articulates his words with an iconic voice and grip on his characters' emotions so that his success is double in effectiveness. Truly, Miller's Crossing is Joe Polito's finest performance to date and establishes the fact that he is a master with the sleight of hand for the gangster genre. No matter how many times he shouts \"Son of a Bitch!\" it never gets old and becomes more-or-less better every time without a sense of excessive repetition. His performance in Miller's Crossing is an unforgettable one and he is the centre of attentive focus the whole film because he takes the show and runs with it. \nBoth John Tuturro and Joe Polito go to show that The Coen Brothers have the ability to bring out the best in actors.\nAlso, in one of his finest efforts up next to another gangster-ish crime film The Usual Suspects, Gabriel Byrne takes the lead in Miller's Crossing with sophistication and skill without ever slipping up, conveying the strong stoicism required by his character and playing a role that embodies a mix of gangster and noir, as if to play a mix of Jack Nicholson in Chinatown and Robert De Niro in Goodfellas. Gabriel Byrne makes a terrific effort in Miller's Crossing, and he symbolises just what styles the film embody.\n\nFrankly, the first time you watch Miller's Crossing it may come of as slow, but its an impeccable gangster masterpiece and is truly one of The Coen Brothers' finest efforts.",

The first time I saw it, I didn't like it hugely when compared to their other work. Now, it just may be my all time favourite Coen Brothers film. It is 1929. Leo (Albert Finney) and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) are rival gang leaders. Caspar wants to kill Bernie (John Torturro) for ruining his bets, and Leo won't allow it because he is in love with Bernie's sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Little does he know that his right hand man, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is having an affair with Verna behind Leo's back. When war is waged between Leo and Caspar, Tom is forced to pick sides and construct an intricate plan apparently to save his own skin. Caspar's right hand man, the Dane (J.E. Freeman) is beginning to become wise to Tom's plan and gets even more agressive when Tom questions the loyalty of his lover, Mink (Steve Buscemi). I am sure anyone who hasn't seen the film will have passed out by now, but trust me, it's not as complex as it sounds. It's shot beautifully and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The writing is a fantastic echoe of the Film Noirs and gangster pictures from years gone by. It's thrilling but not at all melodramatic or overdone. Carter Burwell's score is flawless, and the mix of drama, action, humour and romance makes for an amazing filmic experience. Just great.",

            "content": "With \"Miller's Crossing\" Joel Coen and Ethan Coen made a gangster film masterpiece and arguably one of the best films of the 1990s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, the right hand man of prohibition era crime boss Leo O'Bannon, Albert Finney in a lion of a performance. The plot is far too complicated and serpentine to summarize in a few sentences, but essentially Tom finds himself between to rival gangs, ALA Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" or James M. Cain's \"Love's Lovely Counterfeit.\" \"Miller's Crossing\" is a beautiful homage to so many films, but manages to also become something wholly original. The Coen Brothers have taken genre archetypes and touchstones and make them completely their own. Handsomely shot by by ace cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (\"Raising Arizona,\" \"Big,\" \"Misery\") and bolstered by a lush Irish tinged score by composer Carter Burwell, the film would be worth watching simply for its rich production values, but it offers so much more. The film bristle with cracking dialogue that can be classic tough guy noir:\n\nEddie Dane: You understand that if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.\n\nOr funny:\n\nTom Reagan: I am awake.\nTad: Your eyes are shut.\nTom Reagan: Who you gonna believe?\n\nOr deep:\n\nTom Reagan: Nobody knows anybody. Not that well.\n\nTo even heartbreaking:\n\nVerna: I thought you said you didn't care about Leo no more. \nTom Reagan: I said we're through. That's not the same thing.\n\nThe story is as cleverly serpentine as the best Dashille Hammett or Raymond Chandler novel, but unlike many throwback gangster or noir films, this film tells it story with a heavy reliance on visuals, where the audience shown things, whether it's a look or a slow pan across an object, rather than an over reliance on telling the audience everything, which makes this film an experience of pure cinema. The film also excels in characterization. There's not a single character in the film who does not see themselves as a the hero of their own story. It didn't strike me until repeated viewing that the seemingly villainous Johnny Casper is really a hapless victim. From the opening scene he is completely honest and open about his intentions and consistently sticks to his word. Ethics! The one character with zero ethics, John Turturro's Bernie Bernbaum. He's true to himself, which is being unashamedly out for himself. Or take the menacing Eddie Dane, who is nearly right almost all along and reads the situation just about perfectly. I've always felt the best films don't have black hat villains and have characters who are all the heroes of their own story, and \"Miller's Crossing\" is a great example of this.  Overall, I will make the bold pronouncement that this film is one of the best film of the 1990s and is the best gangster films of all-time, standing alongside Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables,\" John Milius' \"Dillinger,\" and Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie & Clyde\" as the best modern incarnation since the Golden Age of Hollywood.

It is a movie that is overshadowed by other mobster movies like Goodfellas and is also under appreciated, not only as a mobster film, but as a Coen film. Miller's Crossing isn't given the credit it deserves. This gave audiences a sneak peek at what they would soon see in Fargo. The plot twists and turns and at times you don't know what the characters angles are or who they are really being loyal to.\u00a0\n\nA crime boss(Leo) and his right hand man(Tommy) split. Tommy turns his back on Leo and goes and joins up with Leo's enemy(Casper). There's so much going on, that the plot is kind of hard to describe from here. Casper wants a bookie dead and Leo doesn't. Leo and Tommy have the same love interest and that love interest's brother is the bookie. Casper's right hand man(the Dane) hates Tommy and likewise with Tommy. It isn't as hard to follow while watching the film, but there is a lot of double crossings and at times you really don't know what is going to happen.\n\nMiller's Crossing doesn't have the huge following of other Coen films like The Big Lebowski or Fargo. But big Coen brother fans know and love this movie because it is such a brilliant piece of filmmaking. You can put the dialogue up there with the best of the Coen's work. The films graphic violence scenes are masterfully well done, and although Roger Deakins didn't do the cinematography on Miller's Crossing, Barry Sonnenfeld does a great job making the movie look good.\n\nAs good as Miller's Crossing is, Joel and Ethan would still improve from here and go on to make even better movies. This deserves consideration when talking about the best of the best when it comes to the mobster genre. It might not be Goodfellas, but it isn't too far from it.\n\nVerna: Maybe that's why I like you, Tom. I've never met anyone who made being a son of a bitch such a point of pride.\u00a0",

That 3 hour experience is an hour-and-a-half you'll never get back, but that doesn't quite mean that their movies are bad. It's just that these guys are why they have the concept of \"The Emperor Has No Clothes\". Well, sure enough, this film is not what people are cracing it up to be. However, when the critics said that it boasts sharp dialogue, fine cinematography and solid performances, they hit the nail right on. Of course, they also had it right when they called the story a bit loose and when you mix that with the slowness, if you notice it, it's easy to lose interest from time to time. Other flaws include a lack of development, a somewhat unfitting score, some disturbances, some forced comic relief,\r\n\r\nStill, although it is no duller than any other Coen Classic, this film marks a turning point in some of the Coens' filmmaking, as they incorporate much of what's great about them. Sure, these traits are in the early stages, so their not as effective as they are now, but they remain present nonetheless. The Coens are some very funny writers, but when they're subtle, they're too subtle. Here, although their more blatant sense of humor here is a bit forced from time to time, as well as bit unoriginal, it's still quite effective. They have also upped the snap in their dialogue, with each line being consistently razor sharp. Although it can't fully do away with the slowness, this dialogue does add some kick to the storytelling, but couldn't have done so without the just-as-snappy delivery of the performers. Of course, the dialogue ins't the only thing solid about the performers, nor is it the only thing solid about the Coens.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of praise for the Coens that I don't agree with, but when I hear someone praise their acting direction, taste in style, snappy dialogue and less subtle sense of humor, I just have to say \"I hate to admit it, but you're right.\" Coen actors are distinctive, though not particularly monotonous. Each character has its own sublte, but still effective level of uniquness, but you can expect almost all of them to be quirky, memorable and overall well-performed. You can expect that trademark here, as well as the Coens' taste in visual style. Like many other fellow Coen films, this film features very impressive cinematography, with subtle, yet effectivley smooth quality and a fairly wide scope to put you in the environment. As for their storytelling here, it is rather uneven, but they do set a steady rise in compellingness as the film progresses, until it finally comes down to a pretty good ending. I'm not particularly a Coens fan, because there's so much of their work that falls flat to me, but on the whole, I have much respect for the them for their snappy style that keep their slow films going, even in here, where their style began making some turning points.\r\n\r\nOverall, although it is yet another slow entry in the Coen Catalogue, (man, they really should get into product branding) only with a little more uneveness, \"Miller's Crossing\" is kept going by solid performances, a smooth style, as well as sharp writing and directing by the Coens, leaving it to be a worthy turning point in the Coens' snappy filmmaking style.",

            "content": "Lyrical Pulp  \r\n\r\nI've only read a smattering of Hammett.  I haven't read [i]Red Harvest[/i] or [i]Glass Key[/i], the two books which most influenced this film.  (It's in theory an adaptation of [i]Glass Key[/i], apparently, but it draws influence from [i]Yojimbo[/i] and therefore [i]Red Harvest[/i].)  However, I think it's interesting that that most literary of pulp writers has influenced some of the most cinematic of filmmakers.  I'm not sure if Joel and Ethan Coen would thank me for calling them such, and I strongly suspect Kurosawa would have asked me to define my terms.  However, all three have made movies which explore the very capability of film as a medium and as an artform, and Dashiell Hammett stretched what pulp detective novels could do.  I think artists are drawn to art, though I don't think that's a revolutionary thought, and I think you'll find the art to draw on even if it isn't in the medium you yourself use.  It's also unsurprising that you will seek out the influences of your own influences.\r\n\r\nTom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) makes things happen for Leo (Albert Finney), who runs an unnamed town which might be in New Jersey.  (\"The Palisades\" gets a mention.)  Leo has a rivalry with Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), who thinks he should be running the town instead.  He wants to get Tom to work for him, and specifically, he wants Tom to take out Bernie Bernbaum (Jon Turturro).  Unfortunately, Bernie's sister is Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), who is Leo's girlfriend.  Oh, and she's fooling around with Tom.  However, things get complicated, to the point where I'm not entirely sure what was going on half the time, and Tom ends up working for Johnny Caspar after all.  And even though it isn't Tom's usual role, he is told to kill Bernie himself.  He lets Bernie live for Verna's sake, which turns out to be a big mistake.  There are layers and layers to the action, and I'm not sure the Coens themselves know what's going on at any one time.\r\n\r\nI think many of the techniques director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld used in this film would later serve the Coens well in films such as [i]O Brother, Where Art Thou[/i].  I don't know why Sonnenfeld stopped working with the Coens, but it's worth noting that he directed [i]The Addams Family[/i] the following year.  At any rate, much of the visual aesthetic of the movie was his work.  He told the brothers that the scenes at the little clearing in the woods called Miller's Crossing needed to be filmed exclusively on cloudy days.  Where he really lucked out, because the Coens didn't let the weather alter their filming schedule, and the fact that there is but a single scene in the movie with sun filtering through the trees is merely a quirk of fate.  The clouds merely did Sonnenfeld's bidding.  His use of lenses and angles are more technical than the average person cares about, but I think even the most film-ignorant viewer can feel the difference.\r\n\r\nThe Coens have a knack for the period piece.  Whether it's the sweeping grandeur of [i]True Grit[/i] or the urban claustrophobia of [i]The Hudsucker Proxy[/i], the Golden Age Hollywood of [i]Barton Fink[/i] or the Depression-Era South of [i]O Brother[/i], I honestly think their best work is done in the past.  I like [i]Fargo[/i] a great deal, of course, but it is actually a period piece, albeit a period perhaps ten years before the film was made.  I'm a rebel in that I don't much care for [i]Raising Arizona[/i] or [i]The Big Lebowski[/i], among their films actually set in about the year they're made.  I think there's something to reproducing an era that concentrates their abilities.  I suppose I'll have to wait until [i]No Country For Old Men[/i] to get a full perspective, though on further thought, I don't know when that one's set, either.  I don't think whimsy is enough, and I think their modern pieces are heavier on the whimsy than the character development or the artistry.\r\n\r\nThere is very little whimsy here.  Oh, there's the bit about how Johnny calls Bernie \"the shmatte,\" which is Yiddish for an old bit of rag--a piece of trash.  Though how Johnny Caspar, who is played by an Italian-American actor, knows Yiddish, I don't know.  There's the bit about how Bernie just appears in Tom's apartment when Tom doesn't let him in; I'm particularly amused by his statement that he didn't answer the phone because it probably wasn't for him.  But this is neo-noir, driven by forces too dark to let a little silliness into the proceedings.  The happiest ending possible for this movie is the one with the lowest body count.  Maybe it would have been best if Tom had just walked away before all this started, but of course he couldn't.  Tom is not the kind of character who knows how.  What's more, he probably doesn't know how to live a normal life, one without corruption and gangsters and so forth.  It's certainly not as though he'd be able to make a living at gambling, after all.",

There aren't enough funny moments and thematically the film is very weak. The noir elements of the film felt like they were squeezing all of the life out of the film. The femme fatale, the brooding/unpredictable protagonist, and the convoluted plot make most of the film feel uncomfortably familiar. I haven't seen enough classic film noirs to be derisive of the genre itself, but of the copycats I have seen, I am not impressed by it. The protagonist in a noir is never as complex as the film makes him out to be- he's just conflicted. And the protagonist in this film seems more flighty than he does multi-layered. He plays everyone against each other for seemingly no reason. The Man With No Name archetype, at least, has very clear motivations. Clint Eastwood's cowboy embodied the Noir protagonist, except set in a Western. The Man With No Name is self serving to the end. The Noir protagonist doesn't know what the the hell he wants, which makes him boring to watch. I am fine with conflicted protagonists but their conflict has to be interesting. As it is, the main character in this film isn't attached to anything- he doesn't want the girl, he doesn't care about his mob boss, he doesn't care about money...he's almost a slightly emotional android. Therein lies my central problem with the film (and maybe the film noir genre itself- time will tell on that one). I also don't like the convoluted mystery aspect of a noir film. I don't like mysteries at all unless the characters are elevated above the plot (like the detective serial element of the Harry Potter films).\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are some great moments. The unpredictable stand offs, the circus that is the gangsters and police, and the performances all are up to par with other Coen Brothers films. This film just doesn't have enough soul. It is caught up in its boring protagonist and mediocre plotting.",

The Coens always made solid, entertaining films aside from one film, which I won't mention. They are perfectionists of cinema. Miller's Crossing is a stunning gangster film that is set during the prohibition era. This film is a masterpiece of the crime genre, and the Coen Brothers have made a memorable film that will appeal to fans of gangster films and crime films in general for that matter. Miller's Crossing has got an incredible cast of talented actors. The film is well crafted, and the pace of this film is really what elevates this film in telling a terrific, effective and emotional story. The Coens are masters at their craft and it shows. The cast are terrific. Gabriel Byrne gives an excellent performance as Tom Reagan an Irish mob bosses' right hand man. Albert Finney plays Leo, the mob boss that Tom works for. Finney is incredible in the part he plays. The film is an epic in crime films, and fans of the genre owe themselves the chance to check this film out. Miller's Crossing has a few memorable and classic scenes. One scene that made the film truly something different was when Leo nearly gets assassinated and gets the upper hand, and arms himself with a Tommy Gun and in a very stylized and violent scene, kills his potential murderers Hey, the old man is still an artist with a Thompson. Another scene was when Tom is force to knock off Bernie Bembaum (John Torturro) that scene has so much power as we see Bernie beg for his life. Miller's Crossing is a flawless gangster film, and it definitely ranks up there as one of the best gangster films such as The Godfather, Goodfellas and Once Upon A Time in America.",

So without any tougher ado here is the second review instalment in my Coen Bothers Review week.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Two: MILLER'S CROSSING [1990]: in the tradition of most gangster films Post- THE GODFATHER the majority of modern gangster films are generally set back in the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's. With The Coen's MILLER'S CROSSING is set in the days of the Prohibition era in some big U.S city as this films back drop. With the Coen's behind this film MILLER'S CROSSING is a very good film but not one of the greatest films of all time. Out of five stars this film would get a rating of three and 1/2 in my book but don't get me wrong despite this MILLER'S CROSSING is a solid piece of dramatic entertainment.\r\n\r\n \r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some large U.S city in the days of Prohibition, the story of this film sees the top crime boss of the city an Irish crime boss called Leo starts to have trouble with the Italian Crime Boss Johnny Casper over one Bookie called Bernie.  The problem being Leo is in a relationship with Bernie's sister Verna, and despite Leo's trusted aid Tom Regan (Gabriele Byrne) suspecting that Casper wants Bernie dead, Leo ignores Casper's demands. The result is Johnny Casper who has grown in power starts to muscle out Leo from the top position as dominant crime lord of the city. When Leo needs help Tom it turns out Verna had slept with Tom, Leo oust him from his organised criminal group.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTom then approaches Johnny Casper to join his mob after this happens but with Casper's trusted henchman Eddie Dane isn't convinced of Tom's newly found loyalty so a test is then required. With Casper now the new crime overlord of the city Casper now has the power to kill of Bernie. Eddie and his associates make Tom take Bernie out to Miller's crossing to kill him. But deep within the woods Tom with possible feelings for Verna can't kill Bernie so Tom spares Bernie's life on the condition he is to leave the city, but will Eddie be convinced of Tom's newly found loyalty and will Bernie be more trouble alive rather than dead?\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, DIRECTION, AND CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the performances in this film, all are generally very good from the cast but the real show stealer is Gabriele Byrne as Tom Regan. For the most part it almost seems like either Byrne or the Coen's had envisioned this character as a clone of Michael Corleone of THE GODFATHER saga. Byrne seems to copy how Michael was played by Al Pacino in the end of the First GODFATHER and throughout THE GODFATHER PART 2 as a once decent person losing all sense of normal emotion and humanity. \r\n\r\nThe direction by The Coen's is fairly decent in this film, for an early Coen Brothers film MILLER'S CROSSING sees the pair at this stage developing into fully fledge Auteur filmmakers. In the spirit of dramatic gangster films The Coen's do make this film a nail biter in parts with one or two good old fashioned killing (much expected in a Mob film), but as a whole  it's just downright average.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't average is the Cinema-Photography; this film was shot by none other than the same director of Photography of RAISING ARIZONA and unlike that film over the top style of shooting, MILLER'S CROSSING has some fantastic and static shots which just looks great in relation to this films story.\r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts: MILLER'S CROSSING is overall a very good and straight forward film. But since it blends elements form greater films, MILLER'S CROSSING does come across as being heavily influenced by THE GODFATHER [1972] and YOJIMBO [1961]. But that aside I must confess this Coen Brother film is a good one from the brotherly duo, my rating is a deserved 70%.",

Miller's Crossing holds up pretty well and is an entertaining contribution to the gangster genre that was resurgent in the 90's thanks to films like Goodfellas.  All the Coen staples are here:  stylized dialogue, quirky characters, elaborate set pieces, fat men screaming (yes, look at all of their movies throughout the 90's and you'll notice a scene where a fat man is screaming).  My favorite set piece in this film is the attempted assassination of Leo played by Albert Finney.  Wonderfully over-the-top.

Miller's Crossing has all the characteristic style of Coen brothers. The cinematography is sumptuous, the dialogues crackle with the usual dash of humor he incorporates and the conflicting mixture of violence & humor or serene background score keeps the atmosphere charged all times. But above all it's the entertainment quotient the movie has, brought through by one exciting character after another where this Coen brothers film trumps all their works. And none so exciting as Tom Reagen brilliantly played by Gabriel Byrne. It's one the most mystifying leading character I have seen in Cinema. He gets beaten up by anybody & everybody,one scene in which he raises his hand on anybody in the film will have you laughing your head off, but still is a pain in the ass for everyone, a person everybody wants to be on his side due to the street smart personality & keen eye he has about people, a kind of modernized version of old Humphree Bogart, only more amoral & less apologetic. \n\nWhether Miller's Crossing is Coen brother's best is matter of incessant argument but for me it's the most endearing work by them, a film that finally turned me into a fan of Coen brothers.",

I quite like the Coens' work, but this is one that has escaped me thus far, hence the borrowing of said DVD. It's very definitely a Coen brothers script with some excellent dialogue and plenty of plot twists. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take that guy out into the woods & deal with him while I write the next paragraph).\r\n\r\nTom Reagan is advisor to Leo, the mob boss who runs things around here. Rival boss, Johnny Caspar wants Leo to give him permission to have Bernie Bernbaum killed because he's making problems for his gambling syndicate. Now Bernie's sister, Verna is seeing Leo and so Leo is reluctant to upset the apple cart (if you know what I mean). Also, Verna is seeing Tom on the side and if Leo ever found out about that there was gonna be some big trouble for him. Add to this the fact that, Tom is also a bit of a gambler and has run up quite a debt, but insists on paying it off without any help. So, one day Casper makes Tom an offer and, as you can probably guess, this is where all the fun starts... I hope you understand that lot! I'm gonna leave it there so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning, this film has a truly excellent script with some great dialogue and clever plot twists. It's a very well made film with a very appropriate soundtrack (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have. Or maybe films have been made since that do what this does, but better. I don't quite know what it is, but this one seems to lack the punch that other Coen brothers films have. I felt that, although he is very good, Gabriel Byrne seems very subdued all the way through and this appears out of character for someone in his position. But aside from that, it's well worth seeing... Recommended (if only for Albert Finney wielding a Thompson Machine Gun to great effect). \r\n\r\nMy score: 7.5/10\r\n\r\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links and bigger print) on my blog at:\r\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.com/2011/03/film-review-millers-crossing-1990.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!... :)",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers are up there on my list of favorite directors but I'd be lying if I said I thought they were one of the best. There movies often have imaginative stories and ideas behind them that come out a jumbled mess and especially in regards to the ending leave something to be desired. So you would think a movie that had a pretty solid and well told story, fantastic performances, a dark edginess too it and still maintained their quirky style would be one of the greats right? Regrettably not, you see this is one those early low budget offerings that became more popular later as the Directors popularity grew. All they'd done of note at this point were Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. The legend goes they wrote this story as a big epic noir film inspired by the works of Dashiell Hammett in the late 80s but took a break after suffering from writers' block, during which they wrote and filmed Barton Fink. After completing the script the Coens decided to film in New Orleans, the location in the movie is never said, but New Orleans has plenty of areas that haven't been changed since the 20s. So little known were they Joel has told tales of Police harassing them on the set, constantly asking for filming permits, and supposedly behaving like the cops in the movie. Not the most hectic production tale I've heard but it does raise the question how did something good come from this? Is it really their underrated best work you've never heard of, or is it just something movie geeks have latched onto? Let's take a look with gratuitous Tommy gun fire.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows Irish mob boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney, who gives a fine performance and kicks some serious ass in this movie) is confidante Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, in my favorite and easily his most quotable role) a smart strategist who is quiet, refined, contemplative and a wise ass. Leo has a relationship going with gun moll Verna Bernbaum (Marcia Gay Harden, in icy, playing hard to get mode) but unbeknownst to him she has a thing going on with Tom on the side. Meanwhile Italian underling Johnny Caspar (John Polito as the character in every gangster movie you enjoy, but has a nasty temper) is being screwed over in betting on races by bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro who was snubbed for an Oscar I tell ya!) and announces to Leo his plans to \"bump the schemata.\" Bernie is Verna's sister however so Leo decides to protect him from Caspar, and so it's war in true Tommy gun wielding prohibition era fashion.\r\n\r\nAll of this is explained in the opening scene, a Godfather riff between Leo and Johnny the sets the style and particularly killer dialogue for the brothers for the rest of the film. So as you can imagine, a few plot twists occur from here, and our hero Tom is right in the thick of it, alternately manipulating the people and situations to his advantage and going along for the ride which grips you for its entire blistering run time. The dialogue is the best the Brothers have ever produced, every exchange being a wonderful meld of words and all of them feeling like they have weight. The story is air tight and riveting, each plot twist rather than obscuring the narrative bringing it into sharper clarity for the jaw dropping ending. I also loved the heavy amount of visual symbolism the movie went for, most ostentatiously the fucking hat. What does it mean? The movie's opening credits roll over an image of it blowing into the forest, Tom loses it in a card game after which we learn of his and Verna's affair, there are an obscene amount of close ups on it, an numerous characters draw reference to it both Toms and just hats in general. Hell, Tom discusses a dream with Verna about chasing the hat but I'll be damned if I know what the fuck it means which doesn't make it any less intriguing. And the acting, my god sells the deal on this being such a great movie. The now famous scene where Tom marches Bernie into the woods at Miller's Crossing to execute him while he begs for his life is so fucking gripping and powerful because of the look of mixed emotions trying to be stony on Byrne's face and Turturro's chilling little freak out. But as much as I liked the side characters and supporting roles, no one intrigued as much as our hero Tom. He seems human, you can relate with him, admire him, find him witty and cool, but his motivation is so strange and changes so much you also are forced to question if he's genius or doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. But either way great character, great performance, great fucking movie.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I found this to be successful, hell one of the Coens' most successful. I know many people not very fond of it but this movie hooked me in and for once with a Coen production I felt satisfied when the credits rolled. Hell, I felt the need to watch it again, four times in one month to be exact just to make sure I'd gotten all I could out of the film. For whatever reasons, maybe it's that I love characters like Tom who aren't afraid to be a smart ass in life or death situations, maybe it's because of the over the top action scenes that kept me intermittently entertained or maybe it's because of how many questions it raised I was eager to explore this movie had a profound impact on me and remains to this day one of my favorites, so I recommend you check it out if you haven't already.",

The Coens mine this masterfully crafted screenplay for both laughs, violence and a peculiar kind of, if not emotion or sympathy per se for their characters, then at least a lot of respect for their convictions. The script often displays a wicked glee in exploiting the style of the genre to test their characters limits. Byrne's Tom Reagan remains strong to his belief in \"ethics\" even if this leads him into a snake pit of twisted loyalties. It's this strong characterisation that helps keep you rivetted even if the plot throws you off like a bucking mule, which it will even if you play close attention - part of the fun is hearing that a minor characters death is dismissed as \"a mixup\" leading you a sigh of relief that perhaps keeping up with who did what to whom is not actually a priority. The Coens also deliver violent set pieces to match the sharp tongues, standout being Finney's Leo proving himself \"an artist with a tommy gun\". This, and the film as a whole, displays both a sincere yet also a calculated, tongue in cheek approach to genre, a very tricky tone to balance but the Coens nail it, aided by a pitch-perfect cast and technical polish.",

Miller's Crossing is a crushingly somber story of a man who doesn't want to chase his hat, but does so anyway.  Gabriel Byrne is a cold, calculating mob enforcer struggling to navigate the violent mob war between the Tommy Gun artistry of Albert Finney and the ethically obsessed Jon Polito.   And it's not just simply endlessly quotable like every other Coen Brothers flick, it's deliciously pornographically obsessed with hard heavy jazzy gangland language and the result is an aural landscape similar to the purple prose of HBO's Deadwood.  Watch out for the high hat, listen for the rumpus, and beware the gory hate of J.E. Freeman's The Dane.  It should also be noted that this is the last collaboration with cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld; he may not be as painterly as future collaborator Roger Deakins, but man, he perfectly captures the Rashomon forest and those handsome men in hats.

They say this is the best after Godfather, well i can tell you this, difference between these two can be measured in centuries. Big difference...not even close.\r\nGood acting performance by Gabriel Byrne. The rest of the cast sleepwalks.\r\nBudget was 14 million and gross 5 million...hmm?....not much.\r\nCan NOT be serious gangster movie with only 14 body counts in total, come on!\r\nAlthough, shooting scenes were great, considering its 1990 movie.\r\nIncorrect - In the scene where Leo uses the Thompson sub-machine gun he should have had to reload at least 6 times. He did none.\r\nThe Dane calls Tom, \"Einstein\", for being so smart. However this film is set in the the 1930s, when the real Einstein hadn't done anything noteworthy to the general public yet in those years.\r\nTom is playing a game between two mafia bosses, now it seems like its either he is not sure about his loyalty or being super smart and already had this plan figured out from the very start. Mixed opinions there. Not believable.\r\nTom didnt want to kill Bernie because he is a brother of a girl who he sleeps with, and i understand that, its a moral logic, but at the end he kills him afterall, what happened to caring if girl which he loves will hate him for the rest of his life? He did care before. Hm....weird?\r\nFew fighting scenes, where next scene Tom's face doesnt have bruises. Makeup artist was off sick?\r\nSome scenes were just silly, no seriousness to gangster style.\r\nSeems like script was written how the movie goes along. Felt bored at some points by empty conversation scenes and drama pauses. \r\nNo suspense feeling at all.\r\nBoth mafia bosses are played soft and kind of dumb. Not really appropriate presentation of mafia boss.\r\nWhat was the hidden agenda with Tom's hat? His dream also? Millers crossing?\r\nThrough the first half was difficult to catch up with all the character's names thrown in your face.\r\nThere was no chemistry between the girl and Tom.\r\nAnyhow, some bits were entertaining, suppose to be intellectual gangster movie but for me just felt like dragging and dry. The film didnt manage to keep me interested throughout, at all. Sorry, but I just don't think Miller's Crossing is all that good.\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Miller's Crossing is a gangster drama set in prohibition era made by the ingenious Coen brothers. Unlike many others, I don't think this is Coen's best work yet it isn't anything much below their very high standard. I had occasional trouble with understanding some phrases or even words used in this movie but fortunately, it didn't take away too much from my experience. In fact, those phrases and certain words made the depiction of that particular era more realistic which is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe story of this movie isn't a new one. It covers a well covered ground before, yet it isn't boring for one second. Not having experienced nearly enough gangster movies set in that era, with the troubles of some unfamiliar phrases as I said already, I was a bit lost in all the characters and their connections in the first half of the movie. I decided to start from the beginning with my concentration set very high and I must admit it was easier to follow it all on the second viewing (of the first half). It helped me fully comprehend this film.\r\n\r\nGabriel Byrne plays the title character here Tom Reagan. He is an assistant of the mob boss Leo running the town. As his right hand he plays a very large part in Leo's decision making. But throughout the film we realise more and more that he is actually just looking out for himself. Byrne is a good actor and I always thought that. My first experience of him playing a superb role was in End of Days. Yeah, I know. That movie sucks big time, but Byrne was one of the rare positive things about it. He played Satan and somehow it felt like the role was made just for him. Albert Finney played the Irish crime boss Leo and he was equally great. He has some particular badass scenes and he delivered with excellence. Not only that, his interactions with Tom were really great and with the right amount of chemistry. Jon Polito played the rival Italian crime boss Johnny Caspar and he was absolutely outstanding. I don't remember seeing him anywhere else but I can hardly believe he surpassed his character here. John Torturro played great too and many believe this is his best role right here as Bernie, a small time criminal just trying to stay alive. On the long list of superb actors playing in Miller's Crossing there is also brilliant Marcia Gay Harden as Verna. Bernie's sister and Leo's soon to be wife. She was gorgeous to look at but she matched her beauty with stout performance. One of my favourite actors, Steve Buscemi plays a very small part here too so I must mention him, oh and there are interesting cameos from Frances McDormand and Sam Raimi himself (I bet you won't guess who he is in the movie even when you do see him).\r\n\r\nSo to summarise, Miller's Crossing is a must see for every fan of the Coen's work and a good watch for anyone else wanting to see a fine movie with magnificent performances all round. It had some flaws in the plot itself and that's why my rating isn't higher but it really isn't anything big. And one more thing. You'll find plenty of cool quotes here and I'll just end my review with my favourite - \"What's the rumpus?\"",

In many ways, Miller's Crossing feels like the Coens' later film The Big Lebowski--it concerns a man who is somewhat of a loser who becomes slowly intertwined in a variety of different criminal plots that spiral out of control and threaten to drown him.    Femme fatales, antiheros, mob bosses, corrupt policemen, and all the other staples of film noir parade before the camera but always with a winking smile from the Coen brothers.  What results is a purely bad-ass, hilarious, and original piece of gangster cinema that could not have been created by anyone else.  Plus, Miller's Crossing brings a new twist to the genre by focusing on Irish organized crime.",

Still, there is much to admire with this film. Visually, it is astounding. But it's also well written, often times humorous, well-acted, and intelligent; just as a Coen Brothers film should be. The film is a showcase of common Coen Brothers-fare, and that's why it's both good and imperfect. I love the Coen Brothers, so that is a good thing. But then again, nothing new means nothing interesting most of the time. Well, that does not go for the Coen Brothers. Just because their talents consist of great cinematography, an eye for acting talent, and great writing does not entail that any of it gets old. I love it as long as they keep the good stuff coming. However, they do not come without their flaws. But then again, that's what makes them so goddamn balanced whether half of their films are just barely escaping mediocrity or not. None the less, this is a great film from the duo; a smart period piece. This gangster drama may not be the most memorable cinematic experience, but in no way is it forgettable. I do not regret the experience; quite in fact I enjoyed (nearly) every moment of it. What can I say; the film was delightful, in a twisted/violent sort of way. You know: the usual Coen Brothers-fare. Reader be warned: this is not a good way to start with the Coen Brothers. Start with \"Blood Simple\", as I did long ago. THEN see this movie, for it is not worth a miss. That is unless you can't stand heartless movies such as this. Its own heartless tendencies drew me into the film. It is a paragon of pure interest from start to finish. Fun to look at, interesting to watch, and even more fun to absorb: that is what \"Miller's Crossing\" is. The only thing it isn't is a classic.\r\n\r\n           The Coen Brothers tell similar stories most of the time. One of them is that of a man (or woman) who takes on a personal quest which renders them down the path of eternal darkness over time. This is one of those stories. Tom Reagan is the confident of Irish Gangster-Political Boss Leo O'Bannon. When an Italian rival named Johnny Caspar shows up and expresses his wish to kill a man named Bernie, who is the brother of Tom's \"lover\", Tom expresses his own views on the matter. He says that he wants to protect Bernie, which greatly angers Caspar. Leo then goes to war with Caspar, throwing Tom into the middle of it. Tom eventually goes to work for Caspar, who shows him the dark side of criminal action. They capture Bernie and in the woods, he begs Tom for his heart and his forgiveness (best scene in the movie). When Tom fails to shoot Bernie and lets him go on his way, the matter is only complicated further. As it turns out, Bernie is not ready to go away. He comes back and attempts to blackmail Tom. This causes even more conflict as Tom attempts to get Caspar to go in for the kill. But...ah, screw it. It's not worth spoiling any more of the plot. This is a well written film and I wouldn't want to ruin the experience. I liked the execution and the outcome was satisfying. There were several outstanding moments of considerable power that stood out against the more typical moments scattered throughout, and that's why this movie works: because it has moments of high tension and emotion. I'd say this movie is completely heartless much like its main character, but a film of such artistic craft needs to have a heart to get by.\r\n\r\n       Gabriel Byrne is a talented man, as far as I can tell from his performance. Byrne gives off such good vibes in this film, playing such an intense and dare I say heartless character. And it takes a big character for me to call them \"heartless\". The word is not one I enjoy using lightly. I use it here only because the character himself claims that he is heartless. And according to definition, he most certainly is. But Byrne's performance has plenty of heart in it, at least enough to move it far towards greatness. John Turturro gives one of his most eccentric and interesting performances to date in \"Miller's Crossing\". When Turtorro's character begs the main character for mercy, there was such power in his fear and stuttering. I can't say I know what compels me to praise it so, but what the hell. I say it's memorable. Albert Finney gives a nice performance, as does the ever-so-delightful on-screen playfulness of Jon Polito. Otherwise, there are some very good cameos in this film, one of them being a couple good-earned seconds from Steve Buscemi. Let me tell you: he deserves more time than most people involved in this film. He is a great actor with great skills, and he's going to do great. Enough said.\r\n\r\n          The Coen Brothers make delightful films which are (mostly) delightful to watch. While most of them start out either lightly or heavily, each and every one has at least one bloody or violent scene in them. That is the Coen Bros' signature touch; a dash of darkness. In \"Miller's Crossing\", the darkness is imprinted in the film from start to finish. This film reminds me of how violent the Coen Brothers can get without going terrifically over-the-top. I like their sense of restraint without restraint. They are courageous men. \"Miller's Crossing\" literally caught my eye. It's as visually beautiful as any Coen Brothers movie, featuring more dazzling cinematography a minute than my eyes can typically handle at the moment. However, I was able to swallow all of it by the end. I cant' say that it was the most difficult thing to do. The original soundtrack/score was also pretty good, although by no means was it masterful. Most of the better pieces were the mellow ones, as on the contrary some of the better SCENES were the more intense ones. That's odd for the Coen Brothers, since some of the best stuff in their films comes out of silence. In this film it is not as so. Most of it comes out of scenes such as the begging-in-the-woods one as well as the baddass-old-man one. The elderly are back, and kicking loads of ass.\r\n\r\n           To fans of the Coen Brothers, definitely see this movie. Anyone else, see it too. If you are not entirely new to the Coen Brothers, that is. If you are, then go someplace else first. Start with one of their first GOOD movies (that means NO \"Raising Arizona\") and then come back to this beauty. Regardless of whether it's truly awesome or not, there's still a whole lot to consider with this film. It is very artistic visually and is a very well written gangster-period-piece. I like me a good period piece, and while this may not be one of the bests, I can say that it was worth my time. After all, who doesn't like good acting, good visuals, and good direction combined into one pretty-damn-great film? Not me. I like my films that way, as long as they are truly artistic. And \"Miller's Crossing\" is for sure an artistic film. So go on and see this movie, for while it is not one of the Coen Brothers' best films of epic perfection, it is still one of the good ones. Take it as you will.",

There's something a bit off about the writing, however - the Coens' droll, verbose humor seems a bit out of place in a story about 1920s gangsters, and the movie never quite decides whether it wants to be a straight noir or a dark comic parody of one and settles on an appropriate tone.  As a result, as well-crafted as it is it doesn't stick in the brain the way \"Blood Simple\" or \"Fargo\" or \"No Country For Old Men\" do, and is well behind those movies in the brothers' filmography.",

Cagney, Bogart, Edward G., and I bunch of others I can't think of right now. Let me tell ya, it's kind a hard to separate this movie from all those noir-y gangster pics. This may as well have been Gilda or something, some kind of passion-play from the late 30s about the good ol' days. Talk about a gorgeous lookin' movie, all that attention to set, those details, and those wonderful performances. Albert Finney really delivers something I never noticed twenty years ago when this came out: solid weakness. And that whole thing between him and Byrne. Nice. And of course Marcia Gay deserved all the accolades, as did Turturro and everyone else. I think at this point I'll watch anything with Polito in it. This guy is a classic supporting actor. He's the one that brings it all back to that other era, an era where the supporting cast was as interesting, sometimes even more interesting, than the main players. I went a bit cold on some of the Coen's later works, Serious Man brought me back, Miller's Crossing we love. We loved the music, pace, look of it, dialogue. The dialogue alone is a character, seamlessly a part of everything else. A big sprawling love-letter to classic film, a masterwork of sorts, near-perfect writing, entertaining, smart. What a classic movie is all about. Am I gushing?",

Nobody, and I mean nobody who writes and directs all of their own films has this kind of track record.  All but 4 of their films are original screenplays, not an easy feat.  I'm deeply in love with just about every one of their movies I've seen.  From Raising Arizona, to Fargo, to O Brother Where Art Thou?, all way the up to last year's True Grit.  They're amazing.  I've seen all but 4 of their films and the one that stands out as the most unique in style, tone and structure to me is Miller's Crossing in 1990.  Just about all of the Coen's films have their roots in film noir in some form or another.  Some have the look down pat (The Man Who Wasn't There).  Some take the genre and spin it into pure comedy (The Big Lebowski).  But in 1990, with their third film, they decided to go all out and just make a film noir gangster movie set in the film noir world.  Pre-War 1930s on the East Coast in a nameless city.  There's the Irish gangsters and the Italians.  When a war breaks out one man stands in the middle and plays both sides.  This is very much from the Dashiel Hammet novel The Glass Key.  \n\tThe movie is sensational.  You would never know that these 2 guys just made the wacky (and genius) comedy Raising Arizona just a film ago.  Miller's Crossing is one of the Coens' more adult films.  That is to say they make movies that everyone can like (Fargo, Raising Arizona or O Brother Where Art Thou?) and then they make movies that mostly people over 21 will like (The Big Lebowski or Barton Fink).  Miller's Crossing is not for everyone, the dialogue is very stylized.  It reminds me a lot of the way Deadwood was written, going to style rather than realism.  The violence is brutal, very brutal.  No cartoonish, but very gruesome.  Think Godfather with more violence.  But hey, if you like film noir and are in for a mature story with perfect acting and cinematic technique like I am then you'll love this.  If you want an action movie with minimal dialogue then please watch something else.\n\tMiller's Crossing came out in 1990 in between Goodfellas and The Godfather Part III.  The Departed could have come out in that shuffle and would have gotten lost.  But watching it as part of a series is the filmography of America's greatest sibling directors it stands alone as their crime epic masterpiece.  Catch it on Blu Ray and revel in the beauty of one of the finest pieces of screen violence.  Albert Finney takes on some guys breaking into his house with a Tommy Gun to the tune of Danny Boy and it almost makes me tear up.  What does make me tear up is a scene in the woods where John Turturro begs for his life, I've never seen an actor lose his @#$% so realistically.\n\tSo watch the movie, know it's a talky piece, but the 'action' will satisfy.  It's not for everyone, but everyone should watch it once.",

He's done so much for Leo after crossing him (which in the end turns out to be more or less - saving him from a world of trouble from Casper) and Leo just doesn't get it. Leo is engaged to Verna even though Tom has been through all this trouble because of their relationship and when Tom is offered back his old position and is forgiven, he explains he wants none of that and he stands his ground as a sudden facial expression of realization sweeps over the face of Leo and he walks away. \n\nGood movie.",

            "content": "The Coens, always masters of the period piece, gangster, uninhibited violence types of films, have made a much more subtle, and more character driven film than they had previously attempted. Though there are many supporting characters with their own vendettas, political factions, and die hard approach to crime syndication, it's the singular path of Tom Reagan (Gabriel Bryne) that interests the watcher of this film. It's his actions that drive the rest of the film into fruition. The supporting cast is exceptional, beyond words or compare. Albert Finney is the mob boss who runs the unnamed city (the film was shot in New Orleans) with the full support of the city's mayor and police chief during the Prohibition era. He runs the rackets, a booze joint, and has Reagan by his side as his right hand man. Reagan himself is an enrapturing character, both quiet and reserved, and yet frightening in the fact that he has a fierce attitude under the surface. Though he seems not able to kill the men who cross him and his boss through his harsh conscience, he is dangerous, able to hit men with chairs, backstab anyone who is a direct threat, and change the entire political system of the city through blackmail, deceit, and faking deaths left and right. He even lets certain men who try to berate and reveal his true colors be beaten and killed for their efforts. The entire movie is an intricate plot filled melange of slight noir, gangster film, and period piece. The plot was so thorough that the Coens had to stop and write an entirely different movie just to get their heads clear. The film is filled with iconic scenes of murder, intrigue, and politics that amount to some very tense scenes. The entire film isn't all needless violence of course. The scene in the woods, one of the only examples of one scene hinging everything together, was poignantly bereft of violence and later came back to make the ending even more meaningful. The absolute badass of everything was when Finney escapes death while pulling some Godfather worthy stunts. Every aspect of this has the right mood, an understandable yet complex plot, and a great cast. One of the best Coen films of all time.",

Miller\u0092s Crossing is one of their earlier works that is almost as good as any Coen Brother film I have seen to date.\r\nTypical of their films, the screenplay is just about faultless. The language style is extremely unique here. Unlike their later film No Country For Old Men, however, this film is just about saturated with dialogue. That is not a problem, but what could potentially be a problem for some viewers is that there is a lot going on with the plot. People are betrayed and double crossed and triple crossed and faking deaths and seducing gangsters left, right, and center. I had to pay apt attention to be careful to not get lost in the picture.\r\nBut I never was. It is not hard to pay attention to Miller\u0092s Crossing because the story and characters are so interesting. They scream for attention to be paid to them, and I loved every minute watching them. The themes are typical Coen Brothers, but it is hard to find fault with a lot of this picture.\r\nIt\u0092s also quite new, believe it or not. Even though it\u0092s an old style gangster movie, the Coen Brothers are skilled enough directors that they can make it an old style gangster film while keeping the characters and themes and plots very modern in feel. This film keeps the old style alive with its style of language and murky set designs.\r\nBut I cannot downplay the engulfing nature of this story and characters. These filmmakers do very well with their direction and screenplay, and Miller\u0092s Crossing is definitely a testament to that.\r\n9/10",

You can even just enjoy the jokes and all the beautiful wardrobe and props. \n\nSo many things have to go right for a complex mobster movie to feel fresh and fluid, especially if it's set decades before the time of filming. All of those things went right in the making of this movie, and they seem to have just gotten lucky on top of it and gotten everything to work out just the way they wanted. \n\nNot too many movies stand up to viewing after viewing after viewing the way this one does. Even with so many moments that are kind of silly and overdone, just ripe spoofs of some of the cliched moments of classic gangster films, you still get fully sucked in and it never lets you go. There's something about the Coen brothers' style that allows them to get away with making fun of moments you've seen a million times in movies, or even replay them without making fun of them, while they still keep you rooted in the characters and action you're watching now. \n\nThey're always layering so much into every scene--you're getting to know the character, you're reacting to some interesting dialogue, you're catching crucial information about the plot, and probably seeing some beautifully composed shot all at the same time. As the shot unfolds, you realize the actors have to hit their marks exactly for the composition to hold together, while at the same time, you're keeping track of action and reaction. To add a comment on film history just deepens the events onscreen. When you're already layers deep, adding more just intensifies the complexity, rather than distracting.\n\nThere's not much to say about the elements of the plot itself that wouldn't spoil the fun of watching it all unspool. A dozen great actors offer work that's as good as anything they've ever done, they follow a plot that carries you along and holds together beautifully, the dialogue is eminently quotable. Gangster movies are a love it or hate it genre for so many people, but there's nothing else that even comes close to what the Coens did here.

He and I had never gotten to bond, really. As he was the oldest of three much older brothers, he left for college as my earliest memories were reaching real clarity. So having him move back in with Mom at the same time I did was an opportunity to plumb his vast knowledge of pop-culture. It is a period which, to this day, has shaped the way I look at movies, TV, and comics. \nI remember watching this, one of his favorite movies, and thinking that the hit-scenes were pretty cool, and wishing that Steve Buscemi had more time on-screen. Don't ask me why. I'm much older and wiser now, and last night after DVRing the movie off FMC, I got to watch it again for the first time with more refined and grown-up sensibilities. \nThis is a gangster story with Coen Brothers flair. It made me laugh to see John Polito as a Capone-style Italian gangster pleading his case in the beginning to the Irish overlord Leo to let him kill one particular thorn in his side as a matter of ethics. This kind of moral juxtaposition sets the tone for the entire film. It's a love story as well, albeit a tragic one. It's a drama with character in spades, and no shortage of comedy if you have an eye for the Coens' weird ability to stage shots in such a way as to make you giggle, even when you're not sure why. \nAny Coen Brothers fan or gangster movie fan who has not yet seen this twenty year old gem would do well to. If you haven't seen it in ages, see it again.",

This film has everything that a prohibition movie should have: tommy guns, psychotic gangsters, speakeasies and a femme fatale. What brings the movie together is Gabriel Byrne. His subtle performance as a bitter advisor to a gangland chief is the real key. You hate him for being a son of a bitch turn coat but as the movie goes on, and everything unravels, you truly begin to see that he is a hero that does in fact believe in something. The homosexual undertone is a bit much, but it helps with the plot. A standout is John Turturro, the crooked bookie who begs for his life in the woods and then blackmails the man who spared his life. Albert Finney plays the tough but kind mob boss well and Marcia Gay Harden does a surprisingly good job playing the fem fatale, who takes advantage of the boss's soft side. Jon Polito does what he is good at, portraying a psychotic upstart italian mobster who is easily fooled. He does show range by showing the sympathetic, ethical side to this character, which eventually leads to his downfall. Unlike many gangster films, it has a happy ending. But we can forgive it since 95% of it is double crossing, guns blazing and violence. It is a gangster noir that deserves much more recognition than it has recieved. But thats what makes it special.",

Although this is one the Coen brothers earlier projects, you can still see their method at work - we are given a variety of characters, each one a unique piece in the massive game of chess the directors have concocted. The entire story bounces from character to character, each one adding their own influence to the continuation of the story yet mostly unaware of what is transpiring ourside their circle of knowledge. The only one who seems to keep it all in perspective is Gabriel Burne who simply smooth talks his way in and out of hairy situations like there was no tomorrow.\nThe overall pace is pretty fast, maginified mostly by the quick and snappy dialogue which is pretty impressive to begin with. Throw in some iconic music of the era and some pretty gruesome shoot outs and you get a mob story that is both memorable and compelling.",

There is a tour-de-force scene of sheer filmmaking brilliance, when two Tommy gun armed assassins try to murder Leo in his own home, it is one of the finest gun battle action scenes i have ever seen, where Finney's kingpin character shows why he is still number one, it is a truly an unforgettable sequence. The period recreation is flawless, a intelligent and fascinating screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen, there is stunning cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld and a magnificent  production design by Dennis Gassner, Carter Burwell's musical score is quite beautiful. A must-see, intense and riveting a glorious entertainment. Highly Recommended.",

I can watch the entire hour & fifty minutes that make up this film without checking my watch or wondering how many minutes before it's over. Pick any cast member at random & you can describe it as their finest hour & if it weren't for a certain loveable burnout named Jeff Lebowski it would be the Coen's definitive masterwork.  \r\n\r\nWhy do I love it so? Well it strikes the perfect balance between comedy & drama. The story is multilayered but never descends into needlessly complicated convolution. In the simplest terms it revolves around sports betting & a power struggle between Irish & Italian crime bosses. The anti hero of the piece is Tom Reagan, played by a never better Gabriel Byrne, a gang lieutenant that has to navigate the increasingly complicated dealings of rival crime syndicates. The other standouts in terms of acting are regular Coen collaborators, Jon Polito & John Turturro  as unhinged Mafia don Johnny Casper & inherently sleazy bookmaker Bernie Bernbaum respectively. The cast (which also includes Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden & a small role for Steve Buscemi) is quality as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is deserving of special praise, the characters interact in a quickfire patois that brings to mind the cinema of the 1940's. The characters never swear in the modern sense, the worst you'll hear is son of a bitch, instead exchanges have a unique noirish quality full of quips & putdowns. The quirkiness that often puts me off Coen's films when laid on too thick is present here but a perfect balance is struck. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of 40's noir throwbacks, the look of the film also brings to mind noir cinema. At times during interiors it's like watching an interior scene from the Naked City that's simply been shot in colour. As for exteriors the shots (especially those from the forrest) are just beautiful. There's a transition during the forrest scenes that's just a marvel to behold.  Bary Sonnenfield's (who went onto the direct (*shrug*) Men In Black) cinematography is more than a match for Roger Deakins.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about how at the 63rd Academy Awards Goodfellas was robbed by Dances With Wolves for best picture/director. Miller's Crossing was nominated for nothing that year. Nadda. Zip. S.F.A. In a year when an abortion like Ghost take's Best Original Screenplay. (That's Right, Ghost). The Coen's should by all rights have gotten their first oscar 17 years before No Country For Old Men. When you think about that, the Goodfellas debacle doesn't seem half as bad.\r\n\r\nWell I might be biased, as I said I LOVE MILLER'S CROSSING.",

This movie is very complicated, and definitely should not be watched while tired.  While there are a couple of action sequences in the film, it really relies on the characters to move the plot forward, which is a fresh look at the crime genre.  I personally thought John Turturro's performance as a Jewish Bookie gone bad was Oscar-worthy, and he really shines in this role.  I had absolutely no problems with this movie, every scene is great, meaningful, well-crafted and is essential to the plot.  As with most Coen brothers movies, the ending is very open-ended.  As the viewer, you can choose which characters you side with and which one's you don't.  Overall, a great film that will please any lover of the gangster genre, and also another solid entry in the Coen body of work.  This is an intelligent crime movie, made specifically for intelligent people, and I think that is why it didn't make a lot of money at the box office.  What does that say about America?",

Though Miller's Crossing is indeed a stylish, well done gangster film, it by no means is my favorite of the Coen brothers' collection. The dialogue is just immaculately written, and the cast is mind bogglingly solid: Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden, Steve Bescemi. I know I'm going to take flack for saying this, but I just think the movie tends to drag at times. In fact, there are moments that are chillingly quiet...and well...boring. However, the good far outweighs the bad, and the Coen brothers' wit mixed with a little Irish mobster thrill is a combination that is hard to criticize too harshly. Though I think much of their work is absolutely 100% perfect (Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, No Country For Old Men, etc.) this one just falls a tid bit shy of those films...great, but not perfect.",

Meanwhile, rivals Johnny Caspar and Eddie Dane threaten O'Bannon's racket.\r\n\r\nMiller\u0092s Crossing is directed by the highly original Joel Cohen, and it\u0092s pretty easy to tell, as there are many numerous look a likes in this film to countless others of The Coen Brothers. \r\n\r\nIn this film, there are many very good scenes that are just about being visually and emotionally captivating. Coen makes this film touch you but not with words or actions, but by the look of the film, and how you feel you\u0092re in this torn-down 1920\u0092s era of where gangsters and crime rule the town, and where everything is deceptive. \r\n\r\nIf you\u0092re looking for a good mafia film then look no farther. Many stereotypes in mobster films don\u0092t quite happen in here. We have always seen these tommy-guns blazing, but not with the kind of style this film gives us. The script is not like many other mafia films, as it is very realistic but also very challenging and complicated. \r\n\r\nThe reason it\u0092s very complicating is because it starts off on the wrong foot talking about characters we do not know, and have no clue about. Probably about 45 minutes into the actual film is when we finally find out who all the players are. Many events in this film also happen, without us even knowing ourselves. I liked the little John Tuturro scene at first and felt that was good, but then it starts to over-play itself and just turned out to be a little too annoying. \r\n\r\nThe movie does have some pretty interesting scenes with some great violence and great visuals, but moves at a snail\u0092s pace. There were way too many scenes that just featured these people talking, drinking, smoking, or anything else about gangsters. I felt like this film at points got boring, and does not do very well trying to pull it\u0092s viewers in. \r\n\r\nMiller\u0092s Crossing features a lot of big names that are recognizable, but aren\u0092t in this film as much as you would think. Gabriel Byrne does a very good job at playing this lead and doesn\u0092t act tough throughout the whole movie, and actually does show some weaknesses within. Albert Finney, John Tuturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all are in this film and show up but are not used as well, and don\u0092t seem to powerful for a film that bases it all on the power of a look and feel. \r\n\r\nConsensus: Though not one of Coen\u0092s best, Miller\u0092s Crossing is a small mobster gem that is visually spectacular and features a real-life look at the world of the Mafia. \r\n\r\n7/10=Rentall!!!",

The rest of the cast, including Gabriel Byrne (who I swear drops his character's Irish accent for several parts of the movie) does just as well, albeit some may be a bit cliched. But that aside, if you love Steve Buscemi and making kids in sailor suits cry, then this is the movie for you.",

I like this movie because its a gangster film that parodies gangster films, and yet in my mind pulls it off with more style and substance than any of the films it mocks. At its heart, Miller's Crossing is a comedy. Its a dark comedy that uses all of the stereotypes of the genre to great effect. The humor is subtle. Very subtle. And that's the best part about it. It's a comedy that manages to be more serious and believable than any drama could. Plus it has John Turturro, which is always guaranteed to provide a laugh (wether he's playing it \"straight\" or not). Just don't expect any goofy slapstick, or the type of over the top exaggerated humor that passes for comedy these days.",

            "content": "Realism isn't exactly a necessary component for successful filmmaking. In fact, a cornerstone of making movies, Hollywood or otherwise, seems to be the escape from the mundane and worldly, in favor of the exploration of the impossible and the fantastic, of distant places or long-past times. And though such imagination is commended, even celebrated, the discerning director must take great care to ensure that a world so divorced from reality remains connected to its viewers. But with \"Miller's Crossing,\" that tenet is one terribly lost on brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who revel in narrative sleight of hand and self-indulgent complexity, allowing their audience no closer than arm's length.\n\nTo be fair, the story they have constructed here does have its merits, ranging from its distinctive wit to its undeniable style, both evidence of its authors' skill, but they are assets trapped within the body of a film that never engages its spectators, in large part because it never attempts to. Like its spiritual, if not direct, predecessor \"Blood Simple,\" the film displays the Coens' particular talent for constructing extremely memorable, highly-charged scenes, but the bulk of the foundation upon which they rest serves as, at best, an unsteady base.\n\nEnter Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), the always-cunning brains behind the posturing of local crime lord Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), a man content to remain behind the curtain, but possessing more than the intellect to run things on his own. As the key player in this tale that owes as much to film noir as it does to the work of Dashiell Hammet, particularly Red Harvest, he takes a central role in the gang warfare that will soon sweep over the face of its unnamed city. Key struggles involve the conflicting loyalties, deception, and romance surrounding brother and sister Bernie and Verna Bernbaum (John Turturro and Marcia Gay Harden), but to say any more would risk spoiling some of the turns in its labyrinthine plot.\n\nIt's a plot that can at times move at breakneck speed, and is cruelly unforgiving in its minor details. Vitally important names are dropped so casually in dialogue so fast-paced you may find yourself wishing for a scorecard, or at least something to take notes on. From the very first scene, the viewer has the sense of being unceremoniously dropped into the heart of an intricate, deceit-laden atmosphere, without so much as the faintest of lights to illuminate its complexities.\n\nSophistication is one thing, but to feign intricacy by obscuring what should otherwise be clear details borders on narrative dishonesty. It's a lesson that the Coens' seem not to have been taught by the resounding success of \"Blood Simple,\" which suffered from similar storytelling duplicity. But like its forebear, \"Miller's Crossing\" manages to cull from its at times implausible storyline genuine moments of tension, terror, and drama. Though perhaps not quite as successful in this regard as its predecessor, these sequences offer up hard evidence that the talent behind the Coens' debut was by no means used up in one shot.\n\nWith regard to casting, Byrne can hardly be blamed for doing all that he can with a character so clearly the product of a screenwriter's pen. \nTurturro, on the other hand, positively shines as Bernbaum, who appears to be the only authentic, believable character amidst a swarm of stock noir cutouts. It hardly seems surprising, then, that following this, he's become something of a Coen regular, with key appearances in both \"Barton Fink\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" Steve Buscemi even puts in an all-too-brief appearance that will make you long for his more significant role in \"Fargo.\"\n\nIn so many ways, the film feels like the slow, inexorable progression of two growing filmmakers struggling to further define their strengths and vanish away their weaknesses. For the first time in their then-young careers, concrete manifestations of their distinctive grim humor, arguably among their most defining traits as directors, were beginning to emerge. Though it lacks the edge and originality of their debut, it casts off the predictable trappings of their previous \"Raising Arizona\" in favor of darker, more ambitious fare.\n\nIndeed, \"Miller's Crossing\" makes the all-too-rare mistake of asking too much of its viewers, while so often, contemporary films rarely make so much as an attempt to intellectually challenge their audiences. And for that, despite its flaws, of which it certainly has many, one must afford its effort due respect. Though it doesn't succeed in making good on its ambitions, the Coens' attempt is to be applauded, for they reach and come up short where so few even extend a hand at all.",

This story is about the mob of New York in the late 20's. The main character, Tom(Gabriel Bryne), is the advisor of the most powerful irish crime boss of the city(Albert Finney). But soon their friendship is going to fall apart because of a woman(Marcia Gay Harden). Because of that and due to his large debts he goes to the other side offering his services to the only competitor of his ex-boss(Jon Polito). I'm not going to reveal any more of the plot because this is one of these plots that have an amazing and magical way to fall into place. You will find yourself almost in any place taken by surprise. The film blends two film genres. The gangster epic and the noir film. This along with a big amount of the Coen style leads to something that you'll hardly ever see again. As I already mentioned the Coen stamp is everywhere. The camera angles and all the wonderful settings say so and so does the script. The characters are unique with Jon Polito's and John Turturro's standing out. I think it's great that the Coen brothers gave Polito a leading role because so far I've seen him in their movies playing small roles that were not very good in showing the full extent of his talent. This really is an excellent acted film but I find hard not to mention that Polito and Turturro were a lot better than the rest, taking their character to a really great level. Another thing that makes this film stand out is how the human side of the gangsters is shown. Usually in gangster epics the main character is so smarter, stronger and in general better than the rest (except maybe for the main antagonist) that it ends being a little bit unfair for the other's. This isn't the case here though because Tom is for the whole duration of the movie walking on a tight rope and luck really plays a significant role to his action and saving his ass. The main antagonist here(J.E. Freeman) is really way smarter than him and also a few more characters put him in really tight situations. So in conclusion what we get here is a witty Coen brothers film, an amazing gangster epic and romantic drama. You really can't get much better than this.",

This is the Coen Brothers' take on the gangster flick, and Gabriel Byrne is at his best as the taciturn, super-clever, super-lucky Tom.  With his dark fedora and his loner demeanor he's sort of the epitome of the stereotype for the \"man on his own,\" and the Coen Brothers are aware that they're playing with this stereotype, so they make it almost mythological.\n\nGabriel Byrne is great, but this is also one of my favorite Turturro roles.  He's a charming, fast-talking liar and conman, and he does his job playing a cold bastard with a giggly exterior marvelously.\n\nBut you really can't say enough about all the various performances, which is usually true with Coen Brothers movies.  Albert Finney, Jon Poliyo, Marcia Gay Harden, Steve Buscemi, and all the little bit parts from the thick-headed boxer to the bartender at the Irish hooch joint, all give perfect performances.  Great stuff.  Deep without sacrificing its humor.",

Maybe it's because Byrne can act circles around the leads of those other pictures. Maybe it's the depth of the cast -- Buschemi is on camera for only a few seconds but sears his character into your brain as one of the lynchpins of the whole complicated mess. \nWhen I saw \"Road to Perdition\" I thought: Eh. This is just another way to make \"The Godfather\" again. When I see \"Miller's Crossing\" I think: I want to see that again!

Being a Coen brothers' film there is a possibility some people will not see it on the principle of that fact, but I assure you this is unlike any other film the brothers have worked on. The cast is quite phenomenal with Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney promoting the strongest of performances. Leo(Albert Finney) is an empowered Irish crime boss who seemingly begins to lose faith in his own ability to control the city when his judgment is clouded by love and a rival crime boss is trying to take over. Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne), Leo's right hand man attempts to alleviate the situation but to Tom's dismay only complicates things for himself, which results in him being kicked out of the crime family. From here Tom appears to be going on a seemingly wild goose chase which ultimately leads to a satisfying yet traditional climax. \"Miller's Crossing\" could have been a bit more gritty with it's camera shots and little more forgiving with it's sometimes complex dialogue, but those are fairly minor gripes compared to the movie as a whole. I highly recommend this to anyone that has a passion for mob/gang related films, as this is quite possibly one of the best.",

The Cohen have the ability to go from one end to the other of this spectrum. The script runs during the Prohibition and in the context of an impending gangster war. Tom, the main character, is trying to avoid it, but ends up getting entangled in a web of crossed loyalties.Gabriel Byrne gave life to the lead role and was excellent. I loved his performance in a character who looks like an anti-hero. He has everything to be bad (he has no character or scruple and doesn't mind betraying friends) but he is pragmatic and seems to regard the bloodshed as something that should be avoided or minimized. That makes Tom a character we like. He is not a good guy, but he seems to be the most human person in the whole movie. Velma, on the other hand, looks like a cold, calculating, treacherous girl. The way Marcia Gay Harden acted also helped. The actress is good and performed well. John Turturro also shone in the role of Bernie, an opportunist little crook who gets in trouble by fooling a big fish. Albert Finney brought to life Leo, the powerful Irish boss with a good heart and full of kindness. He is a good actor, but his character seems too good to be a mobster. Much closer to the ruthless and cynical picture which we use to make of mob bosses is Jon Polito. He's the most dominant actor in the film, along with Byrne. I loved his work here. His cruelty, the easy way he kills or orders to kill gave me goose bumps. The rest of the cast also did a good job, but I think these actors deserve prominence, not so much for having the main characters but for the quality of their work.Another good thing are the technical details. Cinematography is very good and contributes decisively to the chilling environment that we like to feel in a true gangster movie. Some scenes are clearly homage to other films of the past, as well as the relevance given to fedora hats. In fact, if there is anything that we immediately link with the gangster world it's this particular type of hat (although it's also one of the most classic male hat models, still fashionable nowadays... I even have one). We can also see other iconic elements of the mob world, like Thompson sub-machine guns. It has excellent firefight scenes also, and the dry and ironic humor that is the Cohen Brothers trademark. The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack because I felt it cut through the pleasant tension I felt throughout the movie.\"Miller's Crossing\" is a good movie. It's not too complex or unintelligible, tells a good story, has a nice irony, a good cast doing a great job, good production values and positive technical details. It's worth watching.",
