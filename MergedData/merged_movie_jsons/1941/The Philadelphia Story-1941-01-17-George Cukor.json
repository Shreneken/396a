            "content": "After Katharine Hepburn was one of a group of stars dictated \"box office poison\" by the ruling moguls of Hollywood she went east and scored a complete triumph on stage with The Philadelphia Story. But our Kate was the shrewd one, she had the foresight to buy the film rights from author Philip Barry and peddle them to the studio that would guarantee her repeating her stage role and giving her creative control. On stage she had co-starred with Joseph Cotten, Van Heflin, and Shirley Booth all of whom became movie names later on, but meant nothing to Hollywood in 1940. She had the choice of leading men and cast in their places, Cary Grant, James Stewart and Ruth Hussey. This was Grant's fourth and final appearance on screen with Hepburn. It's a typical Cary Grant part, witty and urbane, with a touch of the rogue in him. He's Hepburn's ex-husband, still very much in love with his ex-wife, but she's marrying stuffed shirt John Howard.Reporter James Stewart and photographer Ruth Hussey are covering Hepburn's wedding for Spy Magazine, the National Enquirer of the day. Through a little judicious blackmail they're invited to this premier society wedding, but both feel out of place and used.After The Philadelphia Story, Katharine Hepburn was a movie name the rest of her long life. Even with an occasional clinker no one ever questioned her about being box office poison.James Stewart won the Best Actor Oscar in probably the most romantic he was ever on the screen. A lot felt it was a consolation Oscar for not winning it for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in 1939. Stewart himself proclaimed to all who'd listen that he voted for good friend Henry Fonda in the Academy Sweepstakes for The Grapes of Wrath. I've always felt that when Stewart talked about those hearth fires banked down low to Hepburn, he was really talking about himself. He's a cynical fellow at first and his romantic side comes as a surprise to him more than even the audience.The Philadelphia Story has become such a classic that even the musical remake High Society doesn't try to copy it, it just presents a softer musical alternative. But I'd kind of liked to have seen Hepburn do this with her original cast as well. Oscars were in the future for Van Heflin and Shirley Booth and Joseph Cotten the following year made his debut in the biggest film of all.",

            "review_title": "Great dialogue, great performances and a real fun, urgent pace to the material make this a delightfully fun film",
            "content": "It is the wedding of the year with socialite Tracy Lord due to marry George Kittredge behind closed doors, with no press allowed. However the editor of Spy Magazine is set to run an expos\u00e9 of Tracy's philandering father and a New York dancer and strikes a deal with her ex husband CK Dexter Haven if he can get a couple of journalists into the wedding and the reception. Keen to get back at Tracy, Dexter agrees to help and escorts writer Mike Conner and photographer Liz Imbrie into the Lord home in the days before the wedding. With tensions high between Dexter and Tracy, everyone playing games and relationships equally confused and confusing anything could happen and surprises are in store.Shot in about 8 weeks with a low number of takes and some impressive adlibbed and one-shot scenes this is a movie worth seeing even before you look at the cast list and the professional reviews. The plot is partly a comedy, partly a character drama and partly a romance (albeit a rather tidy one) and each aspect pretty much works in tandem with the others. The comic tension between the characters is really well written and, although it is a clich\u00e9, it does fizz and spark across the screen and is regularly hilarious and consistently a delight to the ears. With such superficial energy it would be easy to ignore the fact that it is interesting below this; specifically I liked the character of Tracy and the way that parts of the film show her character being stripped back as she in particular learns something about how she comes across, softening her character a little bit in later scenes. However to suggest that this has great depths is to give it more praise than it deserves, because it doesn't run deep and it isn't a great drama. Likewise the romance isn't a main part of it but it does still work because it is all delivered at such a fresh and funny pace that it draws you in, even to the point where I gratefully accepted the film's conclusion with a smile rather than a sneer.The cast are a delight, but then that pretty much goes without saying, and they work with the dialogue like a surgeon uses a scalpel. In fact that is a good example because the dialogue is normally almost as sharp as said instrument. Grant may have got top billing and the big money (which he then donated away) but it is very much a shared effort between the three stars, with Grant in fact having the least showy character. If anything the film belongs to Hepburn who is a delight whether spitting back at her father with tears in her eyes or a barbed comment sliding in like a greased knife. Stewart is just as good and is reaction shots show a real comic timing, but he also gives good dialogue and he is fun. Like Stewart, Grant has a great chemistry with Hepburn, which means that he can deliver convincing tension and trade insults without undermining the ending which otherwise would have maybe been an ask too far. Hussey is good and it is easy to forget that she must have felt a bit out of her depth but it never shows in her performance. Support is roundly strong from Young, Nash, Halliday and even Weildler.Overall this is a delightful film that is such fun and has such a good pace and spark that it is easy to buy into the weaker elements of the narrative and not only forgive them but get into them. The dialogue is sparky and funny while the delivery of same is just what the material deserved. The cast have chemistry and help inject urgency to the story that keeps it all moving forward. A wonderfully delightful film that is fun to watch and surprisingly engaging.",

            "review_title": "Hepburn's Ferocious Comeback.",
            "content": "A movie custom-made to fit the personality of an arrogant but headstrong movie star, a play with dialog that sizzles with so much ferocity that it threatens to leap out the confines of its own frame, performances that could not have and have not have been excelled ever since, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is one of the best screwball comedies ever made and the third to pair her with Cary Grant with whom she worked so completely well. Hepburn had asked that Tracy and Gable be her leading men but looking at this film, for all the chemistry that Tracy and Hepburn ever had and all the talent Gable had for acting in comedic farce, I can't imagine either of them playing any of the two leading males that are after Tracy Lord's love. That Grant plays C. K. Dexter \"Dex\" Haven so perfectly well, and his opening scene with Hepburn is the stuff of movie history, only rectifies that. That Stewart embodies the essence of MaCauley Connors as if he were in fact the character just proves how strong an actor he was, and one who didn't have to resort to extreme emoting to make his point. That the three make for the most memorable romantic triangle in film history is probably an understatement.Of course the story is old. Of course the character motivations are dated. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY belongs perpetually in its own time, the late 1930s (when it was written and performed on stage), when sensibilities towards the rich were much different than they are today. The whole bit of the society princess being humbled to become a better person is really a thinly disguised fable that tells the story of how Hepburn, who had made such a powerful debut in film with her appearance in A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT, quickly established a personality so abrasive (she wouldn't do interviews or cheesecake, it is rare to find a Hepburn picture from the 30s where she is dolled up) that it translated into box-office bomb after bomb and by 1938 she was all but washed up. Tracy Lord's return to humankind is really the story of Hepburn's return to the world of acting even if she retained her abrasiveness to her last days. And of course, who better suited for this role than Hepburn herself, who had done the role on stage and by the time Hollywood came (reluctantly) calling -- they wanted Norma Shearer, who in my opinion could have carried it off but differently -- knew the part in and out (and owned the rights to the play in a shrewd move). We can't imagine anyone else playing this role, which is why when the inevitable musical remake was made in 1956 with Grace Kelly in the lead, it misfires, and no amount of Cole Porter could save it even if it was a commercial success.But regardless being dated, maybe too talky for some, what a movie. To see the utter craziness of the plot which backfires at least twice and creates a sense of really not knowing what will happen next (even when we know on a certain level Hepburn and Grant will wind up in each other's arms) is the stuff romantic comedy is made of. Oscar nominated in almost every major category, it won two -- Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay -- but over the years it's grown beyond statuettes and remains as one of the greatest films of the 20th Century.",

            "content": "The excellent play by Phillip Barry, is the basis for the delightful transfer to the screen. The choice of George Cukor as its director seems to have been made in heaven. Indeed, Mr. Cukor clearly understood what was needed to make this film the classic it became. George Cukor's contribution, as well of the magnificent screenplay, by Donald Ogden Stewart, make this a timeless comedy that looks as fresh today as when it was originally released.It helps tremendously that Katherine Hepburn had played Tracy Lord on the stage and knew what made her tick. Ms. Hepburn, an actress of enormous talent, is the embodiment of this society woman. Katherine Hepburn clearly understood her character. Having come herself from a privileged family, she was able to get deep inside her character. Tracy Lord is going to be married to George Kitteredge, a man from her own social circle. Deep down inside, Tracy can't get her mind from the man she really loves, the rascal Dexler.The casting of Cary Grant as C.K. Dexler was a touch of genius. Mr. Grant had played opposite Ms. Hepburn before. He was an actor that always delivered and was always a welcome addition to any of the movies of the period. Mr. Grant, with his good looks, makes the perfect man to play the part. As Dexler, the man who broke Tracy's heart, he returns just before the wedding, perhaps to remind her he's still loves her and can't get her out of his mind.James Stewart was the other happy casting of \"The Philadelphia Story\". He was relatively unknown to the movie going public, but he left his mark all over the picture. As McCauley (Mike) Conner, this actor was perfect. As the tabloid reporter infiltrating the society wedding he proved his impeccable sense of timing.Ruth Hussey, contributes to the film in unexpected ways. Virginia Weidler, as Dinah, is irresistible. The rest of the ensemble cast is a director's dream. Mary Nash, John Howard, Roland Young, John Halliday, Henry Daniel and the rest, are perfect.\"The Philadelphia Story\" will keep delighting audiences for many years to come.",

            "content": "This is a delightful romantic comedy about the life and loves of a high society girl.  Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is about to be married to George Kittredge (John Howard), a self made man who elevated himself from the lower class.  The wedding is supposed to be a private affair, but Tracy's ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) blackmails her into letting two reporters, Macaulay Conner and Elizabeth Imbrie (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey) cover the event.  What ensues is a screwball courtship for the heart of Tracy as everyone falls in love with her at once.Director David Cukor (`Little Women', `My Fair Lady') provides a fast paced comedy with rapid-fire repartee and fosters a bubbly chemistry between the cast members, which brims with laughs.  Cukor received one of his five Oscar nominations for this film and it was well deserved.Katharine Hepburn is marvelous as the blueblood bride to be.  She is a well-grounded girl who is not beyond putting on airs for show.  She is simultaneously sassy and dreamy and her comic timing is superb earning her one of twelve nominations for best actress.  Despite a star's billing, Cary Grant plays a supporting role as the sarcastic Dexter Haven.  With his deadpan delivery, he provides the perfect foil to Hepburn and Stewart.Even with the luminous cast, Jimmy Stewart steals the show with a comedic tour de force.  His inebriated scene with Cary Grant is uproariously funny and his puppy dog wooing of Katherine Hepburn is enchanting.  It is hard to believe that James Stewart only won one Oscar in his outstanding career. Though nominated five times, the only role for which he won the statue is this one, a performance that is unquestionably among his best.This tremendous comedy brings together three screen legends at the peak of their careers.  It was nominated for six Academy Awards winning two, and it was rated #51 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  It is a timeless classic that is sure to please.  I rated it a 10/10.  See it and enjoy.",

            "content": "That this brilliant story originated on stage is obvious.  The stage requires personas of epic and electric beauty.  Philadelphia Story boasts three of the brightest stars that ever burned to occupy these personas, which they do with miraculous luminance.  The play, of course, was written for Hepburn by Phillip Barry, and after over 400 performances on Broadway she cleverly bought the film rights right out from under the noses of Hollywood moguls who fancied themselves smarter than Dear Kate.  This came at a time when Hepburn was tops on the list of stars who had been labeled box office poison by producers.The dynamics between the stars are legendary.  Finer actors never lived, and these are the performances of a lifetime for each of them.  Stewart is funny, smoldering, passionate and moving and he has moments, many of them, of stunning brilliance in each of those emotions.  Grant is his typical stilted and elegant self, funny, gracious, urbane and, yes, beautiful.  And then there is Hepburn.  She is breathtaking to look at, and she plays your heart strings in a masterful glissando plucking at every emotion as she moves effortlessly across her entire unmatched range.The supporting cast is worthy of the surplus of talent that surrounds them, and offer a few unforgettable moments of their own.  And the presence of George Cukor, the greatest director of women in history, and the best director of Hepburn as well, coaxes every brilliant word of the script to its full potential.You must not miss this treasure simply because it is from another era.  It depicts that era with insight and irreverence that expose it, and the rarified world of old Philadelphia Money (yes, with a capital \"M\") like few films of its time, or any time, could.  Every time I watch this movie, and the frequency would embarrass me if I were honest about it, I love it more.\nWatch it.  Study it.  Assimilate every second of it and your understanding and appreciation of cinema will be enriched for it.  And you'll have a great time doing it!",

This film basically has what most romantic comedies today dont have. That would be a well-written script, Great Acting, and actually funny.The acting is a huge strength in the film. This is called Katharine Hepburn's best role by many, while I admit she is excellent in a number of scenes, I think she tends to overact at times. Cary Grant is great here. Everyone else is Great but I believe James Stewart to be the standout. He is perfect for this role, its a flawless performance, that he deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for.The Script has wonderful dialogue thats delivered flawlessly by the actors. Even simple dialogue like \"Isn't that awful\" was delivered superbly by Katharine Hepburn. George Cukor made this project look like nothing, he made many films which were \"womens films\" but he does a damn good job here.\nIf you think Romantic Comedies of today are good, look at The Philadelphia Story and they will pale in comparison. The Philadelphia Story is a very good film and worth remembering, unlike the mediocre to crappy romantic comedies of today. The Philadelphia Story is highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "A turning point in Katharine Hepburn's career...",
            "content": "... and IMHO just about a perfect romantic comedy. C.K.Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) had a short stormy marriage to Tracy Lord (Hepburn). Now she is about to marry George Kittredge (John Howard). Haven and Lord are old money elite. Kittredge is a guy who pulled himself up by his bootstraps...and he won't let anybody forget it. You never really know WHY Dexter agrees to help infiltrate and therefore sabotage Tracy's second marriage. You never know if he intended to try and get her back -from the opening scene it seems their parting was pretty acrimonious. Or maybe he just knew that Kittredge was a drip and didn't want Tracy to suffer a lifetime of..well..being dripped on. At any rate he convinces the Lords into allowing two reporters from \"Spy Magazine\" to cover her wedding because the magazine publisher has a story all ready to go about Tracy's father's affair with a chorus girl if that coverage is not allowed. Since Haven, although he doesn't need the salary, works for the magazine too, this allows him to get back into the Lord household and do his best to ruffle Tracy's feathers. Tracy's problem and the reason that her first marriage broke up was her inability to see her own moral weaknesses while pointing out everybody else's. Tracy is completely to the manor born. When she discovers that one of the reporters (James Stewart as Macauley Conner) has written a beautiful book of poetry she asks him why he works for a cheap tabloid magazine instead of writing his own material. His reply is that he has to eat, and this answer rather stumps her. There are many complicating factors. Tracy's dad is off with his mistress, so the Lords try to pass their uncle Wllly off as Mr. Lord to the reporters. When Tracy's dad returns unexpectedly they try to pass him off as uncle Willy. The two reporters (Stewart and Ruth Hussey) have some kind of low key romantic understanding, but then Macauley begins to become attracted to Tracy. Add alcohol and almost code busting complications and insinuations ensue.It really holds up today as a genuine romantic comedy and comedy of manners in which everybody displays authentic behavior and reactions in spite of that pesky production code. The only thing archaic and even somewhat repulsive is how Tracy's father tries to make his affair with the chorus girl all Tracy's fault. He tells her that when a man has a daughter that loves him in spite of his faults he doesn't go looking for that in his golden years in another woman. I wonder if Chelsea Clinton ever had these problems? But I digress.Let me just say one thing about James Stewart's Best Actor Oscar. Stewart was wonderful as a working man captivated by a woman from another world, who discovers that the rich are not all jerks, but he was definitely not the lead. This was Grant and Hepburn's picture all of the way. The only thing I can figure is that the Academy felt that they did Stewart wrong the previous year by passing him over in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and were making amends.I highly recommend this to anyone. If you are not into classic film and would like to be, this is a perfect place to start.",

            "content": "Katharine Hepburn, my favourite actress, gives the performance of her career as Tracy Lord, a spoilt Philadelphia socialite. The movie is a triple treat, with my other two most favourite actors, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart, in the other lead roles, Cary as Tracy's former husband C.K Dexter Haven, and Jimmy as the peeved reporter who Kate falls in love with. \nAlthough there has been much written about Jimmy Stewart not deserving the Oscar that year, if it was given for the Academy passing over his performance in \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\", then it was well deserved. Cary Grant deserved a nomination, and Kate definitely should have taken out the prize for the year. I could be going to extremes, but I think this was definitely the movie that deserved to take home the statuette for Best Picture of 1940. I have seen both \"Rebecca\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\", movies highly acclaimed that year, but neither has ever come close to \"The Philadelphia Story\". The first time I watched it I missed not only most of the witty one-liners, but the whole point of the story. It was the first movie I watched with each of the three stars. Almost a year later after I viewed it again I couldn't believe how I could have passed over such a rare gem. As a fourteen year old, I can't be pretentious in definitely knowing the real themes of the movie. Maybe something in the way of humility and degrees of acceptance, I'm not so sure. I have thought about it a lot, but have only reached the conclusion that it is one of those 'feel good' movies that is re-watchable. There are things about it, even close to my tenth viewing, that I am still picking up on. Lead by Ruth Hussey and Virginia Weidler, the supporting cast of \"The Philadelphia Story\" is one of the finest I have seen. With Cole Porter songs, and yet another star cast, this movie was shockingly remade into the musical \"High Society\" in 1956. On all accounts, Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm cannot match the sophistication and wit of the non-musical cast. It seemed too much like recycled humour, despite its attempts to modernize an immortal story.\nThis movie is a slice of Old Hollywood that must not be sampled once to enjoy it. It should be taken in many times! Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "If this is sophisticated comedy, I'll take the gaucheries of Airplane (1980) any day. Despite the celebrated cast, director, and screenwriter, the movie's not very amusing, unless you think drunks are automatically amusing. In fact, at times the antics are downright annoying, especially the shrill Hepburn character and Stewart's going way over the top as an inebriate reporter. At best, actress Hepburn is a matter of taste. Here director Cukor gives full reign to her most troublesome habit\u2014sheer staginess. For Tracy (Hepburn), there's no such thing as a simple movement; instead, every inflection is an exaggeration of some sort. Just as bad for the movie, Grant is not allowed his usual superb comedic skills; instead, he gets to look on in a rather wooden manner, a not unreasonable reaction. Unfortunately, this is another example of MGM's Louis Mayer's infatuation with the idle rich and well-housed. One of the film's few positive notes are the many subtle innuendoes. In fact, the strategic use of such innuendoes as 'intact' made me wonder if the Grant-Hepburn marriage had ever been consummated. Then again, why any man would warm up to such a bitchy \"goddess\" remains perhaps the movie's biggest conundrum. On the other hand, the supporting cast, particularly Hussey and Weidler, furnish what there is of the movie's meager amusement. Too bad it's only in support.To me, the movie's exalted reputation is likely the result of Hollywood's promotional arm working overtime. After all, if the production's got this many illustrious names, it's got to be a classic. For a revealing contrast, catch the Grant-Hepburn-Hawks genuinely funny Bringing Up Baby, made only two years earlier. At least, Hawks knew how to edit a scene without letting it drone on and on. Here, Stewart's adaptation of the Barry play may have looked good on paper, but on screen it's quite a different matter, despite all the hoopla.",

Playwright Phillip Barry certainly had an ear for sophisticated chatter and, along with \"Bringing Up Baby\" and \"Holiday,\" he singlehandedly defined the term \"screwball comedy\" in the late 30s.  And so it is fortunate for all of us that the screen adaptations of each of these classic Broadway plays are classics in their own right.Katharine Hepburn, who starred with Cary Grant in all three of the aforementioned films, plays society prig Tracy Lord, a spoiled, temperamental rich girl who owns a will of iron and a heart to match.

Dexter Haven (Grant) has not taken the wind out of her sails, so she decides to make a go of it again.  Announcing her forthcoming marriage to wealthy George Kittredge, a rather staid, uptight sort, it comes off more like a match made in gold than in heaven.  However, the stubborn Tracy is convinced she is in love this time.  Around to disrupt the wedding plans is Tracy's former husband, who still has feelings for her and her family, her estranged scandal-ridden father, her young, precocious sister, and a posterior-pinching uncle.  Also hovering around the Lord estate is tabloid reporter Liz Imbrie and her photographer Mike Connor, assigned to cover the impending nuptials and, of course, scout out any juicy gossip.With a deft ensemble and crisp, intuitive direction (George Cukor), the dialogue blisters with furious fun (courtesy of Oscar-winning scripter Donald Ogden Stewart), with every character having his or her chance to bask in the limelight.  Hepburn, who was considered \"box-office poison\" at the time, revitalized her Hollywood career with \"The Philadelphia Story,\" smartly buying the film rights to ensure her starring role.  Dripping with frilly-edged sarcasm, she makes full use of her clipped Bryn Mawr speech tones.  But her ultimate triumph is that her 'ice queen' demeanor never alienates the viewer.  We still root for Tracy to come down to earth, rejoin the human race and live out that fairy tale ending.  Cary Grant is as smooth as silk pajamas as Tracy's first husband, raring and ready to pull her off that mighty pedestal she's placed herself so high on.  Synonymous with elegance and style, I doubt there is another actor who can handle martini-dry banter the way he does.  He is flawless -- in a class by himself.The real revelation, however, is Jimmy Stewart as the smitten photographer who is only too willing to keep Tracy perched on that pedestal.  Stewart, who won the Oscar, breaks from his usual \"aw shucks\" mode to show a surprising comic range.  His midnight poolside soliloquy with Kate is wondrous and lingers long after the closing credits.  Completing the romantic quadrangle is the wonderful Ruth Hussey, who inherits the wisecracking Eve Arden role, the good-natured trooper who always seems to come in second man-wise.  Hussey takes the ball and runs with it, giving the ripest performance of the bunch.Additional praise must be given to Mary Nash, as Tracy's flowery, meticulous mother; young tomboy Virginia Weidler, an adroit little scenestealer, for keeping up with the big folks and offering a wickedly smart-assed rendition of \"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady\"; John Howard for his dour, stuffy groom-to-be and good sportsmanship as the butt of many a joke; John Halliday, who manages a couple of razor-sharp scenes as Hepburn's reproaching father, and Roland Young, who played Cosmo Topper in the delightful \"Topper\" film series, for adding his typical brand of bemused merriment as lecherous Uncle Willy.   From the opening classic bit with Hepburn and Grant squaring off to the church altar denouement, \"The Philadelphia Story\" provides a wealth of entertainment.  It's a rare, rich package even the Lord family can't buy!",

            "content": "The witty characters and situations of Philip Barry's play doesn't hide the fact that everyone of these people is pretty close to certifiably nuts. Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord has her charms, but there's a motive behind that charm that brings on suspicion. She's on the verge of her second marriage, having already divorced the allegedly constantly drunk Cary Grant, probably tipsy all the time during their marriage because of her obviously selfish disposition. Now she's engaged to the stuffy John Howard, on the verge of a huge society bash, and Grant shows up with the idea of pointing out her mistake in choosing a replacement. Along with him are Spy magazine reporters James Stewart and Ruth Hussey who want all the dirt, although Stewart hates being put on a story that he would obviously like to see utilized as a bird cage liner.A biting commentary on the idiocy of high society and its domination of much of the press, this spoofs the lives of socialites like Barbara button (ironically one of Grant's wives), Doris Duke and Brenda Fraser, all \"poor little rich girls\" whose lives became daily copy for society columns and really not worth much. Barry gives it good to these ladies through leading lady Hepburn who us in denial of her image as a \"goddess\", claiming that she wants to be loved, not worshiped, but entirely one dimensional in her definition of what love is. Barry makes it clear that it us through the fault of society for creating these images, and the individual families for allowing them to believed. At first, Tracy leads Stewart on in that goddess image, but his direct approach with her opens her eyes to the ridiculousness of her life. So by the night before her wedding, she's got three men after her, all for different reasons.When her father arrives and eventually describes to his daughter's face her lack of a loving heart, the look on Hepburn's face is pure destruction even though she responds in denial. She's got a rather dizzy mother (Mary Nash), a directly honest, trouble making sister (an outrageously hysterical Virginia Weidler) and a fight to the death for her honor uncle (Roland Young) who takes a fancy to the sardonic Hussey. What a swell party indeed this will be, especially under the direction of George Cukor.While Stewart won the Best Actor Oscar for this, I would have preferred to see him nominated in the supporting actor category. He's brilliant in his performance, but it is not a focus in the story in spite of some terrific scenes. Grant scored in this and two other comedies (\"His Girl Friday\" and \"My Favorite Wife\") and deserved the leading nomination with Henry Fonda the deserving winner. Hepburn gave quite a different performance than her earlier RKO work, and this is a step above in sophistication her almost as brilliant work in Barry's \"Holiday\" remake. But overall, this is classic screwball romantic comedy at its best, pretty much flawless, and it's unfortunate that Hepburn never worked with either Grant or Stewart again.",

            "content": "George Cukor's \"The Philadelphia Story\" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours.I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy\". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr\" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc\u00e9 plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. \"Marry me, Tracy\", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot.Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in \"Grapes of Wrath\", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in \"The Great Dictator\"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen.Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn \"wohds, wohds, wohds\". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one.And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. \"There goes George\", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of \"The Philadelphia Story\"",

Or, at least, that's the way the plot is often summarized.Of all the romantic comedies I've seen lately, particularly of the first half of the 20th century, \"The Philadelphia Story\" was my least favorite. Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind and need to see it again, but I just didn't find it very funny and more often than not just thought it boring and dragging on too long.Cary Grant is alright, but this is not his best role. Katherine Hepburn is a hideously ugly beast, an annoying leading woman and her mouth belches out lines with a voice that would kill anything within earshot. How she is considered one of Hollywood's biggest star in this or any era is beyond me. Jimmy Stewart plays the redeeming character in this one, and it helps that at times he comes across as a rambling drunk. His drunkness is not as great as Doc Boone's from \"Stagecoach\", but still notable.The actress who plays Dinah Lord, Virginia Weidler, is the hidden gem here. She appeared in 44 films over the course of her lifetime, but probably none you've ever seen (besides this one). I'm not sure how she managed to be in so many films, but almost never in any successful ones. Whether that's her fault or that the casting director never picked her for the right roles, I don't know.Until I see this one again, which i don't plan on being soon, I'll have to say it didn't thrill me and the only really lasting legacy of this movie is that Tracy Lord became the namesake of one of the world's most notorious porn stars.

The writing is deliciously witty and acerbic, and George Cukor's direction is nigh-on perfect. The film bounces along at a cracking pace, and the more romantic parts are enough to warm the heart. The acting is superb too, Katherine Hepburn is deliciously shrewd, Cary Grant is charming and urbane and James Stewart while cynical is the epitome of the Mr Nice Guy persona we have come to know and love him by. Overall, a real treat, if the ending wasn't as tacky we would have had perfection of a romantic comedy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Not bad.But frankly, I've had enough of all the worship for this silly bit of tripe. First of all, Hepburn is so convincing as an arrogant, cocky society girl forever putting down others and showing her contemptuous snobbery, that I find it annoying to even listen to her speak.Then too, I had to wonder why on earth JAMES STEWART got an Oscar for what amounts to a nondescript role as a bumbling reporter. Even the great CARY GRANT had much better material to work with in his other comedy romances.All of the other \"rich\" characters are purely stereotypes--everyone, from VIRGINIA WEIDLER playing a bratty kid sister, ROLAND YOUNG, JOHN HOWARD and MARY NASH--they're all cardboard cutouts. Only RUTH HUSSEY makes something of her role as Stewart's photographer friend.No, can't say much good about this unless you're a die-hard Hepburn fan and love her in anything she does.

Written out, it sounds like an abusive drama, but when you see the clip, you recognize it as one of the iconic moments of screwball comedies. Unfortunately for me, I don't really like that genre, so I didn't like either Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story.In the movie, Katharine Hepburn is a society dame who's engaged to John Howard. When the newspaper reporter, James Stewart, who's hired to write a piece on the upcoming wedding in the society column falls in love with her, she finds herself in a triangle.

It is based on the same general theme, providing opportunity for tearful, closeup apology and conversion to `normal' human.This film is marginally better that that disaster. The dialog at least has had the advantage of some polishing. The backdrop is populated with mere stereotypes. In the foreground, Stewart really does have grace -- good thing he was able to do solid work elsewhere because his hiccoughing happy drunk here is wholly unoriginal. Grant has one classical Grant moment: when he rings the candles near the end. This has some Mankiewicz touches: he knows how to overlay celebrity on the role, and that's all we have here folks -- the very type of Spy magazine celebrity that the film makes fun of. How ironic that Mankiewicz was utterly destroyed by what this system wrought (`Cleopatra').But this is Kate's picture, no doubt about that. She was in fact a prideful, arrogant prig who had suffered several boxoffice failures. Like her successes, these had little to do with the merits of the films or her acting. The public just didn't like her.So, she started a campaign to rejuvenate her image. The play was written for her specifically to satisfy this need: to show she could discover a heart. She worked it out on stage, then managed this comeback.The film has only two interesting features for me. The first is how Hepburn's face was made up and photographed. I understand this was a matter of much experimentation, and became the standard for all her black and white work (the color work would never be as good) as well as for many who followed. The lighting requirements (few front lights to accentuate the sunken cheeks) sometimes meant that the men standing next to her looked odd and malevolent-- something about which they complained.The other interesting thing concerns the subtext of the story. The frontmost matter is the tripe about a perfect woman in all regards except lacking a heart. (And the bit about that being the cause of her father's womanizing!)But the backmatter is about stooping to the reality of the fan magazines' celebrity machine. And that's what this is, pure and simple, with a nod that the writers behind the machine are often talent men with a higher calling. I'm sure the writers added that on their own.",

            "content": "If you could have only one piece of information about a movie before watching it, it should be the year it was made: in part, for the historical context; and in part, for the moral context. It is the latter that is essential for this movie, for it presumes much of a moral nature that we no longer accept and may even find repulsive. At the beginning of the movie, Dexter and Tracy are a married couple who are fed up with each other and in the act of separating. After Tracy breaks one of Dexter's golf clubs, he pushes her in the face so hard that she falls to the ground. If a man did that to a woman in a modern movie, we would dislike him, but this movie wants us to like Dexter and approve of what he did to Tracy. We are able to get past this scene without too much difficulty, because Tracy is obviously not hurt, and because it is played for laughs.Later, it turns out that the reason she divorced him was that he was an alcoholic, which was all her fault, and that she was wrong to divorce him for that. This point is made seriously, and so it is harder to get past than the push in the face. Can you imagine someone getting up in front of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and saying, \"I am an alcoholic, and it is my wife's fault\"? Today, we might blame the alcoholic for drinking too much, or we might say his alcoholism is a disease and thus is no one's fault, but blaming the wife is outrageous. Furthermore, we might praise a woman who stays with an alcoholic husband and tries to help cure him, but we do not blame her if she divorces him.When Tracy decides to remarry, Dexter decides that her fianc\u00e9 George is not the right man for her to marry. Dexter not only crashes the wedding, but he also arranges for a reporter and a photographer, who work for a tabloid, to cover the wedding, in hopes of causing trouble. Many of us have had the experience of disapproving of the person someone is going to marry, but we know it is none of our business, especially if that someone is an ex-wife. Can you imagine being a woman whose ex-husband crashes her wedding trying to break things up? Today, we would regard a man who would do that as odious, and we would advise the woman to get a restraining order on him.Tracy's mother has separated from her father Seth because he was cheating on her, and thus Tracy does not invite him to the wedding. But he shows up anyway. He tells Tracy and his wife that a man's philandering is not his wife's concern. Furthermore, he goes on to say that his adultery is all Tracy's fault (here we go again). He explains that when a man starts getting old, having a sweet, devoted daughter is the mainstay that he needs. But when his daughter does not live up to those expectations, the man just naturally has to go out and get a sweet, devoted young woman to have an affair with. That argument is not only bizarre, it is downright creepy as well. It is hard to believe that even in 1940, when this movie was made, the audience would have bought that line.Although the reporter, Macaulay (Mike), and the photographer, Elizabeth, seem to be romantically involved, he nevertheless begins to fancy Tracy. The night before the wedding, they start smooching and go for a swim. It is all supposed to be innocent, and we are supposed to disapprove of George when he refuses to go through with the wedding. The idea is that since Mike and Tracy did not actually have sex, he is making a big fuss over nothing. But I cannot say that I blame him.Of course, the fact that Tracy is drunk is supposed to excuse her indiscretion. At least her intoxication is an important plot point. But there is way too much drinking in this movie in general. Two-thirds of the movie involves people getting drunk, having a hangover, and then drinking some more as a cure for the hangover. This may be another difference between 1940 and now: we do not think drunk-humor is all that funny anymore.After George leaves, Mike asks Tracy to marry him. When she says \"No,\" he goes back to Elizabeth, who does not seem to be disturbed by this at all. Except for George, the men in this movie sure get a lot understanding. Tracy, on the other hand, is depicted as being wrong- headed, and is pretty much told so by Dexter, Mike, and Seth, each in his own way. But Tracy is fine just the way she is, and it is the men who are wrong-headed. She would be better off without the lot of them. Instead, she remarries Dexter. I disapprove of that marriage, but as I noted above, if that is the man she wants to marry, it is none of my business.",

The play was written with Hepburn in mind and when MGM got the film rights, they got her too.  This wasn't seen as good as, 'Bringing Up Baby' notwithstanding, RKO had regarded her as 'box office poison' after a run of flops.However, the movie struck gold and became one of the all-time classics. Hepburn plays Tracy Lord, a brittle society miss between marriages - Grant plays her ex, and dull John Howard her intended.  Stewart plays a cynical reporter who is hovering around to cover her new wedding.  Also in the cast is that little moppet Virginia Weidler, who slightly predated Margaret O'Brien as a little sister and wasn't quite so goody-goody.A lot of the best bits in 'The Philadelphia Story' were later reused in the musical remake 'High Society'(with Crosby, Sinatra, and Grace Kelly) but there are some really classic scenes here.  I especially like the scene where Hepburn and Stewart get tipsy and he goes really overboard in his appreciation of her; there's also an amusing scene between Grant and Stewart involving more consumption of alcohol.Highly recommended for the discerning cinema comedy fan, 'The Philadelphia Story' lives up to all your expectations.",

            "content": "THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is a great comedy directed by George Cukor. Despite the fact that the thematic framework already narrated and seen earlier this movie seems fresh. I think in this film, everyone can find something for themselves. Humor is a varied and meaningful. See Grant, Hepburn and Stewart in the same film is quite challenging. The script is very good and is followed by an even better acting. The Philadelphia Story is the story of luxury and elegance, teasing, sarcasm, love, drinking, arrogance and generally, a wide range of human qualities. The cellophane high society are seamlessly wrapped diversity that makes us who we are.Three men and three different characters are linked, each in its own way, with the rich ice queen Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn). C.K. Dextera Havena (Cary Grant) is profound, eloquent and charming ex-husband. This character is a bit neglected, but always in the right place and pronounce the keywords at the right time. Grant is excellent, but I was a bit bored with the roles of ex-husbands. Macaulay Connor (James Stewart) is \"forever\" unhappy writer who immigrated to write the yellow press. The voice of criticism, and the voice of reason. The character who has something to say to everyone except himself. George Kittredge (John Howard) He was betrothed young rich and untouchable upstart who answer its her standards.Cukor with the help of the aforementioned scenarios exported tangle heated, smart and wiggly dialogue, spiced with romantic intrigue which no lack of questions. Antagonisms and friendship between the characters is another of the features that contribute to such receptivity of the film, which are equally contributed by all.Stewart and Grant are the face and did a great job. However, my sympathies were given ladies. Hepburn is in her crazy performance authentic, of forcing a prude who does not forgive until the fine souls who want love and violations of their own (unnecessary) rules and countless prejudices. Ruth Hussey as Elizabeth Imbrie is paparazzo and would-be painter. She offered a lot of sarcasm beneath which hides their romantic thoughts. Always responds readily to prevent the drawer own feelings.An honest, romantic, funny and extremely sophisticated comedy who on my own joy is not a failure.",

It takes place around this rich mansion, but it's not particularly invested in place, the way it is with Welles, or even Capra and Sturges.The one attribute that makes it stand out is that this is a film about Hepburn stepping into a film so viewers can engage with what moves the icy, indomitable self.She enters 'the Philadelphia story' knowing it is a story being prepared by nosy journalists who have come to get a scoop on her on the eve of her wedding, the story as the ensuing film.Three men vie for her affections, each one offering up his own understanding of Hepburn.Grant as the playboy ex-husband who left her muses that she has been acting the part of callous goddess while missing genuine heart in her performance. The second is her current beau who she is slated to marry the next day; he's entirely smitten with her goddess image and doesn't want her to change, but this understanding of her now appears to her trivial and callow, merely that of an admirer.And third is Jimmy Stewart as the author who is there to jot down the story for the paper. He is the most suspicious of her wealth and vanity but getting to know her sees her as a radiant soul. The usual shuffling of screwball films ensues about what happened last night and who she's going to marry after all.It's not particularly my kind of thing but there's obviously a wide audience of Hepburn lovers and fans of the era that will be more than happy with it.",

            "content": "\"The Philadelphia Story\" is often cited as the apex of Hollywood sophistication, and with good reason. The script (mostly Philip Barry's Broadway original, with some reshaping and a couple of extra scenes by Donald Ogden Stewart) is wonderfully fast and literate, and the three stars exemplify what what has largely been lost: amazingly attractive actors whose eyes shine with wit and whose voices are more than up to the challenge of speaking brilliant, challenging words. Everything about this film -- the acting, the direction, the costumes, the production design -- has an otherworldly, almost radioactive glow.But -- and I'm afraid there is a 'but' -- something has always bothered me about this story. The basic premise is that Tracy Lord (Hepburn), d\u00e9butante extraordinaire, possesses all things bright and beautiful but a warm and forgiving heart. This is demonstrated by her intolerance of her first husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant), and even more by her inability to accept the transgressions of her 'womanizing' father. Will the goddess be brought down to earth, and how? If you've never seen the film, I don't want to give away the final resolution, but I suggest that you listen closely to the 'big' scene wherein Father upbraids Daughter, and try to imagine Bill Clinton having the same conversation with Chelsea. Fathers have a right to demand only so much of their children.Otherwise, 'Philadelphia Story' is a great film, and if you've never seen it, don't bother apologizing. Just get thee to a video store.",

He does this by bringing along two reporters (James Stewart & Ruth Hussey). They come undercover to get some behind the scene snapshots of the wedding. Of course the results of all this is hilarious.Stewart and Hussey give ground breaking performances as the reporters.

Gerg Cukor does a fine and memorable job in directing but it's the acting and one of films finest screenplays that blows this film way ahead of most romantic comedies.

The classy cast is more than adept at this type of smart-talking fluff, yet too much of Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart unfortunately turns Cary Grant into the proverbial third wheel. Act II tails off from the opener in both energy and wit, with far fewer laughs and more inane chatter. This material seems awfully staid and familiar, perhaps because Hepburn played her role on Broadway and hasn't found a fresh approach to the part. Stewart won an Oscar, as did Donald Ogden Stewart for his adapted screenplay (which must've caused Philip Barry discomfort), yet it's a disappointing \"classic\", a filmed stage-play.

As usual, he didn't win an Oscar for his performance (he never won a regular Oscar--just an honorary one years later despite MANY great performances--particularly in light comedies) BUT, oddly, Stewart did get the Oscar for Best Actor--even though his role was clearly a supporting one! I guess they were trying to make up for his loss the year before, though this is NOT one of Stewart's best performances.

            "content": "What a delightful movie this is - loaded with star power, clever dialog, and a script that keeps us guessing. The first scene, where Cary Grant is shown leaving his wife Katharine Hepburn with no words spoken, sets the tone. As Hepburn plans to remarry, Grant seeks to get revenge on her by sneaking a reporter (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer (Ruth Hussey) into her home on the wedding weekend. Stewart is brilliant in the role from beginning to end. He's upset over being there in the first place, as he's a serious writer who has been asked to write a trashy tabloid story, and he's not a big fan of the well-to-do either. The scene early on where he examines the silver, thinking he's alone, and is confronted by the butler, is hilarious. Later he dials up another room within the home at random and says \"This is the bridal suite, would you send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and a bottle of beer?\" When asked who he is, he then says \"This is the voice of Doom calling. Your days are numbered 'til the seventh son of the seventh son,\" before hanging up. He has other comic scenes early on, including asking the librarian \"Dost thou have a washroom?\" after sensing her formality.I just loved how the film wrong foots us, as we expect it to go in a direction of these two being undercover spies with all sorts of similar antics throughout the weekend. Instead, Hepburn immediately sees through the ruse, and proceeds to hilariously torture the pair with questions of her own. Along the way an uncle will be assigned the identity of the father, only to have the father show up unexpectedly himself. Hepburn's much younger little sister (Virginia Weidler) is part of the fun, at one point going up to the piano with a gleam in her eye, and busting out a raucous tune: \"Lydia, oh Lydia, say have you met Lydia? Oh Lydia, the tattooed lady. She has eyes that folks adore so, and a torso even more so...\"Throughout all this madcap chaos, the script is fast-paced and clever. For example, in response to her mother asking if there's no privacy anymore, Hepburn quips, \"Only in bed, mother, and not always there.\" I also loved it when she referred to the poet Li Bai at one point: \"There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river. He was drunk....but he wrote beautiful poetry.\" More importantly, there are observations on character and love. The father (John Halliday) tries to explain an older man's attraction to a younger woman, and even though he seems like a rake, there's something to what he says. The film takes a serious turn when he and Grant both say some devastating things to Hepburn about her insensitivity, and the hurt in her reaction shows her acting prowess. With all of that said, I think it was really Jimmy Stewart who really made this movie special with two wonderful scenes. The first is where he's drunk and goes over to Grant's place, which is an absolute classic. The scene was unrehearsed, what we see was the first take, and it includes a couple of improvisations - Stewart hiccupping, and Grant quipping \"Excuse me.\" The look in Stewart's eyes really make us feel that he's drunk, and that we're getting a glimpse at two friends (the actors themselves) having fun. In fact, the way Stewart looks at people throughout the movie - the butler, the librarian, Grant, and Hepburn - is just fantastic, and still makes me smile thinking about it.The second amazing scene is when he and Hepburn (who's also drunk) realize they're in love. \"A magnificence that comes out of your eyes, in your voice, in the way you stand there, in the way you walk. You're lit from within, Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you, hearth-fires and holocausts,\" he says. She answers, \"I don't seem to you made of bronze?\", a reference to one of the cruel things that's been said to her, and he responds, \"No, you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank, unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl, Tracy. Full of life and warmth and delight...\". When he kisses her, she emits a beautiful \"golly,\" and later, before they dash off across the lawn, she says \"put me in your pocket, Mike.\" It's a wonderful, romantic scene. Oh, and I should say, the lines they say to each other earlier in the evening - \"Hello you... You look fine\", \"I feel fine\" are just lovely too. It's for that reason that I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in Hepburn's choice at the end. The evening before she does say \"The time to make up your mind about people is never\", and it is in the spirit of a reconciliation which grows, but just doesn't feel right. Aside from her feeling the blame for her ex-husband's alcoholism (the nerve of her not understanding him better!), the real passion and chemistry is with Stewart. With that said though, it's a delightful movie, and the story behind its making and Katharine Hepburn's resurrection is a real testament to her intelligence.",

            "content": "To tell you the truth, they don't make films like The Philadelphia Story anymore. Maybe it's because the talent, class and grace of the great Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmie Stewart don't exist anymore in the film industry. This film brought back Kate Hepburn, America's most honored actress of all time. I bought the 2000 VHS edition which featured a documentary of her life after the movie from 1992. Kate was by all accounts very much like the character of Tracey Samantha Lord in the movie. Cary Grant plays her loving ex-husband who comes back into her life for her second marriage. It's a society marriage of course. There are no jokes about the Main Line society and it was not filmed at all in Philadelphia but a Hollywood set. Anyway, the acting was superb with Jimmie Stewart who got his only Oscar for playing the reporter who is smitten with Tracy but his real love is his work and his partner LIz played by the wonderful Ruth HUssey. I didn't forget Ruth because she does her job well playing among 3 huge stars. I also can't forget British actor, John Howard in the role. When Kate got the role, she asked for Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. She got Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant instead but we wouldn't have it any other way, would we?",

            "content": "Like a lot of other people, \"The Philadelphia Story\" is one of my favorite films. It possessed one of the strongest ensemble casts ever assembled: Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey, Virginia Wiedler, Mary Nash, Roland Young, and Henry Daniell. The film is based on the hit Broadway play, starring Hepburn. One of the many things that distinguishes Hepburn from other major actresses is that she was never an insecure woman about her talent. She surrounded herself with the best people available without fear of being overshadowed. As a result, \"The Philadelphia Story\" is brilliant.It's an insane, zany story full of blackmail, mistaken identity, changing bridegrooms, and class separation that belongs right where it is, in 1940. Seen today as a play, it doesn't come off, partly because the acting isn't as adroit and charming as seen here, but also because of societal changes. These are old money idle rich, not new money or celebrities who are fodder for the tabloids and clash with the working class. Tracy's anger at her philandering father is interpreted in the film as coming from a cold, unforgiving daughter rather than someone who's justifiably upset that her mother is going to be hurt again.The comedy is wonderful, handled by masters, with perhaps the most out of the box performance being given by Jimmy Stewart. Gangly, boyish, and funny, he's also quite sexy as he romances Tracy, and his scenes with Grant are priceless.Everyone in \"The Philadelphia Story\" has a fixed opinion about who they are and who everybody else is, and everyone's values are shaken up as the story unfolds. The film bears repeated watchings and will keep you laughing and on your toes at every viewing.With the rich and mighty - always a little patience.",

Miss Hepburn took time off to make the movie, returning to the road company well before it finally closed on 15 February 1941. Shooting from 5 July 1940 to 14 August 1940. Remade in 1956 as \"High Society\", a musical version with Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly.COMMENT: So much praise has been heaped on this delightfully witty comedy of manners, it seems superfluous to add more. Let me just say that the dialogue sparks, the characters fascinate, the plot entertains and the players excel. \"The Philadelphia Story\" is one of the most successful transitions of Broadway to Hollywood ever made, a perfectly flawless gem of wit and sophistication that is, if anything, even funnier, more acidic, more biting, yes, even more clever on the screen. We have Katharine Hepburn to thank for this. She owned the screen rights and made sure MGM did the play proud. She hired the director, the screenwriter, the other players and all the technicians. A great pity she missed out on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Award she so richly deserved. (Who remembers Kitty Foyle today?) James Stewart gives an equally scintillating performance, while Cary Grant (a master of cut-and thrust dialogue) is brilliantly cast as the sly C.K. The supporting players are so perfect, it seems less than just to single out one or two, but I must draw attention to John Howard's magnificently dull fianc\u00e9 (Walter Pidgeon himself could not have done the role more proud), and John Halliday's vibrantly quirky rou\u00e9 father-of-the-bride. And how we vigorously applaud Roland Young!Thanks to the director and his behind-the-camera team, the movie is always as attractive to look at as to listen to. A double pleasure indeed! \"The Philadelphia Story\" is indeed one of the sharpest, most amusing comedies MGM ever made.",

            "content": "Recently, when my mother was having a tough time, she creaked open her cupboard, and pulled out a well-loved DVD. \"Let's watch The Philadelphia Story. It'll be nice to disappear into the delightful struggles of the rich and beautiful for a while.\" And, though it's an indisputably lovely watch for audiences old and new alike, whether watching for the first or thirty-first time, it's more than rote comforting, Classical Hollywood escapism that makes The Philadelphia Story truly special. It's seldom that we find a film with such modestly entertaining aspirations assembled with such consummate care, as director George Cukor's feather-light direction and perfect pacing allow the film to bubble like champagne, but sink in like a sumptuous feast - indisputably one of the most impeccably loveable and utterly unmissable films of its era. Naturally, it helps to boast one of the most airtight, razor-sharp romantic comedy scripts of all time. Writer Philip Barry (adapting Donald Ogden Stewart's stage show) has as much fun peppering the film with the deliciously salty repartee as he does having his characters playfully massage every syllable out of the most riotously intricate names - from the mouth of Jimmy Stewart, the seven syllables of 'C.K. Dexter Haven' somehow emerge as a contemptuous political haiku. Cukor and his players have a ball poking fun at the ludicrous posturing of old money snobs, but the film's class divide is treated far more tongue-in-cheek and with tender sympathy than the savage, cartoonish satire of the average circa 1940 screwball. The film's plot might suggest the gossamer silliness of a Society Magazine take on Much Ado About Nothing, but underneath the Russian Doll subplots of mischievous double-bluffs of masquerade and library and poolside meet-cutes (all delectably zany in their own right) lies a surprisingly rich, compelling, and fundamentally human story, bursting with emotion and heart. Underneath the marquee of comedy of manners zingers lurks an underbelly of genuine family drama, as affecting as it is entertaining, postulating that a yearning for genuine connection - to be really known, beyond social status, trappings, presumptions, projections, and posturing - is, perhaps, the most universal of desires, and the message hits home with the effervescent pop of a bottle of champagne downed a little too fast. But, let's be honest: we're here for the legendary triple-act of Classical Hollywood heavyweights Hepburn, Stewart, and Grant. They do not disappoint, playing off each other with dazzling ease, and showcasing some of the most effortless banter and deep-set chemistry in cinema history. Hepburn has never been better than she is here - she imperiously commands the screen with a hailstorm of scathing punchlines, before embodying the self-esteem imbalance of a woman inundated with superficial praise, but seldom genuinely appreciated, to an unnervingly human degree. She's funny, sad, and almost unspeakably loveable, in an astoundingly heartfelt rollercoaster of a performance. Still, this is unquestionably the Jimmy Stewart show, as his sour, curmudgeonly indictments of the superfluity of wealth are as utterly hysterical, even moreso when giving way for a softer, poetic, recitations betray an aspiring artist beaten down by self-doubt and the financial impediments to wholeheartedly pursue his dream. A decidedly unconventionally subdued Grant rounds up the trio with the least showy performance, but his performance betrays staggering subtleties of inner emotion and past demons. Sneakily puppeteering his peers while firing off innocently acrid witticisms with his never-drier deadpan makes him an exquisitely sarcastic Greek chorus of sorts, and the mischievous twinkle in his eye is as entertaining as all the banter in the world. The rest of the ensemble are all magnificent in their own right, particularly Ruth Hussey as Stewart's perennially spurned, icily deadpan photographer companion, and twelve-year old Virginia Weidler, uproariously funny as the Lord family's gutsy daughter, belligerently unwilling to accept the stubbornness of her older family members causing mishap after mishap. There's the occasional bump in the road where the film shows its age - the calamitous, climactic partner-swapping follies flirt with being too silly to sit comfortably, and it's nicer to just pretend the eyebrow-raising prologue, which treats spousal abuse as a rollicking punchline, just never happens (thank goodness for DVD track-skipping). But, on the whole, this is the highest, most delightful caliber of movie magic imaginable. Whether you need to laugh or cry (usually both), find an airy diversion from life's tribulations, or discover genuine insight in the interplay of immaculately constructed characters, you'd be hard pressed to find a more deeply satisfying watch than The Philadelphia Story. To quote our dear C.K. Dexter Haven: \"My, she was yar.\" -10/10",

            "content": "Despite the cast, this film cannot be conveniently filed under the \"screwball comedy\" category. It is more of a superior drawing room comedy, with some dramatic gravitas. It is positively emblematic of the genial, metropolitan elite that had such an influence in America, with Roosevelt the President.The three stars are obviously the \"Story\" here, but minor characters also play an effective part. The extent to which the older adult members of Hepburn's family have no clue as to what is going on, while the child does, is most amusing at times. It ought to be said that the film is far from all that funny. The humour is more of the clever and fleeting variety. Most of it arises either from Grant's splendid persona, with his wry tones, or Hepburn's flighty, beguiling mannerisms. I would perhaps say that Grant is to a degree under used, as there are very large stretches of the picture where he is not on screen. Stewart is however very impressive, playing a sensitive, artistic type who understandably is somewhat taken by Hepburn. All three stars are much in their element, with accents as remembered by all, and a fitting social setting.As has been said by some other film scribe, \"a strong case is being made as to the sheer irresistibility of the film's female star\". Katharine Hepburn is shown at her most statuesque and unconventionally beautiful. Her character has an impressive array of fine lines to deliver, and is treated with dignity and understanding by the script. It is in some ways a voyage of self discovery for Hepburn's Miss Lord; from a rejection of her anointed \"goddess\" status, a rejection of marriage for mere hierarchical gain and a deeper understanding of love.The film's about-face ending is quite charming really, mixing the conservative with the progressive. Conservative in that marriage is seen to have to take place, and in the characters returning to earlier relationships. It could indeed be argued that not enough had been made of Stewart's relations with Ruth Hussey's character. Progressive it could be said, in that events have been very quickly turned upside down, and love over society is championed. Also, perhaps most tellingly, the drunken \"indiscretion\" of Hepburn is not just forgiven, but seen as part of her self-discovery. This film in its treatment of a liberated woman such as Hepburn, must be praised for its sensitivity and liberal understanding. All too often, Hollywood allowed the reactionary and the puritanically conservative to lazily dominate its films. As manifested in the Hays Code, numerous scaremongering Anti-Communist propagandist films, blind faith in rigid \"family values\" and the stifling of its main comedic talents like Preston Sturges and the old silent comedians. The trend of there being many mainstream, liberal films was to wane gradually during the 1940s, partly symbolised by Roosevelt's passing and much of the 1930s ethos, as the Cold War began in earnest.This \"metropolitan elite\", of the Woollcotts, Kaufmans, Welles, Marx Brothers, Chaplins etc. (so lovingly evoked in 1942's \"The Man Who Came To Dinner\") is not exactly manifested in the actual characters on show here. We are presented with an upper-middle class milieu, with contrasts provided by Grant's hard-bitten aristocratic dandy and John Howard's dullard \"man of the people\" politician. There is nothing staggering about the film's assertion that the upper classes can be perfectly charming and noble, whilst those of the lower classes, like Howard, can be charmless and materialistic. It seems merely to be making a point of its very balance, and is almost a fig leaf to those who would have expected a simplistic \"socialist\" line would have be taken.Need it be mentioned that Cukor's direction is excellent? Making an art form of the unobtrusive, he lets the camera just take in the performances and the script, without distraction. He captures Hepburn in a radiant and sensitive light that I suppose slightly overshadows the male leads. There are artistic shots at times, that evoke occasional counterpoint to the usual images of the starts. One lingering shot of the precocious child watching from out of her window the night's events, is a good example of this working to great effect. An effect of establishing a wider, but still near-motionless canvass to the story.I very much enjoyed this film; it was a very good evening's company. I suggest one should take it in over a fine meal and copious wine, as it is an urbane, thoughtful brew of a film, and a perfect showcase for the unique Kate Hepburn.Rating:- ****/*****",

            "content": "We all know of movies that you hear are considered a \"classic\", but you've never seen, and the few clips of the film you've seen does not, exactly, motivate you to check out the entire film. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY was one such film for me. This 1940 George Cukor production is lauded for it's dialogue, direction and the stellar performances of the cast - particularly the 3 leads, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.Recently, I attended our monthly \"Secret Movie Night\" where we pack the Willow Creek Movie Theater on the 2nd Thursday of every month and get treated to a \"Classic\" Film (made before 1970) or a \"New Classic\" (made after 1970), but we don't know what the film is until it starts playing on the screen.So...imagine how much my eyes rolled back into my head when I saw that this month's film was the aforementioned THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. I sighed to myself and said \"all right, time to endure this one all the way through.\"And...I couldn't have been more wrong. Almost from the start the script, pacing and witty dialogue of this Broadway-Play-Turned-Movie swept me away. Most certainly aided by the fact that 3 of the best movie stars of all time - at the peak of their abilities - were letting this wonderful dialogue roll off their tongues. This film is a \"classic\" in every sense of the word.The plot is...inconsequential. Basically...Philadelphia socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn) is getting remarried. Her ex-husband (Cary Grant) enlists the aid of a Journalist (Jimmy Stewart) to create havoc at the wedding.But...this is a film where the journey, not the destination, is the fun of the flick. The 3 leads banter back and forth with each other, arming and disarming (and charming) one another with their quick wit and biting criticism. The Broadway Stage play was written, specifically, for Hepburn and she exceeds in this role. Here is a newsflash - KATHERINE HEPBURN IS A VERY GOOD ACTRESS - and I think this is the very best performance of the very best actress of all time (with apologies to Meryl Streep). She was nominated (but did not win) the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance (losing to a very deserving Ginger Rogers in KITTY FOYLE, I would have voted for Hepburn, but gotta give Rogers her due, she is very good as the titular KITTY FOYLE).Stepping up to the plate - and matching Hepburn blow for blow - is, surprisingly, Stewart. I didn't really know the story of this film, so I was surprised where Stewart's character-arc went, especially in relation to his relationship with Hepburn. Stewart lost the Oscar in 1939 for his bravura performance in MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (inexplicably losing to Robert Donat in GOODBYE MR. CHIPS), so the Academy made up for it's mistake by awarding Stewart the Oscar for Best Actor of 1940. This most certainly was a worthy Oscar-winning performance, but (if I\"m going to be honest), pales in comparison to his work in MR. SMITH...Looming over these two (and Tracy's impeding marriage to another person) is Cary Grant as Tracy's ex-husband, C.K. Dexter Haven. While Grant's role is the least showy of the 3, he commands the screen just with his presence whenever he shows up and strengthens this triangle with his strength of character.The supporting cast is just as strong - Ruth Hussy (Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as a photographer, Roland Young (as the lecherous Uncle Willy) and, especially, 13 year old Virginia Weidler who is spunky, fun and smart as Tracy's kid sister. The only performer relegated to the back of the scenery is the bland John Howard as George Kittredge (the man Tracy is slated to marry). With Grant and Stewart on the scene, you know that Kittredge has no shot at getting Tracy Lord to the altar (or does he?).All of these fine actors and the wonderful dialogue were put into the hands of the great Director George Cukor - who had 1 of his 5 Best Director Oscar Nominations for this film (he will win for MY FAIR LADY in 1964). He handles this film with skilled hands letting the actors (and the dialogue) \"do their thing\" without letting any of them overstay their welcome. It is a masterful job of directing and with strong actors (and off-screen personalities) like Hepburn, Grant and Stewart, he had his hands full.Sure...it's a 1940's movie, so some of the \"social situations\" (mostly male/female dynamics) do not age particularly well, but Hepburn was a strong personality - certainly well ahead of the game in terms of equality of strength of the sexes, so these dynamics do not jump at us as strongly as it might have been in a lesser actress's hands.If you haven't seen this film in sometime (or if you haven't seen it at all) - check out THE PHILADELPHIA STORY - you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Such films are normally associated with America in the 1930s and 1940s, where they were popular because they allowed screenwriters to flirt with daring themes without breaching the requirements of the Production Code relating to the depiction of adultery. There were, in fact, occasional examples from other countries, such as the British-made \"The Divorce of Lady X\", and the format has sometimes cropped up in recent 2years. (\"Sweet Home Alabama\", \"Did You Hear about the Morgans?) The couple here are Tracy Lord, daughter of a wealthy, aristocratic Philadelphia family, and her ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven. Dexter turns up at Tracy's family home on the eve of her scheduled marriage to George Kittredge, a self-made businessman, and makes it clear that he would be interested in renewing their relationship, even though Tracy is less than pleased to see him. To add to Tracy's difficulties a third man has fallen in love with her- Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor, a journalist sent to cover her wedding.It quickly becomes clear whom Tracy will not marry. Poor George never stands a chance. Part of America's national mythology is \"log cabin to White House\", the idea that in America anyone can succeed if he has the \"right stuff\" and that there is therefore always something admirable about a self-made man. \"The Philadelphia Story\" subverts this myth with a vengeance. It is not that George is a vulgar parvenu- indeed, if he had a streak of healthy vulgarity about him he might cut a more attractive figure. He is stiff, pompous and physically unattractive; we never understand why Tracy ever got engaged to him, unless as a reaction to the handsome, charming and amiable (albeit flawed) Dexter, who comes from a similar social background to her own.As between Dexter and Mike the outcome is not so obvious. The normal rule in romantic comedies involving a love-triangle is \"first name above the title gets the girl\", but here both men are played by major stars, Cary Grant and James Stewart, who received equal billing. Intellectually, of course, we know how matters will end (or at least we do if we are familiar with the conventions of the \"remarriage\" genre), but emotionally we feel that Mike might just be in with a chance.The film was remade in 1956 as the musical \"High Society\". Now there was nothing wrong, in principle, with remaking it as a musical, but I have always regarded \"The Philadelphia Story\" as far superior to \"High Society\". The reason for this has nothing to do with the music- the songs are tuneful and the lyrics witty- and nothing to do with the story, which is much the same in both films. The reason for the difference lies in the acting in the main roles. I exempt from my criticism Frank Sinatra, who played Mike in the remake and wisely did not try to copy Stewart's interpretation of the role, realising that their styles of acting were completely different. Sinatra's Mike, therefore, is hard-bitten, cynical and wisecracking whereas Stewart's, an aspiring writer, is gentler and more idealistic. This film brought Stewart his only competitive acting Oscar, and a well-deserved one it was too.Between, Grant and Bing Crosby, however or between Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly, there is no comparison. Grant and Hepburn are both on top form here. Watching their battle-of-the-sexes duels you realise not only just why they found it so difficult to live together first time around but also just why both cannot live without the other. The main obstacle they need to overcome is Tracy's perfectionism. She sets high standards for himself and demands impossibly high standards of others, especially Dexter who complains that he was less Tracy's husband than \"High Priest to a virgin goddess\". Dexter, who is fond of a drink, has his faults, and doubtless tried Tracy's patience severely during their first marriage, but we realise that beneath it all he loves her deeply.Crosby, by contrast, is so laid-back that he is quite unable to make Dexter seem interesting; we never understand why Kelly's Tracy might have wanted to marry him in the first place. With Kelly we have the opposite problem; she is so heart-meltingly beautiful, and so soft and gentle in her manner, that we never understand why Dexter might ever have wanted to end their marriage. (In Hepburn's case her occasional flashes of temper make this quite obvious). It doesn't help that Kelly did not have a particularly good singing voice- unusually for the leading lady of a Hollywood musical, she only sings one song- or that Crosby was old enough to be Kelly's father, which lessens the chemistry between them. (The age difference between Grant and Hepburn was only three years).Two other good performances come from Ruth Hussey as Mike's attractive lady photographer Liz and the child star Virginia Weidler, who as Tracy's younger sister Dinah steals every scene she is in. Weidler had appeared in another film directed by George Cukor, \"The Women\", the previous year.Not all comedies of this period hold up well today. This was the third \"comedy of remarriage\" Grant made in 1940, the others being \"My Favourite Wife\" and \"His Girl Friday\". The first of these can today seem very dated, as well as overly sentimental. The second is a lot better, although much of its appeal lies in the way in which it combines its romantic plot with a good deal of satire aimed at the American press and political system. \"The Philadelphia Story\", however, is like a fine vintage wine, as good today as when it was first made. 9/10",

I think I've watched it on average at least once a year since 1989.The dialogue is quick and witty, even by modern standards, occasionally biting from time to time and after watching it more than 20 viewings I'll still catch something that managed to slip my attention previously. Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart are all great in their roles and Ruth Hussey more than carries her own throughout.I've believed for a long time that some of the older movies from the golden age of cinema are often better than some of the more modern films, some of the actors from this time frame are superior to the modern ones (both on and off the screen) and I honestly think that movies are better when they are more reliant on great plots and dialogue then they are on special affects. We can see that today in some movies like Lost Husband and Forsaken, two movies that I think are modern classics that just simply have a great plot and actors carrying the storyline forward without being dependent on CGI or special effects to tell the story. If you watch this movie I think you'll see what I mean.Sadly some people will deliberately decide to ignore it because it's black and white and they find it difficult to watch but I was nearly in my teens before we got our first color TV set so many movies and TV shows that I watched as a kid I didn't know were actually in black and white (Maverick and Miracle on 34th Street come to mind) until I was much older so if you fall in that category I would encourage you to try and give this a shot. I think there is a colorized version available on the market, many classic movies of this type were colorized in the 80's, and while I am personally not much of a fan of colorization, if that is what it takes to get you to watch this, then go for it.

            "content": "An unmitigated disaster - and I speak as someone with great affection for vintage film, comedy in general and these actors specifically. I'm not entirely surprised that THE PHILADELPHIA STORY garners the absurd high praise that it does, though. Every aspect of the play and film is utterly phony, but in that high-minded, self-congratulatory manner that appeals to middlebrow audiences who point to films like this as emblems of their own good taste. I can't think of another 'classic' that's routinely considered an actor's dream in which the actors have been so ill-served by their roles and dialogue. They're all embalmed up there on the screen - not just stagebound but hidebound. The well-known plot revolves around the imminent society wedding of ice princess Tracy Lord to a self-made prig; in attendance are her archly witty family, her archly witty ex-husband (who pines for her still) and a pair of archly witty tabloid-style reporters (who resent her spoiled ways and vast wealth). The proceedings begin in a reasonably lively fashion, but it's not long before the forced mechanics of Philip Barry's conception begin audibly creaking, by which point the high-toned literary bon mots begin to land with little thuds; the ghastly speechifying, the would-be ironic wisdom and poetic drunk-scenes begin to take over the movie and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY becomes an endurance test for anyone who has ever truly enjoyed watching Hepburn, Grant, Stewart et al in anything worthy of their talents. Grant does what he can with his role, which mostly calls for worldly-wise detached bemusement, but Jimmy Stewart is trapped with scenes and dialogue that seem like a deliberate attempt to sabotage his naturalism and tremendous rapport with movie audiences. His famous 'drunk scene' with Hepburn is so horridly bogus and actorish that you wonder if the Academy gave him that Oscar as a form of combat-pay - you can't not wince hearing him swoon, \"There's a magnificence in you, Tracy\", bathed in Metro's most gossamer lighting. Ruth Hussey is wasted in a completely thankless role, John Howard's stuffy bridegroom is similarly a stock character/cipher, and Roland Young's old roue, meant to be irresistably irascible, sets your teeth on edge throughout the film. Yet all of these performers get off easy compared to what Barry, and Metro, have done to poor Katherine Hepburn here. The Tracy Lord role is written as a harsh and demeaning caricature of Hepburn's own public persona; she garnered raves, and a return ticket to the Hollywood firmament, for sending up her perceived hyper-neurotic brittleness with great good cheer. She must indeed have been desperate to redeem her image by playing a role this insulting: the 'Hepburn' being spoofed never once alludes to her fierce intelligence or dramatic intensity or even her basic decency or humanity. 'Tracy Lord' is a spoiled, smug, self-centered and utterly insufferable stick-figure whose entire dramatic purpose is to be told by every other character how cold and fraudulent and incapable of human emotion she is, over and over, until the audience is fairly salivating for the cleansing humiliation and comeuppance that will render her, at last, a 'real' woman. She gives her lines more feeling and intuition than they deserve (when she's not forced to read dialogue expressly designed to make her look foolish or hateful). The real irony here is, though THE PHILADELPHIA STORY did renew Hepburn's Hollywood career, it reinforced the audience's distrustful perceptions of her, so that generations of moviegoers have come to think of Tracy Lord and Katherine Hepburn as one and the same. But there's a reason THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is rarely, if ever, revived as a stage property: it's horribly false and condescending, and one could single out the phonies in the audience with ease - they'd be the only ones laughing, while the majority of the attendants punctuate their long silences with nervous coughing between impatient glances at their watches. Thank the Lord at least for Virginia Weidler in this movie, as the kid gives the only unaffected performance in the whole show. Lucky for her that Philip Barry didn't think enough of the character to devote the same 'care' he took with the lead roles.",

Perhaps the fact that the whole film takes place over two days and is mostly shot at Hepburn's home adds to the feel of urgency throughout the entire film. Will she go back to her ex-husband? Will she marry the new man in her life? Will she fall in love and run away with Jimmy Stewart?

The performances are, without any doubt, what holds the whole film together, Katherine Hepburn shines as the leading lady and her on screen chemistry with Hollywood legends Cary Grant and James Stewart is outstanding. The individual relationships between each character is what made the whole film intriguing to view. I do think it is a bit of an overstatement to label this as a comedy. It is a feel good drama that has humorous elements to it, but it is not necessarily funny, especially when you compare it to the proper comedies made by the likes of Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers during this era of film. The plot is also very straight forward, it flows by so easily that you forget there is even an objective that the protagonist is trying to overcome. There is never a moment where Tracy or any other character seems to be struggling. I do not blame the actors, but the writers for not making their issues seem vital, something that we would want them, as viewers, to defeat.The film is very sweet, the immense charm of the story itself and the lead make it a pleasant viewing. Well acted and somewhat enchanting, The Philadelphia Story may be flawed, but it is still worth the watch if you are looking for a good romance, just do not go out of your way to see it.

But as far as I'm concerned life itself goes around in circles and if any certain thing or a person is bound to come to our lives the destiny will surely show the way there and the way back.The Philadelphia story premiered 80 years ago, was directed by the great George Cukor and starred Katharine Hepburn and for the first and sadly the only time together two of my favorite actors, Cary Grant and James Stewart. The picture was nominated for six Oscars, winning two for the Best Adapted Screenplay and the Best Supporting Actor for Jimmy, although I personally wouldn't name him supporting as his character is pivotal to the plot and has in a way even more depth than the main characters.Everything in this story is simply splendid, from the opening silent scene of a break-up to the final picture shot with confused faces, filled in between with long, colorful, passionate dialogues and fantastic performances that combine the drama and comedy in magnificently equal proportions (maybe dramatic component prevails by an inch or so) and gives the viewer a lot to think about in the process.It's so easy to fall head over hills in love with someone only to realize in a short while that it was in vain and the person you wanted to bind your life with seems to flow away like a feather - the only person to blame here is yourself. You created the illusion yourself and believed in it. And it takes a lot of time to figure that out, accept it and move on - but you can never escape the consequences and either you come to terms with them and yourself and do what's ought to be done or you end up pitying yourself for the rest of your life because there might never be another \"Philadelphia story\" that you would want to tell your kids about.",

With any other actor this would be a vile act against a woman but because it's Cary Grant, it works and thus showing the power of these three acting titans, Hepburn, Grant and Stewart. The Philadelphia Story gives an insight into the lives of the rich and famous, something which would be harder to pull off in later decades not to come off as a metaphorical dick waving display of wealth. I do find myself trying to figure out why this is? Could it be the incredibly high standards of writing and filmmaking craft on display here and the love of these performers; even more so when compared to the poor standard of romantic comedies today?Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is not a ditzy socialite. In this role written for Hepburn it's clear that she is a symbol of first wave feminism; wearing pants and an emasculating suit and being an influence on her younger tomboy sister but more importantly, it's not to be undermined the complex characterisation of Tracy Lord. Like in Holiday, Grant and Hepburn share some very poignant and hard to decipher dialogue in which he tells her about her standing as a goddess and her lack of human frailty. Despite her ego, she claims in a sincere manner \"I don't want to be worshipped, I want to be loved\". Under the surface of the usual Cary Grant charm and elegance, C.K. Dexter Haven is one the darker characters Grant ever played. Apparently he \"socked\" Tracy on occasions, destroyed the cameras of multiple photographers on a boat and is a recovering alcoholic. This is Cary Grant at his most conniving with no remorse and enjoying it, displaying the darkly comic side of The Philadelphia Story.However, this is Stewart and Hepburn's film. Macaulay Connor is the moral, do-gooder James Stewart is known for (at least at the beginning that is); objecting to having been given the assignment of snooping in on the wedding of a Philadelphia socialite, as opposed to something with more journalistic integrity. He is appalled by the rich and their lifestyle but unlike Jefferson Smith he throws this out the window when he falls in love with Tracy; a piece of subtle cynicism on the movie's part? I also really appreciate the relationship he shares with his work partner Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey). Her character is very cynical throughout most of the film but later reveals her more idealist side. She shares a platonic friendship with Macaulay but there are hints they have deeper feelings for each other. Virginia Weidler, on the other hand, is a real scene stealer. Just look at her speaking French in an overdramatic manner then singing Lydia the Tattooed Lady by the piano; a pointless scene but funny.I can't call The Philadelphia Story a predictable movie as I couldn't see where the story was going at the end. I could have sworn she would end up with Jimmy but at the last minute and totally out of nowhere she goes with Cary and with it coming off as contrived. Likewise, a drunken Stewart carrying Hepburn in his arms while singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow is surely one of the greatest things ever caught on celluloid.",

Watching her performance in this film, it's hard to believe that Hepburn ever had a 'box-office poison' period. Still, in giving Tracy Lord life, Tracy Lord not only gave Hepburn back her career, but also allowed movie audiences for generations to come to enjoy the undeniable magic and charisma of Katharine Hepburn.While this film is undeniably Hepburn's, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart also turn in brilliant performances. Grant chose the more low-key role, oddly enough, while insisting on top billing. This left the field open for Stewart to sneak in and try his darned best to steal the movie from Hepburn's capable hands, and he almost succeeded. The chemistry between Hepburn and Stewart is a delight to watch, and I do wonder what Grant could have done with this role if he'd chosen it. Could he have improved on it?

Many of them have undoubtedly been well-written, well-acted and highly entertaining, but I simply can't bring myself to adore them as I do many films from other genres. 'The Philadelphia Story' proved an ideal example of what I'm trying to articulate. The film has everything going for it: Katharine Hepburn as a snappish socialite, James Stewart as a quick-witted reporter and Cary Grant's roguish boyish charm. The story is a bit more complex than you might expect from a screwball comedy, with three different men vying for the attention of Hepburn's wealthy and independent Tracy Lord, though only one, of course, will successfully take her hand in marriage. Each of the memorable performances are spot-on, and the screenplay is very sharp, but it's not a film I can see myself watching again in the near future; or, if I did, it would only be because I love Jimmy Stewart so much.'The Philadelphia Story' was directed by George Cukor, and adapted by Donald Ogden Stewart and Waldo Salt from Philip Barry's Broadway play of the same name. After a string of disappointing flops for Hepburn, the film proved phenomenally successful, nominated for a total of six Academy Awards and winning two (Best Screenplay and Best Actor for Stewart). Though each of the actors brings their characteristic quirks and personalities into this film, it is certainly Stewart who steals the show, and he is particularly hilarious after consuming a substantial amount of alcohol. Cary Grant does what he does best of all, playing the mischievous ex-husband (a similar role to his Walter Burns in 'His Girl Friday (1940)'), whose constant interference is really just his way of showing how much he wants Tracy back. Aside from the three main stars, other performers of note include John Howard as Tracy's undeserving husband-to-be, Ruth Hussey as Stewart's tabloid photographer, and the delightful Virginia Weidler as Tracy's nosy younger sister.The film is often described as a \"comedy of remarriage,\" a sub-genre of American comedy which was most popular during the 1930s and 1940s. The Production Code (also known as the Hays Code) explicitly forbade the cinematic depiction of infidelity, and so many writers avoided this by having the main protagonists divorced at the beginning of the story. Cary Grant was seemingly an expert in such situations, and other notable examples of this phenomenon can be found in 'The Awful Truth (1937)' and 'His Girl Friday (1940).' Another notable characteristic of 'The Philadelphia Story' is that, unlike every other screwball comedy I've seen, the conclusion was not completely predictable; I actually had no idea who was going to end up with Tracy.

A far more moving and humorous film in the same vein, that is too overlooked, is Libeled Lady (1936).

Do you seriously need to read anything more about this movie? Go out and rent it right now.Still with me? Okay, here's the plot. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) and GK Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) are a couple of old money, high society types who got married in a moment and divorced in a fury. Two years after that, Tracy is ready to marry the nouveau riche George Kittredge (John Howard). Dexter offers to sneak a couple of reporters into the wedding, supposedly as revenge on Tracy but actually because if he doesn't, the magazine will run a damaging story about Tracy's father. The writer and photographer, Macaulay Connor (James Stewart) and Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), are a couple of working class stiffs who have the talent to be artists, but being an artist doesn't bring in enough cash to pay the bills. As the three interlopers arrive at the Lord family estate a day before the wedding, Dexter, Connor and George find themselves caught in Tracy's gravitational pull. Their orbits around this beautiful, brilliant and fiery star intersect and crash into each other until we find out who Tracy loves, who loves her and whether any of that has anything to do with getting married.This is a great movie. Go out and rent it right now.Still reading? Yeesh, what more do you want to know? This film has some of the greatest, sharpest, most electric dialog you'll ever hear, delivered by some of the greatest actors there will ever be. And it's not all about Hepburn, Grant and Stewart. Ruth Hussey is just a wonderful as they are, even with a much smaller role. The filmmaking isn't very complex by today's standards and many older movies like this end up feeling a bit slow and labored when compared to the wild camera work and insanely fast editing of modern films. But The Philadelphia Story flies like a rocket across the sky. The energy of the story never lets up and even the scenes meant to be quiet and calm, crackle and spark like an electrified road runner.Go out and rent this movie right now.Still reading? Well, in addition to being a marvelous work of entertainment, The Philadelphia Story is also an interesting examination of American attitudes toward class in its era. This film paints a picture of three distinct classes in society. Tracy and Dexter are the sort of wealthy elite whose families have been rich as long as anyone can remember. They are spirited and eccentric and indulgent. Connor and Liz are the rest of the people that have to work jobs they don't particularly like just to meet their basic needs. They are pragmatic and sarcastic and have a snobby sense of superiority over the idle rich. George, in most other stories, would be the hero. He's a guy who started out working in the coal mine and has risen to be a top executive in the company. George is the self-made man, though perhaps with a little help from his prospective father-in-law. But in The Philadelphia Story, George is the schmuck. He doesn't have the \"breeding\" or style or mischief of the genuine elite. But he's got enough money to have pretensions and bull-headed ideas that working class folks can't afford to bother with. In many ways, George represented the future that was coming to American when this movie was made, but these filmmakers didn't think much of that future. The ending, with its Old World sense of class propriety, also isn't something you'd find in many American stories of any kind told after this.The Philadelphia Story is a great movie. Go out and rent it right now. Don't make me tell you again.",

During this time it becomes apparent that husband number two is not the best fit and Tracy ends up coming to some self realizations about her and her stance on perfection.I am not sure that I agree with the father's logic that his daughter and her striving for high ideals is partially to blame for his philandering.Classic film that you should see at least once...Cary Grant and James Stewart are at their best and this role was literally built to show case Katherine Hepburn.

Dexter arrives at the Lords' mansion the day before the wedding with writer Mike Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie, determined to shake up things and make Tracy look authentically on things.Katharine Hepburn is absolutely enigmatic and amazing in her role as Tracy Lord.

The comedy was an unexpected and pleasant surprise - I was expecting more of a relationship-drama. This gives the movie great momentum, initially.After a while, however, the jokes become fewer and fewer and it does become a relationship-drama, and then it becomes more stuffy, more dour and more predictable. It essentially becomes a standard \"who will end up with who\" movie. Not terrible, but not the stand-out great movie it was in the first half.This second half also makes the movie feel a bit dated, due to the social stuffiness and play-like dialogue.Three of the great performers of the 40s are on show - Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. Of the three Stewart's is the better, mostly because of the character he was playing. Hepburn's character was irritating and Grant's was a tad stuffy.Stand-out performance, however, goes to 13-year old Virginia Weidler. She gets the best and funniest lines and scenes and she delivers them to perfection. The scene where she sings \"Lydia, The Tattooed Lady\" is sublime.Another performance of note was that of Ruth Hussey as Elizabeth Imbrie. I enjoyed the performances of Weidler and Hussey much more than that of the three big-name stars.",

            "content": "It's easy to accept Hepburn as the goddess queen socialite Tracy Lord since the part was written as a Broadway play with her in mind. Wisely investing in the story rights with playwright Philip Barry granted her virtual certainty to be cast in the film version when MGM purchased the rights. The film was shot with almost no retakes under director and friend George Cukor, and produced Jimmy Stewart's only Best Actor Oscar.Casting Cary Grant in a romantic comedy just about assures a film with snappy dialog and precision comic timing. The surprise here might be Stewart's ability to keep the same pace going, along with his newspaper partner Ruth Hussey. Together they set out to capture the wedding of the year for their tabloid rag, 'Dime and Spy' magazine.The opening scene seems to come a little out of left field if you're watching it for the first time. Seeing Hepburn take a shove in the face from Grant's character was a bit like Jimmy Cagney's grapefruit smackeroo on Mae Clark in \"Public Enemy\". Here it was done in the interest of a dissolving marriage, to live on in infamy as kid sister Dinah's (Virginia Weidler) 'sock in the face' memoir.The thing is, Tracy Lord (Hepburn) deserved it, and the film goes on to show how those closest to her help her understand it, deal with it, and eventually learn and grow from it. It was interesting to me how closely in tune both C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) and Tracy's father Seth (John Halliday) were in describing her character. Dex admonished her for not understanding human frailty; Dad in turn recognized that she didn't have an understanding heart. Oddly, Tracy's fianc\u00e9e Kittredge (John Howard) seems to love her for those very reasons, and it's when he spells it out for her that she finally seems to get it. It takes all kinds.You have to keep your eye on Jimmy Stewart when he goes into that drunken jag at Grant's home, it's really brilliantly done. Up till then his comic repartee and timing was competent, but that scene probably insured the Oscar. It's also why one might be left scratching their head over the eventual outcome of the story, as it goes full circle to become sister Dinah's little victory after all. The question for me though would be why Dexter Haven would proceed with 'Love Affair II' after all that had gone before. I guess that's why they call it a story.",

Not being the biggest fan of hers, I'm not as enamored with this movie as others are. I do like it and recognize its quality. It's just not one of the classics I like to rewatch. It also very much has the feel of a filmed stage play, which George Cukor was prone to do. Characters bouncing in and out of rooms with great flourish and lots of long conversations that are full of speeches. It's a very talky movie. Still, excellent cast helps a lot.

            "review_title": "\"Full of inundo\"",
            "content": "It seems unthinkable given her almost instant rise to stardom in the early 30s, and the almost universal acclaim she enjoyed in the later part of her career, that for a short period in the late 30s Katherine Hepburn bore the disparaging label of \"box-office poison\" and was regarded as a liability to the studio. She was dropped by RKO, made a picture with \"poverty row\" studio Columbia, and didn't appear on screen at all in 1939. And then all of a sudden, with The Philadelphia Story, she bounced right back as if she'd never been away.So what was the secret? Well, it certainly doesn't hurt that The Philadelphia Story is very good indeed. Playwright Philip Barry had written it especially for Hepburn, and it had had a successful run on Broadway before MGM snapped up the rights. It was the ideal role for the persona she had been crafting over the last seven years \u2013 a headstrong society woman, independent and confident, but still prone to the errors of confidence. It is a sparkling and intelligent comedy with situations and dialogue that seem natural yet are funny in an almost by-the-way manner. This is the sort of comedy Hepburn was a mistress of. In short, the part was tailor-made for her. What's more, the play had been such a hit that Hepburn found herself in a strong bargaining position with the studio.First, she secured the directorial services of her friend George Cukor, with whom she had already worked a few times. There really is no-one who could have done a better job. Cukor's speciality was in taking stage plays and making them not seem stagy. You see, a stage play can't just skip from one location to the next like a film or a novel. For reasons of practicality narrative has to be blocked into lengthy scenes. This can be very boring if it is adapted directly onto the screen. Cukor's trick is to subtly move the action along or quite literally change the angle on it. For example, there is an early scene where James Stewart and Ruth Hussey are in a sitting room, and are visited in turn by Cary Grant, Virginia Weidler, Hepburn and Mary Nash. Each time a new character comes in and the dynamic changes, Cukor begins again with a new establishing shot and new camera set ups, giving a sudden feel of freshness. We are effectively fooled into thinking we have just seen lots of little scenes, instead of one ten-minute one all set in the same room.Cukor also keeps the tone of the story \u2013 as well as the solution to the tangled love-polygon \u2013 implicit in his technique. In the earliest scenes the camera is almost continuously centred on Virginia Weidler (Dinah) following her is she bounds from room to room, matching her relentless energy. There's also a nice moment in the scene at the stable where we first meet the characters played by Roland Young and John Howard. When Hepburn and Howard speak to each other, the camera doesn't get too close, and a horse is pottering about behind them. This isn't some pretentious bit of symbolism, it merely means that no matter what the characters say or how they say it, the scene could never be misinterpreted as a deeply romantic one.But enough of Mr Cukor. Hepburn also managed to gather a fabulous cast. Her original choices of Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy were not available, although it's hard to imagine even those two heavyweights doing as well as her runners-up, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. These well-mannered comedy roles were bread-and-butter to Grant, but Stewart was more the newcomer. Still, his performance is a virtuoso act of comedic interpretation. What he actually achieves is to make that witty dialogue sound completely fluent, as if it was an improvisation rather than a memorised script. Ruth Hussey is the perfect sidekick for him, and does something similar but a little more dry, yet with deep emotion underpinning it. Then there are the absolutely divine appearances by Roland Young, Mary Nash and the wickedly funny Virginia Weidler, between them ensuring there is not a single trough in the whole picture.And what about Ms Hepburn herself? She is magnificent of course, playing the role with such naturalism and yet such wit, teasing out the humour in the ordinariness of the words. The thing is, this isn't really anything different to what she was doing in Holiday and Bringing Up Baby, so why the sudden swing in popular and critical opinion? Well, perhaps audiences just hadn't been ready for the strength of character and audacity of the grown-up Hepburn. And maybe after they had fallen for the bitchy determination of Bette Davis in Jezebel and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind, the good-natured feistiness of Hepburn seemed like a warm-blooded counterpart. Whatever the case was back then, The Philadelphia Story and its stars are just as watchable today is they were seventy years ago.",

I felt zero empathy for all the characters that were not really developed, for instance it may have worked if the groom was portrayed as slightly more ambitious and conniving. American culture has always been antagonistic to the british class system but the opposite happens here, the rich boy not only walks away from his marriage in the first place but wins the day as well, by manipulation. If a strong female lead was intended which is what Hepburn was aiming for, the opposite has been portrayed. I just really want to know who the critics were that were obviously paid by studios at the time to love this. I have less doubts about modern critics who love irredeemable story telling.",

            "review_title": "Stewart is best actor, Grant has top billing, and Hepburn's star rises",
            "content": "This very witty film has a superb plot that allows a huge cast to shine in all their roles. \"The Philadelphia Story\" is about spoiled wealth, pride, judgment and condemnation, mistakes, forgiveness and love. All aspects of the film are superb. Others discuss the story and performers in detail. So, I'll mention a couple less discussed aspects and give some background on the movie.This film is an early jab at the sensationalism of the press. In the early 20th century, newspapers often touted sensationalism as they competed with one another. Over time, the mainline press became more reasonable, responsible and less flashy. But the hunger for gossip and gullibility of some people, especially idol worshipers of Hollywood and the rich and famous, led to the rise of what today is called the \"tabloid press.\" \"The Philadelphia Story\" seems pointedly to belittle the tabloids.Another unusual thing in this film is the subject of alcoholism and recovery from it. Cary Grant plays C. Dexter Haven, an alcoholic. His drinking was the main thing that led to the breakup of his marriage two years ago to Tracy Lord, played by Katherine Hepburn. Now it's the eve of Tracy's wedding to George Kittredge (played by John Howard), and Dexter shows up sober as a church mouse. The film says only that he had been working in South America and hasn't touched a drink in nearly two years. He doesn't drink at any time in the film, and he shows the cool-headedness of sobriety when others around him are well oiled. Cinema before this time mostly treated drunkenness with humor. Booze often was a main prop in W.C. Fields movies. In many films, the audience got laughs from the pratfalls of the drunks. In \"The Philadelphia Story,\" much of the humor comes from Tracy and Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor, played by James Stewart, when they are in their cups. But on the edge of that humor amidst the intoxicated, is the only serious thread in this film. Dexter's recovery proves to be true and earnest.While all the roles in the film are played very well, one in particular stands out. James Stewart's role is one of the best acting jobs of all time on the silver screen. Connor changes his persona a number of times. It never seems forced or overdone, but real and natural. He was a cynic at the start. He was comical then serious. He was happy and in love. Then he was back down to earth. Stewart played in many fine films after this, over a wide spectrum of movie genres. He never had a role more diverse than that in this film. It is a tremendous show of his acting talent. He was most deserving of his best actor Oscar for 1940. Finally, some tidbits about the film background. These come from the 2003 biography, \"Kate Remembered,\" by Hepburn's 20-year friend, A. Scott Berg; and from the 1993 TV film that Hepburn narrated, \"Katherine Hepburn: All About Me.\" In her early career, Hepburn was often difficult to work with. She demanded huge salaries. She was dubbed Katherine of Arrogance. But she established herself as a movie star very quickly. Then, in the late 1930s, she had several movie flops. She was labeled by an independent theater group as \"box office poison\" in 1938. So, in 1939, she returned to Broadway and a play that Philip Barry had written specifically for her. Hepburn starred in \"The Philadelphia Story,\" which became a huge success. She had been in an affair with Howard Hughes for a few years. Hughes wanted to marry her. But, she had her eyes set on stardom and saw marriage as blocking that. So, Hughes bought the movie rights to the play as a gift for Hepburn. She gave it to MGM and Louis B. Mayer on the condition that she got to star in the film. She said she wanted Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable for the male leads. But she got Cary Grant and James Stewart. And, one thing really stands out about this movie. Katherine Hepburn's role is the major role and focus of the film. And, she owns the film. But she has second billing \u2013 after Cary Grant. She and Grant were in four films together, and this is the only time that Grant had top billing over Hepburn. Film historian Jeanine Basinger tells how this came about. She does the commentary in the voice-over version of the film that I have on DVD. Cary Grant was the top box office draw at the time. No doubt, MGM could see him as a boost for the film. But, Basinger said for Grant to do the film, he wanted three things. MGM agreed, and Hepburn agreed. The first was that he wanted top billing. The second was a salary of $100,000 \u2013 a huge sum for a film actor in those years. And third, he wanted MGM to give his salary to the British War Relief. So, that's how Cary Grant, with a lesser role, came to be billed above Katherine Hepburn \u2013 but for a great cause. Here are a few funny favorite lines. Sidney Kidd, \"You hate me, I trust, Miss Imbrie?\" Elizabeth, \"No, I can't afford to hate anybody. I'm just a photographer.\"Mrs. Lord, \"One of the servants has been at the sherry again. I'd better go see.\"Tracy, \"You haven't switched from liquor to dope by any chance, have you Dexter?\"Dinah Lord, \"Maybe he's going to sock her again.\" Mrs. Lord, \"Don't say sock, darling. Strike is quite an ugly enough word.\"Liz, \"I've come for the body of Macaulay Connor.\" Dexter, \"So glad you came. Can you use a typewriter?\" Liz, \"No thanks. I have one at home\"",

There's witty banter, reminding one of such great screwball classics as His Girl Friday (starring Grant).  The setup is good, the characters are the stuff of great screwball.  Then the witty banter stops.  Katharine Hepburn's character is given a lecture about how she's an ice princess by every one (including her philandering father, who has NO BUSINESS lecturing her about anything).  There's an awful drunk scene between Hepburn and Stewart.  I can't believe that scene is celebrated.The sexism of this movie, admittedly a product of its times, is still off-putting.  The scene of the father blaming his daughter for his affairs is the worst.  The movie seems to actually believe he's right!Finally, the ending is totally arbitrary.  Whether Hepburn ends up with Grant or Stewart seems to have been changed at the last moment.  The whole movie seems to point in one direction, but in the end it goes the other way. This was the nail in the coffin of a lousy, over-praised movie.Don't get me wrong.  I'm not someone who hates these old comedies.

            "content": "This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled \"box office poison\". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife \u2013 even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a \"female\". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments",

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story (1940)\nAlmost a nice comedy of remarriage with slight errors. Romantic Comedies were ruling in late 30s and early 40s and most of the all time classic films releases in the same period. The Philadelphia Story appeared in the same span but it came out as a different Romantic comedy, making it new of it's kind - Comedy Of Remarriage. A woman starts realising about herself just before she's to get remarried with the help of her ex husband and a news writer. It is moreover a woman's journey from 'The Goddess' to 'Human Being'. I would have been more happy if the self-realization trick would have done it rather than oscillatory love. I personally can never digest such things in the movie that Love can really oscillate like this quickly. And anyways, if you were had to end the film on that note then entire pre-climax portion doesn't make sense at all. The woman falls in a love with the writer a night before her marriage and on her marriage day she declines him peacefully just to remarry her ex husband. If this had to happen anyways, then why did you needed that love angle just to prove her prejudice? Although i am upset with the climax that way, i liked the throughout structure of the film. All characters are well written even if you had to accept slight errors towards the end. Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart (Oscar Winning.. seriously?), Roth Hussey make a great foursome effort while i cannot forget that little sweet little girl Virgiania Weidler who play one of the most essential part in the film. George Cukor makes a nice comedy even though it is not Fully mad or funny. His conviction comes right in the path when things seemed like settling down, but then he had something else to tell. Overall, The Philadelphia Story is a nice comedy which can be enjoyed once or twice maybe, and even a Great one if i had to forgive the slight errors in the climax. But those slight errors snatches so much away from the impact, after all a Classic film and a normal good film are differentiated by those slight errors.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

Basically C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) is finally kicked out by now divorced ex-wife, who he married too hastily, Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn), who dumped him when his drinking habit got out of hand. Two years later, Tracy is engaged to be married to aspiring politician and pretty ordinary George Kittredge (John Howard) at the Lord mansion, and three unexpected guests have arrived to see the wedding. Reporter Macaulay 'Mike' Connor (Oscar winning James Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth 'Liz' Imbrie (Oscar nominated Ruth Hussey) are assigned to cover the wedding story, i.e. The Philadelphia Story, and the third guest who has helped them get close the action is Dexter. The deal between Dexter and Spy Magazine editor Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell) is that the reporter and photographer cover the \"wedding of the year\", and Dexter's story (he doesn't want getting out) isn't published. After arrival, it is clear that Mike, Liz and Dexter are a bit out of place, and the complicated relationships between all the characters are just as bad, but they stick around. The day before the wedding however, after a party and loads of alcohol, Mike and Tracy seem to get very close to each other, and end up kissing and having a late night swim in the pool. Feeling very guilty, Tracy confesses to George, but says that the kissing and swimming is all that happened, I can't remember how George was swayed away from the marriage, but Mike offers to marry Tracy instead, but she declines knowing that Liz is his real other-half, and she agrees to marry Dexter once again. Also starring John Halliday as Seth Lord, Roland Young as Uncle Willie, Mary Nash as Margaret Lord, Virginia Weidler as Dinah Lord, Lionel Pape as Edward and Rex Evans as Thomas. Grant is charming and likable as always, Hepburn is sassy and lovable, and Stewart deserved his Oscar for being the likable American everyman, I may have only laughed a few times, but I can see why it is a really good classic romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Picture. Katharine Hepburn was number 38, James Stewart number 12, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Stewart number 3, and Grant number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Hepburn was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and Grant was number 23, Stewart number 13, and Hepburn number 9 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

            "content": "THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is a glittering 1940 comedy, based on a play by Phillip Barry that starred the legendary Katharine Hepburn on Broadway and re-established a career that was floundering at the time. Hepburn purchased the movie rights herself to make sure no one else got to do the movie and I'm so glad she did. Hepburn gives, arguably, the greatest performance of her career, as Tracy Lord, a spoiled, self-absorbed heiress and grande dame of Philadelphia society who is busy planning her upcoming marriage to a stuffed shirt named George Kittredge when her ex-husband, C.K, Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) re-enters her life. Also thrown into the mix is a reporter (James Stewart) who has been sent to the Lord mansion to do a story on the wedding and ends up succumbing to Tracy's charms. This delicious comedy-drama is a delight from start to finish. The opening scene is a classic where the relationship between Tracy and her ex is firmly established in a brief and classically funny scene. Stewart won the Oscar for Best Actor for what was, in reality, the third best performance in the film. Hepburn is brilliant and was nominated for Best Actress (losing to Ginger Rogers for KITTY FOYLE) and Grant has never been better, in a performance that didn't even merit a nomination. Donald Ogden Stewart also won an Oscar for his adapted screenplay. There is a school of thought that Stewart's Oscar for this film was more a consolation prize for losing the previous year for his far superior work in MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, but I digress. The film was an instant classic upon release and is one of the few chances you'll get to see three acting legends working so beautifully together to provide the meat of this rich and stylish comedy. Don't miss this one. Remade as a musical in 1956 called HIGH SOCIETY with Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra taking the roles originated by Grant, Hepburn, and Stewart, respectively.",

Stewart probably didn't deserve his Oscar for his role as Mike Connor, but he is so much fun here it makes the movie. I also liked and appreciated, which I don't get to see in Rom com's today, how other people call out Hepburns character for being a \"prig\" upper class socialite type. actually compared to the sociopaths who made Rom com's so insufferable in the past 25 years, she's almost positively delightful and human.Grant is funny too, though kind of more of the 'straight' guy in comedic moments. Its a frothy Hollywood romance with skill and grace and drunken shenanigans, and even kids get eloquent quips. I may personally prefer when these actors are in screwball mode in other films (Hawks jumps to mind), but it's respectable, quality stuff, and it takes its characters seriously - Hepburn especially deepens and has a sophistication with the character that's surprising when it starts off seeming like it could dip into pre sitcom territory (and some may argue it's what that is).But Mankiewicz and Cukor have fun with them in what is not great but very good, and that's enough.",

Hepburn gives the performance of her career in a once in a lifetime role.  The character of Tracy is vibrant and smart, with a unique sarcastic flair.  C.K. Dexter Haven is dashing, witty and touchingly vulnerable.  Grant is brilliant.  Hussey and Stewart are equally great in their roles as the \"every day man and woman\" who have somehow managed to work their way to center stage to the social event of the year.Through it all, you will laugh at this delightful mix of people and recognize yourself in a little of each one of them.

            "content": "George Cukor directs \"The Philadelphia Story\". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc\u00e9 \u2013 a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon.Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, \"The Philadelphia Story\" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity.Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about \u2013 Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc \u2013 but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps \"The African Queen\" and \"The Rainmaker\", but we see this in \"The Philadelphia Story\" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of \"mere women's pictures\". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, \"Heller in Pink Tights\", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, \"Sylvia Scarlett\" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and \"coming outs\", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

This was more light-hearted drama than comedy; I didn't laugh at all. While fun to watch three famous actors in their prime, Hepburn steals the show.

'Baby' was totally screwball but 'Story' is a comedy of manners, a term that arguably has no meaning today. Watching with hindsight and a knowledge of High Society it's often easy to see how the 'spots' suggested themselves as song opportunities. Above all it is a well-made play, author Philip Barry was himself a member of an elevated social class and Grant and Hepburn had already appeared in an adaptation of one of his plays, 'Holiday' which was equally adept. The play - and by definition the screenplay also - is so well constructed as to be actor-proof though that isn't necessary with actors of this calibre, not just the three leads but also Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler Roland Young et al.

She was labelled as box-office poison in the 30's, after a string of film failures. Here, she bounced back in rip-roaring style as fussy society-girl Tracey Lord. Cary Grant is on the verge of absolute stardom as C.K Dexter Haven. James Stewart won an Academy Award for his performance as Mike Connor, proving his range and place along America's finest actors.Tracey Lord is contemplating marriage for the second-time round. Her first trip down the aisle to C.K Dexter Haven ended in divorce. Two years have passed since that fiasco, and Tracey is about to marry the respectable, yet fuddy-duddy George Kitteridge. Dexter has moved on from the marriage too, and is now working for 'Spy' magazine. However, his arrival at Tracey's mansion the day before the wedding with writer Mike Connor and patient photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey, in a fine supporting performance)certainly shakes up Tracey's plans and makes her wonder whether or not she is doing the right thing after all.Hepburn is luminous as the fault-finding bride-to-be socialite. She much resembles Katherina from Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of The Shrew'- too bold, outspoken and brash for most men. Cary Grant is doing his usual suit role with a suave manner, yet he excels at it so he is a delight to watch. Perhaps James Stewart shouldn't have got the Academy Award in 1940 though. It is a great performance, yet pales in comparison to Fonda in 'Grapes Of Wrath', the man who should have won Best Actor that year. Fonda was mixed up in whispers of Communist party meetings, so politics prevailed in 1940 and Stewart won. It was also compensation for his loss the year before for his role in 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington'. Let's not worry too much about Oscars though. This film doesn't need awards to prove that it is great.This is not screwball comedy, it's more of an romantic comedy than anything else. There are numerous classic scenes- catch a drunk Hepburn and Stewart. Priceless! Also, the opening scene is justifiably one of the greats. The dialogue and comic banter is brilliant, and Mary Nash and Virginia Wielder are superb in smaller roles as Tracey's mother and little sister.It is a joy to watch Stewart and Hepburn together; one of the delights of cinema. He's bumbling, she's bold and they have surprisingly terrific chemistry! This would be the last outing for together for Grant and Hepburn, after a prolific four films together. She would soon discover a man named Spencer Tracy.One wonders about the treatment of Tracey and women in general in this piece. Before she can find happiness, she, like Katherina, must be put in her place and embarrassed. Yes, she is a bossy, dominant woman full of unnecessary sass, but why should she cop so much heckling for it? The attitudes towards women are slightly off-putting here, but ultimately Tracey finds happiness and that's what we care most about.The idea for this comic romp is said to have come from the writer's own experience with Kate Hepburn's wacky family clan. Wherever the idea came from, thank god it made it to the screen.",

Having said that, I have difficulty giving it the status of the classic that so many praise it as. It's a good romantic comedy which I found to be a little slow for the first half hour or so (with the possible exception of the opening scene) that picks up the pace nicely as it moves along. Katharine Hepburn was excellent as the somewhat tormented Tracy, who's come out of a bad first marriage to Dexter (Cary Grant), is now engaged to be married to George (John Howard) while Dexter is still hanging around, and who ultimately becomes smitten with Mike (James Stewart), a society columnist assigned to get a story about the wedding. The real question in the movie is who - if anybody - Tracy is going to end up marrying. Hepburn showed her range of talent - sometimes icy cold, at times falling down drunk and from time to time just hopelessly confused about her feelings. Stewart - who won an Oscar as Best Actor for his role - played an equally tormented character equally well. Mike (or Macauley) is a writer of short stories who accepts a job with \"Spy\" magazine (a tabloid sort of paper dealing in gossip about the rich and famous) to make ends meet. He hates his job but has to put a roof over his head. Tracy's wedding is another assignment he hates until he falls for her. Grant's role was a bit more limited, but there was absolutely nothing to fault in it. One cannot review this movie without mentioning the standout performance by Virginia Weidler as Dinah, Tracy's nosy little sister. Her performance was so good that I find it surprising she never really went very far after this. It's a very good movie, mildly funny (even a wee bit risqu\u00e9 at times, at least defined by 1940's standards.) I didn't think it reached the heights that some have assigned to it, but it's pleasant viewing, featuring a great cast working with a good story. 7/10",

Cary Grant is as charming as can be trading sarcastic barbs with Hepburn. And Hussey drops one droll throw-away line after another like a pro.Of course, the movie all comes down to Hepburn, and it's a case of absolutely perfect casting. At the nadir of her career, Hepburn made the brilliant decision to bring this stage play to the screen with herself in the lead role, cast as an untouchable snob who just wants to be loved. Movie audiences got to see her brought down a peg, and their appreciation was instantly apparent: Hepburn catapulted to the top of Hollywood royalty and never came down.Screen comedies don't get more sophisticated than this.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Released in 1940, \"The Philadelphia Story\" is about a Main Line Philadelphia woman, Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn), whose marriage is imminent. At the last moment, there are certain unexpected attendees who challenge her view of life. Listed as a comedy and a romance by IMDb, it certainly is that, but the film does contain dialogue that is biting, somber and outright mean.The cast is stellar and it is difficult to imagine how any film starring Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant could not be worth watching. This film certainly is worth watching, but I disagree with those who assert that all three actors turn in their best work here. Hepburn's performances in many other films surpasses her portrayal of Tracy, e.g. \"On Golden Pond\" or \"Stage Door.\" The same can be said of Jimmy Stewart in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", \"Rear Window\" or \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" For Cary Grant, see \"North by Northwest\", \"Notorious\", or \"His Girl Friday\" which was also released in 1940.As a love story, it has a rather complex plot--not just the usual triangle. Tracy's fianc\u00e9, George Kittredge (John Howard), is excited to wed the desirable Miss Lord, but he might be somewhat out of the loop as he keeps his distance from the bride-to-be on the last day before the nuptials. Her ex-husband, C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), is about as welcome as an unreachable itch, irritating Tracy at every turn and constantly inserting his verbal barbs. Another complication is the writer/reporter Macauley Connor (Jimmy Stewart), who arrives to do an inside story on the ceremonies for a tabloid.A broader view of the film reveals that its subject is Tracy's relationships with five men--the three just mentioned and her father and her Uncle Willie, who are personae non gratae due to their vices. Tracy discovers through these five that she has much to learn, despite her cool, confident countenance.Hepburn starred in the Broadway play not long after leaving Hollywood in response to the theater owners placing her on a \"Box Office Poison\" list. She purchased the film rights to the play, then sold them to MGM with the stipulation she could choose the producer, director and the starring actors. The success of the film must have been sweet revenge.The film has many admirers, including me. Stepping slightly off track, I will disagree with many of those admirers who assert that the musical remake named \"High Society\" is not in the same league. I do not think a remake should be judged solely in relation to the original, especially when genre lines are crossed. I find the musical to be equally engaging, but for different reasons (the music, the different stars, etc.). Both should be appreciated for their particular, fine attributes.",

The casting is probably what makes this movie great -- who could resist Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart all in one movie? Most of the supporting actors are superb, as well. Most of my kudos go to Virginia Weidler as Dinah, easily the most complex of all the characters in the film.Equally important and equally impressive, the dialog in this movie rivals The Princess Bride and others for wit and clarity.The story itself is light-hearted and fun, if you can leave your politics in your back pocket for a couple of hours. Remember, this film debuted in 1940 -- only a year after the publication of \"Alcoholics Anonymous.\" So perhaps we can forgive Dexter for blaming his drinking problem on Tracy, and forgive Tracy for accepting the blame.I have a harder time forgiving Seth Lord for blaming his infidelity on Tracy's lack of warmth. What a load of crap! Even if he was influenced by her coldness, what's wrong with Dinah's love? In the end, a spouse cheats because he/she wants to.I've watched this movie enough times to tell you everything that's wrong with it -- politically, morally, in terms of continuity, and so on.

While I wouldn't give him the oscar over Henry Fonda, it is a great performance.  Grant and Hepburn shine.

In nearly every scene one can see true artists at work. I say High Society first and as good as Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby are they do not hold a flame to Cary Grant or James Stewart. Some of the best dialog I have heard. I probably can say that about quite a few of the older films from with the same actors, but it is just so amazing how quick and sharp dialog can be. The scene with Cary Grant scolding Katherine's character in front of changing rooms was an absolutely staggering show of talent for both Grant and Hepburn. One gets to really see some vulnerability in Hepburn and I feel as if it is not all acting (or she is just that good). One cannot say enough about Stewart and the more of him I see the more and more I love him. He is one of those actors who are different from each other in some very fundamental ways but are all distinctly his. Very powerful writing that drew me in even if I have no ability to relate to the characters on any level besides the fact that they contain the flaw of being of human. I think it was kind of funny how one of my criticisms for High Society was actually done to more of my vision and that is with the little sister. The actually story was much more interesting this time around also. Overall a great movie and really shows why the greats are indeed the greats.",

With a triple A-star cast (Hepburn, Grant and Stewart), sure direction from Kate's favourite George Cukor, some terrific set decoration, pithy and occasionally daring dialogue and some fine supporting turns too, none better than Ruth Hussey as Stewart's sardonic side-kick come girl-friend, it could hardly fail.Basically a love quadrangle amidst a comedy of manners amongst the upper classes (reflecting Hepburn's own privileged but free-thinking upbringing) with just a little anti-proletarian-ism (in the form of the slightly unfairly kicked around Kitteridge as Hepburn's jilted and much maligned fianc\u00e9 - he can't even ride a horse properly for goodness sake!) and anti-paparazzi-before-its-time journalistic sentiment thrown in, the film gets off to its famous and hilarious start as Grant \"socks\" Hepburn when she signifies the end of their brief and obviously turbulent marriage by breaking his cherished golf clubs and rolls along merrily until the equally well-known ending with the surprise frozen snap-shot of the hastily arranged re-marriage between Grant and Hepburn.I could quibble about a number of things, for instance Hepburn, while she was never lovelier, does occasionally grate with that voice and those mannerisms (plus you get tired of everyone telling her how wonderful she is), you could argue that Grant and Stewart might have successfully swapped parts - although Stewart makes for a surprisingly convincing drunk and as hinted earlier the socialist in me does take a little exception to the glorification of the high and mighty of Hepburn and her hardly spotless family (aptly named the Lords) above the persevering up-from-below Kitteridge. And yes, the film does often betray its stage roots with a little too much dialogue and sometimes static viewpoint. But in the end, I'm glad to say I was as easily won over as Hepburn was by Grant - no contest really.",

The most important thing however is, that the film never forgets that the characters are what makes a great movie. It doesn't sell their character's development for a few cheap laughs, but lets the dialogue and the actors take care for amusement. Outstanding in this movie is Katherine Hepburn.

            "content": "Prior to the release of The Philadelphia Story, Katherine Hepburn had a string of failures (including the classic 1938 screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby) that labeled Hepburn as box office poison. In order to get rid of the career-ruining label, she decided to get to work on her own film. In 1939, she was starring in a very popular Broadway show from Philip Barry. She convinced MGM to buy the rights with her having control on everyone who was brought into the cast and crew. She chose George Cukor to direct this film whom she worked with before and David Odgen Stewart who was a friend of Barry's and had experience turning plays into movies. For the cast, she chose Cary Grant and James Stewart as her main co-stars. She worked with Grant previously three times (including the aforementioned Bringing Up Baby). Taking control of the production was a very smart business move for Hepburn. In addition to this romantic farce being the fifth highest box office hit of 1941, the quality of the film is very good. George Cukor directed the heck out of the film by getting top-notch performances from his entire cast, had perfectly-timed scenes with perfectly-timed jokes, and so on. Stewart's screenplay is a masterpiece (for its time) thanks to the sharp, witty dialogue. The fantastic acting is also on display. I complained about Hepburn's performance in her 1938 film, Bringing Up Baby. It was clear that she was new to comedy and she wasn't really that funny. Boy, do several years make a difference! She was fantastic here as she delivered her witty dialogue with ease and she made me chortle many times. Cary Grant does Cary Grant things here so it is no surprise he turns out another fantastic performance. James Stewart reportedly was hesitant during filming about doing several scenes, but he really comes up big here. He received his only Academy Award with his portrayal in this movie. Two Philadelphia socialites, Dexter (Cary Grant) and Tracy (Katherine Hepburn) were lifelong acquaintances who ended up marrying each other. But that marriage did not last long due to Tracy's icy cold mannerisms towards Dexter which may have turned him into an alcoholic. Two years after the stormy end to the marriage, Tracy is getting married to a politician, George Kittredge (John Howard) who seemingly has an ordinary and rather boring personality. Meanwhile, Dexter was living in South America working for a tabloid named Spy. On the day of the wedding, Dexter shows up unexpected with two reporters from the magazine, Mike Connor (James Stewart) and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hassey). Tracy quickly sees the ruse and Dexter tries to convince her that it is best for the family if this happens as their publisher is planning on running a damaging story about Tracy's father. From there, a bunch of well-timed comedy happens!As much as I enjoyed and I laughed while watching The Philadelphia Story, I could not help thinking about how much times changed. The film came out in December 1940, and obviously morals were different back then. Way different. One of the messages I have noticed is that despite the shortcomings of men and the trouble they put people through, it is up to the women to delicately handle the events. I got the sense that the film believes that it is okay for women to be pushovers. It easily stood out considering in today's world, women are very strong and equal to men in every single way as it should be. I know times were different, but I was rubbed the wrong way just a little bit. On that note, I really enjoyed The Philadelphia Story. The movie is very funny and wacky, the performances are top-notch especially those from Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart. This is the movie that threw Hepburn's label as box office poison in the trash. I definitely give this film a recommendation, especially if you are in the mood for some wacky hijinks. My Grade: B+",

A bit too talky, but the dialog is often witty, with Hussey delivering some of the best lines. The script tries to send a message about class and therein lies the problem.

Although it would be unfair to say that the talent makes this film, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart are far and away its best feature.\"Philadelphia Story\"\" was adapted from the stage production of the same name by Philip Barry. The play was written with the intention of reviving Hepburn's stage career. It was brought to the screen with the help of Hepburn's boyfriend Howard Hughes who purchased the rights for her as a gift.Full of fast-talking highbrow humor, the material is unquestionably aimed at an upper-class audience, but not only in terms of taste, but also thematically. Created during the latter half of the Great Depression, \"Philadelphia Story\" makes the statement that class is insignificant, that it's a non-existent social framework that purports itself as an indication of character. We obsess over class, something that couldn't have been more true during the depression, and it's a theme all the more impressive considering the film's popularity and story of celebrity gossip and intrigue.Hepburn stars as rich socialite Tracy Lord, who is about to marry working-class hero George Kittredge (John Howard), only her wealthy ex-husband, the wealthy and fantastically-named C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) plans on spoiling the big day by sneaking in a tabloid writer (Stewart) and photographer (Ruth Hussey). The jig is up pretty quickly, but not without making things dreadfully difficult on Tracy.Stewart might have won the Oscar, but this is Hepburn's film. I'd agree with what Stewart once said: that the statuette was \"deferred payment\" for losing out in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" an undeniably superior role. Hepburn should have seen the glory for this film for her magnetizing and moving performance. Whether its her distinct and powerful voice or her variety of facial expressions, she's got us tied on a string and she just plays with us throughout the ups and downs of her character. Tracy is not unlike Hepburn herself as a major public figure that feels worshipped more than truly loved or appreciated.Stewart and Grant, however, deserve their due. Stewart pilots the best scene of the film when he pays a drunken visit to C.K.'s place late at night. Grant works his charms in a more subdued way as C.K. is more the subtle mastermind than the flashy performer of his schemes. Also worthy of mention is the dry and snide humor of Hussey's character. She adds a really nice touch to the cast and keeps it balanced.Although a bit sharper, more sophisticated and dialogue-heavy than most romantic comedies, \"Philadelphia Story\" is still a classic and it makes its class argument through those weaknesses in ways, making it a terrific film. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",

But I often find it harder to write positive reviews than negative; when you don't like a movie, there are specific things you don't like that you can talk about, but when every aspect of a film is great, what is there to say? This is such a film: every aspect is great.Still, I happened to read some of the negative reviews here (not that there are many) and felt motivated to put my own two cents in on the positive side. Overrated? Not by a long shot. Everything receiving effusive praise deserves it: the sparkling, witty dialogue, the wonderful performances, the chemistry between the stars, the significant contributions from the supporting cast, it's all there. Dated? If you're complaining that the movie is dated, that's more a comment about *you* than the film.

I'm usually the guy who gets on here to write negative reviews of highly rated films which I found overrated (in fact, I'm getting ready to write one for The Bicycle Thief, which I just saw). But The Philadelphia Story doesn't merit such treatment. It's delightful and fun and funny and a deserved classic. The point was driven home to me forcefully some years ago when I got around to seeing High Society, the musical remake of The Philadelphia Story. Having loved Philadelphia Story, I had high expectations for High Society, yet I found it limp, tepid, and very disappointing, a pale imitation indeed. At the film's conclusion, I found myself wondering if I was misremembering how good the original was, so, even though it was late, I decided to pop The Philadelphia Story into the VCR and just watch a little of it, just to compare.I ended up watching the whole thing, late into the night, unable to turn it off.

But overall it, unfortunately, isn't a good, fun-to-watch movie, and it took me three sessions to get through it. Its most obvious drawback is that it wasn't so much \"adopted\" from the stage play, but that it is merely a stage play that was filmed, and with as few takes as possible, on \"real\" locations. Consequently there are long \"talking heads\" scenes, and we are forced to witness James Stewart hammily play a funny drunk for about half of the movie. The movie also deals with dated issues such as marriage across class lines (which it advises against), and the importance of women behaving demurely to their husbands and fathers, so as to not force the latter into accosting young dancers.In a nutshell, an interesting movie that will appeal to the boffin and the completist, but not really a must-watch classic.",

There are some dated aspects of the Battle of the Sexes attitudes of the period but considering all that, this was still an entertaining comedy. Katharine Hepburn is aces in the role she was a hit in on Broadway and this was her great comeback film after years of being labeled Box Office Poison. Cary Grant, in his fourth and final teaming with Ms. Hepburn, is as suave as ever. And then there's Mr. Jimmy Stewart who's only Oscar was for this very role. He lost the previous year for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and he always considered his win here as make-up for that. While I agree his performance in the former was better, he's quite funny here so I can see why he might have been the victor though I've yet to watch the other Best Actor nominees from that year.

It's also the perfect Katharine Hepburn vehicle, and certified her position as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The entire cast and crew are simply spectacular, with Ms. Hepburn and director George Cukor likely most responsible (and deserving of \"Best Actress\" and \"Best Director\" attention).

            "content": "George Cukor's acclaimed film, The Philadelphia Story, is successful for its relevance in challenging gender roles and its portrayal of the social class polarization coming out of the Great Depression. Artistically, the film contains an ingenious storyline and notable elements of audio such as dialogue and music that make the movie prominent in its age and beyond.The harsh years of the Great Depression delayed the continuation of women's rights after the Suffragette Movement in the early 19th century. During those years, the progress that had been made in the previous decade was set aside to focus on the economic depression that affected every family in America. Meaning, in order to provide jobs to as many people as possible, only one breadwinner was allowed per family. With that method, theoretically, every family would have at least one income source; thus, men were preferred over women for the task, and, in the process, revived the Cult of Domesticity. However, The Philadelphia Story challenges this perspective. The film portrayed Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) as an independent and headstrong woman-not very common during the Great Depression years. The film is classified as a \"screwball comedy,\" which meant that the central character would likely be a woman and challenge a man's masculinity. For instance, the film contains undertones of masculinity and examples of society's patriarchal thinking seen in moments such as the beginning of the movie where C. K. Dexter (Cary Grant) pushes Tracy to the ground, or when the characters around Tracy criticize her lack of sentiment and empathy towards others while, at the same time, objectifying her as someone who needs to be venerated-a \"goddess.\" Yet, Tracy's arc is seen throughout the movie, and she is, in the end, able to prevail and grow as a woman.Furthermore, the developments of the economic depression contributed to a polarization of classes in society. When juxtaposed, the economic depression provoked a sudden and radical transition from the riches of the Roaring 20s to the penniless years of the Great Depression. In turn, it allowed for economic classes to separate, which caused a sense of resentment towards the other. In the film, it is clear-in the beginning-that the Lord family is not too fond of the lower-class, as it is seen with the family's behavior towards the reporters; in the same way, the reporters-especially Macaulay Connor (James Stewart)-show some animosity towards the high class family. This contrast mirrors the deep resentment held by people at both ends of the spectrum and the two completely opposite worlds that must coexist in society. However, it can be argued that, as the film progresses, Tracy and Connor's relationship contradicts this societal separation. The characters are able to strip away prejudices and society's image of them in order to see the human core of their beings. They become infatuated with one another even when they come from different worlds; nevertheless, the characters do not end up together and find someone who is in their class. So, really, the characters were never \"meant to be,\" for they were from different worlds that could not merge. Also, the movie even criticizes the social climbing class that resulted from the Great Depression. Tracy's fianc\u00e9, George Kittrige (John Howard), is often criticized in the film as someone who is not worthy of Tracy, the family's status, and someone who does not belong in the high class environment because he is a \"social climber.\" This trend was prominent in the 1930s and 1940s. New opportunities were opening in the workplace and some were lucky and smart enough to take advantage of the economic situation for their gain. The film portrays the social dilemmas of 1930s - 40s America through the relationships of the characters and their behaviors and judgements of one another.On another note, artistically speaking, the film has memorable filmmaking elements. Apart from acting, the film is most notable for its distinguished story-telling-both on screen and its creation process. Originally, The Philadelphia Story was a stage production that had a successful run on Broadway. In its creation, the playwright, Philip Barry, had very specific criteria that needed to fit into the story, and he personally contacted Katharine Hepburn to be involved in its production. Even when declared \"box office poison,\" Hepurn had remained a renowned actress known for her talent and independent personality. Barry and Hepburn worked closely to create the script (for the play and the film) that shaped each of the characters-especially that of Tracy. In turn, the film had a strong storyline and screenplay that fitted both the actors and characters perfectly. As a screwball comedy, The Philadelphia Story exceptionally illustrates the form of social satire that the genre is known for. It is considered one of the best comedies of all time (AFI)-the \"quintessential remarriage comedy film\" (Brattle Theatre Film Notes). Additionally, the use of audio elements such as dialogue and music further enhance the film's tone and message. The dialogue is cleverly structured and delivered to create a complex plot. The script was meticulously created to the point where every line that is delivered propels the plot in some way. Being originally meant for theatre, the actors' dialogue delivery gives the film more dimensions in terms of subtext and context or the story. Also, the film uses music specifically to intensify the conflict and tones of a scene. For example, there is a scene where Tracy and Connor are talking to each other after a long night of drinking and dancing where they confess their infatuation with one another. In that scene, music is used in harmony with the dialogue, which reflects the intensity of their feelings and what they are saying to each other. Music is an aid to the film to highlight the tone of a scene based upon the dialogue. So, elements of audio-dialogue and music-are scrupulously composed to deliver, in the most effective way, tone and message of the story or scene.The Philadelphia Story successfully reflects historical trends of the 1930s and 1940s and provides an excellent and complex storyline with clever uses of music and dialogue, which adds layers and value to the film.",

I have never been the greatest fan of these sort of movies, although there are some exceptions. I guess this movie is a sort of exception, since I still enjoyed and liked watching it.The movie doesn't have the most accessible story and is multiple layered and filled with some deeper meanings. This certainly is no formulaic movie. It makes the movie unique (perhaps the main reason why it's regarded as a classic) but not always easy to follow. The movie however always remains interesting, mainly because of the reason that it's no formulaic one and therefor also mostly unpredictable.But really the thing that makes the story and its characters work are its actors. The movie has a great all-star cast, with Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, Cary Grant and Ruth Hussey. Some great Oscar winning and multiple nominated actors in this movie. They all give a fine performance and lift the movie to an amazingly high level.The Oscar winning story is well constructed and features some great dialog. It makes the movie movie original and unpredictable as well as fun and entertaining, although this movie is not really my idea of a great romantic comedy. The movie is professionally directed by George Cukor, who leaves it up mostly to the actors to tell the movie its story.A delightful unique movie with some great sequences, that provides more than enough reasons why this movie is a perfectly watchable one to all.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Well, here we have a vastly overrated film starring vastly overrated actors.The hype over this film is really something. How is this film, compared to any other screwball comedy, 'refreshing' and 'modern'? Because it stars Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, who are probably just about the two most overrated actors of the Golden Age? I didn't find any of the dialogue witty or refreshing. Either viewing of this film. I didn't like it the first time that I watched it, and I despise it now that I've seen it again. James Stewart is alright, but also fairly overrated. Ruth Hussey (as the sidekick to Stewart) is perhaps the only watchable character in this film.The plot has been borrowed for a lot of other films: Katharine Hepburn's character was married to Cary Grant's character. They didn't get along well, as it's implied that she was egotistical and cared only about herself, and he was an alcoholic (who may have abused her, if this were Pre-Code they would have shown that part). The opening scene of the film is pure slapstick, and it only goes downhill from there.It is now two years later, and Hepburn's character is getting married again. Cary Grant's character is kind 9f a nuisance, and he bothers her (which she doesn't like, and which is supposed to be funny- you know, that witty repartee kind of thing). Add to the mix James Stewart and Ruth Hussey, who are photographers come to take pictures of Katharine Hepburn's character's wedding. Katharine Hepburn flirts with James Stewart. He tries to impress her. And so on. Cary Grant flirts with Katharine Hepburn. The poor guy who she's supposed to be marrying is kind of just there.This film was remade as High Society in 1956, which I enjoyed more but-- I can admit that this film is better. The Tracy Lord character (Katharine Hepburn in the original, Grace Kelly in the remake) was written for Hepburn, as she played it on stage- so she does a better job. Perhaps Hepburn was the better actress, but it's not that hard to be a better actress than Grace Kelly. (I don't like the way you guys over there are looking at me, we're all allowed our opinions)It's very hard to praise the 'talent' of Katharine Hepburn. If she was such a good actress, how in a fifty-year career did she go from playing spinster-esque young women.... to spinsters? This movie is no exception to her typecasting, but I will admit that she plays the role with slightly more ... well.. I can't write that word here. She's not the good guy in this one. Or is she? Cary Grant just plays himself, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Here it really doesn't. Like I said before, I tried to like this film. I have a soft spot for screwball comedy, and Bringing Up Baby is one of my favourite films. But this one is vastly inferior to the wit and sparkle of BUB.Another flaw of this film is that it's too long. Typical screwball comedy films are about an hour and twenty minutes to just over an hour and forty. This one is almost two hours, and they squeeze every last drop of plot out of the poor film. They add gaga after gag, and they fall flatter and flatter each time. The other good part of this film, other than the beginning, was when James Stewart and Kate Hepburn were drunk and no one could find them and then they found them and he was singing 'Over The Rainbow' off-key.Edit: (Gaah! Pitchforks!) Look, I'm sorry I don't like this film. But I tried to like it- I watched it twice. Maybe it was the second viewing that made me dislike it.",

            "content": "Directed by George Cukor, \"The Philadelphia Story\" is quite an upper-class comedy featuring three heavyweight stars: Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. Based on a stage play by Philip Barry (who created the role of Tracy Samantha Lord with Hepburn in mind), this film is essentially Hepburn's vehicle, but Grant wouldn't do the picture unless his name appeared first in the credits. Stewart, conversely, did not care where his name appeared; the most important thing to him was that he was working with two movie star giants like Hepburn and Grant. Actually, Hepburn had recently been given the worst of all Hollywood labels - \"box-office poison\"; she credited her role of Tracy Lord as having revived her movie career. But for all of its glamour, sophistication, wit, and the presence of three major stars, I personally find \"The Philadelphia Story\" to be a rather boring picture. (Of course, this is only my opinion; I'm not asking anybody to agree with me.) Stewart, in fact, won his only Oscar for his performance in this film, yet he claimed he never thought much of it; it is believed that he actually won the Oscar as compensation for having NOT won it for his superlative performance in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939).In spite of my negative feelings about \"The Philadelphia Story\" as a whole, it does manage to have its share of memorable sequences. At the Spy Magazine headquarters, the overly-cynical reporter Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor (Stewart) and the annoyingly sharp-tongued photographer Elizabeth \"Liz\" Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) voice their displeasure at editor Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell) for his assigning them to cover Tracy's upcoming swanky wedding. Tracy's much younger sister Dinah (Virginia Weidler), who is one of the most irritating characters in the piece, nevertheless manages to shine with her rendition of a song attributed to Groucho Marx: \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady.\" Mike croons \"Over the Rainbow\" as he carries the inebriated Tracy from her pool. The very first scene in the picture shows Tracy's former husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) leaving her mansion in disgust; Tracy dramatically strolls out carrying Dexter's golf clubs and breaks one of them, and the music score of Franz Waxman greatly accentuates these proceedings. Jimmy Stewart's best scenes in this picture, aside from Mike Connor's aforementioned scene at the Spy Magazine headquarters, include his drunk scene while seated at a table with a sober Dexter, as well as his highly romantic \"hearth fires and holocausts\" speech to Tracy. Cary Grant best displays his usual smooth charm in this film when his Dexter character chats with Tracy beside her pool, and earlier, when he makes his first return to the Lord mansion, much to Dinah's pleasant surprise and Tracy's increasing fury.Boring or not, \"The Philadelphia Story\" turned out to be one of the most successful comedies ever to come out of Hollywood. Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie ultimately learn not to thumb their noses at high society, and Tracy Lord ultimately learns to curb her sense of inner divinity and to have more of a sympathetic heart for other people's failings. In closing, I would like to repeat what film historian Robert Osborne once remarked about Tracy's wedding: \"Formal attire is, of course, optional.\"",

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story is pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be. The film features three of old-time Hollywood's most famous stars, each of whom falls comfortably into the type of role you would expect of them. Katharine Hepburn has the central role, that of upper-class Philadelphia socialite Tracy Lord who is about to be married. But this is not Tracy's first go at marriage. Cary Grant plays her first husband C. K. Dexter Haven whom Tracy divorced maybe because he had a drinking problem, maybe because she felt he just wasn't good enough for her. Is any man good enough for this ice queen? Certainly a tabloid reporter would never measure up to her high standards. But when reporter Mike Connor is, much to his dismay, assigned to cover Tracy's wedding he ends up getting himself rather more involved in the proceedings than he could have imagined. James Stewart plays Connor, completing our triumvirate of movie star royalty. A few other performers have their moments, most notably Ruth Hussey who plays a photographer who also happens to be Connor's love interest. But for pretty much the entirety of the film's running time the focus is on the characters portrayed by Hepburn, Grant and Stewart. It is up to this trio to carry the picture and they are of course more than capable of doing just that.When first husband C.K. Dexter Haven shows up at the Lord home just before Tracy is about to be married again you know complications will inevitably ensue. The fact that he has brought along a reporter and photographer who he has smuggled into the home under false pretense certainly won't help matters. Tracy sees through that ruse almost immediately and this very private woman certainly is not keen on the idea of having her wedding splashed across the pages of some tabloid. But circumstances dictate that she has no choice but to allow it in order to protect the reputation of her family. Reputation is everything in her world. However as events play out she may begin to look at life, and at herself, a little differently. This queen of high society may be in for a good bit of humbling.The film is fairly predictable, rather formulaic. But, thanks largely to the performances of the three stars, the film is always engaging and ultimately rather charming. There is plenty of snappy, witty dialogue. There are moments of great humor and some very serious, heartfelt moments as well. Grant is just as suave and debonair as you would always expect Cary Grant to be. Stewart is more of an everyman and he infuses Mike Connor with a lighter touch that works perfectly. And Hepburn is essentially flawless as her character evolves, tearing down the walls she has placed up around herself and, maybe for the first time in her life, following her heart. It's hard to imagine anyone but Hepburn in the role. She can play cold and detached, she can play warm and loving. As this film plays out she gets to do both. There may not be much inherent drama in the plot as it's rather obvious all along where all this is headed. And as presented there's nothing very cinematic about the film. The story was originally a stage play and that's pretty much the look of the picture, a stage play that someone happened to film. Some of the material may seem dated, perhaps the film as a whole doesn't play quite as well all these years later. But all in all it's still an enjoyable film, undeniably elevated by the performances of its three great stars. It may not be right at the top of the list of all-time classic films but it is certainly worth seeing and worthy of being remembered as fondly as it seems to be.",

            "content": "Although a bit overrated, The Philadelphia Story is a solid comedy presented by three major stars; Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. Any one of these three could easily hold a film up by themselves. The dialogue is crisp and the direction is impeccable by George Cukor, who excelled at these types of screwball comedies. This one is not perfect, but it is watchable, despite the stagey acting by Hepburn. Why men would fight over the angular Hepburn is beyond my comprehension, as I found her personality to be repulsive. However, since the dialogue is very funny, it overcomes this deficiency as well. Enjoy the highly unlikely events.",

            "content": "As I've said before, comedy is a difficult topic to put on film; one person's hilarity could just as easily be banality for another. I'm not qualified to suggest why that is so, but I do know this: most people respond to witty words and double entendre. And this film has both, in spades (and was awarded the Oscar for Best Screenplay).Add to that the very capable and radiant Katherine Hepburn \u0096 one of Hollywood's true greats \u0096 Cary Grant, James Stewart and Ruth Hussy, you can then be assured of a slick production, fine acting (Jimmy Stewart got Best Actor Award) and a very pleasurable 112 minutes. And, the re-mastered DVD that I watched was perfect.The film was adapted from a stage play and that is obvious: many of the set scenes look just as though you're sitting in a live theatre, and I think that has a very positive effect for the viewer. For example, the musical version (High Society 1956) doesn't quite have that same look about it, as a stage production; moreover, the screenplay of that movie just doesn't match this 1940 release. I laughed much more during the latter.So, what's the story all about? Rich people, snobs, the excesses of wealth, marriage, divorce, love, honour, honesty, and... what it means to know yourself. The last item refers mostly to Tracey 'Red' Lord (Katherine Hepburn), the flighty, gay and free-spirited (seemingly) daughter of a filthy rich banker. On her wedding day, she's furious that her ex-husband, Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) has turned up, with a couple of (maybe) low-life reporters from Spy magazine, to spoil her marriage to her very safe, very dull and very dreary new husband-to-be, George Kittredge (John Howard).How that plays out, and how Tracey find herself and true love by the end of the movie, is a sheer delight: the dialog is fast, witty, loud and complex \u0096 so you have to listen carefully all the time. Although, watch for some of the sight gags by Jimmy Stewart and his facial expressions; no wonder he received the Oscar (and for a comedy too!). But, the concentration is worth it and, fortunately, there are quieter moments whereby you, and the actors, can catch their thoughts and breath. At times, the whole production has a sense of a British farce, the type that those Brits are so good at. But, it's all American (by this time, Cary Grant was an American citizen) and just as good, if not better.If you liked High Society, you'll love this one. Highly recommended.",

The scenario is quite interesting, and the script makes excellent use of all the possibilities, but most of all it is the terrific cast that makes it such a fine and memorable film.  You could not ask for better performers (or better casting) than to have Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart as the three lead characters.  Not only are they all ideal in their own roles, but they also make a wonderful combination in their scenes together.  Plenty of credit also goes to the supporting cast, which is very good in its own right, and their characters get some good moments, too.The story takes the familiar situation of a woman pursued by suitors both past and present, and adds in some creative details, plus the background of an eccentric family, to make it rise far above the banal level where so many movies of this kind stay.  It moves at a pleasant pace, with many good scenes.  While there are no big surprises, it features enough quirky developments to keep from becoming predictable, and it's quite satisfying once everything is resolved.

            "content": "Katharine Hepburn possessed two qualities which made her a star; the first was her unique New England borough and mannerisms that simply wreak of hauty excellence; the other quality is guts. After winning an Oscar for \"Morning Glory\" Kate the great was branded box office poison - a moniker that destroyed many a starlet's chances from hitting the big time again. But not Kate. Undaunted by Hollywood's snub, she commissioned long time friend and play Philip Barry to pen the Broadway smash \"The Philadelphia Story\" for her to star in, and then, purchased the film rights herself. Hence, when MGM decided that it wanted to make a film of the play, they had no choice but to consider Ms. Hepburn's terms first. These were, in fact, quite simple. Cast Ms. Hepburn in the lead; as spoiled socialite, Tracy Lord, and give her casting approval. The idea of relinquishing control to a then has-been actress must have really burned L.B. Mayer. However, he must have had nothing but smiles and praise for Kate when the film version of \"The Philadelphia Story\"(1940) became one of MGM's biggest money makers.The plot concerns Tracy's pending rebound marriage to George Kittredge (John Howard) a weak man who cannot hope to match Tracy's fiery temperament. That's perhaps the reason why Tracy has taken to him so. You see, Tracy's previous marriage to C.K Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), a man her equal in every way, ended badly. He actually knocked her to the ground with his fist. But times have changed. Dexter's changed. And he's realized that he's still carrying a torch for his ex. Fast forward to the weekend before the wedding; a family scandal involving Tracy's estranged father, Seth (John Halliday), and the wiley machinations of her uncle, Willie (Roland Young) lead to Tracy's acceptance of a couple of tabloid journalists, Mike Connor (James Stewart) and Liz Embrie (Ruth Hussey) to cover her pending nuptuals. But the plot is about to thicken in an unexpected way when Tracy decides to go after Mike on a drunken binge and midnight swim. So how does it all end...brilliantly and with much fanfare, pomp and hilarity. \"The Philadelphia Story\" was so enormously successful that MGM decided to make it into a musical a decade later - and to exceptionally good effect - with Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra. As \"High Society\" it once again became the biggest and brightest money maker of the year.Warner's 2-disc special edition of this vintage comedy is a welcomed treat. The black and white image has been impeccably mastered from very clean film elements. Contrast levels are superb. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. Aside from the commentary track by Jeannine Basinger, disc 2 of this DVD contains two feature length documentaries; one on George Cukor, the other on Katharine Hepburn. There's also a couple of vintage short subjects and a gallery of trailers from other Cukor films and an audio only radio broadcast. Very nice. Bottom line: \"The Philadelphia Story\" is a rare cinematic delight and this new DVD sparkles as only a few films of this vintage have. The good people at Warner Brothers deserve another pat on the back for their formidable efforts.",

            "content": "THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1940), directed by George Cukor, is not a documentary about the largest city in the state of Pennsylvania, but a sophisticated comedy based on the 1939 stage play by Philip Barry as produced by the Theater Guild starring Katharine Hepburn, Joseph Cotten, Van Heflin and Shirley Booth. Due to Hepburn's stage success, the screen adaptation marked her return to the screen following her two 1938 releases of BRINGING UP BABY (RKO Radio) and HOLIDAY (Columbia), each co-starring Cary Grant. As much as many star performers around 1937-38 as Marlene Dietrich or Joan Crawford were labeled \"box-office poison\" due to mediocre film assignments, many have restored their careers with successful comebacks in 1939. Hepburn's comeback took place a year later, earning her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. Teamed opposite for the fourth and final time opposite Cary Grant, it also marked Hepburn's MGM debut as well as her only performance opposite James Stewart.Plot summary: Two years after her marriage break-up to C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), debutante Tracy Samantha Lord (Katharine Hepburn) goes through the motions of her upcoming wedding plans to George Kitteredge (John Howard), an oil company general manager. Because Dexter feels Kitteredge all wrong for Tracy, he arranges for Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell), society editor and publisher of Spy Magazine, to hire writer, Macaulay Connor (James Stewart), and his assistant photographer, Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) to cover the society wedding of Tracy Lord titled \"The Philadelphia Story.\" Dexter's arrangements in getting Connor (who would rather follow his dream in short story writing than working on this assignment) and Elizabeth (who secretly loves Connor) inside the unapproachable Lord manor by passing them off as good friends of Tracy's (unseen) brother, Junius. Problems emerge by the arrival of the uninvited Tracy's ex-husband and his reporting guests; the arrival of her uninvited philandering father (John Halliday) and other unforeseen events that occur the night before the wedding event. Also in the cast are: Roland Young (Uncle Willie); Mary Nash (Margaret Lord, Tracy's mother); Virginia Weidler (Dinah, Tracy's younger sister); and Rex Evans (Thomas, the Butler).Though THE PHILADELPHIA STORY starts like a screwball comedy, the formatted material that follows becomes basically a re-filmed stage play with limited underscoring. With few scenes set outside the estate, comedy is performed verbally rather than though chases and slapstick actions during its 112 minutes. Hepburn is reinvented here, sporting longer headdress to fit in her Tracy Lord character. Her dramatic moment comes when her seriously-minded father (John Halliday), a philanderer noted for his involvement with Tina Mora, a dancer in New York, saying how Tracy has everything but \"an understanding heart,\" which hurts her deeply. Roland Young offers fine amusements as a womanizing uncle, but there's not enough of him to go around for some big laughs. Virginia Weidler as the eavesdropping younger sister, sings her piano playing rendition of \"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady\" (introduced by Groucho Marx in AT THE CIRCUS (1939)). Cary Grant, who addresses his on-screen ex-wife simply as \"Red\" (for her hair color), assumes top-billing over Hepburn, yet it's the third-billed James Stewart, who not only gets more screen time than Grant, but wins an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his supporting performance.Personally, I never really understood Stewart's Academy Award win for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Henry Fonda's performance in THE GRAPES OF WRATH (20th Century-Fox, 1940) was much more deserving. Other than Stewart going through his usual motions, his drunken scene opposite Dexter (Grant) or expressing his love for Tracy (Hepburn), being highlights, there are much better roles in Stewart's filmography that are more Academy Award worthy (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946); or SHENANDOAH (1965), as prime examples). If the Academy wanted to nominate Stewart in 1940 to amend their oversight for his MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (Columbia, 1939) nomination, maybe his more standard role in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (MGM, 1940) opposite Margaret Sullavan, would have been a better choice. Ruth Hussey's Best Supporting Actress nomination was acceptable, but lost to Jane Darwell for THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Interestingly, another Stewart (Donald Ogden Stewart), became the only other nomination win here for his Best Original Screenplay category.Remade by MGM as HIGH SOCIETY (1956) featuring Bing Crosby (Dexter); Grace Kelly (Tracy); Frank Sinatra (Macauley Connor); Celeste Holm (Elizabeth) and John Lund (George), produced in lavish Technicolor with Cole Porter songs, both versions proved popular due to its frequent revivals and star quality value. While HIGH SOCIETY was a successful remake as the original had been a decade earlier, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY resumes its popularity over the years through home video, DVD and many revivals on cable television's Turner Classic Movies.

It is about the last in the runaway-heiress cycle, the only difference being that she is running away while still at home, and all she is running away from is her perfectly nice ex-hubby next door. Can you bear it? Barry wisely keeps Kate off-screen for 12 minutes, or 20, or however long it may be, so that all the other characters can tell us how wonderful she is first, and all she has to do is walk on: cue applause. Probably works on Broadway. In the movie once she appears all residual interest in the film basically evaporates. Impossible to imagine any two grown men fighting over her, or even one. Grant as one of them has a good scene with Stewart as the other that is more or less irrelevant to the actual plot, which includes the preposterous notion that she wants her father to masquerade as her uncle, and for some reason everybody goes along with it.

And although these aforementioned qualities may not be immediately associated with 'entertaining' by most people, in the hands of the spirited George Cukor the film comes strangely and uncontainably alive (and stays that way until the very end). It's as if it rises from the remnants of the traditionalistic Hollywood romance films of the 1930s, and takes on a little spite, a great deal of confidence, and a sense of moral ambiguity in the process. Donald Ogden Stewart's script is brilliantly adapted from Phillip Barry's play, but it's equally as much the interplay and unique chemistry between the three lead stars which creates the wonderful effect; Grant's confidence and offish glances, Hepburn's style and progressive feminism, and Stewart's delicate youthful arrogance.",

            "content": "\"The Philadelphia Story\" is widely considered one of the best romantic comedies of all time. In it, a socialite's ex-husband shows up days before her wedding with a couple of tabloid journalists in tow. Naturally, she's none too pleased with this development but she must co-operate in order to protect the reputation of her philandering father. As a result of this unwelcome intrusion, her wedding plans are thrown into disarray, particularly since she soon has three men vying for her affection.The Oscar-winning script has a depth atypical of romantic comedies and relies more upon its sharp, witty tone than in creating farcical situations. I'll admit that the plot seemed a bit unfocused to me the first time I watched the movie but on a second viewing I was able to appreciate some of the film's nuances that I'd missed the first time around, such as Cary Grant's telling body language.The performances of Grant and others bring the script to vivid life. Considering that the part of Tracy Lord was written specifically for Katherine Hepburn it's unsurprising that she excelled in the role. She landed a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her efforts while James Stewart outdid her by actually bringing home an Oscar (his only Oscar, as it turned out). Meanwhile, Cary Grant lent his considerable charm to the character of C.K. Dexter Haven, a suave scoundrel getting a kick out of pushing his ex-wife's buttons. The supporting cast also deserves praise, especially Ruth Hussey (another Oscar nominee) & Roland Young.Direction, scoring and other technical aspects were all capably handled but are otherwise not worth commenting on.Overall, I'd say that this is a film that deserves its reputation as one of the best romantic comedies of all time. While the presentation isn't particularly distinguished, the sharp script and charismatic performances make the film well worth watching.",

There are plenty of moments of hilarity that still work for modern audiences, but perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film is the insight it gives into the attitudes of American society at the time. Examining issues of class and privilege, through the triangular romance between Hepburn's haughty aristo, Grant's rich playboy and Stewart's low-born but poetic magazine hack, the story twists and turns between Hepburn's realisation of her own failings and the other stars' growing awareness of her qualities. The class divide in US society influences just about every scene. With all the lead actors playing to familiar types (Grant the wide boy, Stewart the stammering romantic, Hepburn the dignified snob), the story itself is fairly predictable, until the last moment when the tables are turned in a manner which would probably be very surprising in a modern romcom; the characters' motivations do not seem to be pointing the way they end up at all, although perhaps contemporary audiences would have had more sympathy for some characters than for others, and it's all great fun. On the whole it's a funny, sophisticated comedy of interest to more than romance fans alone. Class",

            "content": "In 1940, The Philadelphia Story was released and Katharine Hepburn's fate was sealed. She was now always and forever a movie star, eventually to be named the greatest of all actresses by the American Film Institute. Unfortunately, prior to this she had been dubbed \"box-office poison\" by a number of producers given her previous track record. Among those movies were Bringing Up Baby and Holiday, both also with Cary Grant. However, those were more silly and less serious roles as she was attempting to win over Grant in a screwball and romantic comedy.The Philadelphia Story hardly seems like a romantic comedy at all, although it is just that. It is a wicked battle of wits taken from Phillip Barry's play, which was written for Hepburn especially. From this material, she creates one of her greatest screen characters in Tracy Lord, daughter of the rich and high-powered Lord family who has such high standards for herself and others, refusing to tolerate any little bit of uncouth or humane behavior. She gets a jolt from her first husband, the suave but somewhat childish CK Dexter Haven. Grant uses this role to wear some dashingly handsome suits as well as counter Tracy's serious talk with her fianc\u00e9 (John Howard) with funny yet poignant statements. It is clear he still loves her, but it will take more than poking fun at her to make her come around.Uninvited but allowed via blackmail, James Stewart and Ruth Hussey turn up as a reporter and photographer for a celebrity magazine getting all the scoop prior to the big day as well as unintentionally getting mixed up amongst these high-class human beings. All plot points aside, this film reigns supreme as one of the best romantic comedies ever made perhaps because there is very little forced humor. Many of the jokes and gags are quite subtle, sarcastic jabs at each other delivered with a touch of love and affection. This speaks highly of the cast, a director's dream which consists of the supreme Hepburn, the suave Grant and the cynical but romantic Stewart. Hussey is beautiful and sardonic, which always mix well in my opinion.George Cukor was a director of lavish taste, which is obvious from nearly all of his films which have immaculate art direction and crisp, clean cinematography. He also was famous for being able to get the best from his actors, women in particular. He and Hepburn worked together many times and it was a relationship built on understanding and trust one another to do what each was capable of. Here, the culmination of Hepburn's screen presence and Cukor's watchful eye come together and create a tale of love and passion as well as a take on those of high society and the differences a few dollars in the account can make. It could be argued that Hepburn and Cukor never made a better film together, and I would hold to that argument as this is pure acting and directing melded together to create harmony on screen.",

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story begins with a fight. Tracy Lord has thrown her husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (Dexter) out of the house. In the opening scene, the fight between husband and wife is portrayed similar to silent films. There is no dialogue but the action and the music say everything. A year later they are divorced and Tracy has plans to get remarried. Tracy is a very strong, moral character who imposes her belief on others. \"She sets extremely high standards for herself and others aren't always apt to live up to them,\" says her mother. Dexter's alcohol addiction was disgusting to Tracy; instead of helping him deal with it, she wanted nothing to do with him. In addition to Tracy's idealism, she considers pride, privacy, and independence to be crucial. Katherine Hepburn's performance as Tracy Lord is the best of her performances. It is not surprising that this role was responsible for her comeback, as she had previously been labeled box office poison. Tracy Lord is adamant but undergoes a change of heart, beautifully portrayed by Hepburn. James Stewart (Mike) and Cary Grant (Dexter) play opposite Hepburn. Stewart is captivating in his academy award winning performance. Cary Grant has tremendous silent strength when he appears on the screen. Dexter has been affected by Tracy's standards, however he has come back to keep her from making a grave mistake.The dialogue of the film is very quick, intelligent, witty, and entertaining. The film addresses the division of classes and the prejudices between them, destructive pride, midlife crisis, selfishness, selflessness, and the importance of an understanding heart. Director George Cukor's deliberate placement of the actors allows for beautiful interaction. The Philadelphia Story is the perfect example of everything a film should be: well written, ingeniously performed, and beautifully executed. Although this film was made a little more than a few years ago, it is still completely original and remains a truly significant film.",

She requests from MGM that she be cast in the starring role only if Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart can play alongside her. A slick move as the ensemble all warrant howling performances.Hepburn plays the swooning socialite who has a case of cold feet on the eve of her marriage when both her ex-husband and a charming tabloid reporter plonk themselves on her front door. Tracy, - adamant that her marriage should go without a hitch - decides to teach these boys a lesson and and all chaos breaks loose!Hepburn never looked so alluring and bewitching in film. Dressed in an array of wedding gowns, dashing blouses and trousers, she assumes power and shrewdness in what mirrors her role in Hollywood as a feminist and a player among the boys. She has the hilarious grandstanding role in the film that fully showcases the slapstick and rapid-fire banter of the film. If Hepburn only ever acted in comedy she would still remain one of the greatest actresses of all time.Grant, oozing charm with Hepburn in comedies and later to star as the edgy, so suave gentleman in Hitchcock thrillers, snappily spits out the comic lines and helped by Cuckor, is a fine rapscallion leading man in a superb supporting role. Stewart, also looking fine and youthful brings a charm and snappiness to his role and plays straight to the audience with his wisecracks and observations on high society.The script adapted by Ogden Stewart from the play by Barry is a holler of lightning-fast one-liners and screwy tit-for-tats as the characters all clamber to fool and dupe one another. The principles all run with the dialogue and rap the snappy banter that is only all so uproarious. It represents a sparkling era of comedy that boasts the best comic talents in acting, writing and directing. Comedy of this standard and nutty style will probably not be seen again as society standards have moved on.While some moments remain ludicrous and admittedly plain silly the film is well supported by the peripheral characters including the fine Ruth Hussey. Each of the players jump in the farcical slapstick with vigor and delight. This is a rare chance when ALL the elements of comedy fire on all fronts and the players just hold on tight and run with the laughs. This was a hoot until the madcap finale.",

What I mean is that Romance is full of crap and clich\u00e9s. Sorry romance lovers. But if you mix Romance with Comedy then you get something worth much, much, more. So can I have the pleasure of introducing a film starring Katherine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, James Stewart as Macaulay Connor, and Cary Grant as C.K. Dexter Haven, and, Ladies and Gentlemen, that film is \"The Philadelphia Story. The plot is so sophisticated but also lovable as you see Macaulay Connor and Dexter Haven fighting for the same girl not so vividly. James Stewart was fantastic in this film but I can't say if this is the best film he has ever starred in because, to be honest, I have never seen him act in any other film except the film which I am reviewing today. I dunno why he said that he didn't deserve an Oscar for the film. He was MAGNIFICENT! Cary Grant was not far behind but he had less of a acting impact on me but he does deserve an honorable mention. Now since those two are out of the way, it is time for......Katherine Hepburn. Katherine Hepburn had some sort of a mysterious aura toward her that couldn't let you choose between: If she is was great or bad! The film does have it's flaws and that is that there are some boring scenes in the film which Is slept through. Of course, I can't say what those scenes were because I was sleeping through them. Anyone who is reluctant toward this film should leave that as soon as they insert their peni.... oh sorry... let me rephrase that. Anyone who is reluctant towards watching this film should leave that as soon as they insert the..... disk(!) into their DVD player. Philadelphia heiress Tracy Lord throws out her playboy husband C.K. Dexter Haven shortly after their marriage. Two years later, Tracy is about to marry respectable George Kittredge whilst Dexter has been working for \"Spy\" magazine. Dexter arrives at the Lord's mansion the day before the wedding with writer Mike Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie, determined to spoil things.The classical scene between a drunk Macaulay Connor and Tracy Lord was indeed classical because that scene portrayed what great acting (and kissing) is. I doubt Tom Cruise can do better than that, or Brad Pitt for the matter of fact. A final message from me: Oldies will have a real ball at watching this movie and a couple of the younger kids will not while others will. No matter what you think of this, it is a classic!",

            "content": "Being from Philadelphia myself, it's almost an unspoken rule that my favorite Romantic Comedy should be The Philadelphia Story. Not because it's high-art, not because its stars are doing the most groundbreaking work of their careers; it's because Philadelphians crave communities that revolve around their city. Shows like It's Always Sunny and films like Groundhog Day become classics because of their proximity to the city, and because, honestly, we like to talk about ourselves. In all honesty, the film barely has anything to do with Philadelphia. But The Philadelphia Story has a great amount of merit outside of its name, and it's a romantic comedy that even non-philadelphians had ought to check out.\nThe Philadelphia Story is romantic comedy through-and-through, but it falls into a few smaller categories. Like its predecessor, Bringing Up Baby, it is a story of mistaken identity; for whatever reason, many characters' true identities are obscured from others, paving the way for hilarity to ensue later in the film. We see this with Tracy's uncle and father who, in an effort to fool the reporters, swap identities. Even the reporters themselves conceal their true employer in hopes to convince the Lord family that they don't work for a tabloid. The fast pace of the film, coupled with the many moving parts, help to build dramatic (and also comic) irony, creating hilarious, outlandish situations.\nThe Philadelphia Story is also a love-triangle, a trope found constantly in romantic comedy today. After all, the love triangle is a device for building tension; it uses the amorous connections between characters to develop them in relation to one another. The presentation of C.K. Dexter Haven, Macaulay Connor, and George Kittredge as possible suitors for Tracy Lord divides the audience to camps based on which character they like more, and which character is better suited to marry Tracy.\nLike many movies with Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant, the dialogue is incredibly fast paced and witty. A certain air of jest and play is created around these smart, sometimes cruel characters. With each jab, the characters are quick to respond, often answering an insult with another insult. Not only does this make the film's comedic style especially intricate, but it also gives The Philadelphia Story a certain amount of rewatchability. Because the pace is so quick, you'll find something new and hilarious every time you watch it.\nOf course, watching these films today, they can be a little dated. There is a lack of representation, and an over-reliance on white actors and actresses that can be somewhat off-putting. It's important to consider the time in which these films were made, while also pushing for similar modern comedies to give more representation to different peoples. It should not, however, detract from the good work that many of the actors and crew put in to craft this hilarious romp.\nIt goes without saying that the film's three all-stars, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart knock it out of the park. Each trained comic and dramatic actors, this trifecta easily locks into the chemistry earned from many years working in this field and with each other. Though not the most dramatically impactful films of their careers, The Philadelphia Story is bound to make audiences laugh harder than they have in a while. If these three working in tandem is not enough to convince someone to watch this film, I don't know what is. If you're looking for an art film that will change your life, look the other way. But if you're looking for a fun film to watch and laugh at, The Philadelphia Story hits the spot.",

After being released from rehab, Grant wants to get back with Hepburn.Enter Jimmy Stewart, a sort of serious writer who has been thrown into a story of rich snobs who he doesn't want to deal with. His publisher understands this sells papers. He'd rather do real writing. So he gets dragged into Cary Grant's plot to get his wife back.The story is quintessential screwball affair. Rich and drunk and rambunctious wealthy. Short of a \"Three Stooges\" episode, this has more smack talking than modern movies. Smart, clippy dialogue and wonderfully tongue-in-cheek nuanced performances from Jimmy Stewart who knows how to properly wring out a piece of dialogue for its maximum chuckle.Also joyously funny is his photographer sidekick played by Ruth Hussy. Her tone is that of a hard nosed working class stiff.

In this case, being perfect includes marrying a successful self-made man, since she is NOT a snob about old money despite her background, and her first marriage, to Dex (Cary Grant), a man of her own class, was in her view so unsuccessful. But the man she has chosen is one who neither knows nor understands her - views her as a trophy to be won and displayed to others, and a goddess to be worshiped in private. He is also stuffy, pompous, self-righteous, and dull - it would appear that Tracey is unconsciously doing penance for her privilege and the failure of her first marriage.It takes the forced introduction of the poet/tabloid writer Mike (Jimmy Stuart) and his photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey) into the household (Dex, another employee of the tabloid, agrees to introduce them because the editor otherwise threatens to expose the scandals of Tracey's philandering father, and because it somewhat amuses him as well) to force Tracey to come to terms with what she herself is and what she wants and needs in herself and in her mate. Mike, involved at a fairly tepid level with Liz, comes in with an almost visible chip on his shoulder, resenting the old money that, in his view, makes life so easy for people like Tracey and her family, while he toils away writing trash to support his true calling as a poet. He discovers, to his shock, that the Lords are, despite their wealth and some serious eccentricities, real people and that Tracey is not just the product of money and privilege - there's a beautiful and substantial girl there who utterly intrigues him, even if she is a bit spoiled and occasionally arrogant. His sort-of girlfriend Liz watches this with dignity and humor, realizing that there's nothing she can do except wait it out and hope for the best - she loves Mike (and understands him), but she can't compete with Tracey's sheer glamor and she knows it.On the night before the wedding, Mike and Tracey both get drunk, and alone by the pool they take a swim and talk. Mike ends up confessing his feelings for her, making her realize that the pedestal she sits on for her fianc\u00e9 is not the place she wants to be - she WANTS to be a flesh and blood woman, not a perfect statue or goddess. She's hammered enough that she is very turned on by Mike's confession and the general romance of the situation, and perfectly willing to be swept off her feet and into his bed, but Mike, although drunk and thoroughly infatuated, is a gent and simply carries her to her own bed to sleep it off. Dex observes some of this, and is able to fill in the blanks correctly, fully aware that while he loves her, Tracey is not perfect.The fianc\u00e9 is not. He immediately assumes the worst, and that is more than enough for him - he wants his perfect statue, his goddess, and he resents the possibility that Tracey might in fact be human. Tracey, awake the next morning with a hell of a hangover and unsure of the events of the previous night, also fears that she gave in to impulse, yet resents it when her fianc\u00e9 shows up and reproaches her, especially since by then, she has been assured that she did not in fact \"do the deed.\" Even though she doubted herself, she resents the idea that he immediately assumes the worst and realizes that she doesn't want to be the object of any man's adoration; she wants to be the object of his LOVE. So the fianc\u00e9 is out of the picture.But we're still left with a wedding just a few minutes away, and two possible bridegrooms (or none at all). Tracey has a choice - Mike, a man who recognizes her humanity, but in a different way still worships her, or Dex, the man who all along has known her for what she is - flawed and human, yet beautiful, smart, talented, lovable, warm, and giving, and he has also straightened out his own problems with booze. She makes the right choice.This is a trivially simplistic plot? Not in my book!Apparently Hepburn wanted Gable and Tracy to play the Grant and Stuart roles. Despite my respect for her intelligence and insight, I think it is fortunate that she wasn't able to get them. Gable was a good actor, but never managed the apparently effortless high-society sophistication of Grant (odd, given that Grant was born and raised lower middle-class Archie Leach, and never went to school beyond the age of 14!), and while Tracy was a brilliant actor, I wonder if he could have managed the innocence and lack of experience that underlay the sarcasm and bitterness in Stuart's character, and that made it so possible for him to become infatuated with Tracey as he did. Tracy's characters always seemed to be rather worldly wise or street smart, while in this role, Mike thinks he's wise, but really isn't. Liz, his girlfriend, is the one who understands the world (and accepts it). She is the female equivalent of Dex here; the observer waiting to pick up the pieces, making sardonic comments along the way.This movie is cleverly and entertainingly written, and delightfully well acted by all involved. It's hard to imagine anyone finding it dull or beneath them, but apparently some folks can find anything beneath them. Their loss. If you haven't seen this movie, do. If you haven't seen it in a while, watch it again. You won't be sorry. Its mores and assumptions are a bit dated, but the humor, wit, and heart are not.",

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story is a brilliant rom com. It's smart, funny, emotional, romantic and so much more. Much of this comes from its brilliant screenplay (its Oscar win was well deserved) and the actors who make it come to life. The story is a creative twist on classic tropes (for example, rather than a love triangle it has an odd love polygon, featuring three potential suitors competing for Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord and a sub-triangle surrounding James Stewart's Macaulay Connors), the dialogue is clever and witty, and the humor works extremely well. It is a wild, fast-paced joyride of a film, but it manages to never get the audience lost along the way, even through multiple faked identities and misunderstandings among the characters. \n Much of the credit for the success of The Philadelphia Story goes to the actors. Its central figures are played Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant, all undeniable titans of filmmaking. The manic pacing of the film presents a challenge to these actors, as they need to be over the top to meet the demands of the script, but going too far makes the film hokey and unbelieveable. Luckily, the film delivers on the promise of its billing, with each of the three leads delivering a stellar performance. The film is also stocked with scene stealing supporting players such as Ruth Hussey, Roland Young, and Virginia Weidler, each one adding to the merits of an already excellent film.\n The Philadelphia Story fits into a number of subgenres. While it is most associated the remarriage subgenre, in which a divorced couple rediscovers love, much to the chagrin of their current romantic partners (ex. His Girl Friday), but it also fits into the wedding subgenre in which one of the romantic leads is about to get married to another person and the other lead has to break up the wedding (ex. The Wedding Singer, Made of Honor), and the journalism subgenre, in which one of the romantic leads is tasked with writing a story about the other and in doing so falls in love (ex. It Happened One Night, 27 Dresses). Ultimately, this subgenre transcendence reflects one of the more fascinating traits of The Philadelphia Story: it is a combination of a number of classic romcom themes. It explores the relationship between social class and romance, definitions of manhood and masculinity, the validity of marriage, and female sexual agency, to name a few. Dealing with so many issues often could dilute each of them; however, the confused and manic nature of the film makes this compounded exploration of issues successful. The hectic pace implies that all of these anxieties coming up at once is in itself an anxiety unto itself.\n To the extent that The Philadelphia Story doesn't get the attention it deserves, it can only be attributed to the fact that it is often overshadowed by its central player's other output. Each of the three leads was incredibly successful both before and after The Philadelphia Story, collectively appearing in films such on the level of Bringing up Baby, His Girl Friday, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, North by Northwest, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, to only name films from the top of my head. However, The Philadelphia Story is a phenomenal achievement and not one to be missed.",

Katharine Hepburn is excellent in a number of scenes but there were times where I felt as though she was overacting.

He's simply perfect for the role and gives a near flawless performance for which he won his only Academy Award.

            "content": "When I finished watching this flick, the first question on my mind was, \"Why didn't I see this sooner?\" This is one of the all-time great romance films. It's smart, funny, profound, deep, free-spirited, and electrifying. I had high expectations going into this film, saying that it stars three of the era's greatest stars: Jimmy Stewart, Katherine Hepburn, and Cary Grant. It is safe to say that it surpassed them in every regard possible.Many people groan when they see black-and-white films. They associate them with long, unenjoyable slogs comparable to history assignments. This film is as far away from that as the moon is from Earth. I can safely say I will be watching this film many times in the future, not just because it is a brilliant film, but it is a film I enjoy watching. The writing some of the cleverest I've seen, and the chemistry all these old-school greats share is enjoyable at worst.There are some films that seek to make the viewer feel like they're not watching a movie, that there's no distance between them and the events on-screen. This film is different. This film has no desire to deceive the viewer. It is proud to be a film, and not in the postmodernist, nod-and-wink way. It embraces what it is. It wants to entertain its viewers for two hours and leave them with pep in their step. And that's exactly what it does.The story centers around a divorced, wealthy Philadelphian woman, Tracy Lord, played by Hepburn, who is set to marry again. As this is a big event, a gossip newspaper wants the inside skinny, so its leader sends a reporter and a photographer, Mike and Liz- played by Stewart and Ruth Hussey, respectively, and who have a fair bit of unresolved sexual tension- to get into the manor. But they cannot do this on their own, as the family does not want anyone but immediate family on the grounds during the wedding. Thankfully, they have someone to help them out: Lord's first husband, played by Cary Grant.Though the film takes place over a relatively small amount of physical area, it is grand and epic and fulfilling in every regard. There are a lot films that make me wish they were longer and more ambitious. This film is those dreams being fulfilled. There are so many layers, nuances, and complexities, but nothing feels forced of unnecessary. It doesn't play down to the audience, but it doesn't leave them hanging either. It is a perfect balance in every regard.But a perfect balance means naught if it not accompanied by a number of moments that capture the audience's attention, that the audience is sure to remember after they move on with their lives. Thankfully, this movie has plenty of those as well. One immediately springs to mind.It is when Tracy introduces herself to Mike and Liz. She found out they were there from her ex-husband, who informed her that if she gets rid of them and doesn't allow them to report on her wedding, he will give them an even juicer story: that of her suspiciously Tywin Lannister-looking father being caught with a young dancer. Reluctantly, she backs off and allows them into her house. But she does not show them who she really is, at least not at first. She is cold, calculating, and fiercely independent, but she acts like a na\u00efve old-fashioned lady. In a lesser movie, this bit could have come off as contrived and lame. But in this movie, thanks both to great writing and a great actress, it comes off as equal parts enjoyably awkward and deeply disturbing.The part immediately before this, where Tracy's younger sister acts like some precocious princess, is pretty great too.And this moment, along with many others, are meaningful because unlike other romance films, this one keeps the audience guessing. It is not clear what is going to happen, so the audience has to grip tight to every moment. It's masterful.And a large part of that has to do with what I can only describe as a 'love square'.'Love triangle' has become a word of death among many intellectual and pseudo-intellectual circles. This is not without reason. Most love triangles are in fact, awful. They are worthless, meaningless, and cancerous. They invade good stories (looking at you, Hunger Games) and drag bad ones down even further. They are cheap cash grabs that serve no narrative purpose whatsoever. But they do not have to be. A good love triangle- or love square- can add intrigue and depth, and that's exactly what this one does. It does not drag the film down, but rather make it even better. All the good parts of these types of situation are here, and all the bad parts are mercifully absent. That's equal parts commendable and outstanding.And it makes me hate bad love triangles even more.All in all, this film is one of the greatest of all time. If I ever re-do my top 100 films of all time, this one is going to be there. The music, the editing, and the directing are first-class. The acting and the writing are unbelievably good. Anyone who has grown tired of terrible romance films should check this one out.",

            "content": "If you are accessing this review of an essential reissue in the print version of the paper . . .Well, first of all, we thank you for your continuing interest. With that out of the way, we apologise for the need to replace one film concerning sexual violence with another very different romantic punch-up.It's all too easy to set George Cukor's sublime comedy of bad manners beside Fifty Shades of Grey (denied an appropriately timed press show due to its undoubted brilliance) and derive all kinds of lessons concerning a decline in public discourse. Let's do that then.Okay, we're now sounder on homosexuality and racial issues, but the notion of Katharine Hepburn allowing herself to be ritually pummelled by Cary Grant is so absurd as to defy lucid expression. Grant does ram his hand into Hepburn's face in The Philadelphia Story. (\"Oh, please, mother, maybe he's going to sock her again!\" a neighbouring child remarks. \"Don't say 'sock', darling, 'strike' is quite an ugly enough word,\" her mother replies.)We are, however, never in much doubt that the estranged couple - once married, now considering new lives - have quite the measure of one another. Hepburn's Tracy Lord is nobody's idea of a submissive. Emerging in 1940, when the screwball comedy was at its height, the film is too fervent with activity to permit any character time to be such a doormat.Indeed, The Philadelphia Story stands as monument to one woman's determination to overcome national mood swings and the inflexibility of powerful men. Hard though it may be to credit, by the late 1930s, Katharine Hepburn had become \"box-office poison\". (That phrase may have made its first ever appearance in comments on the actress by Harry Brandt, an independent cinema-owner.) Even the now-revered Bringing Up Baby bombed with the public.\nHepburn's response was to back a play by Philip Barry and, when it became a hit, persuade her (ahem) close friend Howard Hughes to buy her the film rights. MGM duly picked up the hit property and, drafting in Grant and Jimmy Stewart as twin romantic foils, sat back to favour Hepburn's triumphant reinvention.These days, the enjoyable, if less astringent, musical version High Society plays more often on television. So, the story is familiar. Tracy Lord has divorced CK Dexter Haven (Grant) some years previously and is about to embark on a new marriage to nouveau swell George Kittredge (John Howard). The wedding is the most talked-about of the moment and Spy magazine resorts to subterfuge to gain access.The editor persuades Dexter to arrange invitations for reporter Mike Connor (Stewart) and Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) as old friends of the family. Tracy suspects who they are, but, always eager for sport, allows the hacks to attend anyway.Of course, Tracy knows what's going on. With the exception of George - rendered ignorant by the disease of new money - more or less everybody knows more or less everything that's going on more or less all the time.In love with patrician style, convinced that wit is a virtue in itself, Cukor's zinging entertainment assumes an intelligent audience that savours intelligent characters. All of this went out of fashion in the 1960s when - in both liberal and conservative circles - a suspicion of cleverness accompanied revulsion at the diseased public polity.Seventy years later, the romcom has so stagnated that it barely figures in the studio release schedules. Too much stupidity eventually killed it off. Meanwhile, the unstoppable desire for ersatz sophistication manifests itself in the chocolate-commercial chic of Fifty Shades of Grey. Which is where we reluctantly came in.",

            "content": "Melodrama. The film adaptation of the play of the same name by the American playwright Philip Barry. And since I didn't have a chance to read the original play, I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. I admit that after watching \"The African Queen\" with Katharine Hepburn, I decided to get a little more acquainted with the work of this actress, and I came across this picture, which starred Cary Grant, who was well known to me from the romantic thriller \"Charade\", and the director was George Cukor - who directed my favorite picture \"My Fair Lady\". The stars in the sky came together, as they say, so I just couldn't pass by this sparkling melodrama, simultaneously discovering Hollywood of the forties. And here is my brief opinion - An ironic charade of a young lady and three gentlemen. Despite my delight, there were not only unambiguous advantages, but also disadvantages in the picture, which slightly spoiled the overall impression of your humble servant. So let's finish with a long introduction and get to the point, so to speak.So, the pros:\n1. The script-you see, now, in our flighty, depraved and unbearable twenty-first century, the script of any melodrama or romantic comedy is guessed almost in a couple of minutes after reading a brief annotation or watching a trailer, because all the scenario moves and cliches are known and beaten to the point of losing resistance. And if you watch an old movie, no matter Soviet, European, Asian or Hollywood, then each picture has its own unique zest, its own style, its own hook, with which it catches the viewer and makes him watch the picture with the keenest interest. This is exactly the \"Philadelphia Story\". The seed is simple and banal - a divorced lady from a privileged American class is going to get married again, this time for a noble nouveau riche, but then her ex-husband comes into play, who sends two reporters to her house in order to make a grand report about this wedding for a scandalous gossip column. He does all this in order to annoy his ex. However, the story will go on completely unexpectedly, it will be full of various twists and turns, and you will puzzle over the finale throughout the entire timekeeping. This is a real skill - to turn everyday life and routine into a real work of art, which was succeeded by two screenwriters. If you like atypical monotonous melodramas, then pay attention to the\"Philadelphia Story\"!2. Dialogues-most likely, most of them migrated to the script from the original play, but it's a pleasure to listen to them. Subtle notes of the characters ' character are revealed in them, not to mention humor. Irony, turning into seriousness. Coldness, turning into passion. Hatred that turns into worship. All this reminded me of the brilliant and magnificent plays of Oscar Wilde, especially \"Lady Windemere's Fan\". At the same time, there is no sense of \"theatricality\" inherent in the film adaptations of plays. No, the viewer believes that everything happens not on the stage, but in real life.3. Humor - subtlety, grace, playfulness, bitchiness of some characters, sparkling jokes, various funny situations - all this is here and in considerable quantity. This is especially different from the first half of the picture, where the characters play a whole performance literally impromptu - and what is most interesting - they brilliantly succeed! A portion of laughter and a great mood are guaranteed to you for several days, and maybe weeks.4. Heroes - everyone is interesting, everyone has their own memorable features, there is not a single \"cardboard\". It is clear that the script has been worked out, because then they did not sacrifice the characters for the sake of humor, effects, and so on. After all, in the cinema, we are interested primarily in the characters that we will look at, and to whom we should feel sympathy. If this does not happen, then the movie is bad, and the screenwriter should be flogged!5. Romance - it's necessary to show affection and passion in this way, resorting only to sparkling dialogues, interesting situations and brilliant acting! That's where the talent and skill of people is visible! Modern filmmakers, both our and foreign, do not understand this, because it requires effort and very hard work, and the level of viewers is now strikingly different, and not for the better right now. Alas, but it's true.So, the cons:\n1. Piling up - in the first minutes, the picture just throws a bunch of heroes at us, which is why the viewer is lost in a pile of names and characters, which is why the immersion is slowed down. It was just necessary to introduce the characters gradually. Yes, it would increase the timing, but it would make the picture even better than it is now.2. The final is already my \"five kopecks\", but I guessed the final exactly, despite the fact that the picture led me by the nose (which I was happy about). My guess was justified. This slightly spoiled the impression, because I clearly don't want to be a Vanga of all Russia!A little about the main characters:\n1. Tracy Samantha Lord, played by Katharine Hepburn , is a bitchy representative of the\" upper \" class, who again wanted to marry, as it seems to her, the best man in the world, and then her ex appeared in order to spoil this joyful event, and then she rushed. Catherine struck me, because she perfectly performed a bitchy lady who drives three men crazy at once, including her future husband, while everyone is only happy about this, and even condones this fact. Bravo Catherine! Bravo!2. Mike Connor, played by James Stewart, is a journalist who needs to concoct a report about Miss Lord's wedding, but he did not know that this woman is not as simple as it seems and that she is able to surprise everyone around with her behavior. But Mike is a quiet guy, just putting on the mask of a cheeky guy. James was convincing in this role!3. Dexter Haven, played by Cary Grant , is Tracy's ex-husband, who showed up at her house on the eve of the wedding and decided to mock her. However, he does not yet suspect that his revenge will not be so simple, and there is something in the arsenal of his ex that can surprise him. In this picture, Carey looks incomparable, and to match the hero. Bravo Cary! Bravo!It doesn't look like a masterpiece, but like a good melodrama, with a touch of America of the forties - it will definitely go. Although all modern melodramas and romantic comedies of the \"Philadelphia Story\" are not equal, because they lose to it in many articles.As a result, we have a good ironic melodrama, with a good script, gorgeous dialogues, great humor, great romance and amazing acting works!My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

But you'll never hear such witty and creative dialogue in the theatre today.If nothing else the drunken after-the-party scene and repercussions the next morning is something we can all relate to... whether you're 80 or 20 (I'm 23) and the year is 1940 or 2000.",

The plot of The Philadelphia Story is predictable - if you do not have a pretty good idea where it's going by, say, the 20 minute mark you need to go see more movies.  But love is always a cliche and so are love stories - it's how you get to the end that matters.  This movie gets to the end with great dialogue, great acting, memorable side characters, and a lot of fun - and the pretty sight of the privileged class enjoying its privileges.I would single out Stewart's performance in particular.  Jimmy Stewart was as likeable an actor as we have ever had on film, even here, where the character is a bit hard-edged and cynical.  Maybe he never could really act in a Michael Moriarity method sort of way, but he could project characters like no one else.",

It involves wealthy socialite Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn)who is soon to be married for the second time; C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), her first husband; and Mac Connor (James Stewart), the down-to-earth reporter who becomes smitten with Tracy....Tracy, C.K. and Mac all face a dilemma. In addition to learning about life and love and themselves, they must decide whom they really love. So be ready for a number of surprises before the film is over....That Grant's C.K. is affable, stylish, and a bit conniving is proved during an interesting exchange between him and the two reporters, Mac and Liz Imrie (Ruth Hussey). Liz was one of the reporters who, after C.K. and Tracy were married, dogged them on their honeymoon. She tells Mac that C.K. didn't smash her camera but instead threw it in the ocean, and later paid for it. \"I got a nice letter of apology, too,\" she says. Mac says, somewhat sarcastically, \"Always the gentlemen, huh?\" C.K. replies, \"Except on occasion.\"...Interesting,too, is that Hepburn originally wanted Clark Gable to play C.K.  and Spencer Tracy for the reporter. After both actors declined, Director George Cukor suggested Grant for the C.K. part and MGM boss Louis B. Mayer suggested Stewart portray Mac....The film was a commercial and critical success. Stewart won 1940's Best Actor and the other Stewart, Donald Ogden, took home an Oscar for Best Screenplay. The film was also nominated for Best Picture of the year.",

The librarian still calls people \"thee\" and wears a white collar. Real Quakers used \"thee\" indiscriminately. I love that Macaulay Collins, the writer (James Stewart) uses the pronouns correctly, asking \"Dost thou have a washroom? Thank thee.\" Yes, the script is literate and funny.Philadelphia is also, clearly, the home of ultra-rich old families like the Lords. We, over here in historic England, are inclined to sneer at dynasties stretching back a mere two, three hundred years. Ours stretch back at least two centuries more!Here, in order to show their status, the family go riding. It's mentioned in passing that Tracey is a big-game hunter and fox hunter. I mind this more than the big house with more than one butler and a \"south parlour\". Her fianc\u00e9 George Kitteridge, the self-made man, is wearing riding kit that is too new - and he turns out to be the biggest prude and snob of the lot.The premise of the story is \"of its time\" - which is to say it is wildly politically incorrect. Tracey Lord (Katharine Hepburn) disapproves of her husband's drinking, and of her father's affair. Her father has left the family home and her parents are separated. Tracey's husband, CK Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) has allowed her to divorce him on the grounds of cruelty and drunkenness. In a swift aside later this is referred to as a good deed on his part. He blames his drinking on her uptight, Puritan, Quaker attitude. We're in Philadelphia, right? He also mentions in passing that he has taken a couple of cures, and I don't think we see him drink in the movie.On the eve of her marriage to George, everybody lays into Tracey, including Dexter. Her father returns to give her away, but tells her he only had an affair because SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM ENOUGH!!!!! Poor Tracey, tears in her eyes, hits the bottle.I'm afraid I couldn't rewatch the next bit. See \"obnoxious drunks\" above. I came back in on the \"morning after\" - the almost perfect Act III. I've forgotten what part Sydney Kidd the magazine editor (small role for the wonderful Henry Daniell) played in the plot. But I always cry at the end.",

So much happens in so short a time without it ever seeming contrived. Characters go through changes and are allowed the space and time to react to each other.  Hepburn reconsiders her entire life in a fairly serious way, and the other characters go through changes too.  Of course, the acting is great, especially from Hepburn, who is one of our great actresses.  The performances given by the little girl and the photographer are also superlative.I suppose that the only complaints one can have about the film are content rather than form.  Hepburn is supposed to forgive her father for his philandering?  She is cold and aloof and thus must return to her first husband, who comes this close to beating her?  As with many classic Hollywood films, the independent, smart woman is pathologized and must be cured.  Marriage is the only real option.  At least here, the options are appealing.  Still, a film like this, while unquestionable great, makes one wonder what people are talking about when they speak of a return to the good old days.  They look like slavery to me.",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 248The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of \"see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see\".The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and \"innundo\" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end.'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled.The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time.While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one.Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10",

            "content": "\"You're slipping, Red. I used to be afraid of that look - the withering glance of the goddess.\"Since Katharine Hepburn is my favorite actress, it's about time I paid homage to one of her films.The movie begins with one of the most classic scenes in film history. The audience does not know who the characters are in the first scene, and no dialogue is used. We see Cary Grant angrily slam the front door of a mansion and stalk towards a car parked out front. A moment later, Katharine Hepburn, dressed in a nightgown, follows him out, carrying a bag of golf clubs. After removing one club, she contemptuously throws the bag filled with the rest at him, haughtily breaks the one club over her knee, throws the halves at him, and stomps back towards the open doorway. Grant follows her, taps her on the shoulder...and when she wheels around, he pulls his fist back as if to punch her, but instead mashes her face in the palm of his hand, shoving her backward through the open doorway, where we next see her rubbing her neck as she sits up. The scene ends. Cut to \"Two Years Later\" as the title informs the audience; the day before Philadelphian blue-blood Tracy Lord's (Katharine Hepburn) second wedding. The audience also realize that the mashee in the opening scene and the masher were formally husband and wife: Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) and C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant). Soon Dexter has makes a surprise visit to the Lord household on the eve of the wedding. Tracy is about to marry George Kittredge (John Howard), her stuffy and rather chauvinistic well-to-do fianc\u00e9. What Tracy doesn't know at first is that Dexter, perhaps seeking revenge on Tracy, has arranged for Mike Connor (James Stewart), a writer for a tabloid-like magazine named \"Spy\", and Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), a \"Spy\" photographer, to do a story on the wedding under the guise of being friends of a friend of the family. Once Tracy is informed by Dexter that she must either allow the story to be written or her father's ongoing illicit affair with a dancer will be the big story instead she consents, but Connor and Imbrie do not know that she knows who their real identities and purpose...and she plots to \"really give them something to write about...we'll set them on their ears!\"The first scene where Tracy meets Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie, and practically interviews them sets the tone for the rest of the film.To reveal more of the story would spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film. But in the next twenty-four hours Tracy and the others find their lives turned upside-down in an alternately hilarious and touching series of events. Katharine Hepburn made the extremely wise move on the advise of Howard Hughes, whom she was dating at the time, of buying the film rights to Philip Barry's play - she had been a hit onstage in the role, which was written for her. Recently having been labeled \"box-office poison\", even being offered a role in a film tentatively entitled \"Mother Carey's Chickens\", it was the only way to guarantee her the role in any filming of the play. She had spent a year on Broadway in the film version, and interrupted the tour of the play to film it for MGM. For the film, she had wanted Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy for the roles of Haven and Connor. She got Grant and Stewart - hardly shabby! And better choices anyway, IMHO. Donald Ogdent Stewart took over for the screenplay adaptation, as Barry had apparently requested too much money. The dialogue is some of the best of any film of its time, and Hepburn, at her most radiant, is beautifully costumed by designer Adrian. She is at times \"lit from within\", as Stewart's character Mike tells her, and at other times \"made of bronze\" (as her father, played by John Halliday) asserts. Dinah, Tracy's young sister, is portrayed to hilarious effect by child actress Virginia Weidler, who makes her appearance to the reporter duo in ballet toe shoes, spewing French and finishing her introduction to them by manically playing and singing a lusty dance-hall song on the piano. Pinch-prone Uncle Willie (Roland Young) adds great spice and fun with his smaller part. Side note: In the scene where Mike arrives drunk at Dexter's house late one evening, Stewart purposely hiccups to try to crack Grant's straight-faced resolve - and it works. \"The Philadelphia Story\" won six Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor (Stewart), Best Actress (Hepburn), Best Supporting Actress (Hussey), Best Screenplay (Donald Ogden Stewart), and Best Director (George Cukor). James Stewart and Donald Ogden Stewart won their nominations (Stewart's sole Oscar win), and although Katharine Hepburn did not win for this role (she lost to Ginger Rogers for her performance in \"Kitty Foyle\"), she received the New York Film Critics' Award. The film revived her professional reputation, was a huge success, is of course considered to be one of the all-time classics of romantic comedy, and my personal favorite of Hepburn's films of this genre.",

Particularly good is the opening scene, which coincidently arouses way too much controversy on this site, that is filmed in the classic style of the silent era. However throughout the whole movie George Cukor proves what a master he is behind the camera. The camera never seems obtrusive and that's the trick. He doesn't practice any kind of showy direction. You barely realize the camera is there and for this type of film that is exactly as it should be.The screenplay is brilliant. Donald Ogden Stewart deserved the Oscar he won for it. The movie is driven by a kind of effortless comic dialouge. It occasionally slips into slapstick comedy however most of it is just very clever lines. Consider this (paraphrased) one by Cary Grant, (talking to writer James Stewart) \"I thought all writers drank to excess and beat their wives, you know, I always wanted to be a writer.\" Of course without a good cast their really is no movie and this cast is one of the best. The trio of Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart carry this romantic comedy. Cary Grant provides the comedy with many of the funniest lines in the film. James Stewart provides the romance with a seemingly effortless charm, with which he managed to charm the Oscar voters. Meanwhile Katherine Hepburn has the best of both worlds clashing swords with Grant while becoming interested in Stewart. The supporting cast was also very good. Ruth Hussey, John Howard and the hilarious Virginia Weidler are all nearly pitch perfect. Deserving special mention among the supporting cast is Roland Young as Uncle Willie. He takes the limited space he has in the script and steals a few scenes from the rest of the cast with some of the funniest moments of the film.Despite the fact that the love triangle had been done before this film, and very well too, it somehow rises above the stereotypical story and creates something special. It is without a doubt one of the best romantic comedies to ever come out of Hollywood.",

That Conner was truly in love with Tracy and saw something in her that would inspire her to be the best version of herself.But then, on the day of the wedding Conner is rejected by Tracy and Tracy gets remarried to Dexter which for whatever reason I didn't see coming. Further although Tracy said she refused Conner in part because his co-worker, Liz, would be upset that to me seemed unsalvageable. (a) Conner and Liz showed no chemistry the entire movie and (b) Liz now knows she was never on Conner's mind and that at best she'll be a 2nd choice.Still the ride there was great.

            "content": "THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940 MGM) starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart was a successful 1940 movie based on a Broadway stage play hit also starring Hepburn, Joseph Cotton, and Van Hefflin. Hepburn owned the show, and commissioned writer Philip Barry to write it for her to star in. She met Barry when he wrote Holiday (1938) for her, which also starred Cary Grant.Howard Hughes (a distant celebrity relative of mine, according to Ancestry.Com), Hepburn's sometime boyfriend during the 1930's and also millionaire dilettante \"player\" on the Hollywood scene then, advised Hepburn to get legal control of the movie rights to the Philadelphia Story stage play, and she did.The movie was directed by legendary director George Cuckor, one of MGM's most gifted movie directors who worked on both The Wizard Of Oz and Gone With The Wind movies in 1939, the year before The Philadelphia Story, but got screen credit for neither.The settings, costuming, camera work, lighting and technical presentation of The Philadelphia Story (1940 MGM) were lavish and wonderful. It was an important movie of those times (the high point in the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood), and it looks it.I am a Screen Actors Guild movie actor currently (2010) who acted in a Baltimore Maryland USA regional play version of that show in 2003 put on by Baltimore's Paragon Theatre. The Baltimore MD production of it ran two months in Fall of 2003 and was an important theater event at the time. Quite memorable, and I got to know the play well...I played \"Seth Lord,\" father of \"Tracy Lord,\" the main female character played by Katherine Hepburn.Wonderful aspects of the movie were enjoyable, and the actor work was breathtaking....I have never seen Cary Grant better or more different...a serious, non-comedy, non-romance role for him...quite a change. James Stewart was also very good...he got a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work in the movie. Hepburn herself was very good, so were others in the movie.The ending was very, very phony, and not a little stupid and ridiculous......girl from hell ends up getting a new husband and marrying him with everybody's blessing....real soap opera stuff.But...nothing is perfect...one has to enjoy the good parts of movies like that, accept the bad parts.The show was written for Katherine Hepburn who paid the author, Phillip Barry, to write a stage play script just for her, and using her particular talents and stage persona....show was about a liberated, independent, arrogant woman of those times (1930's) and she turns into the rewarded hero of the show at the end....because she paid for the show, and the writer was on HER payroll!Hepburn (also a distant, collateral celebrity relative of mine, according to Ancestry.Com) went on to more roles and movies about independent women of the type she seemed to specialize in, but never again ventured into play or movie ownership and production, or commissioning writing especially intended for her.She stuck to actor work, went on to become famous for \"Tracy/ Hepburn\" team movies, got 3 more Academy Awards (got her first for Morning Glory in 1932), and became famous as the only actor, male or female, to earn 4 Best Actor Academy Awards, the first in 1932, the last in 1981 (Morning Glory [1932], Guess Who's Coming To Dinner[1968], The Lion In Winter [1969], and On Golden Pond [1981]).Died in 2003 at the ripe old age of 96....had the longest life of any Academy Award Actor Winner in history.

The \"spy\" magazine sent reporter Mike Connor and photographer Liz to Tracy's home to get more news about her incoming marriage. Due to help of Tracy's ex-husband Dexter, they could live with Tracy's family for a few days. Unthinkable thing happened. Tracy appreciated the book written by Mike very much. After several talking, unconsciously their hearts were becoming closer. Tracy faced with choices.The unexpected ending was really a big surprise for me. Marriage, divorce and remarriage are significant thing for a person. It is wise to think twice before act.Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart brought us wonderful and unforgettable performance. James Stewart deserved his Oscar award (the best actor).A comedian classic. 8/10",

            "content": "Romantic comedies are one of the most loved and popular genres in cinema. There are very few romantic comedies that stand the test of time and remain fresh after decades. 'The Philadelphia Story' is one such rom-com. Beginning from the star cast, the movie shoots up the expectations of the viewer. I mean which other movie can boost of having screen legends Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart in one frame. The movie also does not disappoint. Based on the coming of age of a rich, eccentric woman who realizes what true love is, along with her maturity as a woman, this movie also shows her confused state of mind when she has to make a choice between her past, present and future love. The rich woman is played by Hepburn and her past, present and future love played by Grant, Howard and Stewart respectively. This movie has got all the ingredients necessary for a rom-com. Great witty dialogues (This movie has got perhaps the best dialogues I have witnessed in a rom-com), Romantic singing, Kissing and a very happy ending. The movie is certainly ahead of it's times and is still fresh even today. There is also a certain amount of suspense maintained until the end upon whom will Hepburn choose as her true love.Romantic Comedies are not usually credited for good acting. But this movie certainly would change the mindset. For example, James Stewart in his illustrious, legendary career won just one Oscar for acting, that in this movie. Katharine Hepburn is like a livewire on screen - According to me, she is the star of the movie, the one that holds the movie together. Cary Grant underplays well, nothing much to talk about his acting. Overall, a great one time experience.Rating : 8/10",

Katherine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Carey Grant are all top 10 actors of all time in many people's book. Though this is not Jimmy Stewart's most iconic performance (which is almost surely It's A Wonderful Life or perhaps Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) it is the one for which he won his sole Oscar, and he is quite good. Cary Grant is a little understated but still solid and Katherine Hepburn is the star of the whole thing.The story starts slow and none of the characters are particularly likeable at first but they grow on you. The ending is a little abrupt but I must admit that I didn't know who Hepburn was going to end up with. A romance/comedy of a different vein than those of the last 30 years, Philadelphia Story, though not perfect, is a good watch that starts out mediocre but becomes very good.",

            "content": "I've just recently commented one of my favorite classic romance, comedy and drama movies. This one has to be \"one\". When it comes to old comedy films I always recall people who talk fast without even rupturing a bit of exaggerated expression on their visage (which were nowadays). I'm surprised Katharine Hepburn is really so talented she pulled this kind of flair effortlessly. James Stewart was incredibly funny too and admittedly this is the first time I saw him. The supporting casts were also delightfully witty. Ruth Hussey's simplistic wittiness blends well. I laugh hard when she prattled sarcastically to C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) about their previous acquaintance ending up disposing her camera off the ocean. I find the character of Seth Lord (John Halliday) funny also. His wit is sharp, straightforward and dangerously funny (this I believe he demonstrated towards Tracy Lord\u2014Katharine Hepburn's character). And there's the girl Dinah Lord (Virginia Weidler) who's age and exuberance reflects well a healthy and fun youth. I find the film very uncomplicated and well scripted, so as well the characters were played very well. I just need to watch it once more again because of the details. Not that the details were inconceivable, but I would put it that way because the characters talks evidently fast. Take for example Katharine Hepburn. Well I got the problem. Nevertheless I catch few of the details with how they progressed to the wits and conversation of the film and I would love to give it another try sitting on my couch and watch their parade once more. It is agelessly funny, even at my age.",

            "content": "Considered to be one of (if not the) greatest actresses of all time, even Katharine Hepburn wasn't immune to a downturn. Before 1940, her career had been in a form of limbo, as she had starred in a series of critical and commercial disappointments. However, in some ways, she would dictate her triumphant return by playing a role that she had previously played on stage, and it's a role that makes for one of the finest efforts in her filmography.The Philadelphia Story is a brilliant film that showcases the talents of some of the greatest screen luminaries of all time. In addition to that, it's a clever and witty production that's one of the best romantic comedies one will ever see. The film is fast-paced comedy that displays perfect chemistry between the leads, and brings out the comedic abilities in them, which George Cukor handled to perfection with his directing. One would be hard pressed to find a better romantic comedy than this one.At first, the film may seem like a typical screwball love triangle that was a common theme for the day. However, it's much more than a triangle, as there are more individuals involved than usual. More specifically, the film focuses on a high society woman named Tracy Lord, who is due to be married to a man named George Kittredge, a self-made man who climbed up from the lower class. However, things get complicated when Tracy's ex-husband, C. K. Dexter Haven suddenly arrives for a visit. While there, C. K. manages to convince Tracy to allow Macaulay Connor and Elizabeth Imbrie, two reporters from a sleazy tabloid magazine, to observe the wedding, despite the fact that it supposed to be a private event. Further complications ensue when just everyone falls for Tracy at once, which results in one of the best screwball courtships on film as they all try to win Tracy's heart.What primarily makes the film exceed is the outstanding efforts from the leads. Katherine Hepburn is at one of her best here, in which she brings both charm and comedy to her role. She is at the same time, both spirited and pensive, and has comedic timing that is second to none. As I previously stated, I would consider this to be one of her best performances in her whole filmography. Cary Grant is also stupendous, in which, with his suave charm, brings some great sarcasm and is so perfectly deadpan that makes him the ideal foil to Hepburn. James Stewart would win an Oscar for his role in this film, and I can see why he did, because he would command attention every minute that he was in front of the camera, with his comedic abilities being incredible, particularly during a scene where he's inebriated, and whenever he tries to court Hepburn, the latter in which he comes off as so na\u00efve that he's somewhat endearing to watch.As also mentioned, George Cukor directs the film like a master, in which he handles the script with the utmost perfection. He manages to incite every single detail of the script to its full potential, whether it's with the dialogue or the characters. The dialogue is full of clever jokes and gags that don't feel forced or unnatural, and is a delight to listen to. Donald Ogden Stewart won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on this film, and that was another win that was definitely a deserved one. In regards to the characters, as a result of Cukor's directing, all of them are given the opportunity to shine. In addition to the leads, the supporting characters also have their brilliant moments. Among them include Ruth Hussey as Imbrie, Connor's fellow reporter who is rather smitten with him, and tends to get somewhat irritated at Connor's advances to Tracy. John Howard also had his moments as Tracy's next husband, who gets into a few spats with Cary Grant. It also enjoyed the performance of Virginia Weidler as Tracy's sister, Dinah, who also has some great moments of comedy, particularly a scene where she tries to serenade Connor on a piano. Ultimately, there are many characters in the film, and none of them feel wasted or unnecessary, which again, proves Cukor's ability at character development and storytelling.The Philadelphia story is one of those films that doesn't seem to falter at any point, from the very beginning to the very end, it's capable of providing a rich and delightful experience for those who see it. Like I said, not only is the film witty and clever, but it also features three of the greatest acting legends of all time shine in what are some of their finest roles. It would not be detrimental if you were to see the film, because it truly is a timeless classic that would not be overdoing it if you were to call it one of the best experiences with cinema that you've ever seen. In a discussion over whether or not old films are still as relevant now as they were then, this film would make a great argument, as it will undoubtedly continue to delight audiences for many, many, many, more years to come.",

Recently, I have been listening to it over and over again. The song is wonderfully performed by Genius Ray Charles. Of course, Jimmy Steward's voice is not as good as Ray Charles' but i still found the song by Macauley Connor (played by J.Steward) enjoyable. I like the scene Mike crooning for Tracy in the moonlight, which is so lovely.The story has such a good ending, which to me, is quite agreeable. But what seems less perfect is when Mike proposed to Tracy without thinking. I still think that the director should have worked on that scene more carefully.It should be a huge mistake if i don't mention Mr. C.K.Dexter Heaven (What heaven!) Cary Grant looks greater than ever before. And the character is such a gentlemen. The way he won back Tracy's love is lovely and romantic.What astonishes me is Tracy's french. She spoke french pretty well.And the little girl Dinah, despite some kind of over-acting scene, she is charming. And i think Dinah makes the movies more relaxing.The Philadelphia is rated 9 out of 10.",

Her drive is the most impressive thing about her, and the criticisms her character takes in the movie are well deserved and auto biographical. She is a stone princess.The men, her suitors, numerous, are the lifeblood of the movie, and principally the delightful Jimmy Stewart. The lines are quick and well thought out, clever enough for a play like this, but never sublime.With the tall, lean, handsome, well mannered men - particularly Stewart - and the exclusive air of Hepburn, I somehow felt like I was watching a Princeton school play. Cary Grant is a little too coy and self-created to have emerged from the upper classes. He's got a chip on his shoulder, as if he's afraid to show something in polite company.Well, I give it an 8 because although it's a great show, I somehow felt the worse for wear having seen it.",

The librarian cracked me up in that while the title says its the Philidelphia story so we know it is obviously set in Pennsylvania, I simply did not think about a librarian being a Friend or Amish. The story line is quite possibly one of the best of all times. Imagine, 5 different love stories in one movie!

            "content": "Few romantic comedies are really about relationships. They are instead about people falling in love, they tend to end with the couple confessing their love or getting married. \"The Philadelphia Story\" is one of those few Romantic Comedies actually about relationships and in my opinion it is the best of the group. The main themes in my opinion are: 1. What makes relationships work or fail?/Why do people who are right for each other separate? 2. The changing modern world (the ease of divorce, woman's independence) and it's effect on relationships and family. 3. How people need to understand weakness if they are to relate to others. 4. Not judging a book by it's cover \u2013 or a person by their job or social standing.It's a clever movie and has a lot to say but what is so surprising is how relevant and apt it still is today. Honestly, you could change a few things about the setting and the superficial character quirks and remake it set it in the present day. Not so much has changed. And of course it is very, very funny. It has a very witty script, you can tell it was based on a play, and the cast is amazing. Three of my favourite actors; Katherine Hepburn (my absolute favourite actress), Cary Grant and James Stewart (probably my favourite actor), all in one place, and they all sparkle in this. I also really like the characters of wise and quietly sarcastic photographer Liz, played by Ruth Hussie and Tracey's wonderful, precocious, scene-stealing little sister Dinah played by Virginia Weidler. It's really very much an ensemble film. A warning - The film relies heavily on dialogue, subtle characterisation and good acting. The plot is relatively minimal and there is not very much in the way of visual humour or action. If you can enjoy a film like that you'll love the film, if you don't you won't.If you like this film check out \"High Society\", it's musical remake.

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story is, quite simply, perfection. From the cast to the set to the script, I can't think of anything that could be improved on this movie.For me, the magic of this movie is the performances of the three leads. Katharine Hepburn takes the line \"Good golly, why didn't you sell tickets?\" and layers it with so much emotion and meaning. Jimmy Stewart's drunken scene with Cary Grant is one of the funniest moments ever put on film. When Stewart warbles \"CK Dexter Haaaaaaven!\" I just have to laugh (mostly because I know what's coming after that line). Cary Grant's facial expressions are at times very subtle, but they convey most of the emotion of his character.The supporting performances in this film are just as outstanding as the lead performances. Ruth Hussey, in particular, is brilliant. Her timing and delivery of her lines is one of the funniest parts of The Philadelphia Story. The first couple of times that I saw this movie I was so focused on the leads that I missed a lot of the meaning behind what Hussey said. Once I picked up on each word of her dialogue, the movie was taken to a whole new level.The first time I saw The Philadelphia Story I didn't know how it was going to end (I can usually see the ending of a movie coming from a mile away). If I think too hard about it, I would have a quibble with how it did end (Tracy goes from being engaged to Kittridge to making out with Mike to marrying CK Dexter in a matter of hours), but I don't waste time doing that. I just sit back and enjoy watching three of the biggest Hollywood legends in history work their magic.",

            "review_title": "The Philadelphia Story",
            "content": "\"The Philadelphia Story\" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think \"This Means War,\" \"Twilight,\" \"10 Things I Hate about You\") but \"The Philadelphia Story\" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc\u00e9e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in \"Mean Girls\". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in \"The Philadelphia Story,\" alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.",

            "content": "Cary Grant faced a series of challenges with this role.From a career perspective, Grant knew the idea of working with Hepburn was dangerous. He'd tried three times and failed three times to find box office success with her, but even his name didn't carry enough weight with the public to bring audiences into any theater that was showing a picture with her in it. She'd been summarily run out of the industry by exhibitors who said bluntly and publicly that they couldn't afford to pay for empty seats any longer. Fairly popular in New England, her films were avoided everywhere else to such an extent that some theaters simply wrote them off as a loss and showed second run movies instead. She had fled Hollywood for home, RKO no longer had to use Ginger Rogers & Irene Dunne films to block book Hepburn movies, and profits at the studio promptly soared.Grant, one of the shrewdest businessmen in the acting community, knew all of this and he rightly feared that this film could ruin his career. Anyone could look at the string of #1 hits he'd had with Irene Dunne and his smash hit Gunga Din, compare those with the mediocre returns he'd had with Hepburn, and wonder why he would bother. The reasons Grant took the role were all business: he demanded star billing and star publicity - the full treatment, nationwide - he demanded $100,000 up front plus a percentage, he demanded a top flight star in the role taken by Jimmy Stewart, and he knew Hepburn was paying for it. If it flopped, Cary Grant was protected nine ways from Sunday.As an actor, the challenge was no less daunting, for both Grant and Stewart. Several critics have noted how it took an actor of Spencer Tracy's ability to make her films believable. How were two of the most popular male stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood going to make audiences believe that either one of them could be attracted to a spindly, gangly, gawky, seriously unstylish thing that the public actively avoided - and with a hideous voice no less? Stewart had had his breakout role across from a luminous Ginger Rogers in 1938's Vivacious Lady, and had hit more box office gold across from Jean Arthur and Maggie Sullavan, so that by 1940 he was a sure bet at the box office. But nobody had to persuade audiences that he could fall for these lovely ladies with enchanting personalities; the actor he had to work across from in The Philadelphia Story was something else entirely.Still, they both went ahead with the film and, together with some of the kindest and most gracious camera work ever seen, they finally lifted box office poison and carried it across the finish line.In one of the easiest decisions in history, Best Actress went to Ginger Rogers for Kitty Foyle.Cary Grant became rich.And in recognition of a staggering achievement, Jimmy Stewart received the Best Actor's Award.5/10: 1 for Grant, 2 for Stewart, 2 for glamour shots.",

            "content": "In the past I must have seen The Philadelphia Story (1940) 3 or 4 times, and last night (5/14/16) saw it again on a local PBS station that shows classic films on Saturday evenings from 9 pm - 11 pm. That station broadcasts in 1080i and the black & white print was flawless and spectacularly clean. A very funny off-color line (pun intended) was spoken early in the film that caught me so completely unawares that I could not stop giggling about it for the rest of the film. If this line was in my previous viewings of this film then I was either talking over it, somehow distracted, or it just wasn't there, since I have absolutely no recollection of ever having heard it before. The line: As Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) and Macaulay Connor (James Stewart) enter the manse for the very first time the butler is instructed to show them into the \"south parlor\". As the couple enters the splendidly decorated \"south parlor\", Elizabeth with her back to the camera, is heard saying: \"Gosh, I was expecting to see pickaninnies and banjos!\" Elizabeth's line is obviously making fun of the fact that the mansion is so large that it may have parlors at each compass point and that they were being shown into one of the lesser parlors because, as reporters, they are initially viewed as unwelcome riffraff by the Lord family. By today's standards this is obviously a non-PC line and can be easily hushed from the soundtrack since Elizabeth is facing away from the camera when she says it. Though I can understand why well-meaning presenters of this film would hush that line, I think that it's presence is important -- and should always be kept in -- because it underscores the insular higher society in which the story takes place, a society so high that even the servants are white, and there are enough parlors in some mansions to accommodate folks from various societal strata if need be. Apparently the studio considered using a real mansion on an 800-acre estate near Philadelphia but decided against doing so because the mansion was determined to be so mindbogglingly luxurious that typical theater goers would not believe that anyone in America actually lived that outrageously well in the 1940's.",

            "content": "I know some people consider this a classic, and in a way I can see why\u2014 sprightly (if often smart-alecky) dialogue, a well-constructed plot, and, above all, legendary actors with overpowering presence. Yet, I fail to see greatness. In spite of the film's polished exterior, I couldn't help feeling that someone was pulling my leg. Several viewings have only expanded the list of problems I have with this film. These are only some of them. 1. Katherine Hepburn's acting, not her character. I thought Tracy was a very interesting character, complex and engaging. The fact that she was at the center of this film is what really redeems it in my opinion. In fact, it is such a vivid character that it finally manages to emerge through Hepburn's affected mannerisms, fake accent, and annoying high- pitched voice. It didn't make it better that everyone kept calling her pretty, something that I totally fail to comprehend. But that's just me of course. People have different tastes. (In all fairness to Hepburn, this theatrical, measured mode of delivery was apparently standard in that period; but she does take it to the extreme). 2. Cary Grant's character, not his acting. Grant radiates likability, and here he manages to give the best spin to what is practically an intolerable character: a spoiled overgrown brat, whose only talents seem to be his looks and juvenile wisecracks. 3. Silly attitudes, nonsensical exchanges, and plain non sequiturs. Just some samples: -Tracy's father blaming her for his own extramarital affairs. She was too distant, he says, so he had to find the filial affection he craves with women her age. I understand a man blaming his wife (which doesn't make it right of course), but his daughter! I mean, what could a man expect from his daughter that he can only find with some floozy in New York? -Dexter blaming Tracy for his drinking problems. His rationale: she took that problem with him when she married him. -Speaking of which, how everybody kept reminding Tracy of her high and mighty attitude, and how she has no sympathy for human imperfection (without showing any real examples of this). I do not necessarily disagree. But they just kept hammering the message until you could see a mile away that Tracy will surely get her comeuppance\u2014discovering her own weakness and learning something valuable in the process. -Tracy's reaction when Macaulay tells her that nothing serious happened between them last night: \"Why? Was I so unattractive,\" and this is in the presence of her fianc\u00e9, the man to whom she's trying to prove her innocence. It doesn't get sillier than that. -Tracy blaming Kittredge for, I don't know exactly, maybe not trusting her enough. The man saw his bride-to-be drunk in the arms of another man, who then proceeded to take her to the bedroom upstairs. Even she was surprised to know they hadn't slept together. And he didn't judge her as she claims. He wrote her a note asking for an explanation. Sounds quite reasonable to me. 4. On the last point, how Kittredge was made out to be the villain/laughing stock of the piece. After he left, even Macaulay and Liz were practically celebrating. This is one of the cases where the author is trying to pull the viewer in one direction, but the viewer (at least my humble self) does not quite see eye to eye. Kittredge struck me generally as a decent guy. He obviously loved Tracy and was willing to put up with her whims. His only fault, it seems, was that he was a self- made man, unlike the vacuous rich boy Dexter. I couldn't help feeling that Philip Barry, the author of the play on which the film is based, was overcome by his aristocratic sensibilities in dividing good guys and bad buys along class lines. Whatever the case may be, well-crafted plot and sleek dialogue do little to reduce the inescapable sense of artificiality and forced character development. One could say, of course, that such devices were typical of the time period. Especially in the early talkies, movie makers were so eager to capitalize on the new medium that dialogue (as witty and polished as possible) became the foundation of the film. Philadelphia Story, then, is a product of its time, and you can't blame it for that. But this means also that is dated in a way that truly great films are not. Overall a likable innocent farce, but, in my opinion, not the timeless masterpiece it is made out to be.",

Not only with the brilliant performances expected of Hepburn, Grant and Stewart, but also with the seemingly overlooked and excellent supporting work by Ruth Hussey and Virginia Weidler. If you have never seen this movie, it is a MUST! I can only imagine how enjoyable this film must have been in 1940.Also, if you happen upon the recent edition that I did, do not miss the Katherine Hepburn hosted autobiographical bonus feature after the film. This too was a real gem!",

            "content": "This is one of the GREAT film comedies! As such it can be used to point up the futility of trying to remake a film classic. The Hepburn/Grant/Stewart/Hussey original is so much better than any of its remakes. Even \"High Society\" with such formidable stars as Crosby and Sinatra shows why we should accept no substitutes. Revivals of Broadway plays work okay. Remakes of great films invariably pale in comparison to the original. This is, no doubt due to the fact that Broadway productions are so transitory. On the other hand, a production on film is permanent, so long as the film exists. Thank goodness the film of The Philadelphia Story still exists. It allows us to see the story done as it should have been done. There is no need to improve upon such a perfect performance.",

            "content": "Wonderful movie. I had never seen a 'Katharine Hepburn' movie, but have heard so many fasinating things about her, and her career, I had to watch it. I was laughing hard! James Stewart as Conner was astounding. The dialouge was bouncy and playful. One scene, Hepburn's screen mother comes in and says to Cary Grant, \"Dexter, can't you remove yourself?\" and preceeds to duck down under some tables. It is now a favorite. 8/10",

Cary Grant and James Stewart are both damn sexy in this movie and I so get Kate Hepburn's Tracy Lord. This movie truly made me laugh out loud, even more than any of today's gross out comedies ever could. The chemistry between the stars is amazing. Some people may stay away from this movie just because it is over sixty years old and in black and white. But,don't do that!! This is a terrific movie, with some real wit and intelligence and some real star quality. This movie proved Kate was a star, even when she was labeled box office poison.",

            "content": "This film is pure gold. I love it more than words can say.  Tough choice for Kate.. Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart.  How did she manage?  All that aside, this movie dealt well with the fragility of human life, and the flaws which we all must realize about our true selves. I particularly enjoyed Hepburn's portrayal of a woman who is able to release herself from pretension and vanity and become an entirely new person, partly due to Cary Grant's tender yet suave assistance. His ability to \"stand her on her feet again\"  leave her infused with what she later realizes is his constant and true love of her.  Jimmy Stewart, and especially Ruth Hussey both turn in excellent portrayals of a reporter and photographer.  Hussey's wit and steadiness provide the perfect contrast to Stewart's jangling existence.  I can't help but watch this movie again, just to pick up on the excellent scraps of dialogue which are so frequently missing in today's films.",
