            "content": "Sometimes something happens with a person in your life that is absolutely devastating, your world is completely flattened and you're left adrift, wandering spiritually and unable to relate to anyone else. The desolation of the scenery in this film, the poor run-down towns in Texas, and the wide openness of the landscape as the little car drives through it mirrors this feeling of being lost after such an event. This is a film that wields a heavy emotional hammer, and it left me with a hollow feeling in my chest.The pace is slow but it matches the weight of this guy's past, and builds to an extraordinary scene, as he and his old lover communicate with the benefit of time having passed and through a mirror, saying the words which usually end up being unsaid, and coming to a kind of peace. There are scars which never completely heal but somehow we move on, and this film is a catharsis. There are so many other things to love about it too - Wim Wender's use of light and color, Ry Cooder's lonesome slide guitar, and Harry Dean Stanton's sense of what it is to be broken. It's a masterful, haunting work, one that will stick with you.",

            "review_title": "A tale of redemption",
            "content": "Paris Texas is a slow, moody, and delicate study about a man who once ran away from everything and now is coming to terms with himself and learning to forgive himself, by finally facing he people he turned his back on. The Wim Wenders directed movie still today rests in a fairly under recognized status, which doesn't stretch the term \"cult classic\" when applied to it. Paris, Texas is about redemption, the road, family, and the bleakness of the American Southwest. It contains one of the most memorable and unusual openings ever. We hear Ry Cooder's lonely single note twangy guitar on the soundtrack with cinematographer Robby M\u00fcller (Barfly, To Live and Die in L.A. , Dead Man) capturing the majestic vistas, rock formations, and the open desert in his camera. Actor Harry Dean Stanton walks out of the dry and desolate landscape, wearing a wornout black sports jacket and dusty red baseball cap. It's a beautifully staged opening sequence. A perfect start to a perfect movie. This man is lost and in need of being found. It's his brother played by actor Dean Stockwell (\"Quantum Leap\", Blue Velvet) who gets word of Stanton's whereabouts and goes after him, which begins the journey of redemption. Nastassja Kinski plays Stanton's young x-wife and the true love of his life. Kinski, the daughter of legendary German actor Klaus Kinski, doesn't make her entrance into the film until the later reels, but her lingering presence is felt throughout. It's almost the same type of thing that Coppola did by not having Brando appear in Apocalypse Now until the conclusion. The scenes that Kinski does have in the end with Stanton are some of the best moments ever captured on film. They're highly emotional and will cause even the most hard-hearted to shed a tear. Both Stanton and Kinski are very subtle and understated in their acting. It's true to their characters. Eight year old Hunter Carson plays Stanton's biological son, who was raised by his uncle (Stockwell). Carson certainly deserves mention in any conversation about great child performances on film. Paris, Texas is a masterpiece. There's no way around it. It's a movie that slowly reveals itself putting the audience right in the shoes of Stanton, who also is trying to remember his past and face it. The story was penned by playwright and actor Sam Shepard, though he doesn't appear in the film. Shepard, a very good playwright, has outdone himself with Paris, Texas surpassing his perhaps more well known, True West. Paris, Texas is a film that must not only be seen, but experienced. Sure the pacing is extremely slow, but as an audience member, use that to your advantage to suck in the picturesque orange southwest desert against the deep blue skys, and the poignant acting, and haunting soundtrack. There's no reason not to treat yourself to this uniquely American masterpiece meditation. It would make a great nightcap for a triple feature with two other simular themed American films, The Searchers and Taxi Driver.",

            "content": "I would say that Paris, Texas is not for everyone, but, truly, that can be said about every movie. But I will say this: fans of methodically paced, beautifully shot, existentially rooted, and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed. Paris, Texas is virtually my favorite movie, and a movie that, whether you like it or not, will leave some impact on you. It is a journey, an experience, an odyssey. Yes, it is long. Yes, it is slow. Defined plot points? Please.But what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. Travis Henderson, an older man, gruff and worn out with age, wanders out of the Texas desert after missing from his family for four years. He is mute, and apparently unaware of who he is. His brother Walt finds him, and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son, his sister in-law, and eventually, in a scene which I tear up just thinking about, his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe. While this film really doesn't rely on plot, it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen: a starkly beautiful, but uncompromising, place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. And then we get to performances. Everyone's great, so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a gentle, kind man, that, despite having personal demons, is a great fatherly figure (fine, maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski, who plays Jane, his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act, and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet, yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god, it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever, which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). In the end, these two carry the movie on their backs, and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry, but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me, I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's. So. What's more to say about Paris, Texas? It's a beautiful movie, one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story, and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'Anti-Romance'? It's not worth explaining here. See the movie, you'll understand.",

The movie looks beautiful, the scenery is stunning and the cinematography and editing are just textbook examples of how to photograph and edit a movie. There is also a haunting guitar score that adds to the emotion of this film, and a deeply moving and affecting story complete with a heart-rending confrontation. The pace is deliberately mannered, but that is not a bad thing at all, if anything it is a strength, and the script is beautifully written. The direction is also superb, while the film sees a rare leading role for Harry Dean Stanton and he is just a joy in this movie. In conclusion, Paris, Texas is a must-see, and I honestly think it is one of the best of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Second American best film of the eighties",
            "content": "It might seem odd to call this an \"American\" film, as its director, Wim Wenders is a German film director, who , unlike his predecessors, Lang, Murnau, Pabst, Von Sternberg , and Billy Wilder, has chosen to remain aloof from the Hollywood film industry. But Paris Texas is as much an  American film as Tocquevillle's \"Democracy in America\" is an American book. Sometimes it takes a foreigner ( In Wim Wenders' case, a foriegner who loves American music, American movies and American literature.) to look  into the American soul. In this case,it helps  that he is working with a great-and misunderstood- American  writer, Sam Shephard, and a great-and under appreciated- American actor, Harry Dean Stanton. I can not begin to convey who poetic, how haunting, and how beautiful this film is, and how artfully it probes the American heart. The scene where Stanton confronts his wife, and tells what he did and why he did it, must rank among the supreme scenes, not just of film, but of human life. It echoed  the great scenes of our literature, such as Ulysses meeting with Penelope, and the return of the prodigal son. In short, the only film which goes beyond it in the eighties is Raging Bull, and that is largely because of the volcanic power of Scorsese, that most self-crucifying of auteurs. in short, I would go so far as to say that Paris Texas is more than a \"ten'...Like Citizen Kane, like 2001, like Andrei Roublev, like Raging Bull , like the Searchers, like Pickpocket, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai and Ordet,it is an ELEVEN.

            "review_title": "The Continued Development of the Dark Romance with Cinema",
            "content": "Directed by cinematic lyricist Wim Wenders, \"Paris, Texas\" is a slow-burning masterpiece. Marked at first by stark, beautiful photography of the American Southwest, later by memorable dialogue and conversational intercourse, and lastly by sublime and emotionally involving character development, the film transcends the idea of an atmospheric mood piece to deliver an engrossing meditation on loneliness, alienation, family, and redemption.Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is fantastic in the lead role of Travis -- a man who had fallen into an emotional black hole and is then reunited with his brother (Dean Stockwell), who has been raising Travis' young son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), in an idyllic and loving suburban landscape with his foreign wife, Ann (Aurore Clement). As Travis slowly begins to grapple with his past and bond with his son, he soon realizes he must find his long, lost wife, Jane (an excellent and understated Nastassja Kinksi), whom he still deeply loves on some level, and abandoned their son years ago shortly after Travis went off the deep end.This all could've been the plot of Lifetime TV movie, but the European filmmaker's perspective on an all American slice of melodrama adds an undercurrent of intrigue in that you never know what these characters are going to do next. We soon find Travis practically abducting his son (who eagerly plays along) from his happy new family life to go on a trek to Houston to find Jane.The closing in scene in a Houston hotel where son and mother are reunited is one of the most fascinatingly rich scenes ever put on screen. Rarely does any one scene work to engage a viewer on so many levels: Firstly: There is a complex psychological framework that is set into place in the scenes prior between Stanton and Kinski in the peep show booth where she now works which are two of the most expertly photographed and brilliantly acted scenes I've ever witnessed. Travis has confessed all to his lost love, Jane, and she is clearly in dire straits. His attempt to reunite her with their son is both selfish (in that it is clearly not in the child's best interest to be raised by his emotionally troubled mother when he has loving foster parents waiting for him back home) and selfless, in that he truly feels his only way to repair the damage he has done is to leave after getting mother and son back together.Secondly: It is beautifully acted with Kinski's ghost-like entrance and young Hunter Carson's trepidation. Witness his hand slide across the wall looking for something to grip, and then his hands running through his hair before he finally decides to embrace her.Thirdly: It is exquisitely photographed. Earlier we see scenes of stark isolation as the child waits in the hotel room. Sofia Coppola later used a similar photographic technique in \"Lost in Translation\" to show how being alone in a big city and looking down from an anonymous hotel room window can be one of the loneliest things in the world.The final scene is both beautiful and emotional, and at the same time makes the viewer wonder, how will this all end? Yes, it is wonderful to see the child and mother reunite, but their new life could easily turn into an emotional hell because of the now absent Travis' misguided attempt at his own redemption.A film working on so many levels like this is best summed up in its own dialogue. In one scene where Travis is drunk and telling his son some family history, he essentially says that his father was more in love with an \"idea of her\" than with his actual mother. This is a fantastic movie for people more in love with the romantic \"idea of movies\" and their potential power as an art form than with any one movie in particular. As such, this ranks among the best I have ever seen.",

            "content": "There's a certain breed of actor that thrives on character roles and rarely gets the opportunity to excel as a leading player. Among my favorites are Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern and this film's principal player, Harry Dean Stanton. Hopper's most acclaimed role was probably that of the alcoholic, assistant basketball coach in \"Hoosiers\"; Bruce Dern similarly turned in an Oscar nominated performance as a booze-addled old man on the trail of cashing in a million dollar sweepstakes ticket in \"Nebraska\". For Stanton, it's this film that will serve well as part of his legacy in a long and distinguished career. Interestingly, among all three actors I've watched dozens of TV and movie Westerns in which one or the other have appeared, usually as villains, and always acquitting themselves well before the end credits rolled.Stanton's character here begins as a mystery, wandering out of a desert in a fevered daze, and transformed into a mute for a good part of the movie until his past is slowly reawakened with the help of his brother (Dean Stockwell). Impatient viewers will have a problem with the pace of the movie because not much happens in the early going, and repeated attempts by Walt Henderson (Stockwell) to bring brother Travis (Stanton) out of his shell are unsuccessful. Through gradual exposition, we learn that Travis's past included a marriage and a young son, now being raised by Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment). Where I have a little difficulty is the comparative ease in which Travis reestablishes a connection with seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson), and consequently, how easy it was for Hunter to decide that he wanted to traipse off with his biological father in a dubious search for his missing mother. Even more puzzling was the manner in which Travis and Hunter managed to track down Jane Henderson (Nastassja Kinski), happening to be in the right place at the right time to observe the woman making a bank deposit at a drive-in window. That sequence and the one that followed with Travis and Hunter giving chase seemed rather slapdash in execution, particularly since neither one of them had seen Jane in over four years, and the instant recognition (by Hunter no less) defied credibility in my estimation. What raises the bar for the film however occurs after Travis identifies his former wife as a peep show call girl, and anonymously identifies himself by virtue of relating their past history together to Jane, who initially identifies with his story in the abstract, but eventually realizes that she's speaking to Travis when details of the conversation can only relate to her own past life. The twist of the story meanwhile, is not one the viewer anticipates, as Travis doesn't desire to reconnect with Jane as a couple, but to satisfy a desire to reunite mother and son. Again, perhaps a dubious reconciliation given the circumstances of the family's break-up, but satisfying enough when we see the look of contented fulfillment on the face of Travis as he rides off after completing his mission. I can't say I really understand the entire dynamic of the family drama at the center of the story, but the picture makes a fascinating character study out of Travis and his search for reconciliation, even if he was working from a cold deck.",

            "review_title": "Unique portrait at family life in early 'eighties America.",
            "content": "\"Paris, Texas\" is by far one of the best films ever made. It's a well-photographed film; it's almost like a portrait. In the center you have the characters: Travis, Walt, Hunter, Jane, and Anne; and all around them you see the desert and the empty space and the places they inhabit. The major characters are all memorable, especially Harry Dean Stanton as Travis and Dean Stockwell as Walt.The film is about reunion. The first third of the film, dealing with the reunion of brothers Travis and Walt in the Texas desert, is both very touching and very real. You can sense the frustration on Walt's face when Travis doesn't want to talk to him about anything, and throughout the road trip, you begin to get more interested in Travis' ramblings to Walt about Paris, Texas. The second third deals with the reunion of Travis with his son, Hunter, and, to a lesser extent, since he's only been gone for less than a week, the reunion of Walt with his wife Anna and Hunter. This is by far my favorite part of the film, because it shows a young boy (Hunter) trying to readjust after his father returns after a four-year absence. Hunter (by the way, he's a great actor) is nice to Travis at first, but refuses to walk home from school with him because \"Everyone drives.\" The fact that director Wim Wenders focuses on this little portion of the film shows true family life--it expands the little \"sin\" that Hunter has done. This event sets up perhaps my favorite scene in any film: Hunter and Travis walking home \"together\"--on opposite sides of the street--with the boy mimicking the movements of his real father. In the following scene I'm touched because the neighborhood reminds me of home--Hunter stops and allows his father to cross the street to join him. There is also a scene (also with no dialogue) that deserves mention--the family watching Super 8mm film of a family fishing trip. Here we see Jane for the first time (a beauty), and we get a portrait of the happy family while the film plays background music for us. It's a wonderful scene that's executed beautifully. The film of the fishing trip allows Hunter to make an observation to Anne about his father--he sees by the way Travis looked at Jane that Travis still loves her very much.The last third of the film comes as a real shock, and I won't spoil it for anyone because this third of the film is what made me REALLY love the entire film. The sequence of events in the final third actually came out of left field, because I was never really expecting that. You should have figured out, though, that there is a reunion between Travis and his estranged wife, Jane. Harry Dean Stanton's monologue is perhaps one of the best ever caught on film. It's really long but you hear every word and every pause. And what I like about that particular scene is the lighting--notice how the sunlight comes in through the window in Jane's room, and suddenly near the end you realize that it's been artificial light after all. There is a similar lighting effect in \"A Clockwork Orange\"--during Alex's chat with F. Alexander and his two co-conspirators over wine and spaghetti.Overall, \"Paris, Texas\" is a great film that should be noted both for its photography and for its realistic look at family life. These are people who are a real family--opinionated, angry, happy, sad, melodramatic, judgmental, high-strung, incommunicado, etc. They refuse sometimes to admit their true feelings and that is exactly what makes a family a family sometimes, the fact that you can't say what you really want to say at a certain time.This is the kind of film directors really want to make--small, realistic, poignant...and with zero special effects.",

            "content": "Presumed dead having gone missing over four years ago, Travis arrives in a small desert town \u0096 thirsty and mute and passing out on the floor. A doctor identifies him and contacts Travis' brother, Walt, who makes the trip to collect his \"dead\" brother and bring him back home. Walt also brings bad news \u0096 he has been raising Travis' son (Hunter) as his own since he was dumped on his doorstep by Travis' wife Jane \u0096 who then just disappeared herself. Trying desperately to build a relationship with his son, Travis also decides to track down Jane and make his family whole again.Over the years this film seems to have grown in stature and reputation, partly because it is perhaps not as widely seen as it once was. For that reason I made sure I watched it when I got the chance recently and was struck immediately by one of the main reasons that I kept watching the film at times, that being the blend of beautiful visuals and haunting score. Normally films that have weak narrative will not suck me in but strong visual style (isn't that what the complaint about most summer blockbusters is?) however the striking look to the first parts of the film really drew me into it even when the plot did not. As everyone else in the world says, Ry Cooder's score was very well used and that's all I'll say on that issue since too many reviews seem to focus on this as if it were the most important part of the film.The plot is, lets be honest, very slowly delivered \u0096 painfully slow at times; but yet it managed to fill almost 2\u00bd hours quite easily and surprised me by how it suddenly became an impressive film when, for large sections of it, I felt left out, disinterested and distracted. Of course many younger viewers may not make it that far because it is very slow at times and this will put many off before it gets better. It does build well and it is really with the scenes between Travis and Jane that the film is at its strongest; I'm sure others have different interpretations but I do like to think that Travis was dead and only returned to reunite his family \u0096 whether dead to them or really dead is another matter but the ending was nicely low key and lacking the sickly sentiment that could have killed it. The cast are a big reason this works because many of them do play really well. Stanton is great and he does tend to steal the film from those around him \u0096 whether mute or unseen behind mirrored glass. He is excellent in his scenes with Kinski, who more than holds her own in a smaller role. Stockwell is good in support and Carson turns in a likable performance that pretty much manages to avoid \"cute kid\" destruction.Overall this is not a perfect film and many viewers coming to it on the back of its reputation may struggle to stay with a plot that develops very slowly indeed without a great deal of explanation. The acting is good, the score is very well used while the direction and cinematography is close to mesmerising at times. The script does deliver but I was never totally into it until the final third; fortunately at this point things become much clearer and much more interesting and, despite taking an age to get anywhere, I was ultimately glad that I had watched it and had enjoyed the total film more than I had enjoyed individual moments of it.",

The lead character (Travis) is an older man who in the first ten minutes of the film wonders alone in the desert like a horse with no name, seemingly suffering from severe trauma. But Travis' later behavior and the behavior of other characters in the film are not believable, given this opening gambit.However, if we discard our need to interpret behavior rationally, then the film works, either as a dream or, more generically, as a parable of modern day America, from the viewpoint of a European film director. The characters and their journey through the film's story are symbolic of American culture as a whole, with its ever-present loneliness, urban alienation, emotional separation, and general rootlessness.The film's visuals and music combine to prop up the thin story, and give the film its enduring cultural theme. Cinematographer Robby Muller's images are stunning. His location shots both in the desert and in the urban jungle, using polarizing filters, are works of true photographic art. The images, with their florescent greens, reds, blues, and yellows in dim light are just terrific. More than any dialogue could, these visuals effectively convey the loneliness, alienation, and lost love that are so characteristically American. And Ry Cooder's simple but haunting Tex-Mex guitar sounds amplify this grim mood.The film's main flaw is its length. With a runtime of 150 minutes, some parts of the film could have been edited out, without loss of the film's message.\"Paris, Texas\" is a memorable art house film about the modern American experience. Like other art house films, the story is not necessarily to be taken literally. Instead, the story provides narrative support for the visuals, the music, and other film elements, the combination of which imparts some broader or deeper social message than could be conveyed by story alone.",

He's terrific, and the only flaws I could maybe point out were the script's fault and not his. Kinski is very good as well. Like I said, the script has some issues for me, with the main character arc being a little hard to buy, and the two and a half hour running time could have been trimmed without loss of mood or substantial content.

That mystery is eventually unraveled when Travis and his wife, Jane (played by Nastassja Kinski), meet again and we learn more about their sorrowful and bruising history.\"Paris, Texas\" is largely about two people who are capable of extreme passion and emotion but who are unable to cope with what those passions and emotions bring out in them. Travis and Jane were overwhelmed by their responsibility to each other and their son -- a life voluntarily chosen became a grim trap from which one would literally kill the other to escape. This part of the story is only told to us, never shown. What we see are the regret, remorse and nostalgia felt by two people who will always have a strong connection -- both emotionally and literally through their boy -- but who know they can never again be together. At the end, Travis drives away into the night, and though his ultimate fate is ambiguous, we feel that he's leaving his wife and child for good. Whether to protect them, or himself (or maybe both) is for us to decide.Grade: A",

It's Minimalist Script and Story are rendered Masterfully. There isn't a False Note from the Actors and Ry Cooder's sliding Score is superb. The Cinematography is at times Breathtaking and Glows gloriously, awash in an amazing display of Soft toned Colors.The Film's Detractors are all over it because of its Length and Simple Story, Long Scenes of Dialog Pausing, and Pacing that is nothing less than long Stretches that are meant to be Thoughtful and Thrive on Gazing.It is Harry Dean Stanton's Film as He center Cuts the Story suffering from slight Dementia and OCD. But the support from Dean Stockwell and then Nastassja Kinski are Remarkable. Child Actor Hunter Carson in a Debut that is Intelligent and softly Underplayed. Aurore Cl\u00e9ment as Stockwell's Wife has the least impact but manages a Small Heartfelt Part.Overall, it is an Art Film for sure. A European Eying America up Close and is Not a Movie that Everyone will Enjoy. It is Longer than most, Slower than most, and the Story is Less Extravagant than most. Patient Viewers are in for a Treat as the Movie Methodically unfolds an utterly Unique Experience in Movie-Going.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is my first ever taste of acclaimed director Wim Wenders, and while the film isn't exactly sweet; it's certainly not bitter enough to steer itself away from the realms of the masterpiece. Paris, Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia. When his brother, Walt, finds him, he helps him to remember his life, and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son, and then with the mother of his child. Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill, and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience. Just like the town of it's title; Paris, Texas is basically a film about being lost. I (and I'm sure many other people) didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas, and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie.The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors, but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side. Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role, and does a good job in, at first, portraying a man consumed with amnesia; and then consumed with the time he has lost. Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie, but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads. Every minute she is on screen is a delight, however, and she lights up the screen with both of her talents; looks and acting ability. The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance; i.e. one that isn't incredibly annoying, but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one. The climax to the tale is more than satisfying, and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film. Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it, and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie. Recommended.",

            "content": "This film is a classic in my opinion.  The story is very strongly influenced by its writer's, Sam Shepard, exploration of the human condition.  The film is not for everyone.  Wim Wenders paces the storyline accordingly to the psyche and struggle of the main character, and the concept of searching for answers to his natural state of mind by returning to the place of his conception is a well thought out and intriguing premise for this film.I have seen this film more than seven times, and love the slow pace because it allows me to be drawn into that world completely and really have the chance to get to know each character.  Recommended to anyone with an interest in psychology, cinematography, Sam Shepard's style of story-telling, and movies that walk to their own beat.  Natascha Kinski and Stanton are excellent.I give it 8 stars (9 if they would release it letterboxed on DVD)",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 30 years. The movie hasn't changed. I remember every scene. So that means it's ME that has changed. While I really liked the movie on its 1984 release, it's only now that I truly appreciate the brilliance of the script, the music, the direction, the photography and the acting \u0085 much less the wide range of emotions.Director Wim Wenders has long been a favorite at Cannes Film Festival, and this one took home the prestigious Palme d'Or. Since then, the film has often been mentioned as one of the best movies of the 1980's, and after this most recent screening (courtesy of the Dallas Film Society), I wholeheartedly concur.Opening in a most unusual manner \u0085 the lead character comes stumbling out of the Texas dessert and doesn't utter a word for the first 20-25 minutes \u0085 this film immediately strikes you as something unique \u2013 definitely not cookie cutter. Trying to outguess the script is a waste of time. It's best to just watch it unfold in a believable and sometimes awkward way.In a rare lead role, long time character actor Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis. We soon enough learn that Travis disappeared four years ago leaving behind a wife and young son. We also learn that his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) and Walt's wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been taking care of the boy, and Hunter (Hunter Carson) considers them his parents (his mom ran off too).Walt and Anne invite Travis to stay with them and re-connect with his son, but they are caught off guard when the two really click and they take off to find Jane, the wife/mother. Their charming (but less-than-professional) stakeout leads to the discovery that Jane is working in a sex shop, spending her days talking to a 2 way mirror with lonely men she can't see. One of the most remarkable on screen soliloquies ever seen occurs on Travis' second trip to see Jane (Natassja Kinski). It's a heartfelt story that plays out as an explanation, an apology, and a plan for moving forward. It's his way of making reparations and finally doing the right thing (as he sees it).As with most classic films, the backstory offers some interesting tidbits and the players are fun to catch up with. This story was originally written by the great Sam Shepard. Mr. Shepard is a Pulitzer Prize winner, an award winning playwright, and well known actor (Oscar nominated for playing Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff). Director Wenders then brought in L.M. \"Kit\" Carson to add and revise the script while on set. Carson's son (with actress Karen Black) Hunter plays the boy in the film, and he delivers one of the best, least affected, child performances of all time. Kit went on to write the screenplay for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) and had a significant acting role in Running on Empty (1988). His son Hunter is still a working actor today. Mr. Wenders was one of the German New Wave of directors along with Herzog and Fassbinder, and his Wings of Desire (1987) would make a terrific double feature with this one. Mr. Stockwell was a very successful child actor in the 1940's and is best known for his work in Blue Velvet and TV's Quantum Leap. Ms. Kinski is the daughter of Klaus Kinski and is fondly remembered for her roles in Tess (1979) and Cat People (1982), though she still works today as well. Harry Dean Stanton is now 88 years old. He served in WWII and was present during the Battle of Okinawa. His acting career began in the 1950's and he still works periodically today. In addition to nearly 200 acting credits, he has had a pretty nice career as a musician. His band built a large cult following. Some of his most popular acting roles have been in Cool Hand Luke, The Godfather II, Alien, Repo Man, Escape From New York and Pretty in Pink. The music in the film is provided by Ry Cooder, who is a tremendous slide guitarist and has worked with some of the all-time greats in the music business \u2013 The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison and Neil Young, among others. Cooder is a multi-Grammy winner and re-teamed with Wenders for the Oscar nominated Buena Vista Social Club a few years later. The music is an exceptional compliment to the movie, as is the camera work of Robby Muller, who also works frequently with Wenders.This story of loss and loneliness is an easy one to overlook, but when a film holds up well for 30 years \u0085 and affects you differently depending on your own lot in life \u0085 its legacy is secure.",

Wenders drip- feeds information, slowly building a picture of the characters and their stories.

            "content": "It's hard for me to select just one movie as my very favorite, but if I had to, \"Paris, Texas\" would probably be it.As I recall, I first saw it while I was a student in a small theater in '84 or '85; a year or two later I recorded it from cable to Beta tape.  After not having watched it for years, I've played it again a few times over the last couple of years.  Many movies I recall having liked in the past are just big disappointments when I watch them years later.  That's not the case with this one!  Then I was single; now I'm married.  That alone makes a big difference, but I also find that even some small elements now have more meaning.  I previously attached no significance to the scene where Travis was determined to find the same rental car in which he and Walt had previously driven.  But how often people do sentimentally and fiercely cling to, objectively, unimportant things in reaction to having had their hearts and spirits broken more than a few times over important things.  I often recall this scene when observing some instance of this in myself or others.I am struck by what opposite opinions people have of this movie.  If you have few problems relating to other people, or you don't care much about relating to other humans, and little in your life disappoints you over long spells of your life, you will probably find this movie very boring. I sort of envy people in this situation, though before I would want to wish myself to be like that, I pause at how much my life would be changed and how little of my personality would be left, if I did.I, too, eagerly await the release of this movie on high quality DVD, and hope that my still barely viewable Beta will last til then.\"Oh, Travis.\"",

            "content": "From the decade of blockbusters and popcorn movies, Paris, Texas (1984), winner of the Palme d'Or, is something else. Slow, long, depending on emotion, dialogue and characters, it gradually emerges as something worthwhile. Starting off in the Texan desert with a man picking up his brother, Travis, lost for four years and mute, the beginning to me seemed not so much intriguing as stiff, the performances a little unconvincing. Travis begins to talk and is reunited with his son, Hunter, who's now 7 and lives with his uncle Walt and aunt Anne. Hunter's mom, Jane, is still missing. Travis and Hunter get to know each other, with Anne concerned she and Walt will lose Hunter. Things are picking up as a family drama unfolds, and one gets the impression something extraordinary has happened.Surprisingly, Walt and Anne drop out of the picture with a lot of the film still to go, as Travis and Hunter return to Texas with a lead on where Jane is. Travis finds Jane in a sleazy place, where she \"talks\" with men. He tells their story, one of a happy marriage giving way to money woes, alcoholism, postpartum depression and abuse. Maybe it's not such an extraordinary story after all- but it's told in an extraordinary way. The look of Jane in that room with the two-way mirror is nearly surreal; that surreal side is reflected in the title. When you hear Paris, you don't think of Texas. But Paris, Texas is a real place, and there's realism in this film, too. This film gradually develops a sense of awe to it, and leaves its own distinct footprint.",

I first learned of him when my parents rented his \"Until the End of the World\" (my mom even bought a copy of the soundtrack). One of his most famous works is 1984's \"Paris, Texas\", winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival that year. Even understanding the plot, the movie is not easy to define. It's as though the movie itself is as vast as as the desert traversed by Harry Dean Stanton's character. One might interpret the movie as a search for life's overall meaning, whether in the swanky suburbs of Los Angeles or in a gritty peep show club in Houston. Indeed, the movie's length emphasizes the long time that it can take to achieve a goal.I don't know how much more I can say about the movie, except that no film buff can afford to miss it.

            "content": "Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance.Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering.All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.",

And this is nowhere more true, it seems to me, than when there are children involved.Travis and Jane had a bad marriage. It was mostly his fault, but in truth they both showed signs of instability. When the big blow-up came, the shrapnel scattered far and wide. One such piece was in the form of their 4-year-old son, Hunter.Now, Hunter was lucky. Unlike his parents, who disappeared into obscurity, he ended up as the \"foster-child\" of Travis's brother and his wife. They were stable, happily married, and gave him a loving home. He was as content as a boy could be under the circumstances.Uh-oh, don't count your chickens, Hunter. Four years later, out of the festering sands of the Mojave desert and looking like some sort of moulting lizard, emerges Travis. He is heading for some obscure destination \u0096 possibly his dusty plot at Paris, Texas, where he might have been considering spending the rest of his life growing tree tomatoes, or anything else far removed from the responsibilities of parenthood. Instead, he encounters civilisation, which contacts his brother. Somewhat against his will, Travis is reunited with the son whom he abandoned.Now, to give him his credit, Travis is a man who realises that he has made some serious mistakes. Had the rest of the movie been about how he confronted those mistakes and actually did something about them and then won back his son's love bit by bit I'd have given it 10 out of 10. The final shot could have been that touching scene when Hunter stops and Travis crosses the road and they go up the hill together. Fade out.But, no. Instead of doing that, he decides to atone for his mistakes by taking his now 7-year-old son away from his happy and stable new home, on a journey down to Houston to find his mother. Hunter is to be sacrificed for the sake of Travis's conscience.In spite of discovering that Jane is unmarried and working as a nightclub hostess (you could say, a prostitute), he leaves the boy with her and runs off. No doubt he is heading for that arid patch at Paris, Texas once again. Except this time he probably thinks he has at long last done something good in his life.I can't agree. One of the worst exhibitions of parental irresponsibility I have ever seen in a movie is when Travis gets his son to phone his foster parents to tell them he has left home. This, of course, is after putting them to a lot of needless worry wondering where he was.Poor Hunter. How long before she quits on him again? Or hits the bottle? Or, before he gets abused by one of her clients? Oh, but the music's great. And the acting. And Texas.",

This time, he (played by Harry Dean Stanton) is more than just lost, having gone into the wilderness in an apparent amnesiac stupor. He is found by his brother (Dean Stockwell), who brings him somewhat back to reality. The kid (Hunter Carson) is a central, meaningful key bringing everything together. He is the innocent victim of a confusing circle of jealously and violence that only becomes clear in the final scenes of the film.\"Paris, Texas\" is a quiet, quiet film. Sam Shepard wrote a script that is more about actions than dialogue, which makes it all the more curious that the final twenty-some minutes of the film feature little but conversation. The final scene between Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski drags on into the heart of darkness, the deeply painful memories of two terribly broken individuals and how they go on with life. This isn't a quick interaction that draws tears to the surface and lets you continue with your life. It dives in deep and doesn't come up for air until every last inch of emotion is pulled to the surface.Robby M\u00fcller, the cinematographer who worked with Wenders on many of his films, helps to make \"Paris, Texas\" one of the most breathtakingly beautiful visual experiences ever. The colours are so vibrant yet stunningly realistic. For all of its emotional depth, this is a thing of great surface beauty. Inside and out, it is achingly powerful film.",

In fact, it is an offense.For a director that first was inspired by images and then looked for stories to fill them and give them reasons to be released as films (he says this in a book). Wenders achieves his high technical and vision point concerning his way of thinking, not just film but life in this masterpiece.He had before discussed the production of images and how this affects our way of seeing and perceiving life. But in Paris, Texas the image, the landscapes really becomes a character, not just to give a good photography and make those 2 1/2 hours that the movie lasts oh!!, so beatiful to watch!!, or to make us get in its atmosphere... The landscapes are so important as the words, or actions, between the characters are, it really touches people surrounded by it, it influences some how their personalities. I mean, each photograme tries to bring this relation.It is beautiful how Wenders can build his caracters personalities, not by the way they think or act, but what impresses them, what visually interests them - like when Travis is watching not the airplane, but its shadow on the ground while it takes off.After all that, i can just say that the rest of the whole story is made by really beautiful, touching and delicate situations of a man's life trying to reorder the lost pieces from a puzzle.And, yes, the conversation between Travis and his ex-wife by the last half hour to the end is one of the most touching moments seen on the screen.",

Kinski's character knew where her son was all these years but never contacted him- I don't see that as someone who loves her son that much. Overall, great camera-work, scenery, soundtrack, and acting but the plot twists in this movie just were too unbelievable.",

It starts off with some stunning desert images where a Harry Dean Stanton wanders around until he is found by his brother. The enigmatic soundtrack stays in tune with the situations. The cinematography adds a spacious but lonely feel. Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell and Natassja Kinski are exceptional performers. They all excelletnly downplay their parts. The film starts off with little dialogue but as the goings-on proceed, the dialogues/monologues more or less take over and become stronger as they reveal a starkness of the characters' inner thoughts. This is especially beautifully captured in the later scenes between Stanton and Kinski. 'Paris, Texas' is also intricately layered and I am sure to discover more things with each repeat viewing. Sheperd's writing is wonderful as he weaves complex themes into the story and memerizes the viewer. In a nutshell, 'Paris, Texas' is a haunting and powerful picture that, once it captivates the audience, it lingers in mind long after the closing credits have rolled.",

This film was probably an early warning to us all of how life can easily overwhelm without us realising it. It is also virtually unique in the successful portrayal of a man who is deeply lost in his innermost thoughts that the outside world becomes almost a minutiae. Mr Stanton encapsulates this mood perfectly and this is probably his best performance ever. The most moving scene (and there are many) might be when he reviews some old cine film of his life (a normal happy love story which surely could not have gone wrong so badly)before he walked away from it all. I can't help but think this is a real life epistle which could be a marker for how life has overtaken the human race in the last 20 years.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed a majority of this movie. As the others stated, it's beautifully done, and the acting is superb. I enjoy \"road\" movies and slowly uncovering the pieces of this man's life as he goes through the journey of Texas and California. I mean the \"amnesia\" is not believable, but I'll set that aside. I liked the stark contrast between Travis and his brother. One, an irresponsible, selfish drifter-type, the other a responsible, caring man. And I thought the kid's acting was believable - the way Hunter processed the new idea of having his biological father in his life and potentially meeting his biological mother.However, I have a problem with the third act. At the end of the movie, it felt like the director wanted the audience to feel relieved and content that Hunter was reunited with his mother. And that we should empathize with Travis driving off into the distance, as he had fulfilled his duty. But I feel exactly the opposite. This is an unsettling ending.Neither of these people are fit to be parents or make life-altering decisions for anyone. They both need years of therapy before being left to their own devices. Some of the other commenters mentioned she was not emotionally stable to be a mother. Although true, I think they're slightly missing the point. Travis emotionally and physically abused this woman! Tied her to the stove?! Of course she needs some help recovering before this kid gets thrust upon her. And there's a couple of sick societal norms being thrust upon us here - that this woman would be quick to jump to being a mom to this kid. That the maternal instinct is just going to pop into place! And then, that it's acceptable that the father is no longer in the picture because he's going to go find himself or something. No, Travis is an immature excuse of a human being and this decision is garbage.Poor Hunter, ripped away from a stable home. I use the word stable because they seem to be emotionally, financially, and physically well-adjusted enough to raise a healthy kid. Not because they're a married couple with a house. Anyway, poor Hunter is in for a treat, all because his father needed to soothe his own conscience.And we're supposed to agree to this? Not me. However, with that being said, I still enjoyed this movie overall.",

Kit Carson, and directed by Wim Wenders (\"Wings of Desire\"), this is one of the best films of the 80's and, well, of all-time.Well-deserved winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes '84, the story of Travis Henderson (probably the best performance of Harry Dean Stanton's long, underrated career - the man's a real American treasure, yet is never mentioned in most Great Actors' list) and his little son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), as they hit the road looking for their ex-wife/mother (Nastassja Kinski), respectively, paints a picture of tortured lives in southwest America. The feeling of the very German Wenders's narrative, though, is universal. I'd compare it to the fantastic Taiwanese Ang Lee's vision of America in masterpieces such as \"The Ice Storm\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\". Ry Cooder's score is also spotless and helps create the perfect mood for the story. A film to be seen over and over again. 10/10.",

            "content": "At the start of the movie I'd expected something thought-provoking, a dish of precious food for brain, something to reflect upon. And I got it. But the surprise was that ''Paris, Texas'' is much more than this. It is a powerful emotion-driven story about redemption (some like to call it ''an anti-romance'' but I think a man ''waking up'' and trying to make up for his mistakes instead of just verbally embellishing his actions is the most romantic gesture ever to be done).I don't intend to get too sentimental but I have to admit that I cried not once, but twice. I'm not going to give any major spoilers, there is a scene that succeeds the booth scene that is less talked about but not easily forgotten. It's very heart-warming and delicate, no matter if you're a parent or not. I was almost sobbing at the sight of that scene. You'll know what I'm talking about.I also have to admit that sometimes you can be really blind since I saw Nastassja Kinski in Tess last year and didn't recognize her here. Maybe because the movie's set in a different era, the make-up, hairstyle & clothing is different but still... this is not an excuse. She has the same ''Nastassja femininity'' in her character as in Tess, her accent is there and I can't believe I didn't recognize that nose which I can't really get out of my mind. After all, it's a guilty pleasure of mine, admiring her countenance. Diverging a bit, I might even empathize more with beautiful people in real life, even though I acknowledge we should empathize as much as we can with people no matter what their aspect is.Harry Dean Staton was also excellent playing the father who's trying to reconnect to his family and life and fill that interior vacuum inside. The rest of the cast did a great job as well, though I feel Hunter's aunt and uncle deserved an ending of their own, a reward for their effort. After all, raising up a child for several years is no easy task.And last but not least, I praise Ry Cooder's nostalgic road movie score, Wim Wender's extraordinary direction, Robby M\u00fcller's cinematography and all the crew that helped the creation of this unique experience.A 9,75 out of 10 from me.",

But the few times that I have seen it since it has made deep impressions on me that only a few films have done. Harry Dean Stanton's performance should be ranked among the great performances of all time in the movies. He doesn't have to say much in the first half of the film but the expressions on his face tell us he is in pain, almost like his soul has been ripped from his body. But we only find out later the reason for this.(Spoilers) Travis (Stanton) we find is suffering from guilt and the pain of losing the things in life that he loved the most. Most men that have loved will see part of themselves in Travis' stories of how jealousy drove him to not let his wife out of his sight, but we don't take it as far as Travis, drink drove his jealousy to new heights. Even though some of his stories would appall us, now we have seen how he destroyed his life, or the drink destroyed him, we now feel sorry for him. The two monologues with Jane are, in my opinion, two scenes that will stay with every viewer for a long time. Travis cannot even look at Jane because it would cause him too much pain and break him even further. But before he leaves Jane he needs to tell her why he did the things to her that he did, only then could Travis find some peace and maybe regain a part of the soul that he lost.Like John Wayne in \"The Searchers\" Travis realises at the end of the film that he has to go and leave alone, that he ruined his chance of a happy life with Hunter and Jane, or he realised that he could never be happy with her, for the intense love that he felt for Jane would always bring jealousy and suspicion would that would always be at the front of his mind.The music also deserve a mention. The southern, bluesy slide guitar by Ry Cooder is so simple but so effective in adding to the lazy pace of the movie.",

And, it's the stort of movie that critics generally adore and the common folk generally find long and confusing. Now I am not saying either view is wrong...in fact, I could easily see both sides of this. So you need to ask yourself before watching it, \"Am I the sort of person who loves very, very, very long and slow films?\". If not, please don't bother watching it. And, if so, you may love it or find that the payoff just isn't worth it. As for me, I just wish the film had more energy and had been trimmed a tad....it would have, at least for me, made the film watching experience enjoyable.The story begins at some grubby clinic in the middle of nowhere. You never really know where this is...perhaps Mexico, perhaps somewhere in the American Southwest. Regardless, Walt (Dean Stockwell) gets a phone call from a doctor at the clinic telling him they found his brother, Travis (Harry Dean Stanton), wandering in the desert...dazed and mute. Walt takes the long trip to get him and Travis is, at least for the first 30 or so minutes of the film, a bit of a zombie. How he got there and what had happened to him isn't discussed and the trip back is long and strange.After about half an hour, Travis begins to open up...just a bit. But again, how he got into the middle of the desert and why he was gone for four years....well, that isn't addressed in any way until very late in the story. Slowly, very slowly, you learn that his wife also disappeared about the same time....and their son has been living with Walt and his wife for some time. Later, rather out of the blue, Travis and his boy take off from California (where Walt lives) and they head to Texas to look for Jane (Nastassja Kinski)--Travis' wife and the boy's mother.While the movie is about two and a half hours long, it feels like at least three or four due to the very slow and deliberate pacing...as well as the emotionally muted acting. No one (in particular Travis) has any energy and although you'd think Walt and the others would scream and yell at Travis for just dropping off the face of the earth....they never do. Because of that, the movie felt very artificial to me...very much like a movie and not real life...which is odd, as Wenders seems to be trying to make the film look more like real life.. A bit more energy sure would have worked for me! But, what do I know? After all, the film is considered by many to be a classic and the movie is in IMDB's Top 250....and is critically adored.Overall, a film that is NOT for everyone...heck, it's probably not for MOST people. All I know is that the cinematography looked good and the acting, at times, was quite good...but at least for some folks it would have worked so much better had the film been tighter and the characters less zombie-like. I did like the evocative film score.By the way, I know that Nastassja Kinski was a popular actress for a brief period in American films in 1984, but it seemed strange to cast her and then ask her to do a Texas accent. She did a good job of it....I am not complaining. But it is a confusing choice. Perhaps she and Wenders were friends or knew each other.",

There are some secrets in Travis' past, specifically what he has been doing for the past 4 years and how he and his wife (Natassja Kinski) ended up being separated. After heading on a journey to try to re-unite with her, bringing his 8 year old son (Hunter Carson) in tow, Travis must face the depths of evil within his own soul and try to discover if it's even possible to rebuild a life that was once destroyed.I think this is a marvelous film in terms of the execution.... it really keeps you interested even far beyond the point where the \"secrets\" are being revealed. In many ways the film plays on themes of voyeurism -- why are we interested in this story? Why do men go to Jane (Kinski) to talk about their issues? I think this film might mean something different to each person who sees it. The film is really sad in the sense in which it shows the consequences of some of our actions, how we destroy our own happiness. Jane tells Travis that she had to send Hunter away because she did not want to fill the void in her life with her son. Yet we know already that Travis cannot fill that void either. I think the film is not really \"saying\" anything -- it's more asking us to question the way we treat others and to realize that our relationships are the things that define us in many ways. I see this in Jane/Travis' relationship and also in the emerging father/son relationship between Travis and Hunter. For a few days Hunter is actually calling both Walt and Travis \"dad\" -- this awkward situation is something that work-a-day good guy Walt thinks is perfectly fine, but Travis I think realizes that the \"void\" cannot be filled with two dads.Wonderful film and I look forward to repeat viewings.",

After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife.In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic.The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at.On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault.This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking.

Starring Harry Dean Stanton as Travis Henderson, a man who suffered a nervous breakdown and estranged himself from his family as a result, the film is both a deep character study and an effective family drama in the same time.The movie begins with some beautiful images of the desert, vast and desolate. We are then introduced to Travis (Stanton) a man wandering through the desert for reasons unknown to the viewer. As he enters a bar, he collapses due to dehydration and is taken to a doctor by the bar owner. He is later reunited with his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), who came from California to his aid and had not seen him for 4 years. We know little about Travis' character and the fact that he initially refuses to speak to anyone only adds up to this mystery. As the story progresses, we slowly find out more about his background, we find out that he has a son named Hunter who is in the care of Walt and his wife, Ann (Aurore Clement).Harry Dean Stanton plays the main character and this is probably his best role. His best moment in the film is his conversation with Jane (Nastassja Kinski), a scene in which he showcases his whole talent. His performance is all the more impressive as he is supposed to express a full range of emotions in the beginning of the movie when his character is not speaking. I also thought that Nastassja Kinski was good in her role, despite the fact that she had quite a short amount of screen time.The film is character driven and we are interested in Travis' actions because we really care about him. Wim Wenders manages to direct the movie with precision and manages to keep the viewer connected. We want to find out why Travis wants to go to Paris, Texas, or why he was wandering through the desert in the first place. What I liked about this film is that you don't know how it's going to end, there are actually moments when you don't know what the main character is going to do next. This is probably the merit of writer Sam Shepard, who is probably better known to the public as an actor. I also found the movie's score to be great. Far from being very elaborate, it manages to bring the audience to where the action takes place. As a downside, the film might seem a little slow at times, but this is necessary for the build up.\"Paris, Texas\" is an art-house film that presents a realistic story. I believe Wenders was just a little short of creating a masterpiece here. Nevertheless, this is a great movie and I think that it deserves more recognition.My rating: 8/10",

Sure she sends a sum of money at regular intervals but given that she has made no attempt to contact him for for years it clearly is not about real love. People who like the film talk about how it deals with loss, alienation and an inability to communicate. Fine. But why is it supposed to be a good thing to dump the boy into that nightmare?

Travis wandered alone in the desert in a self made hell because of his own sinful nature. Marrying a much younger woman only fueled his inner demons leading to a mess for his entire family. What a fool. Both he and his wife searched for years for a replacement for something they considered permanently lost only to lead unfulfilled existences on the border of living. I liked the way the story went on and on with no explanations about what caused Travis to trek into the wilds and then sprung it on the viewer in one gut wrenching scene in a Houston cubicle. The dialogue was never boring, but instead concise and well delivered, however, I did have a bit of trouble understanding the German lady's accent. 4 stars.",

            "content": "American filmmaking in the 80s was rapidly changing. After the huge success of films like Star-Wars and Jaws, Hollywood was only concerned with making massive epic blockbusters. That's not necessarily a bad thing, several of these films are timeless masterpieces that redefined cinema like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Die Hard. But the popularity of large action films unfortunately resulted in smaller personal films essentially becoming nearly nonexistent. However all of this changed in 1984 when Wim Wenders film Paris Texas was released.It's funny how such an important American film was directed by a German. Paris Texas was the film that got Wenders noticed. It didn't receive any commercial success, (the film only barely broke even.) but it was a critical hit. Paris Texas is the story of a strange man that suddenly walks out of the desert in Texas one day, this man turns out to be someone called Travis Henderson, (played by Harry Dean Staton.) the people who found him call his brother, Walt Henderson, (played by Dean Stockwell.) who then flies in to go get him. Travis acts strange and antisocial, but we don't know why. Eventually we learn that Travis has been missing for 4 years, and Walt and his wife Anne have been taking care of Travis's son, Hunter. (played by Hunter Carson.) Hunter at first isn't very excited to meet Travis but they bond overtime. Anne and Walter tell Travis that they haven't heard from Travis's wife, Jane, (played by Nastassji Kinski, Klaus Kinski's daughter.) in long time, but she still deposits money for Hunter's future in a bank in Houston. Travis and his son then go on a journey to try and find Jane. The plot of Paris Texas is very simple, and yet it is universal and timeless. The audience can't help but get caught up in the story of Travis, Hunter, and Jane. We want to know what happened four years ago, and we want to know if they'll ever find her, and what happens if they will. Another thing that is pure genius about the plot is the pacing. The pacing of the film is very slow, and it is slow pacing used at its finest. The story unfolds in such a way that it allows the audience to follow along without getting lost, and keeping us interested. If the film had a shorter running time, it would just not be nearly as good as it is now. The actors in Paris Texas deserve special recognition, they all do amazing jobs but Nastassji Kinski and Harry Dean Staton are especially amazing. This is not to say that the other actors aren't great, but these two go above and beyond what anyone could have expected. The character ark of Travis is one of the best in any film ever. Paris Texas is at heart a redemption story about a man who has let his family done and now needs to make up for it. And it is one for the nicer redemption films out there. It's not a violent depressing blood-bath like Unforgiven or Irreversible, no Paris Texas takes a much lighter approach to the story. That's not to say that Unforgiven and Irreversible are bad or that Paris Texas won't make you cry, both of these are still true statements. The films slow pacing helps the actors out with their stunning performances. Since the film is so long, it allows us to spend a lot of time with them really getting to know them. We would not be able to fully understand the characters motivations if the film was any shorter.Paris Texas also has a distinct style and feel. One big way that the style is conveyed to us is through the cinematography which is wonderfully shot by Robby M\u00fcller, (Breaking the Waves, Dead Man, Mystery Train.) M\u00fcller is able to fully capture the empty vast landscape of Texas, in a way that was only topped by the Coen brothers No Country For Old Men. And anyone whose seem the film will tell you about the films amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is a simple yet beautiful. (this phrase basically describes the entirety of Paris Texas.) It's able to perfectly set the tone for the film. The production design is also fantastic everything from the spray painted abandoned buildings in the beginning to the desolate peep show lib at the end. With a film as impressive as Paris Texas, it's hard to believe that Wim Wenders made it in only a 4-5 weeks. Paris Texas was unfortunately not a commercial hit, but it was a massive critical success. Paris Texas swept of all the top prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, including the Palme d'Or. It also won the BAFTA for best director and was nominated for best film. Roger Ebert's added it to his Great Movies list in 2002. And Kurt Cobain said that it was his favorite film of all time. Paris Texas reminds us of a time when films were simpler, when all you needed was a well written compelling story to be good. Oh and God damn what an ending.9.8/10",

After being abandoned by his wife, a husband and father from California drops out; four years after disappearing, the man's brother finds him, grizzled and wearing a dusty jacket and tie, walking purposefully-aimlessly through Southwest Texas. Director Wim Wenders, working from L.M. Kit Carson's adaptation of Shepard's original treatment, overdoses on the cloudy, majestic skies and rugged terrain of Texas--but once we return to the West Coast, there's nothing much going on visually, and the reedy-thin plot isn't enough to support the film on its own. Shepard doesn't create characters through his writing, he sketches outlines: the withdrawn father, the shattered wife, the conflicted child. And even if these were three-dimensional people, it might be difficult to forgive Shepard the fact they aren't particularly embraceable. There are isolated moments of lonesome beauty and regret, yet \"Paris, Texas\" is that most irritating breed of arthouse non-wonder: it invites us to appreciate its craft and intuition while giving us little more than a carefully-posed series of life-like images. ** from ****",

            "content": "Another Wim Wenders retrospective screened in the Busan Cinema Center. This time, it was Paris, Texas (1984). What caught my attention by the positive raves it received, such as the 1984 Palm D'or, the FIPRESCI Prize, BAFTA Best Direction for Wenders, and other prestigious awards. It is not surprising that many claimed the movie was one of the best in Wender's filmography. Entering the theater with no knowledge at all (seriously, I was clueless about the story this time), I came out with tears in my eyes and still feeling speechless of what I just watched and felt, knowing that this film will stay in my memories for a while, and if not, for ages.The film opens with a man named Travis Henderson (Harris Dean Stanton), walking alone in the Texan desert. Working with Wenders' long-time collaborator Robby Muller, who really took advantage of the vast, empty land into a visually appealing, imagery-filled landscape that captures the essence of our main character. Accompanied by Ry Codder's acoustic guitar arrangement, the film not only introduces us to a western genre that seems bizarre but also strengthens the feeling of loss and loneliness of the main character. Moreover, Codder's absorbing tune really absorbs us deeper into the character, pulling us further into the story where we do not know what will happen next. This combination of cinematography and soundtrack is truly well built, leading to ambiguity and suspense.Next thing we know, Travis lost consciousness and a German doctor examines him. As Travis did not say a word or possess a telephone number, he calls the number that connects to Walt, Travis' brother. Despite having not seen him for 4 years, Walt went to pick him up, which leads to a flashback sequence where we follow the story of Travis's past and try to connect with the people he encountered in his previous life before his disappearance. Now, I'll just stop the synopsis here and hope that I do not spoil the story too much already. In my opinion, this is a film that is best experienced when clueless, similar to our main character wandering in the desert.The screenplay, which is penned by Sam Shepard, is an absolute powerful screenplay not because of the storyline, but rather, because of the emotions that serve as the core of the film for our audience to explore. Joy, sadness, fear, anger...Name any other emotions and most of them would be present in the film. Wenders served those emotions raw, without any fabrication even though the story felt almost impossible to happen in real life. Just small moments, like the way Walt and Travis interact with each other, would really lighten up my feelings. But what is more fascinating is how Wenders scattered the emotions throughout the film in a way that fits neatly with the atmosphere and builds the proper momentum. This is especially true in two of my favorite scenes in the film - one of which is when Travis looks at his past recordings to recollect his memories. It's an extremely wonderful moment where I just laughed with tears of sadness flowing through my cheeks. As for my other favorite scene...I will discuss it later down below. But I am certain, I believe everyone can connect to the story through the same reasons: in order to feel those emotions that I strongly felt.The actors' performances were something I rarely experienced. They were on another level...it was another reason why they perfectly managed to capture my emotions and evoke such strong reactions. Now, I never really watch Harry Dean Stanton films since I wasn't really into old films until today, although I do know he has been usually cast in laid-back, supporting roles. Regardless of the films he had played, Stanton perfectly fits the part with his range of emotions, whether through expressions, dialogue, or aura. Hunter Carson, who played as Hunter (yes, they both have the same name) also magnificently nailed the role. His performance was unlike most child actors that have a tolerably stiff performance; it was almost like a professional, despite being a debut. Lastly, Nastassja Kinsky, who played as Jane, might have short screen time but made a lasting impression in the film. I especially love the scene when she converses with Travis. It's just unbelievable. Most of it was done with long takes and no cuts, yet they are so into character that we were transported into their world and what will happen next, paying no attention to the technical detail of that scene. For me, the conversation between those two characters was truly the highlight of the film, thanks to its additional eccentric production design, colorful cinematography, and Codders' beautiful soundtrack. In fact, I am listening to it right now as I'm writing this review.All in all, Paris, Texas is just a perfect film that will stay in my memories for a long time. I would usually analyze the movie's external and technical aspects but as I am too emotionally invested in the film, guess I'll skip the commentary for this time and maybe analyze it the second time watching. That says a lot about how good the film was. It truly is a must-watch! A very fascinating story with incredibly real and raw moments.",

In the second half of the movie we are given to understand the typical, unoriginal, backstory to the whole situation. The back story is not interesting, and it is also told to us in a very unoriginal and, I think, all to direct way. My recommendation is to watch this movie halfway, or 3/4. if I had done that i probably would have given this movie an 8 or a 9. sadly, I watched it until the end (like a normal person), and all the mysteriousness, slight absurdity, feel of the plot, situation, etc. and all the endearing qualities that the characters had, were destroyed. the ending is also completely unrealistic. here it is important to make a difference between what I say \"surrealist\", or \"strange\", which is in a way voluntarily unrealistic, and unrealistic which I mean as \"wants to be realistic, but fails at it miserably\". knowing that the second half is terrible, I would still watch this movie again, and almost gave it a 7",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a film that encompasses so much human emotion and spiritual drive; a film that travels such sociological lengths within the human mind just as it does physically in space and setting. The film begins in a dusty and lonely desert location, but journeys from here to busy airports; to contemporary American suburbs to the highways connecting these places, to apartments in towering buildings and right on to sleazy performance houses located within the deep, deep crevices of large cities. The sense of travel is important; the sense of journey is apparent. One of my favourite scenes-come-shots in the film occurs when the film's lead stares out of his brother's garden overlooking a highway and an airport runway. No one says or does anything, the character just sits and observes all this activity going on as he forms thoughts in his head; thoughts linked to the fact he must conclude a certain journey he has begins to realise he has already undertaken.The film begins with a lone man walking through a desert, he is Travis Henderson (Stanton) and wears a rugged and unshaven look as he potters about in a smart, but dusty, suit. Eventually, his brother named Walt (Stockwell) drives out to meet him after being called out by an individual that comes into possession of Travis' wallet, and attempts to figure out what happened. Quite quickly, director Wim Wenders combines beautiful scenery; the bending and twisting of conventions when we see a formally dressed man in a place we don't expect to see a formally dressed man; and an element of mystery when it transpires Travis' memory is less than perfect and he's been out of contact for four years. Additionally, when asked what happened \u2013 Travis rejects the question, tiptoeing around it and further placing it on a back-burner. All that he does reveal, to begin with, is the explanation of the title; that being that he wants to own a small plot of land in Paris, Texas \u2013 something he's been observing via a small photograph for all these years. This gives the film an initial overall direction, or something for its mysterious, mute character to aim for.Part of the film's underlying effectiveness is the way Wenders allows us to slowly get involved with characters like Travis. Initially, the audience is invited to toy with a few ideas surrounding him. Do we think he's in trouble with someone? Is he on the run? Can we trust him when he's driving for Walt? Can we trust him when Walt (who knows about as much as we do at most points and thus; speaks for us, the audience) leaves him alone in the motel room as to not merely run off again? The answer to that last question is 'not really' and when it transpires Travis does run away from Walt's attempts at help, maybe we feel a little angry at him; a little frustrated that he's acting in this quite shut off and childish manner.But things change, and people branch out. It's interesting to note that when Walt does disappear from the text as the film nears its final third, Wenders is clearly signalling that he feels comfortable enough he has delivered the necessary information for us to form our own realisation of what's going on and allows Travis to take over as that character that drives the film; as a character that goes places, not randomly, but because he knows what he needs to do \u2013 we know what the situation is and away he goes. It's an effortless switch on Wenders' behalf; a master-class in directing as he delivers this long and drawn out story in the most humbling of manners but never, ever looses track of who's who and what their role is on the screen.The core of the film revolves around the sorting out of problems past; a sort of correcting of mistakes. But this is no film resembling a crude red marker-pen streak straight through several errors on a page, this is more a noting of mistakes made in a first draft before re-writing what should have been accomplished first time out in slick and effortless typography. Not knowing what transpires and why certain people are in the position they're in is 90% of the fun but what I will say is that a third party agent is involved and they're of a rather innocent variety. It is this agent that, when revealed, bridges gaps and enables certain personnel to take on certain responsibilities.Another key tactic in Wenders' delivery is Nastassja Kinski's character. Looking at some of the old posters uploaded here on IMDb, it seems there are a fair few detailing her character with the face of said person slapped all over the covers. But Wenders doesn't reveal what it seems he considers his prize jewel until much later on. I could say her name is Jane perfectly fine, but to mention her surname would be a spoiler of rather unfortunate consequence. Needless to say, she is connected. Paris, Texas is a rewarding experience. It asks us to find time to lend to those that come across as immediately eccentric or not of a 'type' we would immediately pay much attention to. It wants us to look at a person and look at a world through this person's perspective as we begin to realise those of an unspectacular variety might very well have a story of the spectacular variety, to tell.",

I wasn't familiar with the work of Wim Wenders but now after seeing this film I'd like to check out more of his filmography. I honestly felt like this film was just refreshing and captivating the way it portrays the Texan landscape. Its beautifully shot and the authenticity of the setting heightens the atmosphere of a man like Travis traveling across the state, trying to reassemble his life.Harry Dean Stanton stars in this film about a quiet man walking through the desert mysteriously, until his brother locates him and tries to get him back to see his abandoned son. His son is young so he does not know his father well, so Travis (Stanton's character) must try to build a relationship with his son. He also is on a pursuit to find his long lost wife and when he finally finds her emotions ensue. The film is a slow build but I think the cinematography is a joy to behold during the wait.One thing I have to really commend about this film is the sheer authenticity and simplicity of the film. Its very straightforward yet there is such complexity in the characters of the film. I think the two scenes with the two way mirrors between Stanton and Kinski were just so raw and sharply written. It puts a smile on your face and you become curious as to how bad their relationship must have been and the steps needed to recover and find themselves together again.I can't praise Robby Muller's cinematography enough in this film. Its so encompassing of Southern America and the journey of the protagonist. There's a sheer beauty to all of what we see in the film. Dean Stanton is perfect, he's always wonderful when I see him especially in his pairings with David Lynch. Haven't seen so much of Nastassja Kinski in the past but she is absolutely perfect and stunning in the screen time that she is given. Highly recommended, a film that doesn't really typify films of the 80's but you just feel as if it something that captures decades past in America.8/10",

The loneliness and desolation of the barren land reflect Travis' extreme loneliness.After saying goodbye to his family, Travis is sure to look for this place again, after all, this is where his soul resides.\nThe loneliness and depth of the movie hit my soul.

            "content": "The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville \u2013 in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night.Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere.I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies.It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere' \u2013 a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible.Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute.The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago.The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise.It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage \u2013 one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling.It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.",

Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination..since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths.Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood.inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.",

I was left kind of dumbfounded when the film finally ended and I asked myself WTF was that?The film has achieved Criterion Collection status but if you value my opinion it is the type of film I wish other like minded viewers could have forewarned me not to watch as is what I am attempting to do now.

            "content": "At the dawn of the 80's, the monumental flop of Michael Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\" put the final nail on the made-in-America auteur coffin, and one of the greatest and most inventive periods of Hollywood, the one that started with \"Bonnie and Clyde\" in 1967 and ended with \"Raging Bull\". Spielberg and Lucas had changed the game and 1984 was one of the peaks of the blockbusters' era with series' starter such as \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Ghostbusters\" or \"Gremlins\". Movies had to be as phenomenal as a Michael Jackson or a Madonna's clip and as far as pop culture went, there was a before and after 1984.And if you look at the Best Picture nominees of the year, you'll recognize immediately the winner (and it's quite deserved) Milos Forman's \"Amadeus\" but the rest is relatively unknown no offense meant, but who remembers \"Places of the Heart\", \"The Killing Fields\", \"A Soldier's Story\" or \"A Passage to India\"? To make things worse, the best movie of the year was probably Sergio Leon's epitaph masterpiece \"Once Upon a Time in America\", what a title, but it had to be sacrificed at the altar of simplification-for-the-masses and be cut from 100 minutes and be victim of a disastrous editing, ruining forever the project of a lifetime.It is a height of irony that at a time were the mass-entertainment status of Cinema provided some of its most popular movies but also prevented, a real masterpiece to sweep all the awards... and it was a European Festival, Cannes, that had the decency to screen the film in its totality, Europe respected America more than it respected itself, so maybe it's understandable that WimWenders' \"Paris, Texas\", literally, a European ode to American culture that won the Golden Palm that year. It is not as great as the troubled, haunting, hypnotic and personal, Leone's movie but in the context of 1984, it makes sense. Even the title works like the bridge between two schools of film-making that couldn't have been more opposite yet seem to make a truce.\"Paris, Texas\" is the story of a man with no past and a future, or a past and no future; wandering in Texan no man's lands with an empty look that speak a thousand words and a baseball cap so red it looks as impacting as a stain on a canvas. Speaking for myself, I thought the red cap was supposed to symbolize the \"woman in red\" he had in mind (in his head) literally, played by NastassjaKinski, I won't spoil the rest of the film but I had to watch it twice to figure out what the symbolism was meant to define. And I liked the 'road movie' approach, the film turns into a sort of spiritual quest where a man tries to find the missing link between the present and a future to build out of painful memories. The film is all about people trying to find connections, and I also empathize with the struggle of Dean Stockwell's character trying to reconnect with his estranged and mute brother, or his brother trying to reconnect with his son, wonderfully played by Hunter Carson. The film was powerfully conveying these attempts to make communication possible between people from different worlds, ages, memories. It overplayed it a little with Aurore Cl\u00e9ment. Did she need to be French? Her thick accent and struggle to speak English make almost every line she said ring false, and I swear one of her \"let me finish\" lines sounded almost like Tommy Wiseau. She was distracting to say the least and a Razzie nomination wouldn't have surprised me.Wenders was probably more fascinated by the sight of Texas than the Germany he grew up in and we can hardly blame it as movie lover, the Western setting that has always been a source of inspiration for the New Hollywood directors, \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"Badlands\" or \"The Last Picture Show\" were indirect nods to the genre and Scorsese made more explicit references to John Ford's \"The Searchers\" in his breakthrough debut \"I Call First\".There's something cyclical in the way directors have all started to be fans and now it's Scorsese and John Ford who inspire one European filmmaker, deserts, baseball caps, motels prostitutes, all these archetypes and a protagonist named Travis, this is literally \"The Searches\" meeting \"Taxi Driver\" and ending not with an orgy of blood, but an orgy of color symbolized by NastassjaKinski's sweater.The two Traviseswere lost souls in a quest that involves the reconciliation between their failed actions and a future that could be less grim. I can't say I didn't enjoy the film's approach, I just think it moved on too slowly and never tried to subdue the whole philosophical aspect. The first act is great, so was the third, the film kind of loses its way in the middle. And I read that Sam Shepard who was the writer, struggled to find the proper ending, somewhat this made me regard the film in higher esteem but God, did they need to have Aurore Cl\u00e9ment?But with European art house films, you never know, any flaws might be deliberate. I loved the imagery, I loved Stanton, Stockwell and Kinski but maybe I could find something in \"Bagdad Caf\u00e9\" that was precisely missing in \"Paris, Texas\", but I understand its iconic status \"Paris, Texas\" doesn't celebrate America as much as it exhilarates the European fascination for America. Europe is basically returning the favor after its own cinema inspired so many great American classics during the New Hollywood period, from 1967 to 1980.\nAnd it's only fitting that in a year where European cinema applauded \"Paris, Texas\", the American Best Picture winner would be made by a European director, celebrating a European icon \"Mozart\", 1984 was weird indeed.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a beautiful film from critically-acclaimed director Wim Wenders. It tackles a wide range of themes from family and betrayal, to reunion and tragedy. It is not a movie for the masses; it is carefully crafted and meticulously plotted to go beyond simply evoking emotion from the audience - it devastates anybody with a heart and soul who would attempt to watch it. Admittedly, it does take a while to start become intriguing, but we are fully invested in Travis by the halfway point of the movie.One of the best aspects of Paris, Texas is the brilliant yet subtle performance from its lead actor, Harry Dean Stanton. In roughly the first twenty minutes of the movie, Stanton is silent and his performance is all body language. We are introduced to him as he aimlessly walks around fields and barren landscapes somewhere in Texas. He tries to drink water from a random spigot and is disappointed when nothing comes out, yet he still keeps walking on with unexplained intentions. News of his appearance at a hospital reaches his brother, Walt, who comes to \"save\" him, and this proves to be a sort of humorous sequence in which Walt talks at Travis while Travis remains silent and mysterious until the story demands him to speak. Travis becomes more and more talkative gradually throughout the film, and is the most obvious changing feature of his character arc. This movie is essentially a telling of the re-birth of its protagonist, Travis, and we should not have it any other way.The way the plot is structured makes it follow an almost untraditional path. In the time slot that would normally be considered act one, Paris, Texas seems unsure of where it is going, and this is in part because the characters are unsure of what to do and do not have a set goal in mind. The protagonist, Travis, does not set a plan for himself until about halfway through the movie, and because of this, the second half of Paris, Texas is clearly the better half.The dominant theme that appears in this movie is the questioning of what family means and what constitutes a \"true\" family. Half an hour into the film, it is finally revealed through dialogue between Travis and Walt that Travis used to have a wife and child, and the child, Hunter, is currently being housed and cared for by Walt and his wife Anne, who are the boy's aunt and uncle. They are extremely attached to Hunter since they have raised him for about half of his life (he is almost 8 in the movie) so it stirs up some controversy when Walt decides to bring Travis home and reintroduce him to his biological son. It does bring out the good in Travis, however, who longs for a connection and feels ashamed when Hunter does not want to walk home with him because \"everybody drives\" and nobody walks anymore. This is clearly an excuse that he really just does not trust his dad.The best scenes of the film are clearly in the second half of the movie, but they will not be discussed in order to avoid spoilers. Without giving too much away, it is safe to say that Paris, Texas is a beautiful, emotional journey that deals with the notion of family, and above all, it is a mature movie. Anybody with a heart will appreciate this film, unless the viewer has never experienced heartbreak over family.9/10",

These are filmed in such a vibrant manner and combined with the original music by Ry Cooder that they became icons by themselves, in one of the most American films I have seen, made by a German director who we feel that he really loves America.Child-to-adults relationship movies are not really my preferred genre. I often find them exploiting the sentiments of the viewers and the ingenuous style of acting of children at the expense of real feelings. Here however the acting of Hunter Carson is really so direct and so true that I am almost happy to see that he did not develop a film actor career and will remain in memory for everybody with this role. Maybe he did have some conversations with Dean Stockwell, who also was a child actor who became a professional, one may just guess.Acting is really fabulous in the movie, beyond Carson and Stockwell we have Harry Dean Stanton with one of the best performances in his career. This story of lost memory and getting back and putting together a broken life is simple and moving, we are not told details that are not important for the relations between the characters, and even if the ending may be disputed from a social or moralistic point of view (is really the runaway girl working in a men's club the best mother for the kid?) it makes sense from an emotional point of view.This is one of the best films of director Wenders together with 'Himmel uber Berlin' and 'Buena Vista Social Club'.

I like movies in general that are big on ATMOSPHERE, Atmosphere is very important to me, and can sometimes make or break a movie. A few of my favorite movies are ones that are able to bring a certain dreaminess to the film, a surreal feeling and this had that. I thought this movie was hopelessly boring in certain places but also the characters were very complex and there was something a bit riveting about the pic though I can't say I loved it or give it a 10.Put it this way: fans of movies like what I just described(slow going on action but free flowing on mood and sound) might want to check it out for those very reasons, definitely a complex picture.",

            "content": "Before you rush out and buy the \"Paris, Texas\" (1984) DVD based on the many glowing reviews and comments, you may want a bit of a reality check. The film is 145 minutes long, that's almost two and a half hours. And not much happens during this time. The pacing is about on the level of \"The Straight Story\" (1999), which was only 112 minutes; so if that film had you climbing the walls you should probably steer clear of this one. On the other hand \"Paris, Texas\" is a technical masterpiece with great photography, excellent directing, and solid performances from the entire cast (although that cast is small). And it's a lyrically told story about loss, loneliness, and eccentricity; a look America and American values from an outside perspective (in this case European). I'm not sure that the film's message(s) is gotten across (unless you listen to the commentary feature on the DVD and maybe not even then) but it is certainly more coherent than when Michelangelo Antonioni tried to do the same thing in the early 1970's. The film opens with a wanderer walking alone in the desert. You eventually learn that this is not Howard Hughes but Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), that he has been missing the past four years, has semi-amnesia (a lot is made of this but the condition is never adequately explained), has a seven year-old son name Hunter (Hunter Carson), and a wife named Jane (Nastassia Kinski). Kinski fans will be somewhat disappointed as she does not even appear until the last third of the film (except briefly in some grainy home movies). The film could actually be classified as a \"buddy picture-road movie\" or two buddy picture- road movies. The first third features Travis and his brother's (Dean Stockwell) journey from Texas to LA, the final third Travis and his son's journey back to Texas. The weakest part is the middle third which serves little purpose other than providing some background details and linking the two journey segments. Because \"Paris, Texas\" is not your standard pre-sold commercial product, most of its suspense comes from the viewers themselves, who have little idea just where the film is headed. So if you watch a lot of films and are jaded because everything is so predictable, this movie viewing experience should be a nice change of pace. Because you haven't met these characters in other films, it takes a lot of storytelling to flesh them out, which is probably the biggest reason for the film's extended running length. Sam Shepard's script is not so much elliptical as it is evasive, somehow the characters tell us their most basic beliefs and deepest fears without really revealing anything about themselves (insert \"Two Lane Blacktop\" here). German New Wave director Wenders gets an astonishingly unaffected performance from young Hunter Carson, as convincing as any you are likely to find. Carson never did much after this amazing debut. The most intriguing sequences take place between Stanton and Kinski. The actors are never face-to-face as their characters speak to each other from opposite sides of one-way mirror. Travis has found Jane working in a seedy shop where lonely men pay to talk to women on the telephone.? The DP fills the screen with images of people dwarfed by vast, distant, and impersonal land/ cityscapes. The most effective and original is a sequence of Travis walking along a bridge over a LA interstate with the audio supplied by an unseen (until the end) and rambling derelict addressing the bumper to bumper traffic rushing by below. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second.Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective \u2013 his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me.

As we learn the back story of this despondent man, we soon realize he is suffering mentally, but he's not insane, as you were led to believe initially. He is cared for by his brother and sister-in-law (who have also been raising his son), and once he has recovered, takes custody of his son, and searches for his estranged wife.The reunion scene of the man and the ex-wife is one of the strangest put on screen in a while. Nothing you would expect happens in this sequence, but the off beat nature of what transpires is strikingly rich in symbolism and immensely emotional. Much is learned about both individuals, in an intelligent \"art house\" approach where a few gaps are left for you to fill in, but the clues are given to explain what is really happening and why. The altruistic outcome is deeply touching.The acting by everyone, especially the child actor, is superior, and the characters are interesting and the story is absorbing.

Kit Carson the film opens with a bird-eye shot of Texan desert, out of nowhere appears our wayfaring stranger (Harry Dean Stanton, in piercing form), a dusty and dead-pan man whose four-years chasing-the-sunset comes to and end when his brother (Dean Stockwell) locates him. The traveler's 7-year-old son (Hunter Carson) lives with his brother and wife (Aurore Clement), and his wife (Nastassja Kinski) is long gone. Now, our man (named Travis) starts reconnecting with his son and family, and a society he has turned his back to.The first act of 'Paris, Texas' is a quiet, ruminative experience of a mute Travis who comes from nowhere and is headed nowhere. This man obviously carries deep, wounded emotion and a bewilderment of something he doesn't understand, or doesn't accept. When his brother takes step, the film turns into a wonderful sibling-story where the two drive through American landscape and accompanies each other with short, interesting dialogs of past, present and future. And so throughout the middle of the film the great performance of Harry Dean Stanton grows better and better, he starts speaking yes, but his emotional core and purpose is full of mystery and compelling sorrow. Trying to understand more and more what happened four years ago, Travis takes his son with him, and decides to locate his wife. The powerful spine in this film lies in its understanding of the power of familiar ties, and the redemption one may seek when all things comes to show. The cinematography of Robby M\u00fcller is great, he captures an enigmatic and magical atmosphere of Texan landscape in a way one haven't seen before; the never-ending horizons, the old railway lines and the blood red sky. Scored by Ry Cooder's absolutely brilliant slide-guitar the film goes home with the Southern Delta blues, full of a yearn and search. Fantastic performances all around, especially as said from our protagonist Travis, who Harry Dean Stanton underplays all the way and in the final scene, driving out at the highway, his expression emotionless but weary, somehow happy yet heartbroken - truly masterclass acting. 'Paris, Texas' is a gorgeous and very moving film that I urge everyone to see.",

            "review_title": "The Best Film You Will Ever See",
            "content": "Paris, Texas is the best film I have ever seen, and without the complete participation of your emotions it would be an utter failure. Rather than a fault, this is an element of design crafted intentionally by the artists responsible for this film. If contemporary films were interpreted as formally as classic literature, then the plot surrounding Paris, Texas would be understood as nothing less than a post-modern Greek tragedy. Yet on a much deeper level, there is a kind of hard wisdom, more precisely a reckoning, that takes place within the unfolding narrative of the film that defies traditional moviegoing experiences because the transformation that occurs is within us.Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is not simply a broken man when we meet him wandering barren landscapes near rural Terlingua, Texas in search of water. Though grizzled and emaciated, he defies characterizations of mental illness or the slightly more nuanced strong, silent Man With No Name (though indeed, Travis does choose to remain mute for almost the first quarter of the film). From his eyes blaze a pain so immense, so intimate, one cannot even begin to guess the personal holocaust that brought about his current state.What we do see is the literal collapse of Travis's apparent four year nomadic exile in the desert when he passes out from dehydration at a gas station near the Mexican border. His younger, more domesticated brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) rescues him by bringing him back to civilization. Although their strained travels west through the desert back to Southern California do not reveal the secret of his past tragedy, these moments do uncover in bits and pieces what exactly Travis lost: his wife and son.In the suburbia overlooking I-5 and Hollywood-Burbank airport, Travis's seven year old son, Hunter (played by Hunter Carson), has been living with Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment) as their child for four years. Although he has been told his biological father is Travis, when Hunter meets him again face to face, they are strangers. Neither Travis nor Hunter have any substantial memories of one another. Walt and Anne open their home for Travis to live, and support him as he reaches out to Hunter. One night after supper, they play old home movies for Travis and Hunter to watch, and we see first hand what seemed to be much happier times. Captured on shaky super 8 celluloid is footage from a trip the brothers took together with their families. Young Hunter is playing, everyone is smiling, and for the first time we catch glimpses of the woman whose presence up to this point in the film has always been felt but never seen: Jane (Nastassja Kinski), the young and beautiful mother of Hunter and the love of Travis's life.Things are not quite the same after they watch the home movies; the relationship between Travis and Hunter begins to improve, and Anne reveals to Travis that Jane has been sending money for Hunter once a month from a bank in Houston. From this point, the film again changes, and we follow Travis and Hunter as they embark on a quest back to Texas to find Jane.In the hands of lesser-talented artists, these scenes would be predictable. But it is the driving mystery of what destroyed Travis that orients the story in a trajectory forward into the undiscovered country of Jane. Though I will not reveal what happens in the film's final act, I will say that these scenes represent the best acting and filmmaking I have ever seen. Some other movies can be emotionally manipulative. In those films, quick cuts, close-ups, and flashbacks are used as gimmicks to visually embellish what the story lacks. That is not the case with Paris, Texas: as our wonder and fascination with what actually happened becomes knowledge, this knowledge alone influences how we feel. Your heart will break in these closing scenes, and as the film ends perfectly, it is left up to us to offer lonely hope for the future.To place this responsibility upon the viewer elevates Paris, Texas from a great movie to participatory art. Travis may be the one we follow on this journey, but in both the film and our lives, the journey ultimately does not belong to him. Though this film is a fable, it's emotional reality will remain a part of your world for years to come.Though it is very tempting to pour detailed accolade upon the direction by Wim Wenders, or the music, or the cinematography, or any other creative element of this film, that discussion should take place after you watch the movie. You may not ever see a better one.",

            "content": "What is your definition of the western? Is it the story of the gun-slinging \"Clint Eastwood\" type who comes into town to take out the bad guys, or is it something more complex? The answer is that the western by definition is the hero's journey, whether it is physical or mental. More often than not, this hero is alone, and without question, he turns out to be a different man than who he was at the beginning of the picture. \"Paris, Texas\" is a western. Unconventional at best, but nonetheless, the hero that Wim Wenders presents to us is perhaps the loneliest man in Texas (Travis), and by the end of the picture, he's a fully realized, beautifully spoken, saint-like human being. But should it be a surprise that \"Paris, Texas\" seems anything but a classic western? Wim Wenders is one of the great mold-breakers of international cinema, more specifically the father of the German New Wave. In the grand tradition of Antonioni and Goddard, Wim Wenders challenged the conventions of the cinema of his native land, and used the screen as the canvas for which to paint whatever was on his mind. I see most of these \"New Wave\" filmmakers as painters, or beatnik poets. They are always looking for something to say, and to find the art in anything they come across. But more importantly, Wenders's western, or whatever you'd like to call it, is arguably his masterpiece. Travis is our hero. At the beginning of the picture, you have no idea what to think of him. He is seen walking aimlessly in the desert, somewhere in the southern part of Texas. It's not clear as to where he is or why is he there, but he is still our hero. The mystique of his character really had me interested in the first half of the movie. No matter how much his estranged brother tried to have him express himself, Travis refused to, that is until he loses his cool. It's never really explained why Travis is so quiet, but my opinion is, that thanks to the situation of the loss of his family, perhaps the shame of it all led him to believe that he owed nobody any words. That's just one theory. But over some time, Travis begins speaking to his brother, from small fragments to actual sentences. His progression continues when he returns to his brother's house, where he meets his long lost son, and he begins to further unravel back into his personality. Travis's silence seemed like a protective cocoon, and walking aimlessly into the desert seemed to be a way of escaping his personal life. In the scene where his brother tells him that he will be returning to Los Angeles, Travis quickly escapes the hotel room and returns to wandering. Wandering, to many people, helps clear the mind. Travis seemed to use it, much less as a detox, and more as his refuge. The uncivilized world of nature became his home. The remainder of the movie is his assimilation back to the civilized world, and his return to speaking with his family. The final 30 minutes of the film are what really entertain me, and what makes Paris, Texas a thoroughly fascinating experience. The shot that Wim Wenders holds on the character of Jane is the greatest shot in the film. As Travis says his soliloquy about the reason as to why he left, we see Jane slowly come to tears at the revelation of his words. Film is the one medium where photographing facial expressions is the most powerful, and the most effective at conveying emotions. I also really enjoyed that it took place inside a peep booth. What makes that so interesting to me is that the Peep Booth is an intimate setting, and Travis uses it as an intimate setting, but instead of getting off on a naked woman, he spills his soul out to her. This scene is the section of which I fell in love with the movie the most. It is the scene in which Travis's hero journey comes complete, as he reunited with his son, and reconciled with his wife. Paris, Texas is a western of forgiveness, and redemption. We even see our hero, Travis, ride off into the sunset, but instead of a horse, it's a car. He's off to be the loner again, but he's content in that he has finally accomplished something. He is no longer the reluctant, scared loner, but a loner that has done good. He corrected his mistakes, explained his guilt and decided honorably to make sure that his son is safe with Jane. Paris, Texas is a wonderful little movie that made such a huge noise back in 1984. It is a testament to the power of independent cinema, and has inspired countless independent filmmakers to this day. It's simplicity and emotion resonates with nearly every viewer. Even if you found the picture slow, you could easily cite what your favorite moment was. That was the case with me. There were moments where the picture could have been much more entertaining, and Travis's reuniting with his son seemed to not resonate with me too much. But once I saw the final scene in the peep booth, I knew what I saw was a great film. It's funny what peep booths can do.",

            "content": "Though it's a little slow and arguably a tad too long, 'Paris, Texas (1984)' undeniably has a beguiling effect. It's a quietly contemplative drama with an almost tangible texture and several really potent sequences. Its impact is the sort of thing that creeps up on you, building up over the course of the story and eventually hitting you right in the heart. The picture exudes an almost intangible atmosphere, with the melancholic twang of its soundtrack complimenting the subdued yet significant performances. The main vibe the flick gives off is one of being lost, of being unable to find yourself even when surrounded by the people you're closest to. This echoes the enigmatic opening that sees its protagonist wander through the desert with a bump on his head; in a way, he wanders through that desert for the entire affair. The thing culminates in a breathtakingly beautiful scene in which two people spend most of a conversation not being able to see one another (even when the audience, in an ingenious move, can see both of them). It's a touching yet tragic sequence that perfectly encapsulates the insurmountable invisible barrier between these two people. It also provides a ton of strangely satisfying, though thoroughly sad, exposition that somehow doesn't feel as on the nose as it actually is (probably because it, like the entirety of the film, is firmly rooted in character). The movie is as much about what its characters don't say as what they do. Its impact is hard to describe but undeniably present. It's a powerful picture, even though it isn't especially exciting or, even, overtly gripping. If you're willing to get on its wavelength, it'll grab you and, without you even realising it, break your heart. It's potent stuff, for sure. 7/10.",

            "content": "There's no doubt Rain Man borrowed a good deal from Paris,Texas. A man,Walt,receives a call concerning his brother,Travis,who's been missing for four years. Walt drives out to pick him up but when he attempts to fly home the eccentric Travis refuses to fly and they are forced to make the journey home by car. Which they do and from there the two plots divert. The main difference between the two is that Rain Man is actually a well made film in which things happen while Paris,Texas is the epitome of all style and no substance. The film opens with a deranged looking man walking through the desert before he collapses in a small bar in the middle of nowhere. Even once his brother comes to bring him home the movie still dwindles along. The audience is left completely ignorant as to what happened and what this character's intentions are. To use this in small quantities and dole out hints of information is acceptable but when you start carrying this utter secrecy thirty minutes into a film,your bound to lose the interest of a good portion of your audience. The same goes for the film's feel. The picture has an extremely austere style in its writing,acting and especially directing. The perfect contrast is Rain Man. Rain Man has a unique tone and feel as well but it also has scenes of varied emotions and a dynamic plot. Paris,Texas is film you're supposed to watch almost strictly for its atmosphere;towards the end the picture begins to form some resemblance of a plot. I suppose the idea behind this cinematic calamity is that the viewer is supposed to savor the idiosyncratic nature,style of each scene that collectively creates a one sweeping sensation'the resulting product is quite different. The scenes drag at a frustratingly slow pace and the film focuses so much on tone,that there isn't anything else to redeem this disaster.Paris,Texas won the Palme D'Or and it is included on the IMDB Top 250 list. Those aclodes or any other praise it is a hollow,dawdling film that has nothing more than a gimmick style.",

All we see is a photo of a vacant lot, which looks nothing like the area Paris actually is in.Harry Dean Stanton, already 50-ish, is remarkable as Travis, who is aimlessly marching through a desert as the movie opens. Ragged, dirty, and hungry, he makes it to a small store where he collapses after one bite of crushed ice. The local doctor revives him, and somehow finds a way to contact Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who through some difficulty retrieves him and brings him to California.Travis is initially mute, unable to explain what had caused him to disappear for 4 years, or even to know that he had been gone for that long. \"Four years, is that a long time?\" In that time his young wife had disappeared, leaving their young son Hunter (Hunter Carson) to be raised by Walt and his wife.This movie is long, has very little to no action, and will be boring to many. I was not bored. I was absorbed in this character Travis, and where he was going to re-claim his life. A good chunk of the second half of the movie was filmed in Houston, where I live and worked, and many of the downtown buildings and highways felt as if I was right there, watching them through a window. The cinematography is superb.SPOILERS: As Travis regains his reasoning, and gets to know his son, he decides to find his wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski as a Texan) after he gets a clue that every month on the 5th she deposits money in an account for her son at a bank in Houston. Hunter insists on going with Travis, and together they find Jane, working in a sex business where she and other girls role-play in booths where patrons see them through windows, and they have no contact with the patrons, can't even see them through the mirrored glass. Travis leaves Hunter in the hotel room, visits Jane as a patron, tells her the whole story, and watches from the top of a parking garage as he sees, through the hotel window, the reunion of Hunter and Jane. His mission is accomplished, he knows he can't be with Jane, but he has made it possible for his son to have his mother.",

Wim Wenders obsession with the American West is apparent in the bleak cinematography and simple yet effective dialogue. A German doctor and French wife infuse a curious European mix that is markedly congrous with the universality of the story. I am madly in love with this film.

I get sucked into it, too, for awhile. Wim Wenders appreciates it from afar, I suppose, and gives it a gritty nostalgia even though it's present tense. Or I should say Sam Shepard does, since he wrote the play (and gives the whole thing its flavor). The main drifter, Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is an archetype of someone lost in sadness and worn by weeks wandering in the wind and sun. He's compelling in his sorrow, and hopelessness. The events that follow are relatively predictable in some sense. He confronts his past in different ways.The real twist at the end is a fabulous play on voyeurism and power, between two people who once loved each other. It drags on too long, but it's really moving at first.Then there is the very end, which seems to just throw it all to a mild sensational withdrawal, one last abuse by a maladjusted man.

Through the character of Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) and his haunting tale of redemption, Wenders subtley explores themes of obsession, possesiveness, familial bonds and the ability of people to adapt to their circumstances and surroundings. Essentially a 'road movie', Travis's travels allow the audience a sense of the vast expanses of Los Angeles, captured and enhanced by the stunning cinematography and Ry Cooder's beautiful-but-minimal soundtrack. Wenders contrasts the cultures of the Spaniards, who once owned Los Angeles, with that of the European settlers in a poignant and sublime way; Travis's half-learnt Spanish heritage is no more apparent in his character than the obsessiveness he obviously inherited from his white father, the angst Walt and Anne develop concerning Hunter's future with Travis differs greatly from the practical advice a Spanish maid gives to Travis to 'fix' the problem - Wenders doesn't make a direct statement on the co-existence of these different cultures, but he certainly identifies and explores those differences. The entire cast is uniformly superb, Dean Stockwell and Harry Dean Stanton are a treat as always, but they shine no brighter than Kinski, Clement or Hunter Carson. And I haven't even really touched upon the mysterious story of the iconic Travis !",

            "content": "Wim Wenders's love for Americana propelled him to collaborate with famed playwright Sam Shepard and the result was the visually satisfying but inert drama, \"Paris, Texas.\" The film's style (as noted in Wikipedia) include shots of \"old advertisement billboards, placards, graffiti, rusty iron carcasses, old railway lines, neon signs, and motels,\" to name a few. Many of Wenders's scenes here remind me of Edward Hopper paintings and despite the limitations of the film's narrative, it's well worth watching simply for the visual feast.The film's plot proceeds quite slowly. Walt Henderson is alerted that his brother, Travis, has been found dehydrated after walking in the South Texas desert. Walt drives from Los Angeles and picks Travis up, intending to return home to L.A., with his brother in tow. It's been four years since Travis disappeared and left his son Hunter to be raised by Walt and his wife, Anne. For quite a while, Travis is mute much to his brother's chagrin, who is desperate to find out where's he's been while missing. When Travis finally talks, all he can virtually talk about is a parcel of land he bought in Paris, Texas, where their parents allegedly met and conceived him.The second act\u2014perhaps the most interesting part of the film\u2014chronicles Travis's awkward attempts to bond with his son, Hunter, once he and Walt arrive back in L.A. Anne is upset that Walt is encouraging Travis to get close to Hunter, since she fears that he'll take the boy away. Actually, that's exactly what happens\u2014Travis asks Hunter if he would like to come with him to find his ex-wife, Jane, who had left the family since she could not cope raising Hunter. Travis and Hunter head to Houston where they bond on the way there. It should be noted that Hunter Carson did a fantastic job of playing his fictional counterpart, a role that required a great deal of nuance and sensitivity.If the two \"bonding\" stories (one between the two brothers and the other between father and son) prove to be fairly interesting, the film's resolution, unfortunately does not. A.A. Dowd writing in the \"A.V. Club,\" cogently notes what's wrong with the narrative: \"There's just something weirdly banal and unsatisfying about the explanation Wenders and Shepard belatedly supply. What drove Travis to abandon his family and flee for the freedom of Mexico? I'm afraid it's nothing more complicated than a case of run-of-the-mill relationship troubles, revealed during a very long monologue that places Travis on one side of a two-way mirror and his ex, Jane (Nastassja Kinski)\u2014now dancing at a seedy Houston strip club to make ends meet\u2014on the other.\"\"Run-of-the-mill\" explanations also apply to the film's title\u2014none of the characters actually end up going to Paris, Texas and the Travis's story of his origins in that particular town, is hardly the stuff of high drama.Travis finally figures out that he's not cut out to be a father and abandons Hunter and Jane to fend for themselves. Presumably, Jane, will do the right thing and return Hunter to Walt and Anne, where he'll end up having a normal childhood.As \"Paris, Texas\" is considered one of Wenders's best films, one might conclude that he is a master of style but has difficulty in the \"substance\" department. \"Paris, Texas\" is well worth watching for the visuals but prepare yourself for a promising story that ultimately runs out of gas.",

Stanton was doing more with his facial expressions than most actors can do shouting a hundred lines of dialogue.\nDean Stockwell and Aurore Clement do most of the talking in the early going and they do very well in their roles. I thought their characters were very realistically drawn.\nUnfortunately, there's a kid. He's 7 but as savvy as a 17 year old. He's just not at all believable as an actual 7 year old. And then the road trip, wherein Stanton's character talks as much as any celebrity on Oprah's couch. By the time we get to the scenes where Stanton is speaking through the glass partition I was getting restless. Yet it got worse. What started practically as a silent movie turned into a morose, Bergman-like gabfest. Could have been at least a half-hour shorter and accomplished the same thing, which, come to think of it, was nothing anyway.\nNo wonder this joker turned to directing U2 videos. He fits Bono's sense of self-importance.",

The \"minimalism\" only is a verneer on the bundle of romantic-cowboy clich\u00e9s that is the protagonist, whose selfishness and callowness is somehow ascribed this massive moral weight and clarity. Wonderful. People confuse affectations of style for actually having something to say. This is a mechanistic, snobbish movie, almost wholly devoid of energy, grace, or value--but the fact that people somehow latch onto this as a kind of paragon of European-doing-America film making is, frankly, embarrassing.",

German director Wim Wenders, facing an American cinematic idiom: the road movie. An opening sequence where a man in a suit appears in the Texan desert(later the desert is contrasted with the city, LA). The man is lost. He is searching for his wife and child. He could be a cowboy at odds with the modernity. Great acting, great soundtrack. He finds his son and slowly he is saved. He finds his wife in a Houston strip joint and, separated by a one-way mirror(what a metaphor!), they save each other. And then off again into the desert.",

            "content": "Words fail, there is no way to describe it. After many years, I have just seen this again for the fourth or fifth time, and it is more incredible now than it was then (or on the many thens). One's appreciation for the genius of director Wim Wenders increases steadily with time, and he is on a rising curve. This time I appreciated even more how spectacularly wonderful the story was by actor Sam Shepard, and the adaptation by Kit Carson. His son Hunter Carson plays the boy, Hunter, in the film. (The boy's mother is Karen Black, whom I knew way back when she made her second picture, when she was too wild to tell.) Here, Wenders shows his deep sensitivity to children, as he had done earlier in his magnificent 'Alice in the Cities', where the child was a little girl. Wenders and Carol Reed have a lot in common that way. The performances in this film, as everyone knows, are staggering in their intensity. Wenders resurrected Harry Dean Stanton from the status of an obscure character actor to become one of the most powerful screen actors of his time (they say he's murder in person but we don't see that bit, and that's his business, and those he may hurt). No one in the world could have pulled off the central role of Travis but Stanton. His casting was the ultimate act of genius. Wenders's casting instincts are probably the most perfect of any director's in the world. He showed his casting genius again in choosing French actress Aurore Clement for Walt's wife. At one stroke, he eliminated the 'American mom' problem by using instead a softly spoken, delicately mannered French woman who is incapable of spoiling a child, being a 'mall consumer', or even thinking of entering a (pardon me while I am sick) Macdonalds. So the kid is safe, and so is the film, and there is no saccharine false sentimentality, and all that goes with those terrible American moms in all the Hollywood movies dripping in sugar syrup, or is it maple syrup? Wenders made the reputation of Ry Cooder in this film, by using his perpetually haunting music for the sound track, and of course they teamed up again years later for the wonderful 'Buena Vista Social Club'. Wenders has as impeccable taste in music as he has in everything else. (He also launched Madredeus of Portugal, not just the Cubans.) This film opens with Harry Dean Stanton walking with fierce determination in a straight line across the Mojave Desert, heading for nothing and nowhere, in a despondent act of self-immolation. But he faints from dehydration, and his brother is summoned by a local because he has his brother's business card in his pocket, although they haven't been in touch for four years. Harry doesn't really remember who he is at first, and we never do learn what he was doing for four years, nor do we need to know. The main thing is he has turned up again, against his will, and things begin to happen. The film is pervaded by the most profound air of total mystery, a mystery not just of events but of the ineffable and impenetrable ultimate mysteries: life, that thing we don't understand, and love (what is it?) Every scene is haunting, every moment is pregnant with the possibilities of exploding emotion and an eruption of so much meaning that it will burst the camera (and the DVD will also warp). There isn't any way all of this can be expressed but by itself. In that sense, 'Paris, Texas' is like a person: irreducible. We have the added attraction of the beautiful Nastassya Kinski to gaze at, and we can never get enough of that, can we? (Especially when she is being elusive and running through our fingers like water.) And Dean Stockwell is there, fretting about it all, wanting clarity and never obtaining it. There is so much tragedy, so much pain, so much that is irrevocable about the past, so much that is broken and cannot be fixed. But this movie is not a downer. Wenders shows us the way. His 'wings of desire' are at work, angels are redeeming the lost souls, the little boy who is so softly charming and entrancing, will not remain a lost boy. Stanton can still redeem himself. Kinski can save herself. The brother and his wife can sit in their empty house and cry dry tears. This film has ripped the guts out of hundreds of thousands of people, and they are still walking around mutilated, but they are mysteriously smiling. Hope hides in corners, and springs out at you.",

            "content": "Seen this fine film about half a dozen times now and, like most fine films, each time I watch it I see something new or find I have a new take on it. This time it struck me how much the character of Travis reminds me of Ethan Edwards in \"The Searchers\", another brooding meditation on loss and loneliness. Both are eternal outsiders doomed to wander the fringes of civilization yet ironically serving the very societies in which they are unable to live by bringing families together and restoring social harmony, even though they are excluded, in the end, from sharing in that beneficence. Making the comparison even more striking is the harsh yet beautiful western landscapes both characters traverse and which are indelibly imprinted on the viewer's visual memory through the cinematographic skills of Winton Hoch and Robby Muller. Indeed Muller is so skilled that he even manages to render that most unlovely of American cities, Houston, like an Edward Hopper painting (i.e. That shot from the motel parking lot with pastel green neon lighting and blood orange sunset). And to cement the resemblance between these two is the undeniable fact that both were the greatest performances of the two great actors who played them, The Duke and Harry Dean. I could go on about other qualities of this masterpiece, like scenarists Sam Shepherd and Kit Carson's ability to endow extremely flawed human beings like Travis with sympathy and affection or director Wim Wenders' knack for eliciting strong performances from hitherto marginal actors like Ms. Kinski and kid actors with zero experience, like Hunter Carson who is almost as fine a child actor as was Dean Stockwell. And I could mention the poignant, haunting music by Ry Cooder. Or the fact that Wenders consistently manages to stay on the right side of the line between slow and meditative. But I think I'll save those points for the next time I write about this American classic from Germany. Give it an A.",

I used to give it a high 9/10 but then I regretted giving it such a low score like 9 so it's a 10 now.This movie is mesmerizing (that's the word I describe it). The ending is very emotional but at first I didn't understand it so I had to see the ending again, especially the last 30 minutes which was something cannot be missed but that leads me to the only issue of the film is that it's hard to understand that conversation (not really an issue though) but then it's my favorite scene of the film so I'll say no more.The film is masterfully shot. It's notable for the images of the landscape and climate of Texas which the movie had some of the best production designs I've seen thought that's not the film's greatest aspect. What made it truly special is its gorgeous and stunning cinematography done by Roger Muller who did for tons of movies I haven't watch so maybe I'll put all of them in my watchlist and learn more from this cinematographer (apparently not now cuz I'm learning Roger Deakins). The Tex-Mex guitar sound by Ry Cooder is effective and simple but haunting to the film's pace. The direction from Wim Wenders is just brilliant!Harry Dean Stanton sold this movie. He is this guy Travis (not Bickle) who has abandoned civilization and decided to rome the desert for 4 years and his return to SOCIETY, as well as a broken family he left behind blah blah blah...you get the idea! Without him, this movie wouldn't be this good. The other cast are also good, especially Natassa Kinski (can't spell!) who plays this wife abandoned by Harry Dean Stanton.The pacing of the film is tireless and steady. The film reminds me how incredible it is to enter a movie without knowing much of it. The color pallete is just...c'mon. There's a point it has to be red or blue or green or...\"On screen, the colors of red, white, and blue are a common scheme, representing the colors of America, society, unity, .......\"It's a moving picture which captures the real drama of amnesia and its effects on family, friends and the person suffering from it. It has an impeccable atmosphere. It has a mood and feeling that is consistent throughout. Despite its 2 and a half hours runtime, this is a very rewatchable movie which only feels like about 2 hours or less. I enjoyed every single part of it and I want to see it again! I'm comfortable to call it a masterpiece (and classic). I could say it's not a film for everyone cuz people have different tastes. It's an experience I'll never forget!Now will you excuse me, I'm gonna rewatch CHiPS and give it 10/10!",

I had very low expectations going in and I was absolutely blown away by just how amazing it was.Everything about this movie is pretty much perfect, to me at least. The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the acting is some of the best acting I've ever seen in a dramatic film, the writing is on point, just everything about this movie is done incredibly well.The film is very raw and gives off a very documentary-like style. The characters find themselves in dirty, grimy settings. The mood of the setting is never overdone. When Travis enters the first booth in order to try and talk to Jane, another woman appears. It's an unpredictable film. There are no perfect situations, much like life itself. This is why I feel that the film gives off a documentary-like feel.Harry Dean Stanton cements his position as one of the most brilliant character actors with this performance. He's a man who's been through a lot, a man who wants to make up for lost time. He's been drifting around the desert for 4 years, and he wants to find perspective of his life again.Nastassja Kinski gives an equally brilliant performance. There's a certain segment in this movie where it's just a long take on her face while she's listening to Travis's story through the glass, and I thought it was one of the most impressive takes I've ever seen in a movie. The way she is able to convey so much deep yet subtle emotion with just her face is amazing. She doesn't need to suddenly burst out in tears. She's restraining herself, and not a beat is missed during the whole scene.The last 25 minutes of the movie, which include the climactic conversation between Travis and Jane, were some of the best final scenes in any movie I've ever seen, period. I'd venture so far as to say that the conversation itself is one of the most emotional scenes in the history of cinema.The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and it's one of the most deserved Palme d'Or wins of all time in my opinion. There were some truly great winners like Taxi Driver and The Tree of Life (controversial as that win may be), but Paris, Texas is one of the best.When Mark Kermode reviewed this movie, he said that the title of the film indicates a fusion between the European style of film and the American style of film. I thought about that comment, and it could not be more true. The director of this film (Wim Wenders) is German, and it appears that he used a lot of that dreamy European cinema influence in this film.The whole movie is virtually flawless. There are some people who will likely disagree with that, but it's a film that changed how I view the idea of cinema, and for that reason, it's in my top 5 films of all time.",

            "content": "\"Paris, Texas\" from 1984 is a unique film in several ways. It's an American film made by a German (Wim Wenders); it has no plot; and its pace is deadly. Yet somehow you are drawn into it.A man, Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) who appears to be mute becomes ill in the Texas desert, and the doctor calls his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) to come and get him. Walt is shocked -- he hasn't seen Travis since he disappeared four years earlier, leaving behind his young son, Hunter. Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been raising the boy and think of him as their own. Walt has to break it to her that Travis is still alive, and they have to tell Hunter.Travis was probably a little strange but now he's downright weird. Walt has to go after him twice when he runs away. They can't fly back to Los Angeles because Travis won't fly; unfortunately he doesn't realize it until they are on the plane, and they have to be removed. He wants the same car they rented to get to the airport to take them home. He finally starts talking, however.I think my favorite part of the film was Travis talking about how he wanted to live in Paris, except it's Paris, Texas, where he owns land. Why does he own land there? It's where his parents first made love, and he thinks he might have been conceived there.Reunited with his son, the little boy has some trouble adjusting to two dads. We learn something of the past -- Travis was married and deeply in love -- obsessed, in fact, with his wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) who left him abruptly when Hunter was very small.Travis finally takes a trip with Hunter to find Jane and reunite her with her son.The story of one man's journey to get back to his life, face his faults, and make things right is a compelling one, and Harry Dean Stanton does a magnificent job of evolving this character. His monologue toward the end of the film is fantastic -- and he started the movie not talking! As Jane, the beautiful Nastassja Kinski is radiant, sweet, and childlike, giving a wonderful performance.You can't fault the acting here -- it's low key, natural, and believable. The problem I had with this film is that it's a little style over substance -- wonderfully photographed and atmospheric, but too long and too slow.Nevertheless, Paris, Texas is well worth seeing for Harry Dean Stanton and the great warmth that Wenders gives the film.

A story about paradise lost, a human odyssey made in a really striking way, \"Paris, Texas\" is a film that feels like watching real life and not a film. Harry Dean Stanton is outstanding as Travis and is so good that it doesn't feel as though he's acting at all. Aurore Clement and Dean Stockwell are also fine as his sister-in-law and brother respectively who take care of his adorable little son Hunter, who is played by Hunter Carson, who displays incredible maturity. Nastassja Kinski is delightful to watch as always and delivers a strong performance, especially considering her age. 1984 was a big year for her, starring in \"Hotel New Hampshire\", \"Maria's Lovers\" and this film. Being directed by Richardson, Konchalovski and Wenders when you're 22-23 is really not a trifle.Ry Cooder's soundtrack is among the best ever and especially the main theme is incredibly effective. What else is there to say? This film will enrich your life and make you ask existential questions probably. It is its purpose, as well as telling us to appreciate life and all the good things in it.

Probably no reason in particular.It is interesting to see that this film seems to have had more influence on musicians than other filmmakers. Irish rock group U2 cite Paris, Texas as an inspiration for their album \"The Joshua Tree\". Scottish bands Travis and Texas both took their names from this film. And late musicians Kurt Cobain and Elliott Smith claimed this was their favorite movie of all time.",

It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes.It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ...Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen.So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in.And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect.Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas (1984) :\nBrief ReviewHardly a good film if you are interested in wild and senseless fascinations of two people otherwise OVERRATED!  Travis Henderson, an aimless drifter who has been missing for 4 years, wanders out of the desert and must reconnect with society, himself, his life, and his family. He and his wife separated all of sudden because of wild theories and senseless fascinations they dreamt and the child is taken by his brother and his wife. The story didn't really convince me not even for a moment because why would anyone care if Husband imagines bad about his wife and wife dreams about escaping, leaving husband and child helpless. Both the characters didn't really make sense to me and the real sensible characters were not justified. The child didn't get the Justice he wanted and the brother and his wife got nothing even after doing so much. The problem was that this separation theory of husband and wife was very casual. It doesn't look convincing, sensible and emotional at all and therefore i just couldn't connect with them for a moment. I think a different climax might have made more sense to me if the child had been reunited with his second guardians rather than his biological parents. Acting by Harry Stanton and Dean Stockwell was fine and both the ladies Nastassja Kinski and Aurore Clement looked beautiful. Screenplay is very slow because it gives extra time to many unnecessary scenes but not overlong. Wim Wenders director is pretty good the way he took the film along with different places and stages of storytelling. However, the conviction of universal emotions was not there. Overall, a good decent watch only if you can bear some senseless and casual fascinations otherwise Skip it. \nRATING - 5/10*",

            "content": "Drifting aimlessly for the most part, Paris, Texas manages to bring its story full circle as it nears its conclusion but the journey to its final destination is slow and may become frustrating if you are not already invested in the plight of the protagonist. A stark, strange & somber experience, it does put the viewers' patience to test but also rewards them with an emotionally hefty finale.The story follows an amnesiac named Travis who's been missing for four years and is found drifting in the South Texas desert. Retrieved by his brother, he is brought to Los Angeles to reunite with his young son. However, soon after their relationship is mended, the two embark on a new journey in order to track down Travis' long-missing wife who left their son shortly after he disappeared.Directed by Wim Wenders, the film begins with our protagonist wandering alone in the dry & barren desert before passing out at a rundown bar. The next scenes do establish an aura of mystery about him and Harry Dean Stanton does well to articulate those pent-up emotions, but the film eventually started frustrating me the way it did Travis' brother when he was trying to connect with Travis but got nothing in return for a while.The story isn't heavy on dialogues, at least not until the very end, and the plot is narrated with a contemplative eye that ruminates more on what the characters are feeling in the given moment. Travis' return to society, his own life, to fatherhood & his new-found purpose to reunite the family is finely illustrated but the deliberately slow pace becomes tiring after a while, for there are scenes in it that it could've done without.Wenders also paints a distinct portrait of America, contrasting its rich suburban city life with vast, desolate & deserted landscapes while the camera is employed as a silent observer, capturing the images neatly yet leaving a mark of its own with some clever placements & angles. Editing allows the plot to unfurl at an unhurried pace that may divide its audience. Lastly, its minimal & funereal score bears much resemblance to an old western.Coming to the performances, the film features a devoted cast in Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell, Aurore Cl\u00e9ment & Hunter Carson, and they all resemble a once big family that is still reeling from its unexpected break-up. Stanton steals the show with a strong input and his chemistry with every cast member adds something to their relationship. Carson plays the kid and works well with what he's given while Kinski does amazingly well in the end to leave her mark.On an overall scale, Paris, Texas articulates its themes in a concise fashion and the final act is no doubt compelling but the road one needs to travel to get there is a long & tedious one. It's not that the way its plot progresses is incongruent with its tone & mood but it just wasn't able to garner my full attention and didn't have anything interesting enough to keep me engaged. Another viewing a few years down the line may result in a different outcome but for now, Paris, Texas was, for the most part, highly underwhelming.",

The film starts with the lonely drifter Travis Anderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walking through the desert, till he collapses (exhaustion) in a near bar. With his identification, the man there contacts his brother Walter R. Anderson (Dean Stockwell) he hasn't seen for four years, since he disappeared. His brother takes him home on the road (when he can't get on a plane), and when they get there, Travis meets his son who Walter and his wife Aurore Cl\u00e9ment (Anne Anderson) have looked after since he and the mother disappeared, named Hunter Anderson (Hunter Carson). After getting used to his Dad, both Hunter and Travis decide to try and find the mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski) by finding the bank she visits every month, and luck strikes when Hunter spots her in the car park (recognised her face from photo). When Travis investigates the building she enters, he finds out she has become a peep-show stripper (stripping for someone she can't see because of two-way mirror, reflection on her side). The emotional part is slowly telling his story, as someone else, and she realises it is him. It is uncertain what happened after Jane and Hunter met each other in the hotel, and Travis wandered off, but this is an essential drama. Oh, the meaning of the title by the way, is that Travis bought a piece of land called Paris, in Texas, and his Dad joked making everyone think he was first talking about Paris, France. It won the BAFTA for Best Direction for Wim Wenders, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Score for Ry Cooder and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

            "review_title": "The Unification of a Disintegrated Family",
            "content": "Wim Wenders was one of the filmmakers who formed new German cinema in 1970's and his film Im lauf der zeit (In the Course of Time) ,alongside with Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff The Tin Drum, is often seen as one of the finest representatives of the movement. In 1984 after becoming quite famous in Europe Wim Wenders went to America to produce his first film outside of Germany. Paris, Texas is a masterful road-movie, which was Wenders' favorite genre; he even made a road-movie trilogy in 1970's (Alice in the Cities, False Movement and In the Course of Time). This slow-paced, mature, one of the director's most acclaimed films and his most accessible film, requires heart, certain maturity and patience from its viewer.A quiet man, lost for four years walks in the desert, due to dehydration a man picks him up and takes him to a hospital. Soon the quiet man is taken in by his brother. Later on the man tries to put his life back together and remember what happened between him, his wife and, his 8-year-old son.Paris, Texas could easily be a film which makes one to die for a ticket to the States. The landscapes, the gorgeous images reinforced by sentimental and honest music make us see into the true soul of America. 1980's and Americanism can be seen everywhere in the film, it is cleverly and precisely created: cokes, sodas, American cars, country music, clothes and landscapes. The construction of state in Paris, Texas is incredibly well handled and the contrasts Wenders has created are astonishing.This profound film about a quiet man, lost woman and the unification of a disintegrated family really drills down to pure emotion. Difficulty of communication and losing one's identity have both been very important themes for Wim Wenders already in Im lauf der zeit (1976). In Im lauf der zeit the two men don't know how to talk to each other, how to talk about your worries, memories and past. But in Paris, Texas the theme of difficulty of communication was taken to a new level: what can you say to the people you once left behind? How can you ever make up the mistakes once made? It's about the impossibility of understanding others, how can you relate to a person with completely different emotions. The change of identity is a scary thing and this theme culminates in the scene where Travis (the quiet man) tries different kind of outfits, trying to find the right suit for his new identity.Alongside with the themes of identity and communication, Paris, Texas is an emotional film about loneliness. The difficulty of understanding and empathy. Perhaps Travis can't make up the mistakes he once made and he is alone. He finds his long lost son and his wife, but understands that he's unable to live with them and is once again left alone, lonelier than ever before. Paris, Texas is a timeless film about loneliness and the later film by Wenders Wings of Desire (1987) can easily be seen as an antithesis for it; it has got certain eras, ages and a history. This profound theme of loneliness culminates in the unforgettable images of men sitting, standing and walking alone in Paris, Texas.In the end Paris, Texas grows out to be a mature film about family, the disintegration and the unification of it. It's a smooth and quality film in style, thematics and content. The delimitations and states are important and full of significance. After seeing the film twice I consider it as a very touching, melancholy road-movie about soul-searching, identity and family. It's a very good film, even if it's not Wenders' finest. I strongly recommend people to get to know his earlier and later German production. Wings of Desire (1987) and In the Course of Time (1976) are for instance two unforgettable masterpieces.",

It's not afraid to really take it's time. It takes its time to build a brother relationship, a father son relationship and allows you to think about past relationships. Whilst it builds these relationships it also delves deeper into the characters as it builds intrigue into their past actions.\nIt also takes time to establish the setting, whether it's of the American West, Los Angeles, gas stations or even strip clubs. This film is remarkably shot, every frame is a painting. I don't want to use superlatives but if somebody asked me what I thought the most beautiful film was, i'd now struggle to think of anything else.\nDespite the long run time and slow pacing, the film is never boring but always captivating. Without giving much away, in the 3rd act of this film their is a simply mesmerising monologue, which is perfectly written, shot and acted. For me it's now on par with 'meet me in Montauk' from Eternal Sunshine as my favourite scenes of all time.What I disliked: Whilst the 2nd act is completely necessary to the film, it isn't as enjoyable as the astonishing 1st and 3rd acts. And a supporting actress in this film isn't as strong of an actor as everyone else.",

He ends the film in the same established position. Unmoved by his often-careless, restless brother's plight.The film is a beautiful view of Texas, the US and the planet.

            "content": "\"Paris, Texas\" is a co-production between West Germany, France and the UK from the year I was born. The language is mostly English. At approximately 2.5 hours, slightly under, it is a really long film. One of the three writers here is Sam Shepard, a very prolific actor himself, and actually this movie is from the year when he scored his one and only Oscar nomination, so you could say that he was maybe at his creative peak there. The script is not by Wim Wenders, the man who is considered one of the finest German filmmakers of all time and luckily he is still alive and I got to see him in person a few years ago on the occasion of one of his newest movies. He also was very prolific of course when it comes to documentaries, but this movie we have here is a definite contender for his most known live action movie, even if I must say it is not my favorite from him. As you can see from my rating perhaps too. But that is just because some of the other stuff he came up with is so good and not because this one here is bad or anything. It definitely is not. Nonetheless I would say that the awards attention, namely a BAFTA win, a unanimous Palme d'Or and the big prize at the German Film Awards that year were a bit too much, just like the fact that it is still listed in the imdb top250 highest-rated movies at that point, even if it is very low on said list, so could fall out in 2021 or 2022 perhaps.The Golden Globe nomination was for Foreign Film obviously, but at the Oscars of course it did not get in, was not even selected by West Germany because, like I said early on, the film is in the English language. And not just the name of the director is a pretty famous one here, but also some of the names and faces from the cast will seem familiar. The one lead actor here is Harry Dean Stanton, who was probably older already than he looked when he made this movie and died not too long at a relatively ancient age. But he left us another western to say farewell and that one is pretty good too, just like this one here. Can you call this film a western? I don't know. Sometimes it seemed to me this way, especially the desert scenes very early on, but I can also see why people would say it is a drama, family drama probably, just like it is declared here on imdb. It's not too important anyway what it is. As long as it's good. And that it is. So yeah, Stanton does a good job, but a lot of his performance is very quiet, very subtle, not only becaue he is not talking at all in the first 30 minutes or even more. Stockwell plays his brother and he is still alive today and Cl\u00e9ment plays the latter's wife and so is she, but she is not that old anyway, so no big surprise, but still nice. I actually liked how they acted towards the protagonist and how they treated him, also the small gestures. Of course, she was scared of losing her \"son\" to him, but she did her best to not make it too obvious. And it came pretty easy because she liked him too, even if he was just extended family.The child actor here is played by Hunter Carson, who has the same first name like his character and I think that is nothing too uncommon for Wenders, but I will get to that later on. The late Bernhard Wicki has a nice little cameo early on that brought more comedy than I expected and I also did not really expect him to be in this movie, but I am still glad he is in it and he was a welcome inclusion. And finally Nastassja Kinski: She has a lot of screen time in the last third of the movie. I read that some thought her portrayal was iconic even (many still think so today), but I would not go that far. Still she was very commanding and gave a great performance and definitely stole the last 40 minutes, even if admittedly Stanton had absolutely no material there to be on equal terms with her. It's all about her there. And she is very good. A bit of a pity that she could not deliver the exact same way many more times in her long career. After seeing her here, her talent is undeniable. She plays the mother of the boy I just mentioned. This surprised me a bit I must say because she seemed way too young at first to have a kid that is almost ten, so I thought she was just another character, but no she is indeed the mother. I thought maybe the first blonde woman could be the mother, but the protagonist was just disappointed what she had turned into and that is why he kept moving forward to find the mesmerizing character played by Kinski. Of course, that also means quite something if I say it as somebody who is not really too much into blondes.One thing you need to pay attention to is the use of the color red in the last third of the movie, not only, but most of all when it comes to clothing. However, there are also smaller examples of striking red like for example the telephone. Or the car of course. Cars I could say. Actually, I felt that maybe they were following the wrong car when a second red car showed up, but I should have trusted the boy. Clearly he knew what he was doing. My bad. In terms of him and how he goes on a road trip with his father in the second half, I immediately had to think of \"Alice in the Cities\". Wenders clearly loved the idea of a grown man travelling around with a child in order to have said child reunited with his parents. But the good thing is that it never felt repetitive, so all is fine. I also liked to watch how he grows closer with his father. And how it all happens relatively undramatic. Like there is no huge emotional turmoil for the son. Like there is for his uncle's wife. The son says on one occasion even that he has two dads now when he talks to his friend from school. And how he eventually does walk home with his father after the initial struggles and how he calls him \"dad\" after watching the old video with his parents I think was downright sweet. The uncle was also a bit more relaxed than his wife, but hey it makes sense. Women are often more emotional.One thing I must say is that this film was heading into a completely different direction than I expected early on when we have these scenes with the mute man in the desert. I would not say I had any idea really which directions it could be going for, but what happened and what paths Wenders was going on I did not expect. As for the muteness and the sound of voices, this is a very crucial component here: Early on, our \"hero\" would not talk at all and at the end when he is talking to his former partner, he initially has nothing but his voice to keep her in the room as initially she does not see him, only hear him and yet she does not recognize him because, like she said, she heard his voice in every man. But yeah, that was really impressive framework there that made quite an impact in my opinion and not too many paid attention I have a feeling. The development and transformation of Harry Dean Stanton's character. Of course, as always with Wenders, there is also a pretty unique of subtle (and sweet) comedy to his movies. Nothing in your face. The exact opposite in fact, but still it just gets audiences in really good spirits and makes you feel a bit warm inside your chest. The reunion of mother and son is of course also very touching at the end and Wenders sure knows how to come up with happy endings that also feel pretty authentic and not just for the sake of making audiences feel good while losing realism and authenticity in the process. Not the case here luckily. This film surely felt shorter than it actually was and for 150-minute movies (or almost), this is always a good sign. Nicely done from everybody involved.The criticisms I have here are just minor really, here and there a scene I did not like that much or that did not feel too realistic, but maybe that is also at least partially subjective. One example would be how HDS's character falls asleep inside the car with his boy calling him to follow the red car. That was a bit absurd maybe. But yeah, difficult to come up with real flaws here. Wenders' films are always nicely atmospheric and have also really good music. This one is no exception. Honestly, the western elements early on made me wish for Wenders to do a 100% western movie (like the old ones with Eastwood etc.), but I'm afraid this will never become reality. Oh yeah, I had this film on my watch list for a long, long time, so I am happy that I got lucky to see this film on the big screen yesterday on the occasion of Wenders' 75th birthday not too long ago. If you get the chance, I recommend you to take it as well. certainly better than to see this film on a small laptop or television screen. Anyway, finally I will create a frame as well because the title confused me a bit and I always kinda thought that it would include a journey from the French capital to Texas, but of course I was really wrong as the comma should have told me anyway. I give this film a thumbs-up overall, even though not a truly enthusiastic one. But it is a good watch and I suggest you go check it out.",

            "content": "The film is a deconstruction of the lies and fakes that human lives are built upon, functioning either as a compromise, or a compensation for their unresolved feeling of emptiness. There are several patterns of rehearsal and simulation in \"Texas, Paris\". To begin with, the very title gives the first hint and synthesis of imitation in the story. The original Paris, the idea and mirage the characters dream to live up to, confronted with the sadness and vacuum involved by the impossibility to recreate it. The characters are too absorbed in their incapacity to make their dramas intelligible to themselves and, therefore, too conflicted to be authentic in the hypostasis they are supposed to embrace. Consequently, they mime roles and concepts instead of accessing and revaluing their emotional potential within themselves. The fake family of Walt, Anne and Hunter, for instance. The two grown-ups are playing the parents instead of becoming biological parents themselves. Anne's despair in seeing Travis and Hunter, the real father and son, growing close, as well as her rhetorically articulated fear of what might happen to her marriage should Hunter join his real parents, could also be interpreted as a tentative of escapism from the problems and disconnections within the couple. A \"borrowed\" child and the picture of the dream-family living tranquilly in the suburbs might very well have worked as Prozac for the couple, since both of them seem to lack the inner instruments and resources to define themselves and their feelings in relation to each other in a marital context and build their marriage on real, solid grounds. When accusing her husband of \"promoting the father and son business\", she objectifies a highly humane, delicate and heart-felt subject approaching it in the cold terms of PR and soap-opera, which highlights the extent of her emotional numbness and self-alienation once more. She is more or less in the banner business together with her spouse. Certainly, Walt's particular line of work with banners is not an accident in the movie, but carries the same symbolical connotations of clich\u00e9s unanimously accepted and imposed as reality. Travis buys a lot named Paris, hoping to settle down there with the woman he loves, but his real-life sentimental paraphrasing of the city of love ends up in a domestic ordeal, abandon and, eventually, loneliness. Having returned to his son, he doesn't know how to behave with him, wondering how a \"Father\" normally relates to his child. He tries on the \"rich father\" role, suit and hat involved, because he has no affective notion and practice of parenthood, at first. Then, when the father and son are walking on two parallel sides of the road on the way back home, Travis mocking his own clumsy father figure morgue and Hunter imitating him, we finally see the two of them in tune with each other, slowly growing out of the stern roles and pretense in their lives and coming to an emotional and authentic reconnection through game, humor and sound self-parody. From that point on, as the story progresses, Hunter undresses himself of his self-perception and experience as Walt's and Anne's surrogate son. The quick, amazing familiarization with each other leaves the viewer with the impression that there had always been a deep father and son complicity that was interrupted and now restored, put back in its rights, as Travis went back being his son's reference point on that street. Heart-broken after their romantic failure, Jane leaves her son in safer hands and reconstructs her particular connection with Travis in her imagination, since their relationship had become too self-destructive to be continued in real-life. Since her mind is no longer able to recreate her lost love's voice and features, she takes a job that consists of entertaining men whom she can't see behind a wall-mirror, identifying their voices with Travis's, and perhaps even hoping he was among them. She, too, elaborates her own substitute for her irreplaceable and impossible romance in a room that is essentially a pretense of intimacy and connection. The wall-mirror is a metaphorical separator of globular lives that can't find peace and a sense of fulfillment within themselves before opening up to one another, held captive within the tragic narcissism of their unhealed obsessions. Bottom line, the movie shows us a very realistic bunch of existentially disoriented people having their lives reduced to a void, striving to deny their sadness while manufacturing surrogates and more tolerable versions of their condition. Personally, I noticed some similarities between Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch as far as their theoretical approach on the human condition, loneliness and absurd are concerned. However, while Jarmusch leaves his characters in the uttermost meaninglessness and entropic alienation, this state is only the beginning of the characters' quest for truth and connection in Wenders's far more tender film, making the passage from fake and artificial postures to self-confrontation and blunt honesty, love and, eventually, some melancholic form of togetherness.",

            "content": "\"This society eliminates geographical distance only to produce a new internal separation.\" - Guy DebordWim Wenders has long been an admirer of Michelangelo Antonioni. In 1994 he assisted the Italian director in the production of \"Beyond the Clouds\", and five years later would write \"My Time With Antonioni\", a diary of his extraordinary experiences working on the film.Wenders is also a huge Nicholas Ray fan. In 1980 he made \"Lighting Over Water\", a documentary about the last days of director Nicholas Ray.It should be no surprise, then, that Wenders' \"Paris, Texas\" is so strongly indebted to both directors. Part Antonioni's \"The Passenger\" and part Ray's \"In A Lonely Place\", the film is also another in a long line of Wim Wenders road movies.Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, an elderly man who has spent the past 4 years wandering in the wilderness. Like Jack Nicholson in Antonioni's \"The Passenger\", Travis is trying to escape his past. He wishes to return to his place of conception, paradoxically a point of non-existence and a point of birth. Travis does not only want to eradicate himself, he wishes to restart. To be reborn.Most of \"Paris, Texas\" consists of Travis navigating vast empty spaces. Like Antonioni, Wenders favours vacant expanses, his characters sliding across their fabricated landscapes, dwarfed by concrete indifference. Wenders also makes gorgeous use of neon lights, and consults his many photo albums when choosing his shooting locations (Wenders is an exhibited photographer, and often travels the world photographing buildings, landscapes and people). This lends the film a unique look: a travelogue of alienation.With its designer existentialism, \"Paris, Texas\" covers the same thematic areas as Antonioni. But where the Italian director is cold and sterile, Wenders - a Christian - is filled with a fiery sort of humanity. Maybe he got this from Ray, who could be remarkably warm even at darkest moments. Wenders makes a mistake than Antonioni never made, however, and spends the entire final act of his film explaining what led to Travis disappearing for four years. It turns out that Travis married a young woman and had a son with her. Life was happy and carefree, until disillusionment, jealousy and a sort of existential nausea crept into their relationship. This led to the couple breaking apart. She, in typical Antonioni fashion, turned to empty sex with strangers in an attempt to distract her from her problems, placating her dissatisfactions with brief moments of biochemical pleasure. He simply disappeared into the wilderness.By focusing on domestic issues - the problems of raising a son, sex, youth, family, disillusionment, alienation, and shattered relationships \u2013 Wenders manages to lessen the film's overall effect. The film turns into a \"marital problem\", the result of a couple falling out, rather than the more elusive, unspeakably cosmic dilemmas that Antonioni manages to convey. Still, Wenders is great at demonstrating how difficult it is for 2 people to articulate their feelings directly. Toward the end of his film his couple have an extended conversation, Wenders separating them by screens and telephones, husband and wife unable to face one another directly. It's a great scene.8.5/10 \u2013 With \"The Wrong Move\", \"Paris, Texas\", \"Alice in the Cities\", \"The State of Things\", \"Until The End Of The World\", and \"King of the Roads\", Wenders has established himself as the master of road movies. \"Paris, Texas\" isn't as great as some of these films, but it's perhaps his most straight forward, his most accessible, hence its popularity.Note: This film is the reason David Lynch cast Harry Dean Stanton in his own road movie, \"The Straight Story\". Both revolving around two brothers, you might say these two films tell the same story from different points of view.",

A man stumbles out of a desert after 4 years gone missing, and travels back to Los Angeles with his brother to reunite him with his son, before leaving again to find his past lover and the mother of his son. Behind its endlessly clever jiving title lies a totally complete, sentimental and sophisticated work. Seeing Paris, Texas through developed, hardened and scarred eyes is just as poignant as when it splashes over the tabula rasa mind of a supple and innocent child. One of the most wondrous aspects of this film is how Wim Wenders sets off from Europe to the south-west and immediately captures its natural beauty. I remember the opening shot well. When I sat down to watch Paris, Texas, aged 12 or so, my dad came in and said: \"Oh that's a great film. But you have to turn up the volume (on the tiny TV). You can't watch a film with that good a soundtrack with the volume that quiet.\" What follows has become a very personally affecting journey. Analytically, Paris, Texas bears no fruits of profound wisdom or revelations, but then it never sets out to. I'm drawn powerlessly to the way that Wenders treats movement as a completely different entity throughout Paris, Texas, changing his cinematographic aura and mood whenever the characters in focus are travelling, seeking panning shots of everything that the non-studio surrounding has to offer the lens: neon, alien landforms, concrete, scrap metal, cars and interchanges, all with the blissful haunting and chilling score by Ry Cooder: truly one of the most masterful pieces of music ever written. However, when the characters are still: in monologue, in deep conversation, or in thought, the tempo and mood instantly change. Such chameleon-like versatility is immensely impressive, regardless of its content. Taking my two favourite scenes in the film: starting with movement: the protagonist, a closed and intriguing man that silently infatuates the audience from the very beginning, crosses a bridge over a freeway whilst a deranged man screams rapturous gospel in a piercing, timeless voice, whilst Cooder's slide guitar becomes agitated, and Wenders' camera sticks tightly to the protagonist's steps. I read a conversation with the actor who played he who is dubbed Paris, Texas's 'screaming man', and he told me most of the scene was adlibbed. I like that. Don't you? By contrast, the film's climax, its most hailed stationary scene, begins with the protagonist walking through a club, draped in a low and fuzzy light, to a booth, where his past lover comes to join him, unaware of who she is talking to. Her (Natasha Kinskji) and him (Harry-Dead Stanton) play out an overwhelmingly intimate and emotionally power screenplay, whilst the camera doesn't move a muscle. Preamble over: the point I'm getting it as that most scenes in Paris Texas are like this. They're ridden with charm and accessibility whilst still managing to be of breathtaking aesthetic beauty.",

            "content": "A wonderfully subtle tale of a man doing whatever it takes to find redemption for a life of causing pain to others. The most obvious genius of the film is Wenders' use of the color red. Traditionally red is a color of great importance and back in the days when artists mixed their own oil paints, red was only used to represent people of significance. Wenders uses the color in the same way. He highlights important features and characters (Travis, Jane, Anne's heels) with the color red. It's a very subtle way of letting the audience know what to focus on and what is important to the story. I thought the green was used to portray a new starting point in Travis' life since it shows up prominently when he is about to reunite Walt and at the end when he's ready to move on with his life, and I thought that was brilliant.Unfortunately, I read an interview with Wenders that said the green was just something he thought was cool that resulted from a technical problem that he decided to keep in. That was a pretty big letdown, but I'll put it past me. Keeping this brief, the last thing I want to mention is the performances. Aside from Hunter Carson, the entire cast is absolutely brilliant. Everyone is so natural and authentic in their roles that it felt like I was watching the characters instead of the actors. Harry Dean Stanton has the rare ability to say more in a facial expression than most actors can say in a ten minute monologue. Kinski displays such pain and heartache without raising her voice once. Just the stream of tears that quietly flow down her cheeks is more heartbreaking than any middle-aged, mistreated wife shouting at the top of her lungs. This all being said, Hunter Carson fell into the child curse of making it so blatantly clear that he was acting that it made me want to punch him. Overall though, a brilliant work.",

On the other hand, the worlds are completely different... the flatness and lack of deep fields in \"Alice\" are met with gorgeous pastiche of deep reds, blues, and greens in Paris, Texas. Indeed, in this latter movie, visuals sometimes overtake the narrative thread.Wenders certainly has a relationship with vagabond sensibilities that I really dig. In this movie, however, it is almost surprising to see the movie come to a narrative conclusion. Better than the surprise felt at actual closure is the 20 minute long reveal at the ending itself, which is just as satisfying and heartbreaking as the long build-up would bring the audience to expect. I could watch that ending over and over and over again, and it's been a long time since I've seen something so satisfying.--PolarisDiB",

The slight story plays second fiddle to the brilliant camera-work and haunting music by Ry Cooder throughout until the last part. Here the film's visual beauty is undermined by an overlong and overbearing encounter between two main characters in a dark and dank setting.

            "content": "The film begins with a man wandering around a desolate Texas landscape. He looks in a daze. We soon discover that he has been missing for four years. His name is Travis. He manages to find a doctor's house, and get in touch with his brother in California. His brother then travels down to Texas. Travis doesn't speak a word in the first thirty minutes of the film; but Harry Dean Stanton's face tells the story.Travis wanders off down a rail track, while his brother is in town getting him some clothes. They meet up again, but still no words. The trip back to California takes a while because Travis is afraid of flying. Eventually, they arrive, and Travis meets his son for the first time in four years. His son, Hunter, is cautious of his father at first; getting a ride home from school in his friend's car, rather than walking with Travis. They watch a movie together of them on vacation, that was taken four years previously, and Travis finds it hard to watch. After a while Hunter trusts his dad again, and they set off in an old car to find his mother in Houston, Texas. They track her down to a seedy club, where she talks to clients through a mirrored window. Travis find this very hard to do, and talks with his back to her, while he tells her the story of a couple. This is the best scene in the film; two emotional people on each side of a screen opening up to each other. The film is memorable for me for Harry Dean Stanton as Travis, probably his best performance in his career; and also the little boy Hunter Carson deserves special mention too as Hunter. The cinematography is wonderful too. There are many shots that stand out, such as a Statue of Liberty painted on a wall, and other numerous images of Americana. A memorable film.",

It's a  story of trying to rebuild  relationships ,the battle zone between men and women, and the undying bond between fathers and sons. All the performances are excellent: Harry Dean Stanton as a drifter brought back to reality to make amends with his family, Nastasha Kinski playing a southern belle (!), and young Hunter Carson's as a young yet brave lad willing to take an adventure by taking a road trip and getting to know the dad he never knew.  One of Wim Wenders \"road movies\" and one of my personal favorites.  Ry Cooder's soundtrack adds to the films mesmerizing mood.  \"Paris, Texas\"  deservedly won best picture at the Cannes Film Festival '84, it's also one of the few films that made me cry.  Most highly recommended. 10 out of 10.",

It was such a beautiful scene that had imprinted into by mind for quite awhile.The scenario was simple and relate-able. Young couples fell in love, living in the fast lane. Then naturally things happened in life, they couldn't take it, and they went to lead themselves separate lives. The feeling was still there and they met again.

            "content": "It is a bit ironic that a German film director, Wim Wenders, along with a German/French film company came into the United States to make an American film in English! Unlike American film makers who invade Europe and usually film in English with the American audience in mind. \"Paris, Texas\" is a slice of American life probably set in the early 1980's about love and failure. It has to do with a man who has walked around in a daze for four years and then suddenly must deal with his past and the things that he has done as they are stirred back into his memory. Up front, the movie begins slowly and moves at the pace of a handicapped snail. Wim Wenders has a visual style that is reflected on screen in meticulous framing and almost unworldly like colors with scenes that would be very ordinary in everyday life. He is a stickler for details and initially creates a not too sympathetic protagonist in Travis who subsequently finds himself peeled like an onion. As we see these layers and begin to understand his past history, one can more empathize with him, even if he appears to be irrational at times. Such is the human condition. Although Harry Dean Stanton receives nearly 100% of the screen time because he is in almost every scene, it is Nastassja Kinski who is the lynch pin of the film. It is her performance that makes this slowly evolving film so memorable. This role alone should have been sufficient to propel her into the foremost ranks of super stardom. Her principal scene is unforgettable.Along with \"Tess,\" \"Paris, Texas\" cries out for a region one special edition DVD with director's commentary and appropriate comments from the two main leads, Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski. Only available in an out of print VHS tape format in the US, I took a chance and bought an all region DVD out of Brazil. Luckily, it played flawlessly.The recently released region 1 DVD is nothing less than superb with a stunning transfer and audio commentary by Wim Wenders - not to be missed for those who liked this film. And now there is a Blu-Ray transfer from Criterion released in early 2010, that is a must buy for anyone who really liked the film on standard DVD. Almost everything has been fixed via what must have been a painstaking remastering process, approved by Wim Wenders, and to be expected from Criterion. Simply super sharp and stunning on a high definition screen.",

Like the brother, we find ourselves quickly frustrated by the mystery surrounding the man's past, but it eventually gets revealed when he integrates into society again. The subtle friction he causes with his son and brother accentuates just how out of touch he is. The acting of this depiction is superb - there is little overt melodrama and it is all quite subtle, a sense of discomfort that yearns to be resolved. This resolution comes in the form of an almost therapeutic third act where the mother finally returns to the picture, asking just how much we deserve redemption. The ending is truly touching but does raise questions of just how far we can offer forgiveness and whether we are actually better off leaving the past in the past.",

Directed by German auteur Wim Wenders (who also helmed the excellent 'Wings of Desire' (1987)), the slow-moving film is mesmerizing at times, especially the scenes in the starkly beautiful Mojave Desert. The cast is off-beat but excellent, with Harry Dean Stanton (one of the all-time great understated character actors) as Travis the laconic drifter, former child star Dean Stockwell and gorgeous French actress Aurore Cl\u00e9ment as his concerned brother and sister in law, Nastassja Kinski as Travis' wife Jane and Hunter Carson, who is outstanding as Travis eight-year old son. The film is much about identity, misperception and dichotomy (the title comes from people confusing Paris, France with Paris, Texas, which is only seen as a photo of a small parcel of desert wasteland and seems to be Travis' 'alpha and omega'). The final scene, in which Travis tells his story in the third-person to Jane in a uniquely intimate yet remote way, is a bit long, but ultimately satisfying.

The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie \"begins\" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie.

It had the same sort of suspense building and economical dialogue, so that I had to focus on the characters to understand them. I did expect someone to start shooting all the way through it too.A lot of the script seemed to be ad-libbed, which was fine and added to the realism, but they all talked so slowly that it really dragged. It also appeared that Travis had some sort of mental ailment that regressed his mind back to that of a child, which was never really explained.I believe that this film could have been about 30 minutes shorter if they had conversed faster and not paused for such long times over nothing. I also believe that it should have been cut, a lot!After about 45 minutes I found it a struggle to remain interested, because there wasn't even a hint as to what had actually happened, so it started to frustrate me and I'm not sure that I was fully convinced by the resolution in the end anyway.By the time Travis got to the strip club I was completely bored of it, but at that point I realised that I might as well finish it.I'm pretty confident that it wasn't worth watching to the end. The big reveal wasn't as spectacular as I had hoped and I was annoyed that I'd bothered to finish it when I could have cut my losses and watched something else.There were far better ways to end the film, something with excitement or intrigue or even just less drawn out would have been good.

Fantastic to look at virtually every frame. The Music by Ry Cooder is one of the best movie soundtracks in the history of cinema; it's simply brilliant.The plot (or story, if you like) of this film is essentially very simple. You get to the end and you say to yourself \"yes, of course\". It's not about loss, separation, grieving, that would be too obvious. Remember - this film comes from a time before movies got clever with their audiences. In the end this film is what it seems; about a father who has to come to terms with, and do something about, the fact that he wasn't fitted for a relationship with the mother of his son. There aren't many other themes (although one would be the sub-story of Stantons brother and sister in law who have adopted the boy and see him pretty much as their son. The sister in law wonders what will become of their relationship if the boy goes away). The only possible outcome is the one arrived at in the final memorable and superb monologue.The thing for me about Paris, Texas is that; like Harry Dean Stantons' character - time changes a person. Since I first saw this movie in the cinema in 1985 my age has doubled and I now have a child of the same age as the boy in the film (also wonderfully acted). I see this film very differently now to the way I viewed it back then. Any father would see resonances from Stanton to their own life. I love this film for the way it makes me think about the way I relate to those who are close to me; Can I handle it? What would happen if I couldn't? Nevertheless - Paris, Texas is not for me one of the greatest films ever made, and it is not in my collection of DVD/BluRay. Why? Yes - its set in a decaying landscape both emotionally and physically. Yes - Stanton is wonderful as the lost guy coming out of the wilderness, BUT. Near the beginning of the film the doctor extorts money from Stantons brother - who is a long way from home and finds that he has to pay the doctor in order to complete his mission. The whole film is like this; there is feeling of moral and emotional blackmail running right through and all the adult characters have been afflicted, damaged if you like, by emotional blackmail to a lesser or greater degree. The only one who hasn't is the little boy. These tensions are revealed but not resolved. Even though its obvious that the issues cannot be resolved you get to the end and you feel irritated when indeed they are not. The question which you feel ought to be the central one - why Stanton walks out on his former life - turns out not to be - it's only the spark that sets the flame. The viewer is thus caught up in the emotional blackmail too; we want to see resolution - but.... However, I guess it is clever for that....I liked the film and I would highly recommend it. I haven't read any other reviews here on this movie (and I will be interested to do so as soon as I post this...). I would welcome too any comments made on my submission - as movies of this calibre are well worth observation and discussion.",

His only solace was leading others to it, that they might enter and lead a better life than him.\"This was an idea from the Bible that had always stuck with me from Sunday School classes from my childhood. Paris, Texas is a modernised version of that passage, and it struck such a chord in me emotionally that I had to re-watch it the day after. I now consider it one of the, if not the, greatest film of all time.Travis (a mercurial Harry Dean Stanton) wanders out of the desert not knowing who he is. His brother (the always reliable Dean Stockwell) finds him, and helps to pull his memory back of the life he led before he walked out on his family and disappeared four years earlier. Travis decides to reunite his family, leading him and his young son, Hunter, on a journey in search of his wife, Jane.Even though Robby M\u00fcller's cinematography is perfection throughout. (Seriously, the colours pop in such a way that the film regularly looks like a work of art) The true beauty of the film is Wim Wenders' and Sam Shepard's ability to create characters that feel so real. I never thought I'd be able to emphasise with every single character of a film, but it's testament to both Wenders and Shepard's genius as filmmakers that it's possible in this film. The phrase \"cinematic poetry\" always struck me as an empty compliment, but it makes total sense to use it to describe this film. The one way mirrors of Jane's occupation speak so much volumes and furthers the divide between the man and his wife. It is not until Travis explains his behaviour that the barrier between them is broken. They are fully able to understand each other, and realise that the possibility of reuniting is truly unavailable. The physical barrier still exists, but the emotions they feel are able to conquer any border. Like all art for me, I can appreciate it even more if I feel an emotional connection to it. No other film has struck me emotionally in such a strong way in years. Travis leading Hunter to Jane in the hope of starting afresh as a family, and then leaving because he knew he couldn't be with them is just such a heartbreaking and beautiful idea to me. He wanted the best for the ones he loved more than his own life, and the best was not to be with him. So the man has to go on, leaving all that he holds dear and start again on his own accord with only the knowledge that they're happy together to keep him comfort. Truly stunning. That freaking gorgeous pink jumper that Kinski wears may be my favourite movie costume of all time.",

            "content": "When this film reached cable I saw a couple of minutes of it, expecting to walk out the door as I had things to do that day.  Two hours plus later I had missed getting to things I had to do and I was both emotionally and mentally dazed.  I did not see it again until today (March, 2001) but despite a gap of probably twelve years I've never forgotten it - and scenes from the film, bits of the story came back to me over and over again.Its a slow paced film and for that reason will probably lose many viewers - but it is very carefully constructed on many levels and has lots to say about the human condition.  The audio with Ry Cooder's music to back it up is quiet and matches the mood perfectly.The visual construction is subtle, often very flat - bright desert, muted twilights, lots of darkness.   Its the antithesis of the usual Hollywood flash - but its also clear that the director knew exactly what he was doing - and even more - that his ideas were good.  And I wont spoil the fun by pointing out the complexity of the motifs used.The script addresses emotional issues directly - but almost imperceptibly.And the crowning touch on it all is Harry Dean Stanton's performance - which almost does not appear to be a performance.  I've not been able to see him in anything else without remembering this character.It will probably never be a popular film - but I would rate it in my top 10 - maybe my top five.  Its a movie that requires an investment in attention and thought and that will pay it back many times over.If your taste runs toward exploding helicopters and lots of noise, do yourself a favor and skip this, you'll probably hate it.  But if you want more out of a movie - this is a great one.",

            "review_title": "Stark Yet Absorbing Story Is One Of Best Films Of 1980s",
            "content": "I generally like stories which unfold deliberately \u2013 those which don't give away all the details up front. I respect directors who intentionally dole out information on a \"need to know\" basis. I'm often drawn to films whose stories might begin in the middle of a long overarching plot line. When I first saw German director Wim Wenders' 1984 English-language achievement, \"Paris, Texas,\" I was hooked from the start.In the only leading role of his career, longtime character actor Harry Dean Stanton meanders through a vast, lonely desert, apparently confused, and disconnected from the real world. He stumbles into a bar and promptly faints. Thus begins one of the most interesting sagas I've ever seen on screen. Stanton's character, Travis, turns out to be the father of a boy he abandoned four years earlier. With the help of his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), Travis returns to Los Angeles to reunite with his son, Hunter (a very unaffected and pragmatic Hunter Carson). But Travis suffers from severe amnesia. He doesn't know how he ended up in the stark desert of West Texas, nor does he remember Hunter \u2013 at least at first.As Travis' memory slowly returns, Stanton delivers the best acting of his career. With very little dialog, we witness Travis reconnecting with the life he left behind for one reason or another. Stanton's facial expressions allow the backstory to unfold at an intentional pace, brilliantly orchestrated by Wenders, revealing just enough information to give us time for every little nuance to sink in. After viewing old home movies at his brother's house, Travis takes Hunter to Houston to find the boy's mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski, in the best performance of her career), who now works as a striptease artist at a peepshow. The long scene of Travis speaking to Jane through the one-way mirror is a thing of cinematic beauty. Stanton speaks slowly and calculatingly, as he discloses the story of their tragic relationship. It's a poignant apology, if you will, which also serves as the catalyst for reuniting Jane with her son.As in many Wenders films, the primary character is disconnected from the hustle and bustle of modern life. His world is a world of vast, persistent deserts, which seems to operate in perpetual slow-motion. Even the Los Angeles scenes are bleak and dreary. In one of the best Los Angeles scenes I've ever witnessed, Travis walks across a footbridge over one of the area's many interstate highways. He passes a man screaming at the top of his lungs about an encroaching end-of-the-world scenario. No one is listening, Travis walks right past him, and the man continues his tirade. Both Travis and the screaming man are disconnected from one another, and from the outside world of soccer moms, businessmen, and overworked citizens.Wenders' longtime cinematographer, Robby Muller, presents the West Texas desert as the world in which we exist, and the city scenes of Los Angeles and Houston are merely overpopulated versions of that barren desert. Ry Cooder's deft slide guitar music plays throughout, further epitomizing the vast emptiness of the cinematography. \"Paris, Texas\" presents a vacuous world, into which is infused a deeply touching story of lost love.\"Paris, Texas\" was the unanimous choice for the coveted Palm D'Or (or top prize) at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Next to David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet,\" it is my favorite film of the 1980s. Yes, \"Paris, Texas\" moves at a very deliberate pace. It's obviously not for everyone. But what a beautiful change of pace from the obnoxiously overbearing superhero cinema of today! Take a break from life, and spend a few hours with this subtle yet moving story. \"Paris, Texas\" is this month's Buried Treasure.",

            "content": "I saw this film when I was 15 and have never forgotten the effect it had on me. I have read some of the negative comments about the film and am surprised I have to say. I myself never thought the film slow. The pace is well handled as it focuses on a man coming back to reality, coming back to the world after he has disappeared unable to cope with life. The themes running through this film are important and Wenders manages to fuse a European and American feel throughout the film. I have read a couple of books on him and growing up in Germany he was always fascinated by American culture as a lot of Europeans are, not carrying the burden of a long history. I know that he and Robby Muller the DOP looked at paintings of Edward Hopper to inspire the look of the film. To me a good film has a strong atmosphere and well rounded characters. This film delivers on every count. I find the scene in the booth when he meets his wife very beautifully written and it is a masterstroke to have them face each other through a one way mirror, a powerful metaphor for relationships. The moment when Kinski turns at the bar always sticks in my mind as does the time Travis walks his kid home from school and they finally cross the road to meet each other. Lastly when Travis is shown the old film footage the pain on his face is very real. This is a draining scene and one which looks at the effect memory plays on the mind. This is my favourite film and possibly one reason why I started to direct myself. Everyone should see this film at least once as it taught me many things, the best being that cinema can be truly wonderful and life affirming.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a slow-paced movie which does not have a lot of dialogue for much of the film. However, silence is a powerful tool. The cinematography by Robert M\u00fcller of the dry arid landscape and beautiful lighting combined with Ry Cooder's guitar playing really accentuate the emotions this film will draw out of you and the long static shots of scenery and scenes are very beautiful.Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering the desert aimlessly. He is, at this point, a mute. Luckily, Harry Dean Stanton acts this out wonderfully, despite having very little dialogue, Stanton's face is a road map of emotions and dialogue is not needed to transmit these emotions to the viewer.His brother, Walt Henderson (Dean Stockwell) finds him and brings him to his home. Walt mentions to Travis that it has been four years since they last saw him. During this time, Walt and his wife, Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment), have raised Travis's son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), as their own. This is due to the disappearance of Travis, and Hunter's mother Jane (Nastassja Kinski).The relationships in this movie are very powerful. Love can be a wonderful thing. However, life also has its share of chores and duties. Which, unfortunately, sometimes can leave some relationships at the wayside until it is too late and you end up wondering \"What happened?\".That is why I believe this film resonates with so many. We have all had relationships, whether it's friends or lovers, where you can't pinpoint exactly where it went wrong - but that eventually you are left without them and in a state of minor amnesia as to what exactly happened. The signs of it failing were there, but you paid no heed. All you have are the nostalgic memories and things can never return to what they were.Maybe not to the extent of Travis Henderson, however, symbolically I think this is part of what makes this movie shine. Travis and Jane both needed closure, and to an extent, their son as well.I will not spoil the ending to the movie, however, it is a controversial one. I would have preferred a different ending, however, sometimes the ending you want to see is not the best ending for the movie.",

There's more than a few slow spots between his comatose emergence out of the sagebrush and the final, troubled reunion, anchored only by Stanton's weather-beaten face and the haunting strains of Ry Cooder's slide guitar. The film ends with one of director Wim Wenders' typically intense, extended dialogues, during which Stanton sacrifices his past to save his future. Kinski isn't offered the same luxury, but a bittersweet resonance still lingers long after the final credits.",

To respond to Thomas Clements argument that \"Yes, the photography is excellent, but come on, how many movies have lousy photography?\", wellI would say a hell of a lot! I cannot truthfully say that i have seen any movies in the recent past (with the possible exception of Once Were Warriors) that has put any effort, creativity or anything of worth into its photograhy, the trouble being that the vast majority of moviegoers care not a bit for the photograpy of the product they are weatching.Todays audience is force fed the action/high speed/smush of hollywood and to say that films like 2fast 2 furious/gone in 60 seconds etc are an example of good photography because of the car chases etc is a prime example of lack of knowledge, the greates of this genre are all from the 60's/70's, Bullit/Italian Job/French Connection/Rendezvous etc. where the dirsctor of photography actually had something to create as appose to fill the screen with SFX ad most have to contend with these days.You want to see photography ?, watch any John Ford/Sergio Leone et al and see what film Photography really is about.

            "content": "It is a powerful and sad story by German director Wim Wenders, with the screenplay mostly written by Sam Shepherd. It features several remarkable performances by folks who are not usually leading actors.Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is a man who deserted his young wife and two-year-old son when he was no longer able to deal with his jealousy, alcoholism, and the recognition of his wife abuse. His much younger wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), still only about 20 years old, then does not believe she can provide their son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), what he needs and leaves him with Travis' younger brother and wife, Walt (Dean Stockwell) and Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment). They essentially raise Hunter as their son.Four years after he disappeared, Travis emerges from the desert speechless. A doctor calls a phone number he finds on Travis and contacts Walt, who comes from Los Angeles to south Texas to get his brother and to take him home.The film follows Travis' slow emergence from silence and his gradual reconnection with his son. Travis learns that Jane has also lost contact with Hunter, but sends small sums of money through a Houston bank for Hunter once a month. Without telling his brother, Travis and Hunter travel to Houston to locate Jane.Travis finds Jane working in a peep show and in a second visit to her booth has a long conversation with her through a one-way mirror, unpacking the story of their marriage and its collapse. Travis tells Jane that Hunter is waiting for her, but that he is too damaged to be part of the relationship. After Jane meets Hunter in a hotel, Travis drives into the night.This short summary doesn't do justice to the story. Harry Dean Stanton has performed many bit parts in movies, but never a leading role. He is amazing as Travis, a simple man unable to be reconciled with his demons. Dean Stockwell had given up movies and was selling real estate when he got the part of the brother, Walt, who works hard to rescue Travis, but ultimately can do no more. Young Hunter Carson was amazing as a seven-year-old boy who is often the leader in the Hunter-Travis relationship. Anne worries about her marriage with Walt if Hunter is no longer part of it. High quality all around.The title comes from the town where Travis had bought a vacant lot in happier times when he wanted to build a house for his family. The cinematography of rural Texas is excellent. The musical score undergirds the story.The sadness, which left me in tears, came in taking Hunter from Walt and Anne who had become his emotional parents, as well as the return at the end of the film of Travis to the desert from which he had briefly emerged at great cost. I loved the depth at which the characters were developed, though I was dissatisfied with the disappearance of Walt and Anne from the film in the second half. It felt like unfinished business.",

            "content": "I truly did not know what to expect with Paris, Texas. It looked like to be some European director's take on the American western. I am glad I gave Wim Wenders's film a chance because it is a deeply profound, moving picture about one man's existence set in a grim, bleak world of loneliness. Anyone who has felt these urges of loneliness can relate to our main character, played superbly by the great American character actor Harry Dean Stanton. Wenders is known for his character studies by delivering thoughtful if flawed characters that embark on some sort of road trip throughout America. This movie felt more at home when compared to the experimental films from the 60's and 70's with similar themes. Set in the world where big blockbusters were given prominence, this is fresh breath of air that stays with you for a long, long time. Wenders combined his West German New Age sensibilities with screenwriter Sam Shepard's (yes, also the actor) raw, bleak take on America. Shepard, being a playwright, always had an idea for meaningful, non-contrived dialogue. The screenplay is a major source of power. Credit needs to be given to Robby Muller's outstanding cinematography because the way he captured the unforgiving Texas landscape, rock formations and blended these shots with the bleak urban setting adds power. When Ry Cooder's haunting yet powerful slide guitar score is heard with Muller's landscape shots, emotion is just waiting to be pulled up from deep within.I honestly find it very hard to label the film as a foreign film. Yet this is a German production from a German director despite a screenplay from an American playwright. In the 80's, the world was borderline anti-American due to Reagan's policies, but the film received good notices at the Cannes Film Festival. Wenders, like his fellow German New Age directors like Herzog always was fascinated with American culture whether that be rock music, fashion, or its mythology. Being a guy with a tendency to make films that are about road trips where characters undergo emotional journeys, this was right up Wenders's alley. This is a small, affectionate movie about a man who is lost but needs to be found. Rather than focusing on the plot, Shepard and Wenders focused on emotion. Ironically, the film is not located in the Texas city of Paris. The title comes from a photograph that mentioned the city, just in case that clears anything up.This film begins with an immensely powerful shot. Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out in the desolate landscape wearing a dusty baseball cap and a worn-out sports jacket. He just wanders until he is found by this isolate German doctor. Apparently, he disappeared without a trace. Word gets out to his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who lives in Los Angeles with his wife Anne (Aurore Clement), so Walt sets out to retrieve him. Travis originally does not remember why he suddenly dropped his marriage with Jane (Nastassja Kinski) four years earlier which caused them to leave their four-year-old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) at Walt's doorstep. With Travis's return, who is on a mission to visit Paris, Texas where he has property, the question is what will happen with Travis and Hunter. Hunter has vague memories of his father, but he considers Walt to be his real father. When Anne divulges some important information, Travis may have to go to Houston if he wants to put the pieces of his life back together.Harry Dean Stanton has always been one of cinema's best character actors. He has a recognizable face and shines in each role, no matter how small the part. He was unsure of the role given his 34-year age difference between himself and Kinski, but that doesn't matter because he truly excelled as a leading man. I felt his pain as his past comes back to haunt him. I loved how he tried to connect with his son again. Everything just felt...so real. In the few scenes he had with Nastassja Kinski, both actors were powerful. Kinski is the daughter of famous German actor, Klaus Kinski which I did not know until I researched the movie. Dean Stockwell was on the verge of retiring from movies before he got this role. His supporting performance is nuanced and has lots of depth. Both Stockwell and Stanton as long-lost brothers truly had some tearjerking scenes with one another. Finally, I even liked Hunter Carson's portrayal as an ordinary American kid that is given extraordinary circumstances.At 150 minutes, Paris, Texas is a small movie that takes its sweet time telling its story. Wim Wenders has a lot to say about this one man trying to rediscover himself amidst the unforgiving desert landscape of the American West. It may be a small picture, but its one to remember for a long time. This is actually my first Wim Wenders movie. What a fortunate discovery! This is right at home for similar films like Midnight Cowboy or Easy Rider. Even better than those films! I was deeply affected by this man's journey from start to finish. The resolution was not what I all hoped but it does not make it any less powerful. If you want to see a character-driven movie that will emotionally wreck you, here you are! Harry Dean Stanton is the reason to see the film.My Grade: A.",

This boy likes action films and thrillers.  But when they ask me about my favourite film of all time they are stunned to beleive it is Paris, Texas.  I was 9 when it came out and watched it I seemed to like it then but didn't know why.  I then found out why the story, the music the photography, the rediscovery of the life you had left and of course the acting and direction.  I watched again 6 years later and found it to be one of the most amazing films ever made.  It took me another 3 years to find it on video and when I did it was a dream come true.  I didn't find a new video version oh no! I found it in a shop that sold pre rented videos and in the midst of all the jumble I saw it an original Palace release I say original due to the fact that there is no barcode on the packaging what so ever and is now my pride and joy of my video collection(along with the video for Southern Comfort which is rated X on the cover).  My only wish is for a DVD release.  I know there is a Japanese DVD but is it remastered is it full widescreen? NO!Anyway as I have said before it is MY personal favourite and I wish that people who have not seen it go out and give it a try just to see why people rant on about it.",

By turns a mystery, an adventure, a love story as well as one of the best renditions of the emergence of wisdom-within-relationship that I have ever seen. This film may take a bit of patience the first time one views it but, I assure you, that patience pays off. This kind of human depth is only achieved once in a blue moon in today's cultural landscape. Did I say that I recommend this movie? I think that, in particular, the combination of European and American perspectives makes for an especially fresh presentation of some classic themes.",

I'm also a film student, and many other inspiring directors may thing that I should be flogged in the testicles with a bull pizzle for never seeing a Wim Winders' film. Now that I have, maybe they're right. The film was the embodiment of isolation. Character action (Travis getting into the back seat of the car, Travis not speaking, Travis getting rejected from his son when he wants to walk him home, etc,) as well as lighting. Notice when Travis's brother (an impeccable performance by Dean Stockwell) takes him to the 'Rancho Motel' near the beginning of the film. A dark green tint is used, showing how distant this all seems in the eyes of the protangonist. Once they're actually in the room, the walls are pale, white, bland-- like a mental hospital. But when Travis looks into the mirror we see a cool blue, and when his brother appears we see the same. The super-8 footage is the biggest heartbreaker. The child, distancing himself from his father, wakes up... No more than that, I hate spoilers. As I've mentioned, Stockwell was amazing, almost very cool. We know he loves his son, but he really cares about his brother no matter what. Because I'd never really known where he came from outside of \"Blue Velvet,\" it was very interesting to see. Harry Dean Stanton I've always known, and has always been on my top 10 underrated actors of all time list (I'm not giving the whole list, sorry, but I will say the writer of this film, Sam Shepard, is also on it.) He never needed to speak, his facial expressions and body movements often did the speaking for him. His name was Travis (like \"Taxi Driver,\" but don't let that throw you. It's a different isolation here folks.\") Travis is apt because he was a travesty, he was messed up. He sinned and he wasn't even seeking forgiveness, rather, solace. (When his bother is upset with him about flying, he says \"It's alright if you leave me.\") Apart from that, this film needs a DVD release. No extras, fine, but the print that I saw was the VHS crapped out version... With cinematography like this, it deserves more.",

            "content": "The art as others have said, is great - the Ry Cooder soundtrack, linear, no-frills screenplay, and heartfelt acting. But the story itself leaves a lot to be desired.The main character (Travis) comes out of almost literally nowhere and we find out he's abandoned his wife and child who was subsequently also abandoned by his mom, Travis' wife. Meanwhile, Travis' Brother and Sister-In-Law have taken in the child and love and care for him like he was their own. The boy in now part of their family. Lucky boy.Travis' brother takes in Travis who needs time to recover from four years of apparent drunken disappearance somewhere in the desert. Meanwhile Travis gets a chance to at least get to know and possibly reconcile with his boy. Lucky Travis.In getting to know his boy, Travis starts meeting his boy at school and at some point, he and his boy playfully match each other's strides and steps on the way home. This part is pretty cool and I agree with one reviewer who said that walk home should have ended the movie, fading as they disappear on their way to the boy's homeBut no. Instead, Travis who is basically a stranger to his boy takes him without the boy's family knowledge or permission to go find Travis' wife and the boy's mother. Basically kidnapping. The boy's mother knows where he's been living but has made no attempt to connect with him.So, is Travis some kind of emotional hero by basically kidnapping the boy he had abandoned from the boy's loving and dedicated family to find his wife and the boy's mother who also abandoned the boy? Leaving the boy's family desperate and to know where the boy is and deeply hurt once they find out?The mother it turns out works in a peep show. The possible reconciliation between Travis and his wife had possibilities, but there was little emotional energy there. Instead, Travis leaves his boy in the hands of the boy's stranger-mother and leaves again for who knows where.Unrealistic and emotionally empty story. Any normal boy would have longed to be back with the family that was devoted to him and actually loved him. As one reviewer said, this is a flawed story of a guy, Travis, sacrificing his boy on the altar of his attempt at his own restoration and redemption.The glitter of art cannot overcome your gut and conscience when the story doesn't make sense and runs over characters you care about without explanation or solution. The movie left me flat.",

The entire film thoughtfully explains just those questions. This movie is subtle and deep.  The performances are uniformly top notch with Harry Dean Stanton playing the role of his career.

Also, it was never established that Hunter's mum was in any way prepared to regain custody of her son. Hunter had already come to love his foster parents, and they, he. What about the emotional trauma of suddenly ending that relationship? We haven't a clue, because the writer/director didn't think it was necessary to resolve the issue. I'll give it this; it's one of those movies where one truly feels they've gotten their money's worth: it seemed longer'n a Baptist sermon in June.",

An emotion driven, character driven, story-telling masterpiece! What makes this film stand above all others in my mind is its simplicity. A story so simple yet complex in its narrative and characters that compel you into a richness of cinema.The story itself is about a journey, and not wanting to go over what others have said before, it's a journey about past, present and future so well justified. What more should be a film about? A great film doesn't need to be rich in what you see. You need to be enveloped by the characters and the story as well. And this is what this film excels in. It has all of these elements.Undoubtedly Wim's best film ever. And my favourite of all time. Underrated by the Masses... the best scene of all time in any movie seen in my eyes. A long scene, but so moving and life-like that you feel compelled to be there and moved by it! If you want to feel so emotionally bound by a film, and quite a few scenes that are uncompromising against any other film then this is the one. You'll need to sit back and take in what it has to offer, and you'll be greatly rewarded. Masterful Cinema!!!",

Next: a road movie somewhat like Rainman (1988, four years later and much better). Next: back to normal life. Next: finding his wife. The whole story of the couple (which is not very exciting in itself) is told by the main character through a telephone while his wife is listening. Boredom supreme!

It is like the colors comply with the internal state of the protagonist. A sense of movement and development, resembling an affair. For the symbolism of the title we may also seek such an explanation - it all starts in pink, as it would be in Paris and ends monotone and smooth, as life in Texas is. Paris is also a surprise.It turns out that actually everything is rotten inside and did not have to happen at all. But was there a possibility that will not happen? Definitely the most colorful film of Wenders. Spectacular scenery with a few revelations about the bridge that makes each of us connecting with postmodern, ours, civilization.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "Paris, Texas",
            "content": "German director Wim Wenders' long career includes many acclaimed films such as Wings of Desire (1987) and Buena Vista Social Club (1999), but the most well-liked one of all may well be his 1984 road movie Paris, Texas. The story of losing and re-finding one's grip on family has universal appeal, even if it looks pronouncedly American on the surface.Written by L.M. Kit Carson and Sam Shepard, the story begins when a rugged man named Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering on the deserts of Texas. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) is notified and arrives to pick him up, shocked to hear from him after four years of uncertainty about Travis' whereabouts. Together they return to Walt's home to meet his French wife Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment) and Travis' young son Hunter (Hunter Carson) who has been brought up by Walt and Anne ever since something went wrong between Travis and his wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski), leading them both to cut ties with Hunter. Travis decides it is time for him to make up for his past antics and begins a quest to Houston, Texas in order to find Jane again.The instantly striking detail about the whole is certainly the gorgeous scenery of southern USA, magnificently photographed by Wenders' trusted cinematographer Robby M\u00fcller. The vast plains, blue skies and majestic rock formations feel familiar from many westerns, but now convey a different, more modern sense of man's smallness and loneliness amidst them, thanks to Wenders' beautifully composed wide shots of the landscapes and infrastructure. The movie is not all deserts though; the urban streets and nightclubs are also an essential part of the film's atmosphere, often basking in rich green, red or blue lighting. The music by Ry Cooder is not to be left without praise either - the lingering blues guitar notes complement the mood seamlessly.The eye-candy visuals cannot carry a whole film though, but luckily in the case of Paris, Texas they don't have to, since Travis' journey is interesting to see per se. The overall genre and mood keep evolving throughout the story; it begins as a road movie with comedic overtones provided by Walt's frustration with his reticent brother, but later turns into a family drama, only to move back into the road movie territory during the latter parts of the film. The famous ending scenes at a Houston peep show booth are even approaching overt melodrama, a turn that may feel somewhat unfitting considering the earlier tone of the quietly dramedic phases of the story. Even though I feel the emotiveness of the revealing monologue is slightly overdone, the preceding conversations between the characters through a one-way mirror do come across as quite haunting and effective, creating a necessary climax for the tale.The always good Harry Dean Stanton is at home in the lead role that allows him to develop from a bearded tramp into a clean-cut, but still secretly traumatized family man. Dean Stockwell is also a perfect choice for the role of Travis' talkative and responsible brother, as is Nastassja Kinski for the Jane part, even though she only appears in last part of the film. Child actors are often the weakest links of many movies, but the young Hunter Carson gives no reasons to complain, even if his role is a pretty straightforward one.The title of the movie refers to the place where Travis longs to go as he believes he may have been conceived there. It that way it relates to the general theme of returning to one's roots and family, be they on the deserts of Texas or anywhere in the world. In any case, even though I personally liked the first half of the film better than the second, I am convinced Paris, Texas belongs among Wenders' best works that I've seen. All major fields of filmmaking (acting, writing, direction, cinematography, music) come beautifully together in the film \u2013 it can safely be recommended to every fan of cinema in general and makes a good starting point for any Wenders beginner wanting to look into the director's work.",

This film I believe did not contain one extreme close up with a blurry back ground that is rampant in crap film today. Watch any movie today and here is the formula establishing shot two shot extreme close up. who the hell wants to watch a bunch of faces with out of focus lights in the back ground? I sure do not and I'm sick of it it's lazy it shows the film makers have no talent and proves America does not produce art it follows strict formulaic procedures that are akin to tracing or assembly line production. So anyone who says why do you like this movie that is one reason why. This director and his DP actually create art something most film watchers, not film readers, but watchers have no clue about. To film watchers this movie is like a book in hieroglyphics they are symbolically illiterate and so keep waiting for some hack director or writer to give them clues as to what is going on instead of viewing the entire screen as metaphor and symbols portraying the inner workings of characters they see gibberish. The fact is if you can't enjoy films like this you are stupid plain and simple sorry but anyone who lives in a society controlled by media who watches TV for most their life and sits there and goes duh what am I watching here your a moron. It is not the film makers job to teach you how to read film the same way it isn't a writers job to teach you how to read books and what would you call a normal and fully capable and able person in our society who can't read? Illiterate. Read some books on understanding film or their are plenty of YouTube videos discussing film theory. Why am I so truthfully blunt? Because you never see people who can't read doing reviews on books do you? Well do you? Yet film illiterates are so proud to stand up and scream I'm an idiot by choice and its arts fault that I have no comprehension. I will give them this we in America are purposely made stupid of how film works in the same way that religion used to not allow people to read, if everybody knew how the scheme worked 3rd rate advertisers and kindergarten psychology propaganda wouldn't be so effective in swaying the masses into buying products that end in calling a lawyer to sue for damages and suffering. I will forgive anybody who takes my advice and tries, and I never shoot down theories from people who I see are making an effort but the people who frequent IMDb and leave reviews saying I don't understand it so it's garbage when it is not even the least bit complex you I have no sympathy for. This is why directors like Nolan are beloved because he spoon feeds the audience constantly and makes idiots think they are smart. Somebody needs to compile a list of films that are smart because they require the audience to figure it out them self and not the writer to spell it out 10 times until they go oh now I get it. This film is a work of art that speaks for it self and doesn't rely on post production to keep your attention like film makers who have no direction. You feel this story unfold and every movement every word ties in and adds to the story it shows that Wim knew exactly what he was going for and wasn't just wasting your time with pointless edits and dialogue for stupid people who need a clap track to get a joke. Or people who think looking at a picture for more than 3 seconds is boring. I look at the rating on this and I look at the rating for Dred and I weep. People can watch who framed Roger rabbit with machine guns and be fine with suspending their disbelief but can't seem to find any humanity in a film that's more human than most of the audience. Pretty soon film sets will be actors and a robot camera no need for a director or cinematographers because people want to see something as cold and lifeless as the face starring back at them in the reflection of their TV screen.",

I was only 3 when it came out, but in comparison to most movies, it will outlast most you'll see now.Ry Cooder did the gorgeous soundtrack, which is intrepid on its own, but it adds ineffably to the movie, which you will see upon viewing it.  It's haunting, pretty, minimalist, and has the ability to convey a wide range of emotions by mainly using slide guitar (maybe a lap steel).The story is of a man (Harry Dean Stanton) who has gone through a fugue. We find him in the beginning almost passing out in the desert from exhaustion, standing there dumbfounded, looking at his surroundings.  Later we learn that he has disappeared for a few years, while his son, Hunter, is now living with his brother and his wife (Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clement). Slowly he realizes what happened in his life, and he decides to dedicate himself to bringing his son back to his mother.  The story is simple, but at the same time, you find yourself questioning many things.  I'm not a huge fan of psychology, mainly because I find explaining my actions by the brain's accord too deterministic, but you'll do your share of wondering nonetheless.Another thing that makes this movie fantastic is the direction of Wim Wenders.  This is the first film I've seen by him (`Lisbon Story' was after that), and I was blown away.  The scene where Travis and Hunter are walking up the street is amazing.  The way the sunlight hits everything on the street, and how the odd angle up the street is concomitant with that will leave you awestruck.  On one sunny morning, Travis is cleaning everyone's shoes, looking at the shadow of an airplane at a nearby airport.  That may seem lame, but if you're open-minded and appreciate the beauty of landscapes, you'll understand what I mean.  Wenders managed to capture the beauty of the areas where he filmed.  He even brings out effulgence in dusty, rural streets.  You can see more of these types of pictures in a book by him called `Written in the West.'The settings are important also.  There are little things you'll notice (not necessarily symbolically as much as cinematically) with more viewings that will captivate you.  The `hotel' scene at the end is amazing to watch. And if this movie seems a little languid in its pace, that's because, for the most part, Sam Shepard writes that way.  There isn't a lot of flashy dialog, and there's not a lot of action.  You can probably expect that from someone who has written award winning plays.  But please, I beg you, don't watch halfway through and give up.  Put it in, turn off the lights, and watch it the whole way through.  It'll make an indelible mark on your future words about movies in general.",

Guests were Kit Carson, co-screenwriter, and his son, Hunter Carson, who played the seven-year old boy in the movie. The house was packed, with many from what passes for the \"film industry\" in Houston. Kit and Hunter (now 27, I guess) were introduced, then a 20-minute short directed by Hunter, with Tim Roth, was shown, then the feature, then a Q&A period. Lots of discussion. It was fun for Houstonians to see the use of Texas and (particularly) Houston scenes (vintage 1984). Crazy geography, of course, for those who live here. The road trip where Travis and Hunter follow Jane starts on one freeway, to switch immediately to a freeway on another side of town, then another freeway switcheroo. No problem; it's the movies. Many here have lauded the movie, and I certainly liked it last night (as I did 20 years ago), and will try not to repeat what others have said. I especially liked the home movie that Travis' brother shows when he is staying with the family in Los Angeles. It contains the first view one has of the elusive ex-wife, Jane (Kinsky) and you should feel really pulled in by the former happiness of the little family, and eager for the return of that bliss, as Travis apparently is. I also really liked the first visit of Travis to the peep show in Houston where Jane works. (The exteriors of that scene were actually filmed in Galveston, but it apparently is supposed to be in Houston, since Travis on his second visit tells Jane the boy is \"downtown\" in room 1520 of the Meridien hotel.) In that first scene, Kinski is totally iconic on the screen, pure soul. I do not like the sentimental and unlikely ending, however, which has Jane re-uniting with the son, and suddenly ready to take him with her and take care of him. Not bloody likely, I say. He has a much better home waiting for him back in Los Angeles with the uncle and his wife (Stockwell and Clement). And I did not like Kinski's lengthy speech during the second visit, in which she mainly says, over and over to Travis, \"I kept on hearing your voice.\" I felt the movie stop dead during that speech, and it was the only time I looked at my watch. After's Travis' speech in that scene, he should just tell her where the boy is and leave the booth. Other endings are possible too, especially if you feel, with me, that Hunter cannot end up with Jane.",

To try to understand the character of Travis (harry dean stanton), Wim Wenders takes us on a journey where the suspense we feel is in the fact that we know nothing about who travis really is until very near the end of the film. In one of the most beautifully and horrifyingly written scenes ever filmed, Travis spills his guts to a adult bookstore dancer (you know the ones behind the tinted glass windows) whose connection to Travis we are only just beginning to understand.The film moves slowly as is typical of most Wim Wenders' films. It is not for the average movie-goer, but for someone truly excited by character development. What will strike you most is the subtle nature with which the story moves. I admit the first time I watched this film I almost fell asleep. But I stuck it out and watched the movie. I watched it a couple more times since then and the film keeps getting better. This, to me, is the true test of a great film. I can still watch this film and enjoy it and find new things about it to love.Bottom line: This film is great, but not for the average movie-goer. If you enjoy character development and arresting dialogue this movie is for you.",

            "content": "Among many great things I have to say about this film, one thing is the musical score by Ry Cooder. I must say that this is one of the best film scores, quite possibly the greatest score ever written for a film. I have never heard music that perfectly encapsulates the feelings of loneliness, loss, pain, sadness, hurt, alienation, and desolation all in one beautiful melody that it is within the music and is also within this film.Paris, Texas is a beautiful melody of loss, sadness, and yearning to find hope in one's despair. Everything about it feels so real and honest, and that is one thing I have appreciated about it-its honesty. The film is very emotionally gripping and feels real in its most emotional scenes.While the film does run at a slow pace, I must say it picks up and adds more interesting layers onto its otherwise simple narrative, which follows an aimless drifter named Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) and his attempts to reconcile with his family again, after being found wandering through a desolate town in Texas. His brother finds him there, where they both reconnect and Travis' brother brings him back home to meet his family again.And I won't get into spoilers, but the rest of it, I must say, is really emotional stuff, and it certainly packs a wallop in its ending scenes. However, I would recommend that you simply see it for yourself.I also have to give credit to Robby Muller's beautiful cinematography, along with director Wim Wenders' steady hand at directing the film. And the performances are brilliant as well, with Harry Dean Stanton adding a sense of subtlety and yet emotional depth to the main role of Travis. Stanton portrays Travis not in an overly acted or performed manner, but with more of an emotional subtlety rarely portrayed by actors.Also, Dean Stockwell, Nattassja Kinski, and Aurora Clement are great in the film, and all in all, Paris, Texas, is simply an experience you have to see for yourself.",

Harry Dean Stanton delivers another just fabulous performance, and does a great impersonation of a \"rich father\".  Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ry Cooder's soundtrack that perfectly matches the desperation, loss and joy in the film. Whatever happened to Hunter Carson, who plays the little boy in the film? Perhaps his father, writer Carson, dissuaded his son against an acting career, but Hunter breaks your heart in this movie and can really act.  Only a few child actors really have that ability, and then it's usually the directors or editors that pull the performance out of them.  I'd put Hunter up against Henry Thomas in E.T., Lukas Haas in Witness, and Anna Paquin in The Piano anyday.",

            "content": "A mesmeric film from German director Wim Wenders, 'Paris, Texas' (1984) is both a poignant family tale and a grand portrait of America. The story, which follows the emergence of Travis Henderson from the Texas desert and his slow journey towards confronting his abandoned life, is a powerful rendering of wasted years, atoning for past mistakes and finding a way to move on.This is a long (150-minute), slow-moving film, as much observed as it is acted. The themes of rootlessness, the road and the redeeming power of children, together with the imagery of downtown America, recall Alice in the Cities, a Wenders film from ten years earlier, but where that film was shot in muted black and white, Paris, Texas is shot in glorious, vibrant colour, which reminded me of the Technicolour used in the early days of colour film.This is the perfect format in which to portray the breathtaking desert landscape of Texas, in which the first third of the film is set. The opening aerial shot, which swoops down to find Travis Henderson amidst the wilderness, is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences that I have seen. The largely empty landscape and the mysterious silence of Travis recall the atmosphere of a Western, with empty roads and telephone wires pointing the way to an otherwise absent civilisation. Dusty small towns and abandoned junk reside in the middle of nowhere. When Travis's brother Walt is introduced in a baseball cap with 'stetson' printed across the top you feel a knowing nod to this general ambiance.When the setting changes to the streets of suburban Los Angeles and Houston the film focuses increasingly on the drama playing out in the Henderson family, whilst painting in many of the details which I relished in my visits to America as a child, from the bustling highways crammed with over-sized cars to the sometimes seedy side streets and enclosures off the main city routes. Wenders's grasp of the country as both tourist and biographer is remarkable and the film is certainly worth seeing on the quality of imagery alone. Even the simple act of pulling into a petrol station is perfectly observed and thus oddly engaging, with the car carrying the camera pulling over just a little down the road from the car on screen.The imagery is complemented by Ry Cooder's hugely atmospheric guitar soundtrack. Unfortunately but unavoidably, this now feels a little clich\u00e9d owing to the large number of imitations that followed in its wake; for a recent example, see the soundtrack to Into the Wild (2007).The sights and sounds of Paris, Texas do not overwhelm the story, which, although undoubtedly slow moving, remains engaging throughout the 150 minutes. The encounter between Travis and Jane, his estranged wife, is gripping for the way in which the hidden details of the story are slowly, almost painfully brought to the surface in the strangest of settings. I do not, however, want to spoil the details of this film so I will leave it to you to seek it out as soon as possible and see for yourself.",

            "content": "I'm a huge Wim Wenders fan, but for one reason or another I never saw what'soften considered one of his masterpieces (alongside Wings of Desire), Paris,Texas. On its release this film won a host of awards at Cannes and elsewhere, but I'm not sure that it holds up well. Individual elements are superb: thecinematography by Robby M\u00fcller, the Ry Cooder soundtrack, and the acting ofHarry Dean Stanton and Dean Stockwell, in particular. But the film seems tooverstress its theme of alienation and emotional distance between people, atthe expense of audience engagement in the characters and plot.The film begins with one of the archetypes of Western themes: A man with nopast, no voice and no obvious explanation stumbles into an isolated hamlet in rural Texas. This turns out to be Travis (Stanton), whose sole possession is a piece of paper with the phone number of his younger brother Walt (Stockwell,looking quite different than Sam in Quantum Leap) in Los Angeles. As Walt flies out to get him, the mystery of his brother's disappearance and reappearancebecomes the focal point of the movie. The inability of the brothers tocommunicate (at first, Travis doesn't speak at all) foreshadows the film'srecurring theme of alienation. During one of a number of long highway sequences (Wender's company is Road Movie Filmproduktions), we get a sense of Walt'sfrustration and confusion, which is elaborated upon when we reach LA and meet Hunter, Travis's son. The time spent on unearthing the dissolution of Travis's early life, including what happened to his wife and son, is painstaking but not intensely engaging on an emotional level. As Travis and Hunter renew their relationship, in search of Travis's long-estranged wife (Nastassja Kinski), the film becomes moreengrossing, culminating in a fascinating and unnervingly filmed sequence in a sleazy sex club that epitomizes Travis's inability to hold a meaningful face to face conversation.",

The man seems to have lost his mind, or his way, or both. He collapses on the floor of a local bar and he is finally taken into protective custody. His brother, (Dean Stockwell) who works in outdoor advertising in Los Angeles, is summoned to fetch him. The brother talks, and Stanton only talks after a long while. It turns out he has a seven year old son, Hunter, who has been adopted by his Uncle and his aunt.The rest of the story recounts how he comes to terms with the traumatic breakup of his marriage and how he reconnects with his young son. This could easily have become a sticky sweet mess, but it is a tribute to the storytelling skill of director Wim Wenders and screenwriters L. M. Kit Carson and Sam Shepherd that this does not happen. Throughout the film, and in the performance of Nastassia Kinski as the estranged mother and wife, it has the ring of truth and a hopeful if not entirely happy ending.",

Foster-dad (Dean Stockwell) tells the kid who the real father is and Harry and the kid hit the road to go look for the real mother (Nastassja Kinski).There's probably a lot of social commentary in \"Paris, Texas\", I just didn't understand any of it. All i saw was whispering lonely people, who are filled with memories and regret. I think the movie is about loss. \"Can you see me when you turn the light off?\" (pause) I don't know (pause, pause, pause) I never tried..\" (pause, pause) My god, get to the point!Not the most depressing movie, not a bad movie, just too slow and too long for me.

So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.",

That and its symbolism, which is subtle enough to let the viewer do the work. I write this just after viewing it--I imagine I'll be thinking more about its symbolism in days to come.It is frightening, precisely because it so effectively refers to the existential challenge we all face. It confronts us not with the silly scares of monsters or kidnappers, but of the actually terrifying: The prospect that we'll fail in life to live up to its challenges, to be brave enough when it matters, to have a change of heart where we cannot or should not. That we should lapse into our old, bad habits. That we should fail in life. That we buy a vacant lot built on empty dreams that worked for our parents, and are now just figments in our imaginations.Fortunately, it offers a way out. It shows we can set our lives right, even if we fail to live up to our dreams. We can repair, make the best of it, if we are brave enough.Painful, yes.

However, we already know who to look at; Travis (Harry Dean Santon) travels through the desert, with a disoriented look; without motivation. All he knows is that he wants to go to Texas, to a place called Paris.Paris, Texas tells how that gaze, empty at first, makes sense. Travis chose to forget about his own life and walk the world. When his brother finds him, he is forced to resume his relationship with his son; what will make him a new person willing to regain his old life. It is the tender story of how the purpose of living returns to the body from which it had fled.However, Travis was happy. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) still has a Super 8 recording of an old vintage vacation. The projected images are a deluge of emotions for Travis and the viewer. In that same scene, and four years later, his son calls him \"dad\" again.Paris, Texas is the story of how a gaze has a body again; but for me it goes much further. Wenders condenses emotion and makes it blossom little by little, coming up against the essence of cinema: absolute love. Travis is only looking for eyes that look at him, a back shot. And that cannot be expressed with narration alone. Wenders even goes beyond the borders of emotion: mother and son meet again while Travis watches them from the parking lot, just before getting in and driving towards Paris, Texas. But now he is another man, his look is different and he has tears in his eyes. It is a movie from another world, a film masterclass, and the best I've seen in many, many years.",

Music by Ry Cooder.But let's do the math: Nastassja Kinski was 23 when the film was made (but apparently her character is supposed to be a few years older). Stanton was 58.\"I knew these people,\" Travis begins, in one of the great monologues of movie history. \"These two people. They were in love with each other. The girl was very young, about 17 or 18, I guess. And the guy was quite a bit older. He was kind of raggedy and wild. And she was very beautiful, you know?\"Quite a bit older? Thirty-six years is MORE than \"quite a bit older\". And while I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, that is a leap I cannot make. A beautiful 18-year-old falls in love with a raggedy man 36 years her senior? I don't buy it. Maybe if they were members of a fundamentalist sect...and she was coerced...otherwise, no way.",

There is some romance in his loose actitude, and the soundtrack as well as the visuals help to highlight the lonelyness. Finally it reaches a climax, except that it becomes a monologue rather than a dialogue, the picture is still uncomplete, until he adquieres the braveness to say it out loud; suddenly everything makes sense, and all the things untold in the dialogue becomes clear with the shots and expressions of the two protagonists: it's a love story through pictures rather than words and it does what cinema does (or should attempt to do) best: capture a living feeling, a sensation; the sensation of that inconclusive relationship.

Zero exposition and so much is on the table. A lost man with a lost history who seems to be following power lines. He's far from home and his brother might be involved with his wife, the mother of his child or something along those lines. Was he presumed dead? Almost no dialog and the world he entered when he crossed the border is likely foreign to what he knew. Despite the fact that these assumptions turned out to be quite off of was still a Great beginning!So while I was wrong in some of my assumptions it shows how interested the director can make you to the point that your imagination is running with the film. That's called \"engagement.\" How could one not be curious about what has really happened and what kind of drama are we in for when things are revealed.A note on the music. While I don't personally like this music it fits the landscape perfect and is the obvious and best choice for this film.To call \"Paris, Texas\" a drama is to nominalize it. In my opinion it's much more a mystery as well as a drama. Complexity can sometimes be a bad word but in this case the complexity of the mystery just makes your mind wonder the whole movie.The subtle acting from all involved is honestly on another level. There is some unspoken pain that the actors carry into their body language and faces. What is more is that the camera is never in a rush so lingering on an actor's face feels natural rather than \"hey check out what I wanted you to see.\" In a word the acting in \"Paris, Texas\" is superb and maybe the best I've ever seen in a movie.If I were to offer a flaw I'd say due to the slow nature of the movie it really needed to be shorter and becomes difficult to give undivided attention to as the final act plays out. The ending is unpredictable but I wouldn't say it was completely satisfying. As endings go in stories it's fine, even satisfying. I would say that the ending seems off balance compared to this film's mysterious beginnings. I'd say the filmmakers went with an ending with gravity and that works fine.One final thing that is interesting is that Stanton's character always keeps some kind of space between himself and those he's in conflict with. It's a fascinating and original idea for a character to see him resolve problems without ever having to actually face anyone. In this sense \"Paris, Texas\" is a masterpiece.Pros\n-entertaining a lot to think about\n-subtle brilliance\n-great characters\nIncredible, INCREDIBLE actingCons\n-slow (keep in mind that this was important so things would play out naturally but to some it will still be difficult to watch)\n-ending was a little out of sync with the beginning in terms of the movie's focus but it was perfect for the characters.",

            "content": "This is a movie that hosts a canyon of mordant themes. A beauty of it resides in the mastery of how simply they are cultivated and interconnected.Travis, now an all-time favourite movie character of mine, is a man that came to be able to take root in that wild, alone world at a late period of his life. Through, of course, love. Love of no hesitation, no limitation. Love, as a wholehearted presumption of infinity about something definitely finite. It grows so pervasive and intense to fill entirely up the old (and thirsty) and large soils of his existence. So much that its absence, the moment of the disroot, gradual and sudden at the same time, is enough to make a bone dry desert out of that terrain greened with love. Then, the inevitable drive (inveitable from being human) to take root whatever may come possesses his fresh and volumnious and decaying emptiness, and brings him to the actual desert that resembles his lost soul with the deep-down, unconscious beacon of hope to uncover (presumably) the authentic roots of himself: Paris, Texas. In what? In the lost history of his lost family. It seems thus much like a deep drilling to the depth of his existential roots as an odyssey rather than a journey. The curious thing is that Travis' having pinpointed that actual desert (by buying it) much before he lived the existential desert. It suggests more than it does outloud, I believe. If you think about it a bit more deeply, it is not a story about a strange, traumatised man but, through his moments, an invitation to take courage to reflect on the depth and breadth of our existential roots in that world.Another beauty of the movie, that strikes me, is its cinematographic economy (or fit-ness as one may like) and the feeling of \"as it should be\" that it leaves behind. The vibe I try to stress is, I guess, captured especially in or after the modest darkening passages between the scenes. It's not long, it's not fast. Not at all. It is at \"that\" measure so as to make you go caught the stream of the story.I don't even bother myself to mention the mastery of actings.This is a movie made me (a person who tries to see movies whenever possible) thought after: finally \"a movie\", after a considerable time! It contains everything what I come to seek in movies after years and more. That more was there to broaden my horizon in a way bestowed on the seventh art.I would suggest you to watch this masterpiece and rewatch it under a light that at least kept me if not already you hitherto.",

This film almost painfully digs into the psyches of its main characters: watch Harry Dean Stanton's little tics and self-realizations (the shot where he sees himself in the mirror for the first time in years, and immediately turns away, for example); if you find it boring you're not looking close enough, not paying attention. Like Hemmingway or a haiku the simplest lines of dialog are rife with inner meaning (Walt to Travis: \"You mind telling me where you're headed, Trav? what's out there?. . . . There's NOTHING out there.\") Is it \"like watching paint dry\"?-- I don't think so, more like watching someone come back from the dead; perhaps slow, but still amazing. I found it odd that some people feel it's \"pretentious\"; I've always thought of it as completely unpretentious-- it IS what it IS (what is more 'zen' than that?). It presents an honest story with a minimal of bells and whistles, special effects, odd camera angles, etc. Easily one of Wender's best, and one of my all time favorites.",

Am a foreigner who migrated to the states in the mid '80s and didn't know the American English enough to have understood this film even had I the means to have watched it then. And am glad.Never had the entitled lifestyle this Travis character so unthinkingly mismanaged then spends the latter part of his life trying to put back together and that so many here seem to identify with. Not realizing it half of it happened by not having led an examined life. Had he managed to question the status quo and his place in it, it is likely he would not have lost so much.I can see the hope and redemption so many find inspiring and helpful. But is for a specific American, and an American way of existing, that never questions the status quo, their place in it, where their privilege comes from or at what cost to their surroundings, or that the place is not made just for them.The point of this diatribe is to warn you: those times are here again. If you seek to not have others experience the same wayward alcoholism and lost of control, warn them. Get them to live a more examined life, a life not requiring a constant stream of stimuli, a more self-sufficient, frugal and resourceful life.Else other \"Reagans\" now lining up will make them go through what so many of you went through.

What caught me about this film was its searing critque of American capitalism and cultural vapidity done mainly through its cinematography.The real desert in the film is America, not the wide open spaces. At times the critique is a little too on the nose - a soul crushing drive in bank and a long pan up a building construction project with a zoom to an American flag flying in the wind for instance. Or the giant billboards. There is a clever early scene where Walt is stood in front of what looks like a greenscreened and very tacky building, which we then see is a huge billboard at the billboard company he works at. Like the booths we have this world within a world.The imagery often creates boundaries between the artificial and the wilderness of nature. The house in LA for instance pushes up against some beautiful grass always moving, but the back of the house and the yard itself are an expanse of dull concrete like materials. Planes and Helicopters constantly ruin the peace. Or a father and son eating a sandwich in the bed of his beaten old truck under the oppressive mass of a huge overpass.Commonly we see this switching between modern but cold architecture and a warmer, washed out, dusty, and faded glory America that is rotting away in the sun.On the surface it is a man and a woman who have lost their way, but I felt the allegory was more about a country that had lost its way, as the \"mad\" man on the overpass who screams down to cars that will never hear him knows all too well.These themes of things falling on deaf ears are repeated in various ways - in muteness, in one way mirrors, in a world where everyone drives and nobody walks.Cheap synthetic materials are used in clothing, curtains and shoes. The old but sturdy boots our protaganist wears are the opposite of this, the genuine article vs the ersatz. The peep show booths with their little doll-house microcosms of reality pushes the idea further.My only gripe is the ending monologue is a bit indulgent, I preferred Jane's shorter responding monologue.Another interesting point in the cinemtography is the palette which features a lot of deep red, and quite a bit of faded blue. On its surface maybe just representing the colours of the flag but I feel there is more too it, the deep red is especially prominent - be it baseball hats, signs, ketchup bottles, bedspreads, shoes, tail lights, neon, pants, cars, placemats, milk cartons, deep red is *everywhere* in this film.While the cinematography does the heavy lifting the acting is very good and the story moving, resulting in a beautiful neo-noir that stays with you. I can't help feeling that the brilliant, massively under rated \"Too Late\" neo-noir of 2015 borrows from this film.",

Starting with an exquisite mysterious man that, ostensibly, loves to walk but also to be alone, that Harry Dean Stanton created with an amazing performance, this movie transforms you in a way that, surely, you can't predict. And that's what I like the most about this movie: the surprising element, the originality and the beauty of it. The colors of the West Texas desert, his iconic moustache or red cap, the view from his brother's house or even his sister's in law voice.\nSome might call it an 'anti-romance' but I would instead try not to call it anything, avoiding labels or genres because this masterclass from Wim Wenders is much more than what words could say. It is a journey, odyssey or even a mission that Travis, the mysterious man, needs to live through and, certainly, we will live it with him. Reconnecting to a past that he no longer remembers but wants to discover.\nIt is undoubtedly an emotional movie that will, most likely, make you cry or feel anxious with that iconic soundtrack but, at the same time, laugh. It is moody, slow and it seems that nothing is happening or will ever happen after you watch the first half an hour, but trust me, keep your eyes and mind wide open and you will be blown away by what is yet to come.

With a screenplay by by the amazing Sam Shepard, (so much alienation and rage in his work), The film reflects themes that repeat all through Wenders' career. The American myth and the desert of contemporary life. \nOf course, as part of German New Wave, Wim Wenders' film does have a sense of European shifting narrative style and filmmaking techniques. But the collaboration of Wenders and Shepard's style imbue it with something truly original and essentially frightening -- a prediction of loss .

On the other hand, Travis was the exact opposite for this atmosphere. His wondering mind and almost delusional set of values are enthralling throughout the film. Purpose is a weak word in \"Paris Texas\", it seems like those lights inlaying around the decayed side of town can't decorate a lonely and broken man's will for truth and compromise. Most interestingly, in the scene of voyeur lounge. Semi-intimate juxtaposition with hearing from the bottom of both shattered hearts. Long before Jane knows her way out of her pride and youth was escape, little does she know that the man who was madly in love with her have always been missing her. Like a lone eagle in the desert, Travis never knew or to find out what \"next\"means. It's like those hanging traffic lights on the road, we see all kinds of bright burning red colors in the film, red light for stop, not until the end we see the rosy dawn of morning fading through the edge of the night sky ,but only we can also see Travis standing in that enormous empty parking lot with dank,shallow and greener print of his more sinuous path.

He collapses in a next-to-deserted town, and while the town doctor revives him, the drifter doesn't speak.  With a business card in his pocket being the only lead to go on, the doctor calls the man's brother (Dean Stockwell), who must retrieve his kin who upped and vanished four years ago.  Now I recognize this in name only because it is catchy.  Most people aren't aware that this is a city named Paris in Texas, so the title stands out.  I once again randomized the Letterboxd Top 250 Narrative Feature Films and got yet another one that is readily available on HBO Max, and with the rate that they are cutting their library, I figured that it is probably better to watch their selections sooner rather than later.  I didn't know what to expect out of Paris, Texas, but I am here for it.  I spent most of the beginning of this just trying to figure out what kind of movie I was watching.  It could be more of a modern Western where it is missing the tropes, but the setting is accurate a la Bad Day at Black Rock.  That's not really what this movie is.  For about the entirety of the first act, you have a protagonist who doesn't speak.  It makes it so that the actors playing off Harry Dean Stanton have to do most of the heavy lifting, namely Dean Stockwell.  It's such an odd situation that it slowly pulls you in, and that's when this movie reveals what it's all about.  Paris, Texas is a family drama, and the focus is on this broken man coming to terms with the actions of his past.  It's a drama through and through, and I thought it is very effective.  It is a bit of a slow burn to be sure, and I can see a few people out there being turned off by the pacing.  That never bothered me, and I felt this allowed for the more poignant moments to carry the proper amount of weight.  I do have to touch upon how terrific the cinematography is in this.  I mean yes, it is one thing to encapsulate how big and empty rural Texas can be, but on the other hand, there is some terrific filmmaking happening in tight spaces.  When everything is getting tied up at the end, and you finally get a full grasp on what happened in this man's past, you are in a 4' x 8' room that is split down the middle by a two-way mirror.  It is amazing what they can pull off in such a small space with some hard-hitting monologues.  I quite enjoyed this movie, although I don't know how many rewatches I will get out of it.  I give this an enthusiastic recommendation.",

All three were idiotic, contrived, and mindless. (No, I won't give the titles).\nSo I decided to re-watch a film that I knew wouldn't insult my intelligence. I came across \"Paris, Texas.\" As good as I remembered it being, I must say, it was better the second time around. \nSo much has been written about this film. It's rightfully on Roger Ebert's Great Movies list. Its running time is about two hours and 20 minutes, but it never seems long. It just grabs you and keeps you watching.\nOf course, Harry Dean Stanton's performance is the main attraction. The man is a marvel, a totally natural actor, and this part is custom made for him. He plays Travis, whom we first see traipsing alone across the Texas desert in a rumpled suit and a red baseball cap. He stumbles into a sun-baked roadside store, looking for water, and passes out. A strange German doctor is summoned to help him. The doctor contacts Travis's brother Walt (Dean Stockwell, in his best movie performance) in Los Angeles. Walt is amazed to hear anything about Travis, who mysteriously disappeared four years before, leaving Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) to raise his young son Hunter (Hunter Carson). The mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski) disappeared also. But the three will eventually reunite in the strangest way.\nTravis is near-catatonic and mute in the beginning, but he loosens up when he arrives in L.A. and meets his son, who is now seven years old. No more synopsis is necessary. Let's just say that the ensuing events are incredible, and the final act  includes two of the best scenes in cinema history.\nSam Shepherd's screenplay is perfectly brought to life on the screen by German director Wim Wenders. The silent, barren Texas landscape seems to stretch forever, while Los Angeles is contrasted as a noisy, smog-drenched labyrinth. Ry Cooder's lonely slide guitar is the perfect soundtrack accompaniment. \nI can't think of a movie with better dialogue. I can't think of a movie with better characters. And I can't think of a movie that does a better job of involving us, to the point where it's personal. We get to know these people so well that they seem like friends. \nIt's also interesting to note the film's color symbolism. Red and green are themes, especially red. What they mean is open to interpretation. \nIt's great that we have the ability to stream countless movies today. But so many of them are not memorable, or even worth watching. Thank God for the occasional masterpiece like this one.",

Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a disheveled man aimlessly wandering the desert. How Travis is even alive is astounding, what happened to him to make him wander the desert is at both the forefront of both viewer's and his brother's (Dean Stockwell) mind. At first, it's difficult to tell if Travis has a disability or is just feeling a little\u2026 off. As Travis' layers peel back, the performance shines through even more, and you root for him to find his wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski) even though maybe he shouldn't considering it was whatever happened with his wife that has caused him to wander Texas for four years! Travis' degeneration not only affected his own life, but that of his son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), whom his brother had taken in as his own. Child actors appearing in films in 1984 make me nervous, but Carson was actually excellently ascended from the typical plot-device to an interesting character. Most notable about the film are the couple of \"peep show\" scenes in a seedy section of Houston. It pulverizes Travis to find Jane working there, but instead of immediately disclosing his identity through the one-way glass, he speaks with his wife \u2014 oftentimes turned around in his chair \u2014 and we discovered \"what happened\". These scenes were powerful, no doubt \u2014 \"I hear your voice all the time. Every man has your voice\" captures Jane's last 4 years \u2014 but were also a bit of a letdown given the build-up. Yes, tying Jane to a radiator and Jane setting their trailer on fire still didn't feel like a satisfying pay-off.

A slow-burn two-and-a-half-hour movie that kept my eyes locked onto the screen. How a movie can be so warm, and gentle hit the hardest in emotions.\n\nThe movie is long and slow paced, so of course it's not going to be for everyone, but then again, every movie isn't for everyone. However, movies like these are a special type of breed that cannot be duplicated so easily if you tried.\n\nWatching this movie without knowing a single thing about it added so many layers of mystery that perfectly placed me in the main characters head. Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), once a family man, but now a silent drifter walking aimless in the Texas desert while having amnesia on certain parts of his life. He has become a worn-out and raggy version of himself, which leaves the audience wondering why. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) finds him and helps to recollect his memories, while also reuniting him to his son, sister in-law, and eventually his wife. So as Travis is retracing his steps and rediscovering forgotten memories, you are with him all the way until the end.\n\nHarry Dean Stanton is excellent as Travis, a man fallen into a black hole of emotions. He may not be a great father or husband, but tries his best to mend the wounds he caused in the past and to leave a personal impact on his son Hunter. Stanton subtle approach of bringing a character like Travis to life is truly extraordinary, because Stanton draws more into Travis gentleness while also displaying the pain behind his kind smile. There were many instances in the movie that I thought that if any other actor played the role, they would have easily over done it for dramatic effect, but Stanton deadpan and yet natural delivery made certain scenes more effective.\n\nA solid child performance from Hunter Carson, who plays Travis's son who is also named Hunter. The scenes between the two were the sweetest elements in the movie and brought a warm smile to my face.\n\nNatassja Kinski plays Travis's wife, who does not appear until the third act, but when she does, she is instantly hypnotic to watch. An actress of pure beauty and raw talent. Her quiet and soft-spoken voice made her presence even more remarkable, because how something so simple can leave the biggest impact. She spends most of her scenes in one room, and yet I totally bought the chemistry between Stanton and Kinski, which is impressive considering the two are never in the same room together and share only two scenes in the movie. All the emotions from Kinski comes from her reaction and demeanour, so with every flicker of her eye and long pauses communicates so much of her emotional state that a million words could not. It's unbelievable.\n\nThe conversation scene towards the end is one of the finest achievements in cinema. Painful and revealing that even if you don't cry, you will think about crying. It is as moving as anything I think I have ever seen. I'm getting teary eyes just thinking about it.\n\nI find it fascinating how a German director like Wim Wenders approaches the portrayal of family life in America, because Wender leans more towards the sad elements in order to destroy the illusion of the perfect family life. It is not all doom and gloom, but it is not all sunshine and rainbows too, just real enough for the audience to attach themselves to the characters and story.\n\nThe score from Ry Cooder is fantastic and plays perfectly in sync with the Texas setting. The music also represents that dry, lonesome, and reminiscent of the past. It is the type of music that makes you feel sad, but the weird kind of sadness that you enjoy.\n\nPerhaps the biggest standout in the whole movie is Robby M\u00fcller's cinematography. Everything from the breathtaking landscapes of the Texas desert where the scorching heat cannot stale the colours of the environment, while M\u00fcller shows us a distant land stretching further away. The other is light and colour that is drenched in vibrant neon. The whole movie has beautiful visuals that helps create the overall mood of the movie while also giving it a foreign feel. It has some of my favourite shots ever.\n\nOverall rating: A devastating, but hypnotic movie that stirs emotion in me like no other. An absolute masterpiece.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a beautiful film from critically-acclaimed director Wim Wenders.  It tackles a wide range of themes from family and betrayal, to reunion and tragedy.  It is not a movie for the masses; it is carefully crafted and meticulously plotted to go beyond simply evoking emotion from the audience \u2013 it devastates anybody with a heart and soul who would attempt to watch it. Admittedly, it does take a while to start become intriguing, but we are fully invested in Travis by the halfway point of the movie.\n\nOne of the best aspects of Paris, Texas is the brilliant yet subtle performance from its lead actor, Harry Dean Stanton.  In roughly the first twenty minutes of the movie, Stanton is silent and his performance is all body language.  We are introduced to him as he aimlessly walks around fields and barren landscapes somewhere in Texas.  He tries to drink water from a random spigot and is disappointed when nothing comes out, yet he still keeps walking on with unexplained intentions.  News of his appearance at a hospital reaches his brother, Walt, who comes to \"save\" him, and this proves to be a sort of humorous sequence in which Walt talks at Travis while Travis remains silent and mysterious until the story demands him to speak.  Travis becomes more and more talkative gradually throughout the film, and is the most obvious changing feature of his character arc.  This movie is essentially a telling of the re-birth of its protagonist, Travis, and we should not have it any other way.\n\nThe way the plot is structured makes it follow an almost untraditional path.  In the time slot that would normally be considered act one, Paris, Texas seems unsure of where it is going, and this is in part because the characters are unsure of what to do and do not have a set goal in mind. The protagonist, Travis, does not set a plan for himself until about halfway through the movie, and because of this, the second half of Paris, Texas is clearly the better half.\n\nThe dominant theme that appears in this movie is the questioning of what family means and what constitutes a \"true\" family.  Half an hour into the film, it is finally revealed through dialogue between Travis and Walt that Travis used to have a wife and child, and the child, Hunter, is currently being housed and cared for by Walt and his wife Anne, who are the boy's aunt and uncle.  They are extremely attached to Hunter since they have raised him for about half of his life (he is almost 8 in the movie) so it stirs up some controversy when Walt decides to bring Travis home and reintroduce him to his biological son. It does bring out the good in Travis, however, who longs for a connection and feels ashamed when Hunter does not want to walk home with him because \"everybody drives\" and nobody walks anymore. This is clearly an excuse that he really just does not trust his dad.\n\nThe best scenes of the film are clearly in the second half of the movie, but they will not be discussed in order to avoid spoilers. Without giving too much away, it is safe to say that Paris, Texas is a beautiful, emotional journey that deals with the notion of family, and above all, it is a mature movie. Anybody with a heart will appreciate this film, unless the viewer has never experienced heartbreak over family.\n\n9/10\n",

However, he is primarily known for numerous supporting roles in different movies of his career which spanned over 65 years. Paris, Texas is a rare example of the movie where Stanton plays leading role and he made it perfectly. He has been able to show very different emotions on the screen, and watching him in this movie is a delight. I can say a lot of good words about Dean Stockwell's performance as well. The movie is a great story about peculiarities of the relations between child with his actual parents who abandoned him and the family who brought him up. In a sophisticated manner, the genre of road movie in the hands of Wenders gives a glimpse into the path of son and mother to be reunited and gives the fresh start, and drama of the man trying to get over the break-up which made him alien for several years. One the most important part of film is the director's work focusing on striking images and use of colours, especially green colour. Wenders is a great master to work with the sublime and delicate material.",

It's a movie about the transformation of a particular individual who you think would never get his shit together.

Its gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack compliment the wonderful performances from not just Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski, but the entirety of the cast.\n\nThe film follows Stanton's protagonist, Travis, as he attempts to rebuild his relationship with his son Hunter, and his wife Jane, after mysteriously going missing for years. What ensues is a moving portrait of a man who must ultimately sacrifice his own happiness for that of those he loves.\n\nThis film is a contemporary Western, using the genres features and translating it into a modern-day setting. What we get because of this is both a beautiful look at the American South-West and a poetic journey with a mysterious, flawed protagonist, who ultimately redeems himself, a clear play on the Western genre conventions. It mimics films like Shane and The Searchers through the nature of its lead.\n\nThis film, despite its 150-minute runtime, is incredibly rewarding even after multiple watches. Because it plays on such well-recognised genre features, we know how this film will end. He will take Hunter to Jane, and due to his jealous and manipulative personality, he will leave so that those he loves can live a happy life. Film to me is less about the destination and more about the journey, and for a road movie like Paris, Texas this is perfect. We experience what Travis experiences, we feel his emotions, see the world with him, and are crushed by the finale despite the inevitable nature of it. What rewards us is not the finale, but the road to it. Just describing this masterpiece cannot do full justice to it, it is a must see for lovers of cinema.",

Wenders' grasp on what drives America is astounding given the fact that he's German, his choice to set the film in the desolate stretches of West Texas an insightful means of tapping into the classic, manifest-destiny attitude that drives the country towards growth for the sake of it and fuels its peoples' perpetual belief in a better tomorrow. His story of a family tying to rebuild is a perfect encapsulation of what the nation stands for; we're certainly not perfect, but the need for honest, genuine, simple fulfillment through legitimate human connection drives us our entire lives and makes room for forgiveness.

The movie opens with a man walking alone along a railway line in the desert and you immediately think why's a man walking alone along a railway line in the desert.\n\nIt's got this beautiful and stunning simplicity to it, like Ry Cooder's perfectly eerie and resonant solo steel guitar. Travis is rescued by his brother Walt who asks him where he's been for the last four years? He says nothing.\n\nHe doesn't feel obliged to explain or declare anything. We learn everything from the questions becoming increasingly drawn into why he won't answer them. Why he carries a photo of a plot of land he bought in Paris, Texas. He says he doesn't know why.\n\nSo there is this great gaping canyon of a fractured family in his life without an explanation as he gently and slowly tries to build a relationship with his estranged seven year old son and ultimately unite him with his mother.\n\nBut what that plot summary doesn't reveal is how incredibly moving and powerful the smallest gesture of love between family members can be.\n\nIt is in how we notice the faintest details even when nobody speaks. This movie literally proves actions speak louder words and shines a light on human vulnerability and the fragility of relationships and the fragility of human existence.\n\nIt is like showing us how fine-tuned and terrifically ingenious, rational and logical human emotion is even when its unknowable. Like the most paranoid movie not actually being paranoid in the end.\n\nThis movie is still a mystery to me and as it reaches a final conclusion it opens another door. It doesn't have all the answers, but it just might have all the right questions.\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time/",

            "content": "The beautifully-filmed \"Paris, Texas\" tells a story, and tells it in a way, that is both novel and hauntingly familiar. In its opening moments it seems almost to be a spaghetti Western. It has the dusty badlands and close-ups of the cracked, inscrutable face of a mysterious protagonist (Harry Dean Stanton). He says nothing, and when others speak it is often with a European accent, reminiscent of those that were poorly dubbed over in the old Italian and Spanish gunslinger films. A German-inflected townie in Terlingua-is he a doctor? law enforcement? just a drinker? probably all of the above-is straight out of a great noir or adventure film, channeling the untrustworthy gregariousness of Sidney Greenstreet in \"Casablanca\" and Walter Huston's old-timer expatriate in \"Sierra Madre.\" But the mystery the movie introduces in its opening scenes feels new and exciting: a man who will not talk, who has a history but seems not to remember it, who has walked so long through the desert that his shoes are worn through.\n\nDirector Wim Wenders tries out several different settings and speeds in the course of unraveling the story of Travis, this mysterious man, yet the information is so fragmented that for a long time each new piece only deepens the mystery. Slowly the plot proceeds, first as an almost comedic road buddy movie, then as a kind of \"Kramer v Kramer\" dramedy as the ragged Travis works to win the trust of a seven-year-old boy, Hunter. The character of Hunter is increasingly central to the film, and the child who plays him is uncommonly believable for an actor of his age. He has to deliver lines that resonate as both funny and poignant, as when he says \"Goodnight, Dad\" to two men in succession or struggles with a decision that causes pain to one of the two women he calls \"Mom.\"\n\nThe landscapes of Texas have probably never been more faithfully committed to film. The deserts of the southwest are the hook, but soon it's all highways and isolated gas stations and endless flatness. Later scenes set on and near the tangled highways of Houston are filmed in a point-of-view manner that is mesmerizing and builds tension, much like the long driving cuts in Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris.\" By this point in the movie, enough information has been revealed about Travis that the mystery has lost some of its urgency, and both Travis and the script seem on the verge of turning inward and abandoning us to their own private musings on the unknowability of others. A reveal about a mysterious \"Jane\" feels too stereotypical for a movie that had up to then been using assorted tropes but tell a fresh tale. But the movie does not end without bringing its threads and themes (especially the theme of the unbridgeable distances between people, and of the jealous desire to possess loved ones, first broached through a character called Anne) to a final fruition. Some of the camera-work in the penultimate scene, involving a one-way mirror, ingeniously underlines these ideas, and there is a satisfying balance and believability to the movie's last dialogue. Ry Cooder's guitar-based musical score has a strong, appropriate presence throughout the film, and like it is artful yet accessible.",

The plot reads like a Sparks heartfelt tearjerker, but the on-screen delivery is something to behold. It moves at an unhurried pace, allowing you eyes to linger on the beautiful nothingness of Paris....Texas, your ears to absorb Ry Cooder's memorable score, all while Sam Shepard's script unravels smooth as butter.

It fits that bill in the sense that its romantic with a hint of some of the complexities/darkness of relationships but still with, what I would regard, as a slightly naive view of those complexities.  In short it romanticises romance.\n I mean this in the sense that it never feels real. This if for several reasons but mainly theres something cold, distant and almost childlike about how everyone speaks in the film \"I like this...I loved him. I go to paris texas\". Etc.\n\nActing is generally ok but Aurore Cl\u00e9ment is jarringly terrible as the french Aunt. Harry Dean Stanton is basically father stone (google it) but he can't do much with this script.\n\n It always feels like a slightly 'intellectual' novel.Its overly long and quite pretentious. Yeah paris is a metaphor and Travis' heart broke so bad he couldnt speak. Fuck. Off. It has one of those stories where its all based around events that happened in the past and the film is essentially revealing the details of those events to us. Thats a structure I never tend to enjoy and given that it takes about 2 and a quarter hours until you understand much at all, its a bit frustrating. The core story itself is kind of interesting..perhaps I would have enjoyed a prequel more.",

The toughest enemy of love is critique. Pride, jealousy, intolerance and egocentrism can also be determinant factors, but everything resides in oneself, and hence our responsibility to give up our way of being and adjust it to the people that we love the most. That is done through decisions, decisions that we face every day of our lives for the sole purpose of love.\n\nThe most admirable aspect of the film is its structure which is divided into chapters.\n\nI. The first chapter opens with the aftermath of personal oblivion, of escaping from the life we once signed an implicit emotional contract to take care of, just to find internal emptiness and maybe the loss of personal identity, which is Travis' case. The journey back to the world left behind begins, yet with a silence difficult to break.\nII. The second chapter introduces you to the protagonist's process of readjustment to the people that participated in his past and memoirs.\nIII. The third chapter begins a necessary alternative journey of search for the missing key in the already shattered family.\nIV. The fourth chapter contains the relevant message of Universal value, from Paris to Texas, that defines our very human condition, as beings in the need of love and acceptance. Sorrows and pains cannot be contained in oneself permanently; sooner or later they have to find a way to be externalized and escape from our hearts and minds.\n\nThe unique thing about the film was: Travis' character acted differently in each chapter, showing a clear trend of emotional evolution.\n\nIt is important to note that Travis had the luck of belonging to a family that didn't put any significant blame in him given that he was absent for around 4 years. Perhaps this may seem unbelievable given our contemporary set of values. Suspend your disbelief, because it has a high reward in the final 20 minutes, as the characters make amendments and nude their hearts to speak what was necessary to confess and fix for coming to better terms. A near-masterpiece of cinema that shows the importance of prioritizing family and listening, something what women are experts at. Just like Welles did in the past, acting is also reacting, because in the reactions half of the emotional impact is found.\n\n94/100",

It's captivated plenty of American directors, too; it's pretty captivating stuff, and what is [i]Lebensraum[/i] but Manifest Destiny?\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walked away.  He left his son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), with his brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell), and just disappeared.  Now, Travis has shown up in a hospital, and they have tracked Walt down as his next of kin.  Walt comes to get him, but Walt doesn't really know what to do with him, especially because Travis is at first silent.  In many ways, it seems as though Travis has been living in his own head for the last four years.  Walt takes Travis back to his home in the suburban outskirts of Los Angeles, where he and his wife, Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment), have been raising Hunter as their son.  It is really Hunter who finishes bringing Travis out of his shell.  At first, Hunter doesn't want much to do with Travis, but they slowly begin to bond.  Hunter is the first one to be aware of how much his father is still in love with Jane (Nastassja Kinski), Hunter's mother, and together, they go after her.\r\n\r\nThe moment which struck me most in the movie (and appropriate, given that Rotten Tomatoes has today randomly churned up a review that starts with mention of my own daughter) is the one in which Hunter is talking to a school friend (Edward Fayton) about Travis.  He has been told that Travis is his father, but he's still allowed to call Walt his father.  When you are not-quite-eight, it's best to have everything laid out as clearly as possible, and it's obvious that this has not happened for Hunter.  He knows that Travis and Walt are brothers, and he knows that he is expected to call Travis his father and allowed to call Walt his father, but he doesn't know the logistics of how that works.  His only response to how he has come to have two fathers is \"Just lucky, I guess.\"  Part of this is that kids just generally think that however they've grown up is normal, so if this is how things are for Hunter, this must be normal.  But I do think things should have been kept clear for him all along.\r\n\r\nThere is also a fairly agonizing scene in which Travis has finally found Jane, and he explains to her how he sees what had until now been the end of their relationship.  From my perspective, it sounds like the two will need a heck of a lot of therapy if they decide that they want to continue their relationship after the end of the movie.  However, the fact that Travis is coming clean with his feelings is something, at least.  He does not blame her for everything.  He clearly understands why she did what she did, why she did everything that has led to them being where they are in this new time and place.  I don't think his understanding it will prevent the pattern of behaviour from repeating itself, but I think that Travis wants it to.  I also think that it will help Travis that Hunter is more of a person, but in some ways, that also makes Hunter more vulnerable.  He will not forget his parents after this the way he did when they both disappeared when he was three, and that is, after all, what Anne feared from the moment she heard Travis was alive.\r\n\r\nTravis and Walt's father met their mother in Paris, Texas; he apparently liked telling people that they had met in Paris and letting them start to fill in \"France\" before he clarified.  (Actually, in several ways, the elder Travis Henderson doesn't sound like a very pleasant person.)  And, yes, this is in many ways a film about assumptions.  Walt and Anne assumed Travis was dead.  Travis assumed, when he left, that there would be someone left to take care of Hunter.  Hunter--and this is the most reasonable of the assumptions--assumed that the life he was living was the life he would lead.  Heck, Walt and Anna assumed that letting Travis walk Hunter home from school would mean that they would both return to the house in a reasonable time.  Sometimes, what we assume is not what will be.  And somewhere, in that great, open expanse of the American wilderness, we always believe we will find ourselves.  It's hard to say how safe that assumption is.",

Very rarely do we see such films that do so, which is odd as anyone who has been to the area will find the look of this film instantly familiar. Although helmed by German director Wim Wenders, this is very much an American film, and his European sensibilities are what really make Paris, Texas so astonishing. He gives great attention to character emotions, and isn't afraid to have scenes go on for a longer duration than many American directors would allow. In the end it's a stirring portrait on alienation and regret, and a slept-on masterpiece from the early 80s. It's easy to see why both Kurt Cobain and Elliot Smith both cited this as their favorite film.",

The next day, as they drive to California, Walt begins to talk, but not a sufficient amount to indicate what happened to him or his woman (Nastassja Kinski), who is the father of his child (Hunter Carson), being cared for by Travis and his French wife Anne (Aurore Clement). There, Walt begins to bond with his son, although remaining somewhat distant at times, but eventually allowing him to accompany him back to Texas to find the mother/his woman. Very slow moving drama hits the mark, thanks to its ability to generate evocation of curiosity from start to finish. The photography is quite fine, as is the acting and the conclusion to the long story. It definitely is an off-beat movie, yet it does work quite well.",

When we kick things off, he's in a happy adoptive home and all seems pretty good for the little tyke. Next thing you know, ol' dad (who abandoned him in the first place) comes back into his life unexpectedly. Why looky there, good old pops decides to get to know his son and spend a little time with him. Hey, how about that! He decides to kidnap him for no explicable reason. While we're at it, why don't we have dear old dad drive him halfway across the country while he and the little guy barely communicate with each other? And for good measure, let's have the father of the year abandon him again with his trampy wife out of the clear blue. God forbid he take him back to the happy home he took him from in the first place. No, just go ahead and ditch him again with the directionless ex-wife.\n\n\nHow about the seemingly endless monologue at the peep show? Yes, let's pretend that neither of them know who's on the other side of that glass. Let's let this pointless innuendo continue on for twenty minutes as the poor kid waits in alone in a hotel room. This scene goes on for eternity and all I remember thinking while I watched it was, \"Man, I've got to piss... Why doesn't he get to the point?... Damn, I've really got to piss... For fuck's sake! Say you're sorry, tell the slut that the kid's alone in a motel room and you're dumping him on her so I can go piss already. Good god, is that so hard?\"\n\n\nOne of my absolute favorite parts of this film is when dad pulls up to the strip club and leaves the boy alone in the car. During this tremendously simple shot something funny happens. A couple of gawkers walk up to the factory window above the parking lot and proceed to stand there for while. Eventually they realize they're in the shot and sulk off to the side. How did nobody notice this when it happened or at least catch it in post? Good god, this film has some hamfisted directing. \n\n\nThe only reason I gave this one and a half stars instead of a big fat zero: It's got a nice score and decent cinematography. Notice I said decent, not \"beautiful\" or \"breathtaking\" as so many others do. It's adequate to slightly above average at best.\n\n\nWhy in the world this is considered one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time is beyond me. Horrible, meandering screenplay? Check. Clumsy, sloppy directing? Check. Baffling, pseudo-noble message? Check. Agonizing, needlessly slow pacing? Check. Unanimous winner of the Palm d'Or? You've got to be fucking kidding me.",

Of course, it figures that the year Stanton gets his leading roles in acclaimed films is the year no one goes to see the film he's in, except the critics of course. Well, at least this film made its budget, because even in USD, it barely cost a thing, and really, if the budget covered Nastassja Kinski's blonde wig, then they should have saved some money by keeping her brunette, because I'm telling y'all, a lot of beautiful girls are better when brunette, and if nothing else proves that, then it's this film's diluting the attractiveness of Nastassja Kinski, of all people, and she's doing a really good and really pretty Texas accent, so you know that wig drove her down a few notches. Okay, maybe Nastassja Kinski didn't fall that far, as she's still pretty incredibly beautiful, because it's still Nastassja Kinski, only she's not entirely brunette Nastassja Kinski incredibly beautiful (My tongue is getting twisted just from typing Nastassja over and over again, though it might just be because I keep thinking of Nast... that should-be brunette girl), which isn't to say that the film's disappointments end there. No, I like this film just fine, and certainly more than I like the film Wim Wenders did a few years after this, \"Wings of Desire\". Huh, now that I think about it, I can't tell if Wim Wenders loves slow avant-garde films more or films that deal with crossing cultures, because even when he does a film that's almost entirely in English, it still has to pertain to a place in Texas called Paris, have several foreigners in starring roles and be primarily produced by the US, UK, France and Germany. Well, either way, we can definately tell for certain that, to one degree or another, he loves slow films, avant-garde or not, for although this film is enjoyable, largely because it's not all that avant-garde, or at least not nearly as avant-garde as something like \"Wings of Desire\" (Few things are as overwhelmingly avant-garde), it's still not the biggest attention-sustainer, even with Nastassja Kinski (Her beautiful self actually doesn't show up until final act or so, so maybe that's why most of the film didn't hold my attention so much).\r\n\r\nOkay, now, the film is of course not nearly as painfully drawn out as something like \"Wings of Desire\", largely because this film has something that \"Wings of Desire\" didn't have: a plot, or at least until the film even forgets where its going through all of its excessive padding. Clocking in at startlingly close to two-and-a-half hours, the film has more than enough time to unravel its strong story, and boy, does it not let you forget the \"more than enough time\" part, because as reasonably hefty as this story is, the film goes plagued to nearly no end by scenes that drag nearly to no end, and if you have a hard time believing it's that rough, then buddy, sit back, because I'm understating. Now, don't worry too much kids, because this isn't quite a modern Terrence Malick film, where well over half of the film is comprised of total nothingness, yet much of this film finds itself dragged down to a crawl by excessive bloating through filler material, if not total nothingness, so much so that, as I said, the film altogether momentarily loses focus after a while, and rarely makes a full recovery after that. This film's momentary lapses in focus dilutes resonance and the ceaseless padding slows down the film's momentum to a crawl, but either way, the film drops your attention all too fast and all too often, while dullness sets and leaves you to think about setting into bed. Again, calm down kids, as the film's dull spots aren't relentless, yet the film is relentlessly slow, meditating much too deeply upon the atmosphere of the film to the point of actually tainting the atmosphere with dry blandness, often to where the film does descend as low as dull, and here and there to the film descends as low as all-out boring, because director Wim Wenders wants so bad to make this the hyper-artistic style piece that it just simply isn't. Now, I'm not saying that this film would be any more exciting if was the hyper-artistic style piece that Wenders wants it to be, because no matter which way you look at it, the film is too meditative, too slow, too bloated and too do-little to be anything terribly upstanding, yet chances are that the film would be better, because what it is right now is a dramatic story rich with substance, and on that level, it slips up by Wenders' attemps at making it an art piece, which not only makes the film dull, but all over the place in focus, tone and theme, as well as limited in substance and ultimately not what is should have been, could have been and perhaps would have been if it were in the hands of a more substance-driven and - yes, I'm gonna say it, you pretentious art snobs - \"competent\" director. As it stands, well, it's at least better than \"Wings of Desire\", because where Wenders headed that operation and crafted a film that was tremendously mediocre for what it was and by its own right, Wenders' mistakes go battled back by the components to this film that really do deliver, sadly not where the film itself delivers, but decidedly to where the film is enjoyable, as well as even rather impressive as, if nothing else, well... an art piece.\r\n\r\nMany of Wim Wenders' artistic touches don't fit all too comfortably, yet there is a certain artistic something that's well welcomed no matter what kind of film you're making, and that is, of course, fine cinematography, for although this film's cinematography's level of impressiveness has dated a bit, Robby M\u00fcller's comfortable shot staging, clever lighting and stunning color bounce remains something to behold even to this day. This piece of style definately catches your eye, while what catches your investment is the very story that goes tainted by other forms of style, though not much too much, for although the film's \"story\"telling styles overwhelm the substance and leave it rather underwhelming in execution, the story remains the primary focus, and it's a strong enough story to where the overstylizing isn't nearly drowned out, yet still to where you can lock in with the story, and mostly with the help of the writing duo of L.M. Kit Carson and, yes, \"that\" Sam Shepard, who I really wouldn't have pegged as a writer of this kind of stuff (No wonder he played a surviving Butch Cassidy in \"Blackwood\"; he seems to know a thing or two about secret lives). Hey, I've got to say, if most of Shepard's writing is better than his work here, then maybe he should write a bit more often, for although his and Carson's screenplay isn't especially upstanding, it is reasonably strong, providing thorough insight into this worthy story, as well as believably human and layered characterization that fleshes out the essence of the key components to this character focus, thus making a strong story all the stronger. Ever so unfortunately, Wender undercuts most every right move made by the film's strong writing duo and perhaps stronger source material and subject matter, and for every compelling high point, there are quite a few underwhelming low points, yet make no mistake, this film has its fair share of compelling high points that manage to avoid going tainted by Wenders' undercuts and give us genuinely engaging occasions of resonance that provide a glimpse at the better film that this final product, as a whole, isn't. Still, with all of the film's low points, it never descends so low to the point of being worthy of dismissal, going supported by its worthy story and a writing team that's certainly stronger than the director who executes their work messily, and if all else fails, then you at least have strong performances to fall back on. Everyone holds his or her own, with someone like the stunning Nastassja Kinski stealing the show for the all too brief time she's on, yet it's leading man Harry Dean Stanton who really steps up to the plate, as his Travis Henderson character, an amnesiac who has missed four key years of a that life he's slowly but surely easing into and looking to ameliorate as well as he can, definately presents quite a few acting challenges, many of which have been toned down by the unfortunate writing down of the material, yet many more of which go accomplished by Stanton with ease, as Stanton boasts a soberingly human and heavily layered presence that defines the Henderson character, broken up by high points in emotional range that further breathes life into Henderson and makes a character more compelling than the film itself. Now, with all of my compliments, as I said, Wenders undercuts most every high point in this film with his arrogant, gratuitously over-artistic touches that sadly leaves this film to descend beneath genuinely good, yet, in all honesty, all but just barely, as the strengths in this film stand stronger than the film itself, and while the sum of these parts failt to carry the film to the level of its golden aspects, there's enough inspiration behind this film to keep you sticking with it, even with all of the low points that ruin much of a promising vision.\r\n\r\nOnce the end of this journey is reached, the film is left tainted by the excessive bloating that renders the film's focus hazy and its effectiveness diluted, thus creating a disengagement that, when combined with the film's relentless slowness, often creates dullness, if not all-out boredome, and after two-and-a-half hours of this, the final product is left falling very short of what it could have been and as underwhelming, yet not to where it can't still catch your eye with its fine cinematography, while your investment goes caught by the strong story, brought to life by strong writing by L.M. Kit Carson and Sam Shepard, as well as by a compelling lead performance by Harry Dean Stanton, thus creating high points that may not be enough to dismiss underwhelmingness - spawned from Wim Wenders' many missteps -, yet remain enough to make \"Paris, Texas\" a generally enjoyable and consistently watchable dramatic piece that may not live up to potential, let alone hope, but ultimately gets you by.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "Staggering out of the desert sun like a less vengeful Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, Harry Dean Stanton steps into the shoes of one of the seminal, iconic, eighties characters. Travis Henderson, in his red baseball cap, battered suit and broken shoes sums up a decade of Americana in his purposeful stride, mournful stare and wholly confused brain. Alongside Blue Velvet (tied in here by a helpful Al from Quantum Leap, minus Ziggy), Paris, Texas paints the other side of eighties America with broad, delicate strokes that depict a land far away from Wall Street and communist paranoia.\r\n\r\nTravis emerges in a small town you've probably never heard of (sic) in Texas with no memory of the past four years and an unwillingness to communicate. His brother, Walter (Dean Stockwell), comes to pick him up and together they return to his house in Los Angeles. Travis discovers his son, Hunter, who he abandoned four years ago has been practically adopted by Walter and his wife. Travis seeks to reconnect with his son and maybe track down Hunter's mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski).\r\n\r\nParis, Texas is eye wateringly good to look at. Robby Muller and Wim Wenders fill a usually washed out landscape with primary colours; hazy purple sunsets, bright orange deserts, deep black tarmac and piercing blue skies are shot from angles that slowly reveal more and more of urban America's encroachment onto nature. Texas looks like nowhere else on Earth, Alien and inhospitable, yet cities spring up in the windshield of driving cars or on the horizon. Pinnacles of steel and glass to match the tors and cliffs Travis is originally found amongst. Ry Cooder's slide guitar score ebbs and flows as the story demands, reflecting both the film's southern settings and the character's broken hearts.\r\n\r\nTravis starts out sad and confused, moves into touching and funny and ends up strong as a rock (and right). It's a brilliant arc (sorry), paced perfectly and played out with such skill by Dean Stanton that multiple viewings reveal more and more. These craggy, hicky, worn and drawn guys are his stock in trade but Travis is somehow different and more. Three dimensional and so believable it's a wonder you haven't bumped into him in a bar.\r\n\r\nBy the end it's doubtful whether Travis is even human, he feels more like an angel, sent to repair past mistakes and re-unite lost souls. That would explain his memory loss, his speechlessness at the start and certainly the film's unwillingness to deal with Walter and Aurore's loss of Hunter. The unification of the mother/son bond is the only concern here, overruling common sense at the cost of the lesser characters so we end up with a triptych. Travis, Hunter and Jane, not exactly together at the end but not far apart.\r\n\r\nPerfect is a dangerous adjective to toss around when it comes to film, the never stopping march of time, public opinion and attitudes changing and well, sheer bloody mindedness can all skew a film's worth but as it's been 27 years since release then Paris, Texas is so close to being perfect you couldn't squeeze a knife in there. Don't try.",

I won't lie, though: the length was a total turn-off (not the movie's fault, I just have a diminished attention span, especially when watching movies at home). I can't say it should've been shortened despite this. Everything about it seemed spot-on to me. The pacing wasn't too slow or too fast, considering the story, and it didn't seem to be drawn out any more than it needed to be. The acting was great too (or maybe it's just that I never saw anyone in this in anything else beforehand that made them feel more like real people to me... whatever, they were still really good). There's no doubt in my mind that this is a solid, stunning, very interesting and unique movie... I just couldn't get fully involved in it. I will definitely revisit it, though.",

The high contrast accents of red (Travis's cap, an old sign at an abandoned gas station; it's basically omnipresent) adding interest to what could've been a dreary dessert setting of beige eternity. \n\nBut then we're thrown into reality when an estranged father/brother who's been mysteriously missing for four years is found and brought back into the issue of his abandoned family: his son who is now seven (who's been looked after by his brother and his wife), and his young wife who ran away but occasionally wires money to their son without letters or contact. \n\nAs Travis awakens from his comatose, ultra ennui'd out state of mind, he sees that he must take responsibility for the rift he's created in his son's life. He embarks on a mission to find his wife by tracing her checks to the bank from which they've been sent. \n\nThis is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, on a physical and emotional level. The cinematography is reminiscent of Amelie, minus the whimsical romantic hootnanny business that makes it so charming; but Paris, Texas is charming in its own right--existentially charming, if that's even possible; and the scene at the end in the hotel--heartbreaking.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas, Great Movies\nI doubt if this film would have a remake sometime in these days. Wherein movies that we watch today in the theaters are very unconventional, some superhero flicks, some sequels, some remakes, some novels to film, and some recycled story, but I gotta tell you, \"Paris, Texas\", is one of the best American films of all time, you will never think that this was released more than 20 years ago, and still, it is I think an essential movie for real movie professional watchers like me. I don't really know where to start but trust me, if you don't want to spend your time reading this long review, then go, see this movie right now if you have a time.\nThe film begins in a desert showing a man walking without anything at all, only a picture of a family and a phone number, but who are those? Now, we know a little who this man is, then someone phones that other person, who thinks he's is brother, and the brother came to that Texas town to pick him up. Instead, it became a little silent movie, this man doesn't speak until a moment where he finally speaks and even eat. Anyways, the guy's name is Travis, and now, he and his brother, went back home to L.A., and there Travis saw his brother's wife and his son. Now, the son who is Hunter, spends more time with him, like how you doing and how is school, and surprisingly, the two did had a quick easy relationship that we all thought they're not gonna talk at first. After that Travis and Hunter went to Houston to find next her wife and Hunter's mother who is Jane. How did they know Jane is in Houston? Because she is giving them (Travis' brother and his wife) money from the bank. And Travis followed her after Hunter saw her car, and finally going into a sex club? What is he doing there? Is Jane now one of the prostitutes in that club? Travis look everywhere and finally getting to find her, there they talked and remember, she doesnt know who this man is. And that's another long conversation, but after that, it was an another scene where Jane and Hunter met and saw once again. And it ended again on Travis leaving and probably unsure where he's headed. \nEnough of storytelling now, and I'm sure I said the whole plot of the film now, but that's not it! As we go also to Travis' adventure, we also get to know more about him, he's lost and alienated to a place where everyone was never been there. His character is very important to those people he met, and ending up changing their lives as well, and also reuniting his family again and leaving them again, not in madness, but in a sacrificial way. And you'll see when you watch it. Another thing that I love is the last 20 minutes or so, on that club where Jane and Travis talk over on a telephone, as if now we all know all the big answers to the big questions right at the beginning of the movie. And that's not about it, it is also the scene where we finally see their human trapness inside, he's nobody, she's nobody too, but there's a story behind it, which made me so emotional as well. And also above else, the direction is steady is not lost, the stunning photography and camerawork is fabulous that we always think a movie set in Texas is always a western but this one is not finally about a western or a quest, it is all about finding for a hope and life, but the film avoids it pure entertainment an having a one whole scene, and that ain't no matter. \nSo, is \"Paris, Texas\", one of the best films of 1984, yes, and also the decade of 80's. \"Amadeus\" and \"Once Upon a time in America\" are two of the best of 1984 but I gotta say, this is quite a journey that I will never forget, that also reminded me of some other great film that are similar to this like \"Wings of Desire\" and \"The Searchers\". So, what else? Are you ready to watch this movie now? If not, then you just miss a one hell of a ride!",

Win Wenders' 1984 \"Paris, Texas\", is a modest yet moving portrait of a man in search of his roots. Harry Dean Stanton is as amazing as ever as a man who, after a four year separation from his family, has come back find who he was/is. \nMuch like Wenders' \"Wings of Desire\", much attention is given to the setting to show how seemingly insignificant we are in comparison to our surroundings. Yet, rather than war torn Germany, Paris, Texas features panoramic shots of the Texas badlands. With a character so arcane and withdrawn from the world, Wenders utilizes the power of atmosphere coupled with Stanton's acting prowess to fill in the parts of the story where the words won't suffice. \nIt is a story about the path to finding one's identity and Wenders finds so many ways to convey this journey.The freeway scene is a brilliant metaphor for how we as humans go through life. We seem to be traveling down this open road at breakneck speed, making last minute lane changes in hopes to catch up with the life we so desire.\nThe film moves at a snails pace, but I get the sense that Wenders doesn't want to rush Travis' journey. I think it is a smart touch as by the films conclusion, one feels that we were allowed to drink in so much of his life that his image kind of sticks with us. There have been many times in my life where I have felt like a Travis and I think the film beautifully encapsulates the confusing and often heart wrenching journey that one must take in order to find out who they really are.",

In the final 1/3, I thought Travis's rehabilitation & Hunter's reacceptance of his father was too quick to be fully credible.   Also I didn't like the ending which was too pastiche for such a  masterpiece - did the director, Wimd Wenders, succumb to American studios with his choice of ending? Personally I would have ended the movie following the wrong red chevvy - OR later at the signpost, one for Houston, one for LA - kept the audience guessing & heightening the emtional aspect.  This would have kept the tautness of the earlier part of the film in check.  I thought it was unrealistic that Travis choose to turn left.  The mother/son reunion wasn't credible!  Nonetheless a film that is well, well worth watching!",

This is played to the sound of Ry Cooder's lonely, crying guitar. Between Robby Muller, Kate Altman and Wenders, they collectively conjured up an outstanding and artistic vision for the cinematic screen. The story isn't too bad either. Travis (Stanton) slowly recovers his memory and his soul thanks to a rekindling with his brother and his son and subsequently embarks on a quest to find the woman he once loved but walked out on several years before. Stanton provides a performance that is distant and troubled but never devoid of intrigue, while Aurore Clement is sweet and charming as Travis' sister-in-law.",

This notion becomes either hard to swallow or just right in the wake of feeling that deep, nebulous \"unresolved\" feeling. Wenders certainly made me work hard for it all the way through, but at film's end, I was ultimately moved. I also read once, many years ago, that Kurt Cobain called this his all-time favorite film, which goes some distance to unfold another emotive layer for me. A must-see.",

Travis keeps wandering around, not sticking to a single place.  No one can force him to stick around.  His brother Walt finds him in Texas, which is the first time even hearing from him in 4 years.  Travis isn't even close to what Walt once thought of him.  One of the things Travis first says is that he bought some land in Paris, Texas because that's where he thought he was conceived.  His dad would kid around saying he first met his wife in Paris, then pause for the Texas part so they would think Paris, France.  The rest of the movie pretty much plays off of this idea.  Everyone around seems to be creating life to fit their views whether it is real or not.  Walt and Anne raised Hunter as their own child, and Hunter even calls them mom and dad.  When Travis comes back Walt tries to get Hunter to see Travis as his real dad, which is upsetting Anne.  She wants to keep things the way they have been.  I mean, Travis and Jane left their child for 4 years, right?  What makes Travis a fit parent?  It might be logical, but again it's just people trying to live in their own fantasy world.  \n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nEverything begins to slow down even more when Travis takes Hunter with him to find Jane, and not in a bad way.  I was so connected with the characters that I wanted to be along with them the entire journey.  I love that Travis finds Jane in the sex place, and when they talk it's full of long shots until they both finish their stories.  And the shot with her close to him at the glass and his face is reflected over hers was perfection.  I really think Paris, Texas is a better film than Wings of Desire, but both show that Wim Winders is a master filmmaker.",

Don't get me wrong, it is fantastic, but I found it hard to get completely immersed in. It's a bit hard to sit through. At times though, when I was able to really tune into the same wavelength this was on, it was quite great.\r\n\r\nThis film begins like some sort of mystery, and indeed it takes the whole film to really find out what happened, but it lacks the traditional shenanigans of the mystery genre. Even when the answers come to light, I was left unsatisfied and wanting more. That's not a bad thing, either.  WHile there is a story and plot, it is not really about those things.\r\n\r\nInstead, this is more of a meditation on character, emotions, loneliness, and despair. That Stanton's character is a man of few words (quite literally) is one of the many things that make this film a curiosity worthy of seeking out. Stanton is a brilliant character actor, and this was his first time to take the lead. He's wonderful, and I wish more people would take advantage of his abilities and let him lead more often.  The little kid gives one of the better and more interesting performances by a child, and Stockwell is also nice. The two women, while pretty good ,left a little to be desired. The performances aren't bad, just overshadowed. \r\n\r\nBesides the acting, the best reaosn to watch this are the music and the cinematography. Ry Cooder's music here is probably the definitive drifter theme in all of cinema and in general. Robby M\u00fcller's cinematography is some of the best work done in the last thirty years. From the neon to the vast expanses of landscapes shots, everything looks gorgeous. The way that light and shadow are dealt with is also quite stunning. \r\n\r\nAs mentioend above, this film is a bit trying on the patience. While it could be a little shorter, I think the real issue here is the pacing. It both works for and agaisnt the film. It's good that the story unfolds graudally, because that's part of the intrigue, but I think it takes a bit too long at times, and the viewer may wonder why some stuff is focused on longer than it should be.\r\n\r\nI'm giving this 4.5 or an A- in letter grade terms, but I'm not sure how I really feel about this one. I'm mixed on it, and am not sure how to really accurately describe or grade it. I think that's a sign that this is worth checking out.",

I thought Travis had gotten into a car accident that killed his wife, and that's why he's mildly catatonic and refuses to drive or sit in the front seat of an automobile.\r\n\r\nWell, now I'll eat my hat.  This movie is, as Jim Hunter describes, \"a long, perambulating film,\" but I never thought it tried to be deep or understated.  There is so much exposition in Travis' confessional that any Intro to Playwriting class would ream it a new arsehole, but for some reason, it works.  Perhaps it's because the characters aren't looking at each other.  Perhaps it's because Harry Dean Stanton is just so straightforward about it all:  his rage, his brutality, his numbness.  He's neither overstated nor understated; he's just stated.  Perhaps it's because of Nastassja Kinski's complex good girl/bad girl duality.  Her coy yet cautious follow-up questions show that she's not entirely naive; she has an inkling about who's on the other side, but she IS still naive enough to will herself to believe it's not so.\r\n\r\nHunter Carson as the precocious, young son is mighty impressive.  Hunter and Jane's reunion scene is so unexpected.  It's not tearful (at first).  It's not resentful.  It's not deep.  It just is.  Hunter gets up, walks over, holds out his arms for an embrace, all at an aching adagio pace.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think I've found a gesture that rivals the inexplicably beautiful woman-putting-on-stud-earrings tableau:  woman's-hand-resting-on-clavicle.  I mean, looking like Nastassja Kinski might help too.",

It is a long, perambulating film that tries to be understated but ends up as a let-down that even Sam Shepherd's beautiful writing, Harry Dean Stanton's fine acting, and Nastassja Kinski's gorgeous face (she's the prettiest crier since Ingrid Bergman) can't save.  Much of act one does little to set up the film's primary conflict, which doesn't really reveal itself until midway through act two, which is too long to wait to understand to what dramatic question we should attach ourselves.  And even the reason why Stanton's character finds direction on his journey is ironically too quickly developed and resolved.  I found myself thinking that even a seven-year-old in all his seven-year-old naivete wouldn't forgive that easily.\nOverall, I think the film should have started about forty minutes into the story, and it would have achieved the same effect.",

There is a nicely crafted story and some convincing acting from the entire cast - especially Harry Dean Stanton and a young Hunter Carson playing father and son. Although quite lengthy, the film goes by rather quickly which may be due in part to its road-movie status. Many different landscapes, from the Arizona desert to the Los Angeles and Dallas skyline, are documented with an insatiable eye. Wenders' style is unmistakable and sometimes a little overambitious; he does capture the beauty of an ignored United States, yet the story he tells is strong enough that he hardly needs such superfluous composition. As for the narrative, its shrouded and enigmatic details are fitting before the unveiling of a big, however anticlimactic surprise. A final confrontation between husband and wife is somewhat overdramatic to the point of Sirkian absurdity. This scene begins on the right foot, but about halfway through its twenty-minute duration becomes overwrought in its message and noticeable in form. Many of the other scenes like this contain moments of sheer brilliance that hide the failings and, ultimately, make it worthy of a look.",

Does he even know?\r\n\r\nLike Herzog's equally brilliant 'Stroszek', to which this movie may be destined to be forever compared, it is the director's 'America' movie using similar imagery, from the bold scenes of the desert vistas and the railroads and the trailer parks to much more subtle images (such as a trucker's cap with the word 'Stetson' written on it serving as a metonymic device for the real thing).\r\n\r\nThe denouement is one of the most interesting and unique in any movie I have ever come across. It is certainly not uplifting, but at the same time it is not deeply saddening. It is not predictable or trite but is definitely not 'wild' or 'David Lynch'.

The main character was played by character actor Harry Dean Stanton in one of his rare leading roles. Producers must have found him fairly unsuitable for a lead in terms of physical appearance, but no one dared to look at his ability to evoke great amount of emotions in such small ounces of effort. The climactic scene is the ultimate proof of this claim. Many sentimental pictures in the mainstream scene concerning reconciliatory themes have characters that are tailor-made for audiences to empathize with, and all rushing into a satisfactory ending to finish the story. But \"Paris, Texas\" made it an hour longer than the usual, completing the circle of emotions with subtle ease. And though the characters were literally throwing out their repressed emotions, it never felt contrived. The end scene of Travis'  face with a faint glint of smile, has able to support the heavy pour out of emotions in the earlier scene, which only proved the film's literal, emotional power.",

            "content": "1984's Palme d'Or at Cannes by unanimous vote. A beautifully shot-and-colored cinematic tribute from German director Wim Wenders and cinematographer Robby Muller toward their vision of classic Americana.\n\n Massive vistas of blue skies, white clouds, dark storms and orange sunsets. The artful neon and dingy rooms of mid-Century motels. Towering stone monuments within the Mojave Desert. The skyline of Houston. A conversation under an L.A. spaghetti junction. A 3am pit-stop diner with a massive T-Rex out front. All this imagery and so much more, drawn from nearly 100% location shoots and authentic props. \n\nCriterion's restoration is outstanding; images are top-notch crisp and color/lighting is outstanding (and highly innovative). Composition is often extraordinary. Note, for example, in-car shots where the rear-view mirror image and the highway far ahead are both simultaneously in perfect focus.\n\n Ry Cooder's twangy-bluesy slide guitar echoes precisely and sadly the 'hollow man in search of redemption' that Harry Dean Stanton delivers. \n\nThe film opens with Stanton found wandering in the desert, after he and his wife disappeared four years prior, abandoning their child in care of Stanton's brother. Then the viewer's on-the-hook for 2.5 hours to find out what really happened. \n\nThe film's split into two parts. Only the first 80 minutes was scripted/plotted pre-production, and that time flows slower than molasses under sparse, focused dialogue authored by Sam Shepard. Then Wenders - sans script, storyboards or plotline - starts winging it. The pace quickens, much is improvised, loose ends dangle - and Stanton's delivery gets stronger with every passing frame. \n\nThough the viewer waits far too long for it, Stanton's near-fin spousal reunion/confessional (also scripted by Shepard) is undoubtedly one of cinema's great works of drama and visual composition. \n\nWenders' commentary is worthy. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: See it. Serious plot-patience is required up front, but visuals astound throughout.",

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a rarity in the world of cinema. It's not only abnormally impressive on a technical level; it manages to transcend the boundaries a film of its type would normally conform to in an attempt to make a name for itself. This in mind, Wenders' singular creative touches take an ordinary tale of self-realization and eventual reconciliation in an attempt to better oneself to a level I've never before seen, regardless of how simplistic the protagonist's circumstances are.\r\n\r\nGranted, Harry Dean Stanton's excellent portrayal of central character Travis' plight as an individual struggling to come to terms with the poor choices he's made in relation to those he loves the most isn't necessarily groundbreaking, but to disavow the film's genuineness in this regard would be unfair to say the least. The interaction between him and every other character, his son included, almost always serves as a proverbial key to discovering the truth behind Travis and the reasoning behind his behavior, but the film's latter act can appear to some as a tad rushed despite how satisfying it is as a means of giving both Travis and his estranged wife a much-needed sense of closure. All in all, Paris, Texas is an extraordinarily well-acted, thoughtfully paced and beautifully shot piece of cinema that provides valuable insight behind the ideas of love lost and an individual's attempt to essentially fix what's been broken.",

            "content": "Wim Wenders followed a great tradition of Germans working in America with \"Paris, Texas\", and like his forebears Murnau and Lang along with his fellow German New Wave figurehead Herzog, he made an exceptional film that won the Palme D'or at Cannes. Shot in the American west, it takes a relatively simple storyline of a man's attempts to remember who he is and reconnect with his family and turns it into an epic examination of loneliness and the bond which ties families together. \n\nThe opening shot of the film shows just how barren and empty the landscape is, standing in the middle of it all is Travis, a man who is 2 minutes away from collapsing from dehydration and hundreds of miles from his brother Walt who comes to pick him up and take him back to LA. On the drive back, we discover that Travis has been away for 4 years, has a 7 year old son called Hunter and a wife called Jane whose whereabouts are unknown. \n\nLots of questions arise from this early premise: Where was he for 4 years? What did he do? Why did he leave? Where is his wife? But Wenders doesn't give any quick and easy answers away, he takes his time with the material, lets Travis ease back into a normal way of life until he figures out what he wants to do, and not what everyone else thinks he should do. Walt tries to give him space right at the start, putting on a happy face + making small talk to gain his trust, but deep down you know he's just equally upset and angry at Travis for leaving and simply wants a reason for his departure. \n\nWalt and his wife Anne have been taking care of Hunter for the last 4 years and have become very attached to the lad, who after some initial dislike starts to warm towards Travis after the two walk home from school in one incredibly touching scene, leaving Walt + Anne worried that he won't be as close with them as before. In a way they know the boy should be with his real father, but it still hurts that their bond may become weaker now that Travis is back in the picture. Even more so when Travis tells Hunter that he wants to find Jane so the 3 of them can be a family together.\n\nSam Shepard's Searchers-esque screenplay is as bare as the landscape Travis inhabits right at the start of the film, but Wim Wenders has crafted a gloriously beautiful film with some gorgeous neon-lit shades of various colours helping you feel Travis' moods along with every twang of Ry Cooder's award-winning guitar soundtrack. Harry Dean Stanton has had minor roles in major films up until \"Paris, Texas\", and he doesn't disappoint in the lead role, remaining a sympathetic enigma throughout with very strong support from Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell and a hugely underlooked child performance from Hunter Carson. \n\nKurt Cobain cited this as his favourite film and it ain't hard to see why: \"Paris, Texas\" is a beautifully simple story filled with so much feeling it's hard not to fall under its spell. Even with a 2 and a half hour length I feel like I could watch it anytime, it's an outsider's view of America with some nice observations on the culture and its effects on the people who can't relate to it.",

It captures the turbulent avenues of the human heart, the halcyon nostalgia of memory as travelled through a barren, windswept landscape of days and years. The tiny eccentricities the make us human and the highways as mapped out of its mortal entirety. And at the risk of sounding patronising (patronising moi?) I would suggest the viewer has to be travelled a little in years themselves in order to truly appreciate its story, if not its superb artistry. \r\n\tHarry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a man who for four years has been wandering aimlessly the ghostly Mohave landscape. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell)finds him out there, having thought him dead, and together they travel back to California where Travis meets his young son whom Walt and his wife have reared themselves. The dialogue is sprinkled with strangely beautiful quirks for instance when Paul explains to his brother that he works for a company that makes highway billboards Travis says\" Oh, so you are the one who makes them, some of those are really beautiful\" as though his brother were the only one who constructed them. The cinematography and direction is transcendental;all played out to a spectral slide guitar soundtrack. from the haunting super eight films that visage the days of young love. To the landscape of ghostly roads, neon lit petrol stations, skeletal railway lines and midnight cafes. To the final heartbreaking third where the conversations between Stanton and an exquisite Natasha Kinski concludes in an act of selfless love sublime... \r\nThe human heart deserves more than mere escapist entertainment, the detritus and junk food fodder than fills our cinema screens, the human heart deserves Paris, Texas.",

Did his father love his mother for what she was, a plain girl from Texas, or what he imagined her to be, a \"fancy woman\" from France?\r\n\r\nTravis has the same problem; he's the real focus of the film and around him the Texas twilight casts long, sad shadows that glisten with hope, brilliant colors, and soon to be approaching night. In him's a heart that's torn between his love for what he knows and for what he wants to run away from, between his son, Hunter, his ex-wife Jane, and himself.

            "content": "Paris, Texas is a film that encompasses so much human emotion and spiritual drive; a film that travels such sociological lengths within the human mind just as it does physically in space and setting. The film begins in a dusty and lonely desert location, but journeys from here to busy airports; to contemporary American suburbs to the highways connecting these places, to apartments in towering buildings and right on to sleazy performance houses located within the deep, deep crevices of large cities. The sense of travel is important; the sense of journey is apparent. One of my favourite scenes-come-shots in the film occurs when the film's lead stares out of his brother's garden overlooking a highway and an airport runway. No one says or does anything, the character just sits and observes all this activity going on as he forms thoughts in his head; thoughts linked to the fact he must conclude a certain journey he has begins to realise he has already undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a lone man walking through a desert, he is Travis Henderson (Stanton) and wears a rugged and unshaven look as he potters about in a smart, but dusty, suit. Eventually, his brother named Walt (Stockwell) drives out to meet him after being called out by an individual that comes into possession of Travis' wallet, and attempts to figure out what happened. Quite quickly, director Wim Wenders combines beautiful scenery; the bending and twisting of conventions when we see a formally dressed man in a place we don't expect to see a formally dressed man; and an element of mystery when it transpires Travis' memory is less than perfect and he's been out of contact for four years. Additionally, when asked what happened \u2013 Travis rejects the question, tiptoeing around it and further placing it on a back-burner. All that he does reveal, to begin with, is the explanation of the title; that being that he wants to own a small plot of land in Paris, Texas \u2013 something he's been observing via a small photograph for all these years. This gives the film an initial overall direction, or something for its mysterious, mute character to aim for.\r\n\r\nPart of the film's underlying effectiveness is the way Wenders allows us to slowly get involved with characters like Travis. Initially, the audience is invited to toy with a few ideas surrounding him. Do we think he's in trouble with someone? Is he on the run? Can we trust him when he's driving for Walt? Can we trust him when Walt (who knows about as much as we do at most points and thus; speaks for us, the audience) leaves him alone in the motel room as to not merely run off again? The answer to that last question is 'not really' and when it transpires Travis does run away from Walt's attempts at help, maybe we feel a little angry at him; a little frustrated that he's acting in this quite shut off and childish manner.\r\n\r\nBut things change, and people branch out. It's interesting to note that when Walt does disappear from the text as the film nears its final third, Wenders is clearly signalling that he feels comfortable enough he has delivered the necessary information for us to form our own realisation of what's going on and allows Travis to take over as that character that drives the film; as a character that goes places, not randomly, but because he knows what he needs to do \u2013 we know what the situation is and away he goes. It's an effortless switch on Wenders' behalf; a master-class in directing as he delivers this long and drawn out story in the most humbling of manners but never, ever looses track of who's who and what their role is on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe core of the film revolves around the sorting out of problems past; a sort of correcting of mistakes. But this is no film resembling a crude red marker-pen streak straight through several errors on a page, this is more a noting of mistakes made in a first draft before re-writing what should have been accomplished first time out in slick and effortless typography. Not knowing what transpires and why certain people are in the position they're in is 90% of the fun but what I will say is that a third party agent is involved and they're of a rather innocent variety. It is this agent that, when revealed, bridges gaps and enables certain personnel to take on certain responsibilities.\r\n\r\nAnother key tactic in Wenders' delivery is Nastassja Kinski's character. Looking at some of the old posters uploaded here on IMDb, it seems there are a fair few detailing her character with the face of said person slapped all over the covers. But Wenders doesn't reveal what it seems he considers his prize jewel until much later on. I could say her name is Jane perfectly fine, but to mention her surname would be a spoiler of rather unfortunate consequence. Needless to say, she is connected. Paris, Texas is a rewarding experience. It asks us to find time to lend to those that come across as immediately eccentric or not of a 'type' we would immediately pay much attention to. It wants us to look at a person and look at a world through this person's perspective as we begin to realise those of an unspectacular variety might very well have a story of the spectacular variety, to tell. \r\n\r\nThree stars with a plus, out of four.",

It would be like \"Titanic\" taking place entirely at a K-Mart - only this movie is great and doesn't attempt to suffocate you with Celine Dion.  Travis is wandering the deserts of Texas before passing out and resorting to having his brother Walt come and bring him to the salvation that is California.  That's fine and dandy for the first hour but when Travis is reunited with his son (turns out Walt and his wife raised the kid after Travis split and his wife Jane gave up custody), the duo leave for Houston to reunite mother and son.  Ordinarily, this would be the stuff a Lifetime original movie is made of.  But with directing by Wenders and captivating performances from just about everyone (sorry Walt, but your wife kind of brings this whole thing down), this is elevated into a pretty engaging work.  Yeah, there's a shift in purpose halfway through and in the end you kind of wonder what all has been accomplished but it is all worth it for one scene.  It happens in this role-playing whorehouse place (which, really, isn't that where all life-affirming scenes are shot?  No...?) and is just about the most heartbreaking 20 minutes you could expect to find in a simulated coffee shop.  To give more details would only diminish the impact but Sam Shepard really knocked it out of the park with his writing.",

The cast is amazing with Harry Dean Stanton leading the way in, quite possibly, the best performance of his career. The subtle score by Ry Cooder only expands the universe and environment of the film in brilliant minimalist fashion.\r\n\r\nThe story is sheer perfection and highly recommend that if you haven't yet seen this work, or any film by Wim Wenders for that matter, this should be high on your list. This film went on to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes and remains one of the few masterpieces to come out of the 1980s. Well, that's about all the praising I've got in me for now.

A slow-burn two-and-a-half-hour movie that kept my eyes locked onto the screen. How a movie can be so warm, and gentle hit the hardest in emotions.The movie is long and slow paced, so of course it\u2019s not going to be for everyone, but then again, every movie isn\u2019t for everyone. However, movies like these are a special type of breed that cannot be duplicated so easily if you tried.Watching this movie without knowing a single thing about it added so many layers of mystery that perfectly placed me in the main characters head. Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), once a family man, but now a silent drifter walking aimless in the Texas desert while having amnesia on certain parts of his life. He has become a worn-out and raggy version of himself, which leaves the audience wondering why. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) finds him and helps to recollect his memories, while also reuniting him to his son, sister in-law, and eventually his wife. So as Travis is retracing his steps and rediscovering forgotten memories, you are with him all the way until the end.Harry Dean Stanton is excellent as Travis, a man fallen into a black hole of emotions. He may not be a great father or husband, but tries his best to mend the wounds he caused in the past and to leave a personal impact on his son Hunter. Stanton subtle approach of bringing a character like Travis to life is truly extraordinary, because Stanton draws more into Travis gentleness while also displaying the pain behind his kind smile. There were many instances in the movie that I thought that if any other actor played the role, they would have easily over done it for dramatic effect, but Stanton deadpan and yet natural delivery made certain scenes more effective.A solid child performance from Hunter Carson, who plays Travis's son who is also named Hunter. The scenes between the two were the sweetest elements in the movie and brought a warm smile to my face.Natassja Kinski plays Travis\u2019s wife, who does not appear until the third act, but when she does, she is instantly hypnotic to watch. An actress of pure beauty and raw talent. Her quiet and soft-spoken voice made her presence even more remarkable, because how something so simple can leave the biggest impact. She spends most of her scenes in one room, and yet I totally bought the chemistry between Stanton and Kinski, which is impressive considering the two are never in the same room together and share only two scenes in the movie. All the emotions from Kinski comes from her reaction and demeanour, so with every flicker of her eye and long pauses communicates so much of her emotional state that a million words could not. It\u2019s unbelievable.The conversation scene towards the end is one of the finest achievements in cinema. Painful and revealing that even if you don\u2019t cry, you will think about crying. It is as moving as anything I think I have ever seen. I\u2019m getting teary eyes just thinking about it.I find it fascinating how a German director like Wim Wenders approaches the portrayal of family life in America, because Wender leans more towards the sad elements in order to destroy the illusion of the perfect family life. It is not all doom and gloom, but it is not all sunshine and rainbows too, just real enough for the audience to attach themselves to the characters and story.The score from Ry Cooder is fantastic and plays perfectly in sync with the Texas setting. The music also represents that dry, lonesome, and reminiscent of the past. It is the type of music that makes you feel sad, but the weird kind of sadness that you enjoy.Perhaps the biggest standout in the whole movie is Robby M\u00fcller\u2019s cinematography. Everything from the breathtaking landscapes of the Texas desert where the scorching heat cannot stale the colours of the environment, while M\u00fcller shows us a distant land stretching further away. The other is light and colour that is drenched in vibrant neon. The whole movie has beautiful visuals that helps create the overall mood of the movie while also giving it a foreign feel. It has some of my favourite shots ever.Overall rating: A devastating, but hypnotic movie that stirs emotion in me like no other. An absolute masterpiece.",
