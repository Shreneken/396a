            "content": "This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! \"Ghostbusters\" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best \"a-hole\" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, \"Dickless\". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From \"This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head\" to \"Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947\" to \"Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! \" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

            "content": "There is no set definition of the word \"classic\" but I'm sure this film qualifies as such or will in the near future, since it was so unique and popular....and remains so today, over 20 years old later. It's just one of those films that you remember seeing when it came out at the theaters. I doubt if anyone has forgotten the catchy theme song, either. Despite numerous viewings, I still find this very funny as I suspect many people do, because it entertains so well. I know the story is ludicrous and I don't believe for one second in ghosts so I ignore the \"theology\" and just laugh at Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson. Murray, as he tends to do, grabs the spotlight more than the rest and delivers more laughs than any of the cast but my favorite was Moranis as the nerdy \"Louis Tully.\" I wish his role had been bigger. All the guys, however, plus Sigourney Weaver, the love interest of the always-horny Murray, are fun. I even liked the sequel because most of this cast was included.",

            "review_title": "My favorite film as a child and still brilliant today!",
            "content": "I have special affection for this film. When I was a youngster, growing up between the ages of four and ten, this was my favorite film. I loved the whole Ghostbusters thing. I loved the sequel, the cartoon series, I had to have the toys and merchandise every Christmas, you name it. Strangely, as I have gotten older, I find myself appreciating the film more and more. When I was a child I loved it for the special effects, the gadgets and the ghostbusting especially. Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I'm older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like Venkman's line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like Slimer being the ghost of John Belushi and Venkman rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80's hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.Unlike many of today's blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against Slimer, Gozer and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80's, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. Bill Murray, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as Peter Venkmen who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the \"there is no Dana, only Zool\" moment. Murray's priceless reaction to Dana Barrett's possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as Murray, we have co writers Dan Akyroyd and Harold Ramis sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver making a wonderful damsel in distress, Rick Moranis is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a  neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.Add to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made.",

            "review_title": "One of the funniest films of all time. Who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!",
            "content": "I have a small posse of favorite comedians. Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He's been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world.I like all of the comedians in \"Ghostbusters,\" come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for \"The Blues Brothers.\" And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as \"Vacation,\" \"Groundhog Day,\" and \"Analyze This.\"Then there's also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in \"Spaceballs,\" Barney Coopersmith in \"My Blue Heaven,\" and that wacky inventor in \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids.\"Yes, one could say that \"Ghostbusters\" is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (\"Kindergarten Cop\"). It's a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they're in over their heads.It starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a \"ghost-busting\" company.But they immediately realize that it won't be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.They pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.However, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn't believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana's apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.Sounds corny, huh? It's meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.I don't know, there's something in me that loves \"Saturday Night Live\" humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don't find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as \"The Simpsons,\" but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.Part of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, \"Ghostbusters\" is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn't always a howler. It's more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from \"Saturday Night Live\" and such backgrounds.Murray steals every scene he is in. This, along with `Groundhog Day,' is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff'd man, check out Murray's face. This is classic stuff.As much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray's flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff'd Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd's performance in this film, I think of that scene.\"Ghostbusters\" is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It's light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors' and writers' backgrounds of \"Saturday Night Live\" -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

            "content": "Bill Murray is one of the best wise guys in the business.  I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical 'Dr. Venkman' cuts loose throughout this good comedy.  Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with \"getting into Bill's mind\" as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character.  Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look).  Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80's and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.Murray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork 'Egon'.  The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events.  Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.This was a picture I loved when I was a kid.  I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed.  It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the 'Busters turbulent jobs.  The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan's movie library.  SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred.  Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now. It is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the 'Busters, for he was originally cast.  The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.  It has spanned these phases for me and still works wonderfully. \nRATING: ***",

            "review_title": "A severely underrated film",
            "content": "What's that you say? Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(\"He slimed me,\" \"OK. So? She's a dog,\" \"When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!\") are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; \"Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?\" \"That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me\", or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, \"Dropping off or picking up?\" Brilliant.Not only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon's retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?The special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film's world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching \"Ghostbusters\" I couldn't imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else. The soundtrack is great, not the overrated theme (Which was in fact lifted from Huey Lewis' \"I Need a New Drug\"), but the wonderfully blusey \"Cleaning Up the Town,\" the creepy proto-techno chiller \"Magic\" and also the wonderful score by the late and much lamented Elmer Bernstein.",

            "content": "Ghostbusters was so great because it took the science fiction and fantasy part seriously (considering how Dan Aykroyd IRL is a strong believer in the paranormal this makes sense), so the humor was almost entirely from dialogue and the performance of the cast. It takes the simple concept of \"people who start a ghost catching business\" and adds things like multidimensional gods and giant killer corporate mascots. These are things you wouldn't expect from a comedy movie at the time. Apparently, Aykroyd's original draft of the story was almost entirely sci-fi action with little humor.The resulting story was dead serious, and rather terrifying. A woman becoming possessed by a demon just because of where her apartment is? Being transformed into a monster, then into stone while she was unwillingly in service to a dark god? That is scary, not funny. What MADE the movie funny was how the actors responded to the situation. They were just like normal people, put in an abnormal situation, and responded in line with their own personal character, which was mainly to crack jokes so they could handle the fear. It was just four guys, out of their depth, going in with a grin because backing down wasn't an option for them.Bill Murray just shows outstanding comedic timing in this one. He had me from the opening scene where he is shocking a male subject in an experiment while simultaneously trying to \"get the girl\" by convincing her she is psychic.What was 80s about it? Well, the triumph of the private sector over academeia - \"I've worked in the private sector, they expect results\", and the EPA contributing to the end of the world. Everybody could forget about Watergate, recessions, and nuclear war, and just laugh at the movies for a change. If you've never seen it I recommend it . The comedy is timeless.",

I really liked the soundtrack, and the special effects were truly excellent, considering it was made in the 1980s. The direction was slick and self-assured, and there are a lot of truly funny lines in the script like \"Ray, if someone asks you if you are a god, you say yes\". I can't count the number of times I was laughing when I watched this film. The performances were brilliant. Bill Murray, who is excellent when he is given a great script, see him in Lost in Translation for evidence, steals every scene he's in, and Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis both gave spirited performances. Also fun to watch were Annie Potts and Rick Moranis, and Sigourney Weaver was her usual charming self here. I will confess when I first saw this I was frightened by the dog like creatures Zuul and Vinz Clortho. I also felt that scenes like the Marshmallow Man (or whatever it was) bit got a bit too silly, but hey, it's all part of the fun.

They had a different movie in mind, then changed it in a rush, making changes and inventing every day while shooting. Usually this results in an incoherent mess, but in this case it became ever so MORE coherent.The reason is that all the principles are strongest at improvisational comedy. And they had worked together intensively and knew how to make each other look good. Its a funny thing about acting, especially comedic acting in the long form : you almost never can actually make yourself a success. You have to trust your partners to make you a success.I always enjoy this movie. Like \"Holy Grail\" its charm is in referencing a mature world of slightly twisted forces, keeping some constant. Its a familiar place, naturally found. Its that natural access that makes it so endearing. Nothing is forced; no one is trying very hard.

I still don't know about the Twinkie.I just watched this again after many, many years, probably since the picture first came out come to think of it. My rating is partly based on nostalgia factor, this was a really fun and novel picture when it came out. Like \"Star Wars\" that preceded it in 1977 however, a lot of the effects don't hold up very well today and almost look cheesy compared to modern day special effects. But what can you do about that, it's just the way it is.The principal characters did a nice job here of bringing their total protonic reversal skills together to battle ectoplasmic residue on a grand scale. Back in the day I wondered why the original trio didn't have another Saturday Night Live alumnus as part of the mix, but Harold Ramis did just fine. Rick Moranis was hilarious as next door neighbor Louis Tully, the story probably could have used a little more of his goofiness. And Sigourney Weaver, wow, how'd you like to get stuck on an Alien spaceship with her on board? Anyway, it's cool to take a step back in time every now and then to revisit an old favorite. Making the effort even more memorable is the catchy theme song which kind of stays with you a couple of days after hearing it. Now if I can only figure out about that Twinkie.",

There is a lot to like about  ghostbusters , like bill Murrays  constant and always funny wise cracks,  the films constant shift  from a light hearted comedy to  intense ghost busting thriller and of course , the technically flawless attack of the marsh mallow man  that is probably one of my favorite parts of this film.In this day and age of computer generated  fx wizardry   the completely analogue special effects  still look  great ( especially the stay puft marsh mallow man , its rampage through the city   looks incredibly   real ! ) and the film it self is still better and more imaginative  than  a lot of event movies you will find in a cinema near you  today .And to top it all off  Ghostbusters is one of the few films out there that actually  had  worthy TV spin off that was the \"real Ghostbusters\", a cartoon that  i loved as a kid.Ghostbusters is a film that truly deserves its iconic status.The screen dwellers mark (out of 5 ) : * * * *",

Lots of special effects (which have also held up pretty well) but the comedy does not get lost in them. Murray does his absurd deadpan, Ramis his low-key deadpan, and Ackroyd his high-energy weirdness. Sigourney Weaver proves that she has comedic chops. Still pretty good, not great.",

            "content": "After losing their university grant, paranormal scientists Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) set up business as Ghost Busters, professional exterminators for those with supernatural pests, unaware that New York is soon to become plagued by spooks as an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer prepares to enter our realm.When Ghost Busters was originally released, way back in 1984 (bloody hell, that's a quarter of a century ago!!!), cinema audiences went wild for the supernatural adventures of spook wranglers Venkman and Co.: the film was the definition of an 80s, crowd-pleasing blockbuster, with an impressive cast of hot comedy names, a script packed with witty one liners, bucket-loads of flashy, state-of-the-art special effects, and, of course, a catchy theme song that couldn't fail to please.So this afternoon, I sat down to re-live the magical experience with my children (aged 6 and 8), but to my disappointment, discovered that the film really hasn't aged that well. Despite some classic moments of dry humour from Bill Murray, the impressive sight of a Godzilla-size Mr. Stay Puft trashing New York, and the even more impressive sight of Sigourney Weaver's lovely, long legs, the film just isn't as great as my memory had led me to believe: it's rather cheap looking at times, with shonky props, unconvincing sound-stage sets, and crowd-scenes of, oh, at least 50 people; the effects that once dazzled now look embarrassingly bad, with iffy stop motion animation, crap matte work, random flashy lights, and Richard Edlund's Oscar nominated 'ink in water' clouds looking just like... well, just like ink in water; and rather than being a roller-coaster ride of laughs and scares, the film is actually pretty dull at times. Sorry kids, but I was so sure that this film rocked; instead, it's just another passable piece of 80s nostalgia for the middle-aged.Oh well, at least the theme song is still a corker; all together now.... Who ya gonna call?",

            "content": "Ghostbusters is quite simply one of my most beloved films of all time. The iconic production is a perfect marriage of a special effects extravaganza with spectacular performances to create one side- splitting gem. Bill Murray is the undeniable star and he's in top form as Dr. Peter Venkman a sly, laid back scientist with deadpan delivery that seems more concerned with dating his pretty client Dana Barrett than actually getting to the bottom of her disturbances. Sigourney Weaver nicely straddles the line between exasperated annoyance and charmed love interest. Bill Murray likewise has great camaraderie with his fellow Ghostbusters Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Those two are also responsible for writing the finely tuned screenplay. It zips, it pops and it never lets up. Ernie Hudson joins them later as Winston Zeddemore. He delivers my favorite quip after the group is blown away by the lightening bolts of an evil entity from another dimension. There is a slew of funny dialogue and Rick Moranis' nerdy portrayal of Louis Tully delivers a lot of it. He's hilarious. \"Okay, who brought the dog?\" he grins after hearing the growl from the long horned beast hiding in his closet. The spectacular special effects support the story, but they never threaten to overshadow the actors. The technology was state of the art at the time, even earning an Academy Award nomination. But it lost to the mine cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Perhaps time has rendered the optics a bit quaint to a modern audience. The sight of that devil dog leaping from the closet and running around the city is the most dicey. But it's the comedic interactions between characters that hold our focus, not the whiz bang appeal of the visual displays. OK so there's that \"monster\" near the end that dwarfs everything else. When the Destructor of their choosing threatens the city and their very existence, it's memorable. That's the kind of silly moment of brilliance that make you realize you're watching a work of creative genius. Oh yeah. I adore this film.",

            "content": "This was one of the first films I grew up with as a child. I remember watching Ghostbusters on video, and then I would rewind it and watch it all over again. I must have seen this film at least 100 times, and I'm happy to say it is still enjoyable to me even today.The basic premise of the film is rather daft, but because of such a great cast, Ghostbusters rises far above what might have been a completely idiotic film, and instead becomes a comedy classic.For anyone who hasn't seen Ghostbusters (if such a thing is possible), it is about three parapsychology professors Dr Peter Venkman (the wonderful Bill Murray), Dr Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are booted out of Columbia University because of their sloppy research methods.Now faced with unemployment, our trio decide to go into business for themselves. They set up the first 'paranormal, investigations and eliminations' business ever to grace New York City. In short, they are the Ghostbusters, our first, last (and only) line of defence against the paranormal world.Their first customer comes in the shapely form of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who has just had a nasty encounter with her fridge! It turns out to be something much more than she ever could have imagined, as she is possessed by something called Zuul, and is now preparing for the coming of Gozer, the demi-god.The Ghostbusters are now suddenly faced with an army of ghosts, an officious EPA inspector, and a possible apocalypse. These are all the plot threads neatly woven into the story, right up to the hilarious ending with Mr Stay Puft, the Marshmallow Man. (I kid you not).Directed by Ivan Reitman, and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, they have truly created a masterpiece. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Venkman, His typical deadpan routine and laid-back manner is a perfect foil when faced with such other-worldly things. He gets all the best lines, and his delivery is spot-on. For example, when Dana is telling them what she saw in her fridge:\"Generally you don't see that kind of behaviour in a major appliance\".Dan Aykroyd is good as 'the heart of the Ghostbusters', a well-intentioned man who has a tendency to cause problems for the group, (after all he does think up Mr Stay Puft. He co-wrote a well thought out, witty script.Harold Ramis manages to be funny in a way I can't properly explain. Some of the faces he pulls when in conjunction with the dialogue of the other cast members are hilarious. He is funny in a serious sort of way, if that means anything. He is the brains of the group, which means he is the only one who really knows what the hell is going on. He has shown a dab hand at directing in recent years, and I'm sure he came up with a lot of good ideas for this film. The best film he directed was Groundhog Day, pairing him up once again with Bill Murray.Sigourney Weaver gives a solid performance, and Ghostbusters is one of the first films that launched her on the road to stardom after Alien. She's certainly not out to play the damsel in distress, and carries herself strongly enough almost as she did as Ellen Ripley. She is certainly one of the first actresses to provide a role-model for other women as strong, female characters.The other characters have their moments too. Rick Moranis is not really that memorable as Louis Tully, but when possessed as the Key Master, he is quite funny. (Especially the scene where he gives the wagon driver the evil eye). Annie Potts is great as Janine Melnitz, their acerbic secretary. Like Murray, she is quite deadpan in her delivery too: (\"I've quit better jobs than this\").Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore only comes into the film about halfway, and he always seems like an outsider when compared to the other Ghostbusters. However, he has a good chemistry with Aykroyd. The scene where they're talking about the end of the world is good, and its just a shame they weren't partnered up together more often.Some of the special effects have dated a little, for example, the Devil Dogs look a bit fake now. But some of the other special effects are still pretty good, like their proton packs, Slimer, and Mr Stay Puft is a magical marvel of special effects work. I understand some of the effects coordinators were the same people who did Raiders of the Lost Ark. That must have been the scene where the Nazis opened the Ark.Where the quality of the effects may have diminished a little, the film more then makes up for it in comedy. Some of the gags are quite subtle, written on a personal level that only the Ghostbusters could understand. With excellent lines from Murray, you can't complain, such as:\"Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back\".The ending is suitably daft, but doesn't cheapen the story in any way. All the actors have a terrific chemistry, and they obviously enjoyed making this film. They have all met before on shows like Saturday Night Live, where they learnt to understand each others abilities and compliment each other to come across as funny as possible. This film really enhanced their careers. The theme song may seem a bit cheesy to some people, but I like it. Sometimes I find myself humming it without realising.Definitely Ivan Reitman's best film, and (with the exception of Evolution) its just a shame he can't make films like this more often. It's a pity the sequel didn't live up to the excellence that was Ghostbusters.",

            "content": "For it's time, Ghostbusters would have to be a classic. Visiting such realms as the supernatural, is sure not meant to be funny, but this film does stretch that rule a little. Thankfully it does, as it allows those among us (like me), who do not believe in ghost and goblins, to sit back, relax and enjoy the funny antics of these ghost-busting heroes. Although it might be a little dated in the new millennium, 'Ghostbusters' is still one of the 'great comedies of the 1980's' in my view.When the University downsizes the parapsychology department, Doctors Venkman, Stantz and Spengler make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters, investigators and exterminators of paranormal pests! When the bewitching Dana Barrett discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, our heroes come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to raise hell in Manhattan.When reviewing a movie, I try to be as fair as I can be. However I feel that by only viewing a movie once, we can not comprehend or appreciate the work that has gone into it, as a lot of work goes into bringing a movie to 'life'. For me that is no more apparent than with this classic hit. The time spent doing the script, special effects, production designs all have their merit and make this movie great. It is not just actors doing their job, as that is only one small part of the movie.Most of 'Ghostbusters' success must be given to director Ivan Reitman. He did a fabulous job directing the Ghostbusters. I am certain that he left no stone unturned when it came to getting this film right and I am so glad he did. What also made this film more unique was that two of its stars wrote one very very good script. I am of course talking about Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. Their originality and comedy on paper, made watching this film a real joy. It is not often that stars write good scripts, but this time these guys got it right.The cast that this film has was amazing to say the least. The four Ghostbuster characters were all different, which made them great to watch. I love the way that director Reitman summed up the Ghostbusters. He said of the three main guys that, Bill Murray was the 'mouth' or the smart ass of the film, while Dana Barrett says of Dr Venkman, ' you're more like a game-show host' and I have to agree with that, Dan Akroyd was the 'hands', meaning the person who was very hands-on when came to the ghostbusting, and finally Harold Ramis was the 'Brains' or the smartest one of Ghostbusters. Add in the cheery Ernie Hudson, who played Winston Zeddemore, making them the perfect team.However, the Ghostbusters are a little different when it comes to doing their job. They have funny facilities, which only they could invent, a car that is as wild and conspicuous as its owners are, while the tools that they use to trap there supernatural phenomenon are weird and crazy. I love the traps, 'nuclear accelerators' and other bits and pieces they simply refer to as 'toys', when they are anything but that.Then take into consideration the other great roles in this film, as without them this film would not be as good. Sigourney Weaver was very 'spiritual' when came to being the normally delightful Dana Barrett. I really enjoyed the onscreen chemistry between her and Bill Murray. Rick Moranis played the moronic '' as only he can. I always think of him as the man from 'Little shop of horrors', but there is no doubting his acting talents. Add in the very 'unusual' and eccentric Receptionist Janine, who was amusingly portrayed by Annie Potts. I love it when she screams 'we got one'. Yet I still say my favourite character in the Ghostbusters, over the silly Venkman (who is second), is the funny ghost Slimer. While Murray is as insane as the ghosts were in this movie, Slimer steals the show in my view. He is wild, 'slimes' people and makes the Ghostbusters all the funnier. Whoever invented Slimer is a genius!There are some very funny scenes and lines in this movie. I love how we are introduced to the first ghost in the movie, who is part of the library in New York, then the mayhem and chaos we see slimmer cause in the Hotel is classic cinematography. The Venkman line at the end of the scene is priceless as he says 'we came, we saw, we kicked its ass!' Throw in scenes with the monsters that run around New York terrorising people, the unlocking of ghosts by the Environmental Protection jerk and the Marshmallow Man are all hilarious parts to a movie that is full on from start to the finish.\nI wish I had been old enough to see the opening of 'Ghostbusters' in the cinema, as I am sure it would have had a huge cinema release. When I remember the Ghostbusters two things come to mind. One is the hypnotic tune 'Ghostbusters' written and performed by Ray Parker Jnr., and two is that my mother and one of her friends said that they banned their children from viewing such rot. I certainly missed out on seeing many great facets of what the Ghostbusters spawned, such as two ingenious cartoons. I sort of understand what they were on about, but I would have preferred being allowed to watch it and then just forget about it. This film has a lot to like about, it is funny, crazy and a little bit different. If you are yet to see what the great fuss is about the 'Ghostbusters', then please do yourself a favour and pick up a copy today. Yes, they are ready to believe you!CMRS gives 'Ghostbusters': 5 (Brilliant Film)",

Not to mention it's unique idea of a story, while most ghost stories are supposed to be scary, Dan Aykroyd and Harrold Rammis made this into a genuine comedy that is so much fun to watch while it still has it's spooky moments here and there. They also picked the perfect cast and great characters, they clicked so well, and I think that's what made the story work so well. Not to mention one of the funnest songs of all time was made with this film, OK, a little off the subject, I know, but I had to mention it.Peter, Egon, and Ray are three unemployed fella's when they come up with a great idea. New York is being haunted by ghosts lately and no one can come up with a plan to get rid of them, well, instead of a typical exterminators, they become the Ghost Busters! The Ghost Busters are like the police only they know how to face these ghouls and they come up with a whole business with it. Peter's girlfriend, Dana, has a problem with her refrigerator, it has demons inside of it, not to mention the whole building is being taken over by evil forces that only the Ghost Busters can handle.Ghost Busters is a fun film that I guarantee you a few laughs with. This is a film that will be remembered for years to come. I think my favorite scene was when Louis Tully is having a party for the building and is trying so hard to get everyone to join, he was so cute. Not to mention when Dana becomes possessed and invites Peter over and how he handles the whole situation, it was just so funny.

            "content": "GHOSTBUSTERS was one of my favourite films as a kid; I first saw it when I was about 5, and it scared the hell out of me (that librarian ghost - jeez!). My old VHS tape was worn through by the time I grew up and forgot about it. Now, years later, I decided to give it another spin and discover whether it was one of those films that holds up even when you're an adult...The answer is a resounding YES! GHOSTBUSTERS is still a great movie, a thoroughly entertaining classic for all ages. It's an out-and-out comedy featuring my favourite performance from a beautifully deadpan Bill Murray, who's perfectly supposed by Dan Ackroyd (who makes a great butt for the jokes), Harold Ramis (as the straight guy), Ernie Hudson (underrated), Sigourney Weaver (a delightful role reversal from Ellen Ripley) and little Rick Moranis, who's always hilarious.Although the film was made nearly 30 years ago, it hasn't dated in the slightest and the detectives vs. spooks storyline still holds up really well. I just can't get over how well made it is, with scenes that should be ridiculous (such as the climax) just totally gathering you up and immersing you in the experience. I love the Lovecraftian undertones, and the way the special effects are still much, much better than most of the CGI in modern movies. Those stop motion dog-creatures, absolutely fantastic, even now.Okay, so the sequel wasn't so great, but I'm a firm believer in the fact that no matter how many bad sequels or remakes, you can never spoil the entertainment value of a classic movie. And GHOSTBUSTERS is exactly that: a classic for all ages, a genuine family movie that never panders to a young audience and remains timeless because of it.",

            "content": "When three parapsychology professors are fired from their university they decide to set up shop as paranormal investigators or \"Ghostbusters\". Their first client is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who approaches the Ghostbusters after witnessing strange visions and hearing the name \"Zool\" when she opened her fridge. Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) checks out her apartment but finds no evidence of paranormal activity. However, when Dana starts exhibiting strange behaviour, the professors investigate further and discover that the apartment complex that she lives in is a gateway for the occult. With paranormal activity now reaching epidemic proportions The Ghostbusters must now try to save the city against seemingly impossible odds.I, like many, have fond memories of Ghostbusters as a child and hoped that I would have the same feeling again when watching it as an adult. Unfortunately, I only found moments of this film to be enjoyable rather than finding it enjoyable as a whole.The beginning of the film is memorable and the 3 professors all seem to be setup as very different characters which generally produces an interesting camaraderie between Aykroyd, Murray and Ramis. The first 20 minutes or so are a lot of fun from Venkman's fraudulent shenanigans to The Ghostbusters chasing Slimer round the hotel. It's explosive and fast-paced, but after these scenes it seems to fall apart slightly and the middle portion of the film bogs down too much with uninteresting and unnecessary scenes (Venkman's creepy stalking of Dana being one example). Rick Moranis' turn as Dana's nerdy neighbour Louis Tully also wasn't particularly funny and was more annoying than anything else. A large portion of their story arc sees them as Gatekeeper and Keymaster in the occult world which was an aspect of the story that wasn't that involving and also one that never really had a particularly satisfying pay-off.In fact watching this again as an adult I noticed both the plot and the story are extremely thin; there certainly isn't enough of either element to warrant its 2 hour running time. Considering the title is \"Ghostbusters\" it would have been nice to see more examples of \"Ghostbusting\" which sadly only seems to feature heavily towards the end. There's also no ignoring how silly the film is for most of its running time, but sadly for me a lot of it was silly in an eye-rolling way rather than being silly in a funny way.Ultimately with Ghostbusters you're left with a film that has impressive beginning and an impressive ending, but one that has an unsatisfying middle-section which always felt uncertain and at odds with the rest of the film. Older teens (who are prepared to overlook the rather thin plot) may still find this to be quite enjoyable, but as for me I only found some parts of it to be enjoyable and feel that I may have just outgrown it.",

            "content": "The first thing that needs to be said is that Ghostbusters (1984) is possibly the funniest film ever. That's quite the bold statement to make but with good cause. This film holds up probably more than any other comedy in existence. You know how there are those movies that you see that are hysterical the first few times you see them? This one just keeps on coming. I remember when I was a kid, I wore our copy of Ghostbusters out. At the time, I thought it was a horror movie (I wasn't the brightest bulb) so I watched it constantly (Being that I am a horror buff) never realizing what it truly was. I hadn't yet caught on to a lot of the humor. About eight years later, I noticed that I hadn't seen the film for forever and a day. I popped it in and oh my God...I just about died with laughter.This movie has something for everyone. Director Ivan Reitman said that he found a comedic formula for films...it works as follows: There's the brain, the heart, and the mouth. Ghostbusters scored with all of them. As the brain of the bunch, Egon Spengler's (Harold Ramis also co-wrote it) use of witty humor is hilarious. If you have the right mind set, almost everything Spengler says is laugh out loud funny. At the heart of the Ghostbusters is Dan Aykroyd's (Who created the idea for the film) lovable fool, Ray Stantz. Ray has a tenacity for saying simple minded things and using very little logic and yet somehow the man got a P.H.D. (Probably through studying habits, despite ignorance.) There's a line that he says involving a smell in the beginning of the movie that I am chuckling at just thinking about it. This of course leaves Bill Murray (He was nominated for a Gloden Globe) as the sarcastic Peter Venkman (The mouth of the beast.) Peter is likely the one that gets the most laughs because he, being the mouth that he is, never stops making fun of everything. It's like Rodney Dangerfield in the party scene in Caddyshack but a whole lot funnier and continues the rest of the movie. The film also produces some laughter out of the minor characters as well. The scatological humor toward the end of the film between Rick Moranis (In a role intended for John Candy) and Sigourney Weaver is quite laughter inducing. Ernie Hudson in one of his first big roles has a few good lines as the other Ghostbuster, Winston Zeddmore (The only one who's not a doctor) and William Atherton of Die Hard fame plays the ultimate annoyance as Walter Peck. Not to be forgotten in the mix is Annie Potts as Janine who has some rather memorable humorous lines, for instance the one I've written to summarize the movie. Numerous other well known faces are seen on screen too, which includes John Belushi (Or rather his continuation of the character Bluto, from Animal House) as the principal image used for the now famous 'Disgusting Blob,' Slimer. Like any good comic will tell you, good comedy is generally about setting up the other guys around you. Well, it just so happens that the characters all work well with each other to set the great comedic moments staged in this film.Not to be forgotten however in all the funny one liners and set ups is the overall film. Ghostbusters was nominated for numerous awards including Oscars for best song (Courtesy of Ray Parker Jr.) and special effects, which are now slightly dated but possibly work even better with the wacky style being consistent with the rest of the movie. Along with Parker, there are numerous other great songs including a song by The Bus Boys that climbed charts and a rather creepy seeming song (But works well) by Mick Smiley. Another thing that should not be forgotten is the horror elements of the film. Though purposely outrageous, the effects do serve as some potential scare moments. Among the most frightening involve stop motion animated puppets called Terror Dogs. Though the scares are few, they do work fairly well (They had me convinced as a youngster) bringing enough threat to the ghosts that haunt New York City. The story itself is interesting as well, involving some intriguing mythology of Sommeria among other countries.Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!",

            "content": "My daughter was flipping channels the other day and ran across the great 1984 Supernatural comedy GHOSTBUSTERS and stopped to watch for awhile. As happens with her generation, she eventually got more interested in her phone and friends and wandered away. Me? I was drawn back into this film so much so that I went downstairs, grabbed the DVD (yes, kids, I still own DVDs) and popped the film into my Home Theater System to give it a proper viewing.I gotta say...I was so inspired by how terrific this film is that I changed course and devoted the 23rd BankofMarquis Movies podcast to this film.Starring the comedic trio of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and featuring Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and the great Rick Moranis, GHOSTBUSTERS tells the tale of supernatural exterminators called to save NYC when paranormal experiences start escalating in the Big Apple.But it's not the destination, it's the journey that makes this film so much fun. Told in a standard 2 Act arc - Origin Story followed by a 2nd Act of battling the \"Big Bad\" - it is the comedic timing and chemistry of the 3 leads that makes this film work (aided by a wonderful \"straight man\" turn by Sigourney Weaver and a brilliant \"side-kick\" comedic turn by Rick Moranis).Credit for keeping this film together, moving and more than just a \"series of jokes\" is Director Ivan Reitman (STRIPES, MEATBALLS), he had the comedic \"cred\" to appeal to these 3 big time comedians, but has a Producers sense of efficiency and a Director's command of subject and tone.This film was Aykroyd's idea and he shines as, Ray Stantz, the heart of the Ghostbusters. He truly believes in what he is doing and has a child-like sense of wonder in his actions. Harold Ramis (more noted as a Writer and a Director) was brought in to co-write Aykroyd's idea, steering it more towards Reitman's idea of humor and writing in a way that would make Murray shine - but he is also wonderfully deadpan as techno-geek Egon Spengler. The serious nerd who never smiles.But...make no mistake...this film revolves around the antics of con-man Dr. Peter Venkman, a scientist who doesn't believe any of this, but is willing to go along as long as it achieves his goals. And...what are his goals? Well...womanizing and getting through life with as little work as possible. Murray is at the top of his comedic game in this film and most of his scenes are improvised - but, to be fair to the writers, Murrya's riffs are what Ramos and Aykroyd put down on paper. He is the mouth of this film and his energy drives this movie throughout.Sigourney Weaver proved that she could do more than Sci-Fi action (like ALIEN) when she plays the straightman to these 3 wild-men. She stated that she was channeling her inner Margaret Dumont (straightman to the Marx Brothers) and she does an admirable, charming job in a role that could have easily come off as annoying.Rick Moranis, of course, almost steals the film as the nerdy accountant neighbor of Weaver's. His improvised riff as he goes around the room at his own party is the stuff of comedic gold.Ernie Hudson comes along as the 4th Ghostbuster. Many folks thinks that he is the \"unnecessary\" GhostBuster, but I would argue that he comes along at a time (right after the origin story is complete) to be the audience surrogate - to ask the questions that need to be asked and to get necessary expository passages out.And...finallly...there is William Atherton as EPA Agent Walter Peck. I kind of feel sorry for this actor, for he had a decent career going up to Ghostbusters, but he was so good as the annoying, buzzkill \"anti-Ghostbuster\" that serves as the foil for their antics, that he wasn't really accepted in any other kind of role the rest of his career (he would play a version of this character in the first 2 DIE HARD films).The special effects hold up, just enough to make them passable. Keep in mind that this film was made over 35 years ago and the effects were state of the art back in the day, so I would recommend you cut that some slack.And...if you do...you'll be rewarded with a rollicking fun time at the movies.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",

            "content": "Poor New York Public Library. The big famous Schwartzman building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue has been plagued by floods, mutants living in the bowels underneath the city and gang members of the future, not to mention in real life, the oldest book on the world, snooty librarians and over diligent security guards. But long before it became a sanctuary from the eye of the storm in \"The Day After Tomorrow\", it was the home of some really spooky ghosts, maybe not living inside one of the lions like Ted Ross in \"The Wiz\", but present none the less. A huge blockbuster when first released, it was a triumph for \"Saturday Night Live\" veterans Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd, along with Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as the team of spook hunters, Sigourney Weaver as their first client, Rick Moranis as her pesky next door neighbor, and Annie Potts as their wisecracking Eve Arden like secretary. Weaver gets a glamorous role that is a total contrast to her character in \"Alien\", utilizing sly and subtle comedy as she deals with trained comics who obviously showed her a thing or two.While everyone is great, Murray is the major scene stealer, and it's easy to see why for a while, he was one of the most sought after actors in films. \" He slimed me\" couldn't be funnier coming from anybody else. Ackroyd does a variety of his familiar Saturday Night Live characterizations, but Murray has a way of delivering lines that has a greater impact. Ramis, a funny guy in his own right, plays the role completely straight, but it's insinuated that something's going on between him and the cynical Potts.Along with that bouncy title song and vintage New York location shots, there are some terrific special effects and some amusing references to social trends of the time. Back in 1984, if you weren't entering Indiana Jones' temple of doom or warning Zach Galligan about \"Bright light, bright light\", you were shoutin' \"I ain't afraid of no ghost!\" A sequel wasn't horrible, but a recent ripoff of the original was justifiably criticized. This was original in every way, and no modern update could improve on that. Calling \"Remake Busters!\"",

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters,\" is considered to be one of the greatest sci fi comedies of all time, and it has endured by many generations as they had grew up with this movie and still cherish it til this day. This movie was definetly a childhood of mine, as I watched this on an old VHS that was recorded on TV before having an actual copy of the movie; then it came to DVD, and now we have Blu Ray. Now I'm an adult, the question is: does it hold up? Well, here is my review. The movie is about these three scientist: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler as they all got fired from the university, so now all they have left is to start a business of their own by catching ghosts. Furthermore, we have Dana Barrett, who has a ghost problem as the building she lives in is being taken over by the evil Gozer as her minions known as the Terror Dogs to posses both Dana and her nerdy neighbor Louis Tully as they are about to bring the end of the world. Its up to our heroes to kick some ghost, and to save the world. Its as ridiculous as it may sound, but it works and definetly well executed. The movie's screenplay is written cleverly by both Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis, and they both have given great performances. Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddemore, doesn't show up into the second half of the movie but he does he give a good performance too. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are both excellent for the roles they were given to play. Annie Potts does fine for playing the secretary. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, as you really love to hate him. The villain Gozer is definetly a real threat, and really has a strong presence in this movie. As for Bill Murray, he is the man! He really steals the show, and his lines of dialogue are outstanding. Speaking of dialogue, the movie is definetly quotable for such great lines like \"Nice shootin' Tex,\" \"Nobody steps on a church in my town,\" \"He slimed me,\" and of course \"Back off man, I'm a scientist.\" The movie itself is really funny, and all thanks to its cast as they know how to make the comedy work. Even Ivan Reitman's direction is really well done as he balance it really well for mixing both the comedy and horror elements into the movie. The movie does go at a very good pacing as it feels tighter, and doesn't drag too long. The ghosts in this movie are memorable as you have Slimer, Gozer, Terror Dogs, Librarian Ghost, Stay Puft, as well as the Dream Ghost which I'll get to. The gadgets as everyone remembers the PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, Ecto Goggles, and the Proton Packs. Cannot forget the Ectomobile! Elmer Bernstein's music is definetly one of his greatest scores, and does have a great soundtrack such as the theme song by Ray Parker Jr., \"Cleanin' Up The Town,\" \"Magic,\" and \"Savin' the Day.\" The special effects may have some bad ones that don't age well, but for the most part, they are really good as this was all done practically without any use of CG at all. That is minor issue, but the major issue, which I am not a fan of is that dream scene where Ray has sex with a female ghost. I thought it was totally out of place, and should've been left on the cutting room floor. That is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless, \"Ghostbusters,\" is still a classic as it is funny, exciting, suspenseful, creative, and has a good heart. I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10!",

It is a movie that is suitable for the entire family. Yes, it has something for everybody.There is no need to go into details about the story for \"Ghost Busters\" as it is a story that everyone with an interest in movies is familiar with, and if you aren't familiar with it, shame on you, I guess you have been hiding under a rock somewhere.Effect-wise then \"Ghost Busters\" is okay for a movie from 1984, and it most definitely was state of the art and visually impressive back in the day. Yes, certain effects are quite fake and poor by todays standards, but you bear with it because this is a movie driven by a solid story and a rich character gallery. And while not a main character, the ghost Slimer will always be remembered fondly when talking about \"Ghost Busters\".The acting is good, and there is a good ensemble of talents on the cast list. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson will always be the original Ghost Busters. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis were likewise good and memorable in their individual roles.\"Ghost Busters\" is an enjoyable movie that you can watch again and again, just don't cross the streams.",

            "content": "When I was about 3 and 4, I used to watch \"The Real Ghostbusters\" on TV. When I was 7, I noticed that my parents had a video tape that said \"Ghostbusters\". I asked them if I could watch it, and they said yes.The first thing that threw me off was that it was black and white. Moreover, it was clearly not a cartoon. The lion statue outside the library probably confused me further. Then, after the woman saw the ghost in the library basement, I could only interpret the movie as scary. Literally every scene invoked fear in me, especially the monster in the refrigerator. By the time that it was over, I thought to myself \"I'm never watching that again.\" Then, when I was 9, my mom convinced me to give it a second chance. So, I watched \"Ghostbusters\" again, and I laughed my head off. I felt so idiotic for having gotten scared by something so hilarious. As everyone knows, the story has Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) battling spooks in New York, and they have to go up against an ancient evil god. Among the supporting characters, one finds musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and dorky Louis Tully (Rick Moranis).Probably what embarrassed me the most about getting scared by \"Ghostbusters\" was the fact that I didn't even interpret Louis Tully and his mishaps. The first time that I watched the movie, I literally did not realize that his character was there.Anyway, this is a veritable comedy classic. It was like nothing that had ever come before. With a catchy theme song (that I play every Halloween), this is a movie that's impossible not to like.Oh, and I should probably explain the \"black and white\" part. When my parents taped \"Ghostbusters\" off of the TV, it was in color on the TV but it came out black and white on the tape. My parents have never been able to figure that out, so their only explanation is that the tape was haunted. If so, then this was the perfect movie to record onto it.",

            "content": "A trio of misfit parapsychologists set up business as Ghostbusters. Ideal really because although slow at first, their business starts to boom as New York comes under threat from a supernatural force.Dan Aykroyd had this idea about space Ghostbusters in the future and the plan was to have himself and fellow Blues Brother, John Belushi, star in it. Pitching it to producer and director Ivan Reitman saw the basic concept retained but eventually it became what we now know as Ghostbusters. Co-written with Harold Ramis {also a co-star}, Aykroyd's genesis turned not only into a \"monster\" smash it at the box office, but also into a pop-cultural \"phenomenon\". In fact it actually is nice to re-visit the film these days without the public euphoria that swamped the movie for what seemed like a decade. T-shirts with the Ghostbusters logo on were everywhere, a telephone number if you rang it would have the Busters on answer phone, whilst the title song from Ray Parker Jr could be heard on the hour every hour on the radio. Even the catch phrase of \"who ya gonna call?\" was being used by the young, the old and the restless. Marketing genius or cynical tactics covering a sub-standard film?Well ultimately the film is really rather ace, it has some problems for sure {the effects were bad back then, never mind now and Ernie Hudson a token addition to the team} but it's razor sharp with its wit and has a mass appeal to people of all ages. It's a basic odd ball's to the rescue plot, but the differing characterisations and comedy lift it considerably higher than similarly themed films that had come prior to it. That it boasts a bigger budget and Bill Murray of course helps the cause. Murray was brought in after Belushi had left the mortal coil, and promptly owns the film. His Dr Venkmen is a fusion of sarcasm, biting one liners and sees science as a way of getting girls. All of which blends mirthfully with the polar opposites that are Aykroyd's Stanz and Ramis' Spengler. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen as the soon to be possessed, and chased by Venkmen, Dana Barrett and Rick Moranis does meek goof-ball supreme as Louis Tully. There's also value to be found in the script courtesy of some political nudging as the mayor is aware of vote power, while the human element badness and cynicism comes from William Atherton's {suitably weasel like} stiff suit Walter Peck.Given its success {it made a worldwide profit of almost $262 million} a sequel was inevitable. Amiable enough as it was, it was a pale shadow the first film and even recycled the ending. So stick with this bad boy then, a fun film for all that serves as a reminder of when the world went Ghostbuster barmy. 8/10",

            "content": "Ghostbusters (1984) **** (out of 4) Classic comedy about three parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis) who set up a business where they trap ghosts. Soon New York City is overrun with various ghouls and goblins as Judgement Day might be coming and it's up to the group to try and stop it. GHOSTBUSTERS was made as a summer blockbuster but it went way beyond your typical blockbuster style and ended up becoming one of the greatest comedies ever made. It could be argued that the cast and director were never better in their careers and that all of them were at the top of their game while making this picture. I think a great deal of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which mixes in the special effects with some very sly dialogue that really makes you believe everything you're seeing. The paranormal aspects of the story are so well done that you can easily accept what's going on and this here takes care of the adventure side of the story. The screenplay really goes all out when it comes to the comedy as we get one non-stop laugh after another because the dialogue always has our characters winking at the viewer and especially the character played by Murray. While all of the performances are great it's clearly Murray's show as he works wonders with the womanizer who has a smart reply to anything going on. Seeing Murray work the dialogue the way he does and the way he brings humor to his part is something truly remarkable to watch because he makes it seem so easy. Both Aykroyd and Ramis are also at the top of their game and the trio really do work extremely well together and in the end they could be called one of the most memorable comedies teams in the history of cinema. Even the smaller roles are played to perfection with Sigourney Weaver as one of the clients, Rick Moranis as her nerdy neighbor, Annie Potts as the wise-cracking receptionist and Ernie Hudson as the fourth worker. THe special effects hold up extremely well today even when you compare them to the recent CGI trend. Just take a look at Slimer to see how perfect the visual effects are but it's also important that these creatures are so memorable as they also add an additional bit of life to the film. Slimer is in the movie just a matter of minutes and yet he too became rather legendary in his own right. GHOSTBUSTERS is about as flawless as a comedy can get as we get pretty much everything you'd want in a picture like this. There have been many films to come along since but none of them have contained the amount of magic, charm and just all out fun as what you get.",

There are plenty of funny parts, but they are overshadowed by parts of ridiculous (yet remarkable) effects which showcase ghosts of plenty. But thanks to great writing, great directing (Ivan reitman), and great acting, this film gets to be a great example of comedy in it's finest form and It's one of the best films of the 80's as well.",

Laughing at an unwilling comedy vehicle also gives to ones doing the laughing a sense of superiority, tickling the satisfaction centers in our brain.This is not the way Ghost Busters work.

The humanity of all characters present is both endearing and an endless supply of laughter.But what makes Ghost Busters a classic is the fact it doesn't stop here. The story is exciting, with a real sense of adventure.

            "content": "My belated visit to the 80s classic ultra-popular American supernatural comedy directed by Ivan Reitman, indisputably his most successful directorial work to date, the Hollywood veteran is now in the inevitable course of being eclipsed by his son Jason Reitman, who is already a two-times Oscar-nominated director (JUNO 2007, 8/10 and UP IN THE AIR 2009, 7/10). The film stars Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as a trio of nerdy parapsychologists in New York, after being dismissed by the university, they initiate a service knows as Ghostbusters to deal with the more and more frequent paranormal activities in the city, things then trace back to Gozer, a Sumerian amorphous god of destruction, who is going to wreck havoc on the city, with the aids of its two servants, Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster, two ferocious dog- shaped demigods.The core trio (later joined by Ernie Hudson as the fourth member to appear politically corrected) predates the current trend of brain-is-the-new-sexy, Peter Venkman (Murray) more or less is a philanderer and particularly disarming in his aloof attitude to the gravitas of their cause. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) has a more guileless mindset, a man-boy hybrid will lovably bring about a beast of a giant marshmallow man. Egon Spengler (the late Ramis) is the geek among geeks, a stern-looking scientists with fully-functional apparatus to bust some ghosts. Peter's new love interest is Dana (Weaver), their first client soon to be possessed by Zuul, so is her neighbor Louis Tully (Moranis), as the receptacle of the Keymaster. The special effects are very much 1980s, but they are also the brainchild of a genuinely extraordinary creation, massively uproarious in its pokerface seriousness (not to mention its contagious theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The wacky script written by Aykroyd and Hamis is the mainstay of its distinctiveness, Murray's iconic personification of his on-screen image is droll to watch, Weaver is beguilingly titillating after the possession and Moranis's loquacious improvisation slightly overstays its welcome, but appropriately dovetails itself into the demigod.Very rarely a comedy can blend well with its spectral fodder and family-friendly closeness, GHOSTBUSTERS is far from being a perfectly executed masterpiece, or a cutting-edge cinematic pioneer, but its common-or-garden stance effectively boosts the \"everyone can be a hero\" message, no wonder it has been an enormous crowd-pleaser and bred into a beloved franchise since the inception. I may skip its 1989 sequel but a long-delayed third installment doesn't seem to a bad idea at all, or the latest rumor is the BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10) helmer Paul Feig is eying for an all-female reboot, it sounds much more enticing, Bill Murray even gives his own suggestion of the casting, see here",

However one of their customers is reporting something about Gorzer and the group realise that she may be the focus of a bigger supernatural phenomenon.Everyone who saw this when it came out will have fond memories of it \u0096 be it the comedy, the `great' effects or just the cheesy wonderful theme song.  It was a great blockbuster at the time but it hasn't dated that well in some respects.  However overall it is still fun to watch.  The plot is average at best but allows for plenty of comedy and action \u0096 which is all you want really isn't it?The bits that have dated are naturally the effects \u0096 the beastly dogs are pretty ropy to say the least but are forgivable.  This is more than made up for by the energy it has and the comedy.  The film is simply fun to watch \u0096 it may not be a classic but it is enjoyable and will make you smile.  Most of this is due to Murray (who replaced Belushi who the role was meant for). Murray has all the best lines and has the most fun character.  Aykroyd is a close second but Ramis is much better behind the camera.Support from Weaver, Moranis, Potts and Atherton are all good and the ghosts are enjoyable if a bit dodgy. Poor Hudson looks as out of place at times as he apparently felt.  He isn't part of the trio and strugged off-screen to fit in, while onscreen his distance is evident with him slightly off to the side on many occasions.Overall many remember it to be better than it is because we saw it as children.  Revisiting it as an adult may bruise those memories but I was relived to find that it was still very enjoyable to watch despite being a bit more superficial than I noticed back in 84!",

The thing is too, that I usually bypass most popular culture from the 80's (the decade that taste forgot), for instance I've never watched \"Ghost\", \"Dirty Dancing\", \"Top Gun\" or \"E.T.\" and won't be rushing to in the near future, there are far too many earlier movies I've still to see. But hey, I really enjoyed this unusual mix of frat comedy and supernatural / science fiction thrills.I liked the three amigo scientists right away, the womanising Bill Murray, earnest Dan Ayckroyd and professorial Ivan Reitman. Sigourney Weaver adds the sexiness (eventually) and Rick Moranis outdoes the three busters in geekiness as Weaver's lovelorn neighbour. The natural landscape of New York is effectively blended in, the special effects are fine for their day and the script delivers excitement and humour in equal measure.Not every idea from the Saturday Night Live team hit the jackpot but this one certainly deserved to, helped by an offbeat idea with broad appeal, a good script and a nice story arc which not only delivers a big finish but also sees Murray get the girl.Call again!",

            "content": "'Ghostbusters' is a movie that for a long time I had intention of watching but never truly felt like watching. Being a huge fan of the website Flickchart.com, I was more than surprised yet my initial response was, \"What the heck, why is it 24th best of all time?\" so I decided that I had to see this movie just to see whether its overrated or not, whether it's good or not, whether I'd enjoy it or not.The main premise to 'Ghostbusters' is quite simple but the film is surprisingly a bit more than just a basic simplistic story. So, we have our three main characters: Peter, Raymond and Spengler who after losing their jobs believe it is time to open their own business called 'Ghostbusters', a service that is available to catch any ghosts reported by anyone. However, a bunch of crazy events that happen throughout the course of the play really change the plot drastically. First of all, the characters in the film are great. Our main trio are great as is Sigourney Weaver's Dana. The acting in this film is undeniably great with Bill Murray again being fantastic at what he does best- making us laugh! The story is definitely one to enjoy and I'm grateful that the plot really turns on your head in this film. The film is well directed with a rather good mix between humor and seriousness. The writing is great and the dialogue is funny however I just find myself rather bored throughout certain parts of the film. It is hard to believe why I'd be bored at certain parts of the film when there is great humor, great characters and a story but the pacing feels weird and the plot that turns on its head doesn't become as enjoyable. As the plot turns on its head, I found the comedy to really disappear and that certainly disappointed me. Going into the movie, I had no real high expectations, nor low ones but rather medium levelled expectations and this film doesn't completely deliver. A film that contains as much comedy as this film did early on, loses me in its last act where the plot truly turns on its head and the comedy begins to disappear. A great first two acts followed by a rather disappointing third act make 'Ghostbusters' a mediocre movie that I find, truly horribly overrated. 24th best film ever, according to Flickchart!?!?

            "content": "While the three pseudo-scientists of \"Ghostbusters\" occupy themselves professionally with the paranormal, their sexual desires likewise are abnormally characterized by paraphilic tendencies. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) takes joy in the sadistic torment of other men, which ordinarily is limited to mere sardonic remarks and poking fun at supposedly less masculine men for their nasal congestion, short height, or what have you, but at its most violent also manifests in his electric-shocking of a male test subject in an experiment of which the validity Venkman jeopardizes in the pursuit of his perverse pleasures. Perhaps, ashamed of his own desires, he also makes excessive displays of his supposed heterosexuality, including flirting with the female test subject and later aggressively, if clownishly, making passes at Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver).Meanwhile, Ray's (Dan Aykroyd) paraphilia extends to a complete displacement of other people as the source of sexual attraction; instead, his spectrophilia appears as a dream where a female ghost signifies further sexual displacement by disappearing before performing fellatio on him. Later, his fantasizing of another non-human humanoid object is made real in the form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a figure from his childhood, which is the time when all of those Freudian quacks like to locate the origins of sexual feelings. And, of course, there's the obviously-symbolic pole he's so enthusiastic about in their repurposing of an old fire station. Egon, on the other hand, seems to be entirely consumed in his pseudo-scientific pursuits, even seeming to not react in the least to the advances of the Ghostbusters' receptionist Janine (Annie Potts). Rather than being asexual, his interests are displaced in the phallic guns or wands of the Ghostbusters' \"proton packs,\" which they employ to ejaculate energy streams, trapping gooey ectoplasmic matter into a shared box. Perhaps, like Peter, Egon also fears his homoerotic tendencies, though, and insists that the men avoid crossing streams.But, of course, crossing their streams is what the entire male-bonding narrative is building up to. Being the 1980s, this includes the homophobic government, in the form of the \"dick-less\" EPA man, butting in, protesting the Ghostbusters' pollution of ejaculating streams and captured slime and even the propagandic effect their activities have upon society. This backfires, however, unleashing the latent desires the Ghostbusters themselves feared and contained in the \"closet\"--the unleashing of them taking the form of flamboyant streams of light and sparkling stars in a rainbow of colors spreading throughout the city. The Catholic mayor's kissing of the Archbishop's ring and turning to him for approval/guidance also plays into the unleashing of the Ghostbusters' phallic powers, but I'm not going to look into that plot point any deeper than that. Now, freed from the closet, so to speak, and after a stint in jail, the Ghostbusters' antagonist takes the form of Old-Testament Biblical proportions in the form of a heterosexually-coded coupling of ghosts: the \"Keymaster\" (read \"male\") and the \"Gatekeeper\" (read \"female\"). And reigning supreme is the god Gozer, who takes the shape of the Ghostbusters' gendered \"other,\" a woman. The men's triumph is in defeating this ghastly heterosexual and female gendered possession of their city.After the men cross streams, resulting in the explosion of white goop from Ray's latent childhood desires pouring over them, the three doctors quickly resort to their prior postures of homoerotic denial: Peter to the rescue of the damsel-in-distress Dana, and Egon and Ray to the safer confines of the short and daft male subject Louis (Rick Moranis), for whom Egon quickly remarks on his desire to perform pseudo-scientific tests upon. The fourth Ghostbuster, Winston (Ernie Hudson), however, the only normal man among them and who, presumably, has a healthy sexual attitude, proclaims with pride, while covered in goo, \"I love this town!\"This makes me rethink what may be underlying the outcry over the casting of women in the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, of what is one of the most, let's say, male-centric of classic comedies. Or... \"Ghostbusters\" is just a silly comedy with the best zingers coming from Bill Murray, a catchy soundtrack and a production design and dated visual effects that remain charming.",

If that sounds like a criticism, it really isn't. They were all fine in \"Ghostbusters.\" It's just that I think their better performances were ahead of them. The one exception might be Moranis, who I mentioned earlier. He is very funny here as the geeky accountant Louis Tully, who is infatuated with Weaver's Dana Barrett, but is also frustrated that she doesn't return his feelings, until, of course, the two get together in the spirit world. Moranis, I think, did some of his best work here. Unfortunately, it was in a limited role.It's a pleasant movie to watch and there's nothing particularly wrong with it.

But a wittier script by Bill Murray would have helped. In other words, I can take it or leave it--that's exactly how I felt when this comedy was over. Sure, there were some fun moments with Rick Moranis as a nosy neighbor and I'll admit Murray and Dan Ackroyd have some good one-liners. Then too, Sigourney Weaver is amusing as the gal with a fridge from hell, but by the time the overlong story got to its mindblowing conclusion, I was longing for \"The End\" to appear on the screen.Not my cup of tea as comedies go. Best moments were when the ghosts were on the loose and things got a little unpredictable toward the conclusion. But what happened in between these ghostly apparitions left a lot to be desired.",

I saw this film multiple times in my childhood and recently caught it again at a special event showing at my local theater. The original film has a great mixture of comedy and goofy spooks to make it the classic that is still enjoyable to watch today.After a brief ghost sighting, the film introduces Bill Murray's cocky and flirtatious Dr. Peter Venkman. Running wild in the psychology department, Venkman doesn't take his job serious but his fellow professors Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Together they investigate the paranormal sightings only to find themselves cast out of their college and in need of starting their own private business.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

When they get kicked out of university, they start a business to fight ghosts.Bill Murray is at his sarcastic best. The guys' chemistry is superb. The three guys fit each other perfectly. Murray is the loud mouth. Ramis is the nerdy brain. And Aykroyd is the nice guy to glue everybody together. On top of the three leads, they have Sigourney Weaver who is a viable partner for Murray to spar with. She's not just a dumb hottie.

Three out-of-work, oddball scientists found a company that gets rid of ghosts from haunted places.

Bill Murray is one of the ghostbusters and his character is unusual for a scientist; he appears bored throughout the movie, when he is chasing ghosts or courting the Sigourney Weaver character. Weaver herself is brilliant as both the cynic and the temptress, before and after she is possessed respectively. All the supporting characters are memorable. They all have their own weird personalities. Heck, even the ghosts, big or small, cute or fierce, have personalities. Top it up with some witty dialog and you have a thoroughly enjoyable film.",

            "content": "Growing up as a small kid in the early and mid 80's I remember when this film came out and the crazy feel and fever it started. It had everyone going around saying in 1984 \"Who you gonna Call\"? \"Ghostbusters\"! And clearly without a doubt 1984's \"Ghostbusters\" was one of the most memorable and better known films of the 1980's, as it's a sci-fi comedy that's feel good and well remembered. As it was well written with smarts and wit still the funny one liners and comedic parts are often overshadowed by the well remembered ghosts(green ghost slimmer) and monsters(the stay puff marshmallow man) of the film.Also well directed by Ivan Reitman the plot is pretty good as it is set in New York City and it features three college professors of parapsychology named Dr. Venkman(Bill Murray)Dr. Stanz(Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Spengler(Harold Ramis)who all of a sudden find themselves out of a job as the university starts to downsize as they have cut their study department due to lack of interest and the mid 80's recession of the bad economy. Yet never fear an ideal has sprung to mind just like it did with all great minds from Einstein to Gallo, and Pluto the trio decide to open up a business and go the entrepreneurial route as they specialize in everything from chasing ghosts and unappetizing apparitions. Also a good supporting role is given from the elegant and classy Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barret a single woman who even discovers her apartment's refrigerator door has became the door for the gates of hell! And thru the film it's interesting and memorable with funny one liners and chase scenes of strange ghost, yet thru it all the \"Ghostbusters\" will conquer all of New York City from the ghastly ghost and make it safe again in this very funny haunting action comedy. Well remembered film at a time that features the comedy trio of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis in their prime and in top form and the lovable and cute ghost like green slimmer and stay puff are very memorable images of joy and fun. Overall one of the better feel good comedy films of the 80's a real treat.",

            "content": "Like my review of Footloose, this is a classic, everyone has seen it, everyone loves it. It's one of those movies that came from your childhood and lasts well into the adult manboy years.So, we're going to do a comparison with the remake.For starters..the Ghostbusters plays it straight. The comedy is presented like a drama and that is usually the absolute best way to do comedy...straight.And conversely the remake is just sort of over the top. And when comedies try that hard to be comedies, they stop being funny.Another part would be scene length. And again, playing it straight, the opening of 1984 is short and honestly kind of scary......when the remake drags on and deals with characters that honestly have nothing else to do with the film but introduce it. You lose interest sort of fast.And this can be seen again with the humor. The introduction of the car in the remake is prime example. Pulls up with a hearse, someone makes a joke about checking to see if there is a body in there.......the scene SHOULD stop when they look at the hearse and cut away to a different scene. But the remake drags on and the joke loses momentum and falls flat when it COULD have been an easy laugh.Conversely in 1984 you have jokes like the Twinkie that ends with \"tell him about the Twinkie\" and it is funny because it doesn't drag on in an effort to be funny. The same can be said about testing the proton packs, the joke ends fast enough for it to actually be funny.And then there is the script and direction, the 1984 version stuck to it and made sure everything was tight, even when it was improvised, it wasn't allowed to get out of control.But the remake the actors took control and the improvisation went on too long, even with scenes being cut.So what you have is a tight and fast film that is a comedy played straight like it should be...and one that everyone knows and loves because of it.",

The movie is all about these men who form a group and of course they go into the business of ghost busting together. The writing is very comical, it's really not the best comedy in the world, but parts of it are funny. To be honest, I like this movie mainly because of the cast, big Sigourney Weaver fan. The effects were good for the time, now they'd kinda be lacking. The action scenes are done pretty well and I liked the visuals. The movie is one most people will have fun with, it's just not the greatest thing in the world if I'm being 100% honest.

Can a trio of determined men capture a Class-5 full-roaming vapor without destroying a hotel ballroom? Is \"crossing the streams\" dangerous to one's health?If you are like millions of other people, you already know the answers to these and other questions. A giant comedy smash in its day, \"Ghostbusters\" is still a lot of fun, and perhaps the most successful cinematic showcase for veterans of \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"SCTV.\" While not as hilarious or as scary as its reputation suggests, \"Ghostbusters\" is clever and amusing and goes by fast.The star of the show, Bill Murray, plays Peter Venkman, a university professor we meet playing a shady psychic shell game in order to score some time with a young lovely. When forced to relocate, he and his friends Egon (Harold Ramis) and Ray (Dan Aykroyd) set to work as freelance spook catchers, fortunately for them just as the the Big Apple is about to be swallowed by the gates of hell.\"We could really bust some heads, in a spiritual sense of course,\" Ray notes.The casting really brings out the best in the movie. Sigourney Weaver as the imperiled love interest Dana brings the right snark to her role, comparing Venkman to a \"game show host\" with a withering stare as he attempts (hilariously) to put the moves on her. Rick Moranis, like Ramis from \"SCTV\", is a nerdy accountant who chases after Dana like a dog, then as a dog. He throws tax-deductible parties, then brags to his guests: \"I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense...that's why I invited clients instead of friends.\" And then there's William Atherton's nasty EPA official Walter Peck, sneering wonderfully at it all.As a fan of the old \"Saturday Night Live\", I guess I wanted more chemistry from the classic SNL cornerstones here, Murray and Aykroyd. Instead, Aykroyd doesn't do much to establish himself. Even though he concepted and wrote the film, his character is even less interesting than the fourth Ghostbuster, recruit Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), who is a bit of a bystander in this film though he does have one great line. \"If someone asks you if you're a god, you say 'Yes'!\"Murray of course gets all the best lines, delivered in his signature deadpan style, like \"Back off, man, I'm a scientist\" or \"Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.\" Director Ivan Reitman leaves Murray plenty of space in-between the special effects to establish a \"Ghostbusters\" voice; even if to me it seems at times more of a collection of catch phrases, I see Reitman giving the film enough shape and subtlety to make those catch phrases click.Yes, the effects are dated, and there are odd moments that don't connect (Ray being seduced out of nowhere by a ghost, for example). Still, \"Ghostbusters\" is a smart genre-bender with the ability to fly through generations like that Slimer ghost goes through walls.",

Annie Potts plays the over worked secretary, Ernie Hudson the hired fourth Ghostbuster and William Atherton is the thorn in the side from the Environmental Protection Agency.Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have written the screenplay which is quite sharp in both the freshness of the idea and the execution of the plot. The jaunty momentum and bright comedy is prevalent throughout. Visually we are treated to some attention grabbing special f/x which dominate the \"Ghostbusters\" encounters with the spooks.

It was comedy with special effects, and \"Ghostbusters\" works for the most part.Yes, the effects are a bit cheesy. Maybe they're meant to be that way, and it's got an innocent feel to it. The ultimate monster is a marshmallow man that will destroy civilization as we know it. One's worst fate is to be slimed or turned into a dog, and it's a lot of fun most of the time, but it could have used more Bill Murray and more editing to give us a better experience.Most of the joy is seeing all that talent in the screen. Bill Murray's dry approach is just a delight. Everything from his one-liners, his gestures, and his exchanges with Sigourney Weaver who is truly a sport while sparring with him, growing to like him as the film progresses, and Rick Moranis plays his nerdy part so well, it's hard not to start laughing every time he jumps in the scene. Everyone else does well, but the three standouts are the ones mentioned before.NYC is threatened by a surge in supernatural activity, and soon references such as the key master are thrown around.

            "content": "What a movie! What an original, goofy, side-splitting movie! Ghostbusters is one of those projects were everything just came together. Somebody had an idea, somebody else believed in it, all the right people got involved, and everything just flowed, producing an instant classic and a landmark of popular culture. From one idea that Dan Akroyd worked on in his spare time came on of mid eighties' best pictures, and perhaps the best horror-comedy since the days of Abbot and Costello.That idea of course, is 'What if there really were ghosts? And what if there were people who made a living catching them?' And the screenplay has a lot of fun with that idea, treating it like real life, down to advertising blitz and regulatory headaches. Yet at the same time it embraces the more fantastic aspects of the story, playing up hauntings, possessions, and the apocalypse to great comedic effect. There's a real blending of the supernatural and the mundane that you don't see a lot, certainly not with such hilarious results.Equally important is the superb casting. Every actor and actress is perfect for his/her role, which is not surprising considering that some of the roles were written for them. Akroyd, as the co-writer, created for himself a role that plays wonderfully to his natural talents. In real life, he's a smart, earnest, kind off nerdy guy, so naturally it follows that he should be an overly-excitable, somewhat gullible nerd who pours himself into his work. Harold Ramis is brilliant as Egon, the straight faced dry intellectual, and Ernie Hudson brings a real down to earth likability to Winston. Sigourney Weaver shows that she definitely has what it takes to play comedies; I have no idea how she managed to keep from cracking up during the 'possessed' scenes.But it's Bill Murray who really steals the show. One if Murray's greatest strengths as an actor is his shiftiness, his blatant insincerity, and as a result he's at his best when playing the schemer, the con man. And Peter Venkman is just such a man. He's a fraud, a charlatan who makes his living studying things he doesn't even believe in- and a shameless womanizer to boot. His chemistry with Weaver is priceless, and throughout he maintains the comedic balancing act that he does so well; never flat or deadpan, but never quite over the top. It's really his character driving this whole enterprise, even if he has no idea what he's doing.There are some good action sequences here, and a handful of truly scary parts, like the now-famous librarian. I especially love the ending, with what is surely the funniest giant monster ever created- nice going, Ray. The special effects are generally pretty good for 1985, and even when they aren't it only adds to the movie's goofy feel.Ghostbusters is also one the most quotable pictures since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There are plenty of instantly recognizable one-liners, like \"He slimed me\" and \"Back off man, I'm a scientist,\" and some wonderfully tongue in cheek speeches, like the famous 'Twinkie speech,' or the one early on that begins with \"Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma.\" It's hard to pick just one, but I would have to say that my favorite line is \"\"Man, the superintendent is gonna be pi**ed!\" And the dialog works even when being 100% serious. The conversation between Ray and Winston about the book of Revelation is a minor masterpiece in its own right.What else is there to say about this movie? It's got a wonderful score by Elmer Bernstein, and a killer theme song by Ray Parker Junior that actually went to number one on the singles charts. There are gorgeous views of New York City and a double serving of Big Apple attitude. Any way you look at it, this is a great production with everything done right from beginning to end.

            "content": "The 80s were a good time for movies with ridiculous and zany storylines. For whatever reason, that decade had a ton of films that were simply not meant to be taken very seriously. This made them arguably more popular in the eyes of the public because an original and memorable concept will stick with you, no matter how absurd it is. A movie that illustrates this point very well is Ghostbusters, which believe it or not, I have actually never seen up until last sunday. It's widely considered one of those movies that is so well known that if you haven't seen it, people think there's something wrong with you. Finally, I can put this behind me and talk about it. This a film that is a highly original combination of comedy, supernatural events, and even some minor religious aspects which aren't immediately visible. The movie starts with a librarian getting snuck up on by some mysterious ectoplasmic being while in the New York public library in Manhattan. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) is busy studying supernatural phenomena in college and takes his two friends, Egon and Ray, along with him to investigate this encounter. The college later expels the three men because they're not convinced their work in this field will amount to anything. After leaving the university, Peter establishes \"Ghostbusters\", a self-proclaimed \"anti-paranormal\" service for hire that specializes in getting rid of any unwanted ghost related encounters. Their initial headquarters is located in an abandoned and rundown firehouse, and soon, they're called into action. The ghostbusters receive a call from a nearby woman named Dana (Sigourney Weaver) who lives in an apartment. She has apparently seen a truly terrifying sight in her refrigerator, which she describes as a large, dog-like creature with horns that was able to say something which sounded like \"zuul.\" Venkman rushes over to Dana's place to try and get a look at this bizarre entity, but by the time he shows up the creature is gone. Later, Peter leads his men on a mission to a hotel in order to remove a ghost the manager has been complaining about, but it dawns on them that all of their equipment is uncalibrated. Egon, the stereotypical nerd of the group, tells his friends to make sure the light beams of their nuclear accelerators never make contact with each other, or else every molecule in their bodies will explode. The ghostbusters do manage to trap the ghost, but not before they turn the hotel's dining hall upside down in the process. Soon, there are more paranormal events being recorded all over the eastern seaboard, and the group receives more attention (and money) than ever before. A newcomer named Winston joins the team in order to help even the odds. Meanwhile, an investigator named Walter is starting to feel the ghostbusters are biting off more than they can chew, so he persuades the federal government to get involved in their activities in order to make sure their inherently unstable equipment doesn't create a giant crater in place of New York City. Unfortunately for the team, their storage unit in the firehouse that is used to incarcerate captured ghosts is reaching its breaking point, and paranormal reports continue to rise. The next time Peter goes to visit Dana, he finds her possessed by the dog-like being that was spying on her earlier. Most of what she says in this brainwashed state is incomprehensible, but she does mention she is the \"gatekeeper.\" The spirit of an identical creature has also infested Louis, Dana's neighbor. Like Dana, his only intelligible line of dialogue is how he only exists to serve Gozer, an ancient Sumerian god that Peter was telling Dana about before. Louis says how he is Gozer's \"keymaster\", and now all of a sudden it makes sense why he and Dana must come together to reunite the \"gate\" with its \"key.\" Shortly after, Walter's patience finally runs out and he arrives back at the firehouse with a warrant claiming he has full authority to seize control of any and all materials directly related to this illegal program, and the NYPD permits his decision. After forcing Peter to shut the ghost storage unit without the proper procedure, all the ghosts that are contained in there are spewed out. The team is imprisoned, but later released on the pretense of being necessary to fight Gozer. The ghostbusters make their way to the roof of a tall apartment complex and see Dana and Louis transform into the same satanic dogs shown earlier. After Gozer appears, the team tries to blast him with their proton beams, but he disappears. He then returns in the form of an enormous marshmallow man that is too big to be damaged by conventional weapons. Even though he instructed not to, Egon says crossing their energy beams is their only chance at stopping him. The move works, and Gozer is closed out of earth's plane of existence. Dana and Louis are then rescued, and a grateful NYC praises the ghostbusters. Before seeing this, I really didn't think it would be this complicated. Don't get me wrong, it still is a mostly simplistic movie when you get down to it, but adding in the whole plot device that involves Sumerian mythology really complicated things. I thought Ghostbusters was just going to be about 3 (eventually 4 guys) going around blasting ghosts, which would have made an entertaining enough movie, but it's a good thing they decided against this. As you might expect, there's a lot of funny moments in the movie, with Murray's performance as Venkman often being singled out for huge amounts of praise. You can't have him without the other 3, though. The special effects here look a little bit dated by modern standards but still manage to hold up, and they legitimately scared me more than once. Interestingly, the firehouse the team uses as a base in the film has a ghostbusters logo inside of it to this day, which I can't say I'm surprised about. I'm also a fan of the iconic Cadillac Miller Meteor the team uses as their primary mode of transportation. No other car looks like it. To summarize, the original Ghostbusters defines the word blockbuster in every sense. It made a huge sum of money, and 1984's halloween season was completely controlled by ghostbuster costumes, which again is not very surprising. I know this movie has had a lot of spin-offs and sequels, but this one will always remain the classic.",

            "content": "Released in 1984 and directed by Ivan Reitman, \"Ghostbusters\" chronicles events when three former parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis) set up shop in Manhattan as a curious specter removal service. Annie Potts plays their secretary while Ernie Hudson hires on as one of the team. Sigourney Weaver appears as the wannabe girlfriend of one of the ghostbusters (Murray) while Rick Moranis plays her geeky neighbor down the hall. There's always been some confusion about ghosts: Are they the disembodied souls (life forces) of dead people stuck on this plane? Are they 'flashes from the past'? Or are they demons (aka fallen angels or evil spirits) deceiving people into thinking they're 'ghosts'? \"Ghostbusters\" interestingly addresses all three, sort of, which I found interesting. It's an amusing horror comedy with a classic early 80's cast and soundtrack. The F/X are well-done for the time, although quaint today, which I suppose is part of the movie's charm. Yet I think the high ratings are largely due to nostalgia because I wasn't entertained nearly as much as I thought I'd be. \"Men in Black\" (1997) took this prototype and arguably made a better film. Still, \"Ghostbusters\" is a fun, iconic flick and certainly worth checking out if its attributes trip your trigger. The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles with studio stuff done in Burbank, California. The script was written by Aykroyd & Ramis. GRADE: B-/C+ (5.5/10)",

That it was based on Dan Aykroyd's father, who wrote the book A History of Ghosts? That the original script wasn't a comedy?We know all that. What we sometimes forget is that Ghostbusters does something astounding for a film. None of the main characters make the hero's journey. None of them.At the beginning and the end, Ray Stantz (Aykroyd) is still an incredibly smart but simple-minded scientist that at least had a ghost practice the fleshy clarinet for him. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) is still a super-smart geek, albeit one with a super-smart geek girl now (Annie Potts, who makes the most of her small role). Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) is still a smarmy con man, despite potentially winning the heart of the possessed Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). And Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) barely gets a moment to show anything at all.Nobody grows. Nobody changes. Nobody cares, really, because it's all so loud and entertaining and filled with gorgeous practical effects and a montage heavy way of telling a very simple story.Rick Moranis is firing on all gears here and so is William Atherton, who is the absolute king of all movie jerks. Just look at that list of actors - nobody here is slacking at all. This is top of the game casting and that's what helps make this movie great. Hell, it even has Joe Franklin in it!So here are a few facts you may not know, as everyone knows the plot:The demonic voice of Dana/Zuul? That's director Ivan Reitman.Gozer was originally going to be played by Paul Ruebens.For some reason, the video for Ray Parker Jr.'s theme features a bunch of celebrities that have absolutely nothing to do with this movie, including Chevy Chase, Irene Cara, John Candy, Melissa Gilbert, Jeffrey Tambor, George Wendt, Al Franken, Danny DeVito, Carly Simon, Teri Garr and Peter Falk.Aykroyd originally foresaw the movie as a future story where Ghostbusters were as common as firefighters. The script, called Ghost Smashers, would have cost around $300 million in today's money to make.A more ferocious version of the Librarian Puppet was rejected, but it later turned up as Amy Peterson's vampiric form in Fright Night.Amazingly, this movie and Gremlins came out on the same day. Needless to say, 1984 was an amazing year for blockbusters.There's a deleted scene that has Murray show up as Carl Spackler from Caddyshack.I never realized it, but Louis becomes the Keymaster after being locked out three different times in the film.So there you go.

            "content": "I first saw this film in a theater at age twelve way back in 1984. I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it a great deal. I vividly recall the audience roaring with laughter at regular intervals. Well, I rewatched this movie after having not seen it for at least fifteen years and boy did it ever hold up. It's partly because of the witty and ingenious blending of a Lovecraftian the end of the world as beget by ancient and powerful phantasmagoric beings premise with a delightfully broad and playful sense of infectiously irreverent and anarchic humor, partly because the special effects are extremely impressive and accomplished even by today's more sophisticated standards (the gluttonous Slimer in particular is a splendidly disgusting wow!), partly because the movie breezes along at a brisk clip without any dreary lulls, and mainly because it's just so much incredibly off-the-wall absurdist fun.The cast is sheer perfection: Bill Murray lands a plumb part as the lovably smarmy Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd is likewise excellent as the overzealous Dr. Raymond Stantz, Harold Ramis plays it suitably solemn and humorless as the deliciously dour Dr. Egon Spengler, Sigourney Weaver is simply ravishing as fetching musician and appealing love interest Dana Barret (and man is she smoking hot when she becomes possessed by the lascivious spirit of the evil, yet enticing Zuul), Rick Moranis exquisitely nerds it up as hopelessly dweeby accountant Louis Tully, Annie Potts adds considerable spark as sarcastic secretary Janine Melnitz, Ernie Hudson is quite engaging as the easygoing Winston Zeddmore, and William Atherton makes for a marvelously smug foil as obnoxious EPA jerk Walter Peck. Ivan Reitman's deft direction maintains an appropriately zany tone throughout while tossing in plenty of neat throwaway gags and culminating in one rousing doozy of a pull out all the stops crazy apocalyptic climax. Among the choice gut-busting moments are our protagonists attempting to nab a pesky ghost at a library, the Ghostbusters corny TV commercial, our boys' first assignment at a posh New York hotel, Stantz's erotic dream, and the first appearance of a giant deadly marshmallow man. Kudos are also in order for the first-rate rockin' soundtrack, with Mick Smiley's hypnotic \"Magic\" rating as an especially awesome tune. Elmer Bernstein supplies a fantastic spooky and spirited score. Laszlo Kovacs' glossy cinematography makes fine use of the widescreen format. Popping up in nifty bits are Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, \"Playboy\" Playmate Kymberly Herrin, slinky Russian beauty Slavitza Jovan (as Gozer), Deborah Gibson, and even notorious porn star Ron Jeremy. But what really clinches this picture's status as an all-time classic 80's winner is its exceptionally inspired and energetic sense of blithely ridiculous merriment. A total treat.",

He was so obliviously nerdy it was hilarious. Added to that was his puppy dog attraction to the more suave and sophisticated Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) which made his character even more likable.

The humour is all in the wisecracks, but not one of them is memorable or (in itself) funny or in any way witty.  If we are fooled into thinking otherwise, it's due to Bill Murray.  It happens in every film he appears in (that is, those that aren't antecedently funny).  His character is cynical in the most innocent way, his delivery is impeccable, we really want his words to be amusing as well - so much so that we're prepared to pretend.The premise of \"Ghostbusters\" is cool, too.  We want to be transported into a world in which there are ghostbusters of this kind, so much so that we're prepared to overlook the fact that we're watching fumbled comedy rather than successful fantasy.  Again, Bill Murray helps.  His I'm-game-for-anything character is the only one who seems to belong.Surprisingly good is Elmer Bernstein's score.

Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and the whole cast, but especially Murray, give highly amusing performances under an admittedly impressive (for those days) direction by Ivan Reitman. By now, acting for blue screen and managing multiple locations in the form of sound stages comes with the territory for making a spectacle science fiction fare, but that art we now take for granted wasn't nearly as developed in 1984 and this film does a really good job. Featuring the finest in pre-digital special effects, whose limitations are quite apparent, but that is all part of the fun in watching a classic.Also, of note, is the story, which is quite well thought out and developed for a goofy movie like this.

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" is a 100-minute movie from over 30 years ago and considered a classic by many today. I am not sure if I would go that far, but it was certainly a good watch for the most part. The director is Oscar nominee Ivan Reitman, whose son Jason has followed in his footsteps by now, and the film we got here is certainly the older Reitman's most famous work, especially as the man in charge. The script comes from Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who also play 2 of the major characters. However, those were one of the weaknesses of the film. Maybe it was because Murray was so great, had the best material and stole every scene he was in, but Aykroyd and Ramis looked truly pale compared to him and this film may have been even better with other actors in these roles.Still, I think they did a good job on the writing. Ghost movies are fairly common, but in terms of people in charge of hunting these ghosts, there really isn't that much to pick from and this is certainly the ultimate movie. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis do a lot with the little they are given, but the standout is clearly Murray in his big breakthrough performance (his introduction with the questioning scene involving the guy and girl was already pure gold) and he has been delivering constantly great material in the last 3 decades, especially in terms of comedy, frequently with a dramatic note to it. However, even with the premise of the world about to end, \"Ghostbusters\" is 99% comedy. Nobody dies, the possessed characters turn back to normal, the shooting sequences involve cool futuristic gadgets and the monsters are at least as creative as scary. And of course, there is funny one-liners from start to finish, also a couple unfunny ones, but not too many. The ending is solid, but not the film's biggest strength. I wonder if we will ever get another \"Ghost Busters\" film. With Ramis' death it may not look too likely, but who knows. Until then, I recommend watching this old film here.

In the second half, the movie becomes extremely dark (with all those monsters and strange creatures), losing interest for me (although that giant Marshmallow Man is a curious figure).In fact, those hideous creatures that appear in the second half, that wizard-like woman and some very disturbing ghosts are mostly what ruins the movie for me.However, not everything is bad about this movie. It has a delightful soundtrack theme which is a classic: the song \"Ghostbusters\", performed by Ray Parker Jr. What else? The special effects are, most of them, awesome (typically 80's, which is a good thing). And finally: both Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are quite funny in these roles. Bill Murray has a very particular sense of humor. Dan Aykroyd, on the other hand, is an actor which I've always seen playing serious and sometimes grumpy characters, so I never expected to see him in a comical role like this.

It's not a boring movie, a bad movie or a big quality movie. Overall, it's just an okay movie made mainly for some fun and entertainment. \u00abWho you gonna call?

This is a film that exists as enjoyment for its own sake \u0096 there is no wider intention beyond mixing laughter and spectacle in an appealing way. The film could have been instantly forgettable in less assured hands, but director Ivan Reitman deserves credit for pushing the right buttons. He is helped out immeasurably by the comic talents of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis \u0096 all four are in uncommonly good form throughout this film, and it's their funny interaction and clever sense of timing that makes numerous scenes stick long in the memory.Three parapsychologists are thrown off campus after bringing themselves into disrepute. Driven by unemployment to take drastic measures, they set up a ghost hunting business. The mismatched trio comprises of enthusiastic Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), technical boffin Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), and incompetent faker Pete Venkman (Bill Murray) who has virtually no scientific understanding but coasts by pretending that he has. Under the name \"Ghostbusters\", they prove a surprising success as they ride around New York responding to ghost sightings and capturing the spectral critters. One lady, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), phones them from a high-rise apartment block after undergoing a weird supernatural experience in her kitchen. When the Ghostbusters arrive, everything in her apartment is back to normal, but Venkman \u0096 ever the womaniser \u0096 takes a shine to their latest client. Only later does it become clear that Dana's apartment is built over an ancient gateway and is about to become the scene of an invasion of demonic forces. The Ghostbusters find the world turning to them to save the future of mankind when all the malevolent spirits converge.Murray makes the best of his role, using deadpan delivery to ensure his lovable liar is the film's most endearing character. Moranis comes a close second as Dana's hopelessly dim neighbour, a small insignificant mouse of a man who ends up working for the forces of evil after being possessed. The film relies heavily on special effects and, generally-speaking, they are cleverly done (especially for the time). In fact, the film was nominated for an Oscar for its Visual Effects. The ghosts blend fairly seamlessly into the live action, and characters like the destructive Slimer and the gigantic Marshmallow Man are brought inventively to life. The story (by Akroyd and Ramis) tends towards broad slapstick, but it's an epic sort of slapstick that takes the genre to staggering, destructive and spectacular levels. Murray does manage to sneak in a few sly, underplayed gags that are wittier than the demands of the film overall. In summary:- Ghostbusters is brash, broad, and overblown\u0085. but a lot of fun!",

The theme song is known even by non-fans, there was a great sequel, action figures, video games, a cartoon series... everyone in this went on to big things (some were already big). You do not get many horror comedies that appeal to people outside the genre, but this one does (along with the sequel).Director Ivan Reitman knew what he was doing. Although perhaps better known for his comedies, he actually started out working with master of horror David Cronenberg. When he came to \"Ghostbusters\", he had every intention of making it scary. And he succeeded. Perhaps not generally thought of as horror because of its wide appeal, there are some legitimately scary moments. The librarian early on? Quite a shock!And that is it. I do not have to say that this is a great film or that I could watch it again and again... you know this. It scared me as a kid, but now... just a classic. Who hasn't seen \"Ghostbusters\"?",

            "content": "Ghostbusters is a movie from 1984 starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters Franchise, Trading Places), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Ghostbusters Franchise) and Sigourney Weaver (Alien Franchise Avatar). It was written Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, Strange Brew) and is directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Franchise, Up in the Air, No Strings Attached).Ghostbusters follows three scientists: Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) as they start their own ghost catching business and their biggest job yet is in a musician named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) own refrigerator. This hilarious movie is carried by is fun characters brought to life by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. They are each very different and very funny in their own ways. Murray plays a classic, sarcastic Bill Murray character, Aykroyd plays a nervous quiet man who is really excited to be living out his dream and Ramis plays a very smart, nerdy, and odd man. They ad-lib most of their lines which makes this all even better.I actually think the success of Ghostbusters led to all of this ghost hunter reality show crap we see on TV today. This was the first movie to really have the idea of ghost hunting itself which means it is very original and started a ghost craze and a (not so good) sequel.Most of the effects in this movie do look quite dated while films like Blade Runner (which came out two years earlier) do not. But all of this adds to the fun of this incredibly fun, hilarious movie from the 80's.",

            "content": "I suppose there is an idea at the core of Ghostbusters somewhere; a high-concept film, about a group of people essentially adopting the role of contemporary exorcists, that straddles some sort of often vacant place on a line that separates non-reality with what could feasibly happen if you were religious. It is a curious thing when a text attempts to handle that of demons, ghouls and ghosts. Deep down, I suppose, it is somewhat perversely pleasurable to convince ourselves of their existence. As years have passed, germs have replaced the invisible monsters that-once-were as the cause for illness; technology has been able to deduce whether or not haunted locales truly are as such while science; theories on evolution and modernity in general has done 'wonders' to disprove the idea that religion and so forth are as genuine as everybody thought they were for so long.There was a line in the Tarantino-penned 1996 horror film \"From Dusk til Dawn\" when the anti-heroic lead states that \"if there is a Hell\", and that the monsters occupying an adjacent room \"are from it\", then there's \"got to be a Heaven\". Should the existence of ghosts, demons and whatnot run in tandem with the theory that there is a heaven and an afterlife? Probably, and yet in spite of all this sweeping modernity doing well to disprove the spirit world and the idea of an 'afterlife', there are still those who remain unconvinced of a ghost's inauthenticity; remain staunch that they've encountered one and remain adamant that the line between our world and the next not only exists, but is thinner than you think. One of the (admittedly, few) charms of the 1984 horror/comedy Ghostbusters is how it exploits the belief of that line while keeping everything as reigned in as it does. This is not, for the best part, an all-out horror film depicting nasty, invading spirits doing their utmost to invade a densely populated human locale, although it does descend into that by the end. Moreover, this is a clash of the old and the new; an unabashed depiction of hauntings and ghosts as very much real but a depiction of science and technology otherwise associated with disproving God; Heaven; Hell and reincarnation through spirit being used to counter said entities.New York City must be one of the most populated zones in the world, but does that mean there'd be more or fewer ghosts there than somewhere largely vacant, such as that attic in an old, isolated English manor house from centuries ago located somewhere in the countryside. Regardless, the leads therein the film discover a fair few of them merely going about their routines in a manner that is underplayed and quite funny but, one senses, realistic to the cause should a large uncovering of spirits ever unfold. Ivan Reitman's film mixes the audacious with the bubble-gum, a depicting people coming into contact with spiritual entities although sadly never really learning anything nor becoming more enriched as a result of it. While the film is quite good fun and often funny, it comes across as too superficial to be anything wonderfully inventive nor much more than frivolously academic. It's often quite childish, even dull in places. Admittedly, where not every film of its ilk can be as good as \"The Sixth Sense\", where the presence of ghosts in a characters life leads to an enriched bond with a psychologist, Ghostbusters does hit the odd mark.The film follows four New York City based men, two Caucasian; an African American and a Jew, who set up their own business in a disused fire station that specialises in ghostly phenomena. Initially, the men (still minus the African American) are ill-suited to the practical aspect of their work where the theory is all in the right place. Uncovering a poltergeist in a library archive, they can only run screaming for their lives when it turns uglier than they'd like. Buoyed by their experience, they have enough confidence to set up this business when a university cuts their funding and the enterprise turns into a ghost 'busting' organisation upon realising there's money in making the ghosts go away \u2013 a sort of supernatural pest exterminator. Among them is Bill Murray's psychologist Peter Venkman, a man whose womanising ways is evident in the opening and who remains largely sceptical on the whole library phenomena anyway where his partners do not. At the other end of the spectrum is Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, a dry man and the most intelligent of the four who is too deep into his work to notice the affection shown towards him by their eventual receptionist. Somewhere in the middle is the \"funny-as-Murray\" but \"as-good-at-his-job-as-Ramis\" Dan Akroyd, who plays Raymond Stantz. Narrative is, of course, superfluous in a film like Ghostbusters; its end-of-the-world routine, as Sigorney Weaver's Dana Barrett discovers a gateway into a doom-laden alternate dimension, is as nonsensical as it gets in a film which might otherwise have been quite intelligently theological. The true pleasures lie in the film's would-be tryst involving the ever-humorous Venkman and the delight in the way he shares his scenes with Weaver, although we do not come to observe much closure to any of it \u2013 nor indeed do we Spengler's with the receptionist. The film is more interested in cracking on with its primary tract of special effects and unexplained alternative universes which, one assumes, comes complete with their own dynamic structures but the likes of which are not explored here. But it remains difficult to get angry with the film because it has with it a boyish energy; it does the rare thing for an American blockbuster in actually trying to sell to you this U.S.P. innocently and fondly, as if it cares for it so much and wants you to share in this fondness. In the ever declining cinematic world of 'event' movies within which we live, that alone is justification for checking Ghostbusters out.",

            "content": "Let me begin my review with a frank statement. I am sick of people calling Ghostbusters 'the funniest comedy of all time'. Why? Because I never once saw Ghostbusters as a comedy. As a young kid, as a teenager, and as an adult I always saw this film as 'a supernatural thriller with humor'.It's not shot, edited, performed, scored, or designed as a comedy. No way! Aykroyd's genuine interest in the paranormal is where the idea for the movie began. When he teamed with Harold Ramis to write the script there's no doubt in my mind that his intended tone was serious, but with touches of light relief (mainly from Venkman and Louis). Listen carefully to the dialogue, it's peppered with loads of credible scientific jargon and multiple cryptic references of almost Lovecraftian lore. This serious subtext weighs the film down in the thriller category more than comedy.The trio (and soon quartet) begin as researchers at Columbia University in NYC. But Venkman, only in it for an easy scam, ends up getting them thrown off campus. Ray and Egon have a plan for catching and eliminating paranormal threats to the public. With Venkman's conman skills, they take a chance and found 'Ghostbusters' in a derelict firehouse. Business is pitiful until Dana Barrett shows up claiming a voice from another dimension spoke to her through her fridge. Venkmen, enchanted by her, goes to her apartment to check her/it out. He finds nothing, unaware that behind her fridge is a secret doorway to a rooftop temple built as the venue point for Gozer, a destructive inter-dimensional traveler.Almost every aspect of Ghostbusters is honed to perfection. Ivan Reitman has never directed a better film. Elmer Bernstein's sumptuous score (often overshadowed by Ray Parker Junior's pop song) is utterly bewitching. The effects, while old-school, don't date the film one bit. The chemistry between the cast is wonderful, you actually believe that these guys have known each other for years. The fact that Harold Ramis plays the deadpan, deadly serious Egon despite having directed Caddyshack and Vacation (two of the most anarchic films ever) gives the chemistry a nice edge, since beneath the serious exterior you know he's actually the maddest one of the lot.However, I WILL complain about one thing (though it is relatively minor). I understand that movies need to be tightly edited to stop the audience from nodding off (but no one possibly could with Ghostbusters), but Reitman's last-minute tinkering renders a large chunk of the film senseless. It begins as soon as Winston arrives. He claims to the Mayor that he's worked with the company for a couple of weeks, but within the timeline of the movie he's only worked for them for a single day. Venkman's impromptu meeting with Dana at Lincoln Center is badly pasted on over Winston's 'interview'. Venkman arrives at the firehouse covered in slime, warps to Dana without slime, arranges a date for Thursday (which actually appears to be later that same night), before warping back to the firehouse, slime intact for his confrontation with Walter Peck (William Atherton, who has been typecast ever since).The original flow of the film included a scene at Fort Detmerring in which Ray and Winston investigate alone. Part of this scene is in the final product (Ray's encounter with a female ghost while dressed as a General) and the scene where Ray and Winston discuss the end of the world was actually their trip back from this scene. With this complete sequence intact, and the surrounding scenes rearranged, the timeline of the film would have made much more sense. Ivan Reitman has shown this complete version as private screenings, but I doubt the public will ever get to see it. The closest you will get is Richard Mueller's novelization 'Ghostbuster's: The Supernatural Spectacular'. You can hunt it down, but it's very expensive.With much of Winston's screen time cut back, the character almost becomes largely redundant. Thankfully, he was developed more in the animated series and the sequel. And, redundant or not, it just wouldn't be the same without him.I'm not one for nostalgia, but 80s kitsch aside, Ghostbusters truly will stand the test of time forever. It's an absolute classic that'll never get old and truly deserves to be up there with the best of them.",

            "content": "My first exposure to Ghostbusters happened when I was quite young and I do remember watching it a few times and rather enjoying it even if there were moments that scared the ever-loving crap out of me but as I got older, the film dropped out of my viewing radar until I decided to rewatch it last year and low and behold, it still holds up just as much as it did back in 1984. From it's ingenious mixture of horror and comedy to its perfect casting and catchy theme song, Ghostbusters easily stands head and shoulders above most of today's painfully unfunny comedies.The film starts with a ghost haunting an old library and freighting a librarian. Following this incident, three out-of-work parapsychologists named Peter Vankman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler, who have started their own business called Ghostbusters, are called in to investigate but are scared out of the library. Upon being fired from their jobs at a local university, the three move into an abandoned fire station and make it their base of operation. Meanwhile, a woman named Dana Barrett returns to her apartment and soon sees a carton of eggs cooking themselves on her countertop as an evil demonic spirit speaks the words \"Zuul\". Faced with the increased paranormal activity around New York City, the team hire another member named Winston Zeddmore but now they also must face an even greater threat then Dana is possessed by Zuul and prepares for the arrival of a Sumerian god known as Gozer and only the Ghostbusters can stop it.In light of the awful 2016 remake which felt more like an unintentional parody of a Ghostbusters movie, the original film still remains a high-water mark for comedies that deal with supernatural elements like Dogma, Young Frankenstein, and Beetlejuice. It's always been a hard nut to crack in terms of balancing the line between horror and comedy just right and while movies like Evil Dead II pulled this off perfectly, Ghostbusters remains the perfect cinematic model to use when it comes to approaching the area of supernatural comedy. Give how it was Dan Aykroyd who came up with the idea for a team of men traveling through time and different demotions hunting ghosts as well as writing the first outline for what the movie would later become, this idea is nothing short of interesting and original but when director Ivan Reitman got ahold of it, he told Dan to scale it back a notch and make it more grounded but nonetheless, it did provide a strong base for Reitman, Aykroyd, Harold Ramis as well as the rest of the cast to build upon and add in new ideas as they saw fit. Plus, the screenplay for the movie is a perfect example of how to do characters in a comedy without having them come across as painfully unfunny stereotypes or characters with no depth or personality. Over the course of the film, there are times where the character of Peter Vankman is doing things that any normal person would deem to be unappealing or downright offensive as shown in a scene where he deliberately gives a student a shock while carrying out a cognitive test. Now, does the scene make the viewer assume that Vankman is the kindest man on Earth? Not in the slightest. Does the moment make you believe that he is funny as all hell? Absolutely. Out of all of the characters in the movie, Vankman seems to be the one who grows the most as a person over the course of the story as he starts out as a flirting twit but once he meets Dana, he begins to change into a more bona fide and honorable character as well as having something worth fighting for ay the end of the film. As for the other Ghostbusters, they really don't get much in the way of development but with that being said, they really don't need any as they are flawless in their own right and have no reason to be developed. All four of the Ghostbusters are engaging, comical and serve the film's plot as they are needed. One thing this film does so much better than the remake was the handling of the character of Winston Zeddmore in that he isn't portrayed as a scientist but rather an average working-class guy who just needs a job which makes him a character anyone can relate to instead of a screaming African-American stereotype in the remake. Even the other side-characters like Janine Melnitz, Louis Tully, and Dana Barrett are great characters and they never feel like they overstay their welcome nor are they ever aggravating to the point of stupidity unlike some characters in recent comedy films. Something else that Ghostbusters does so it is making the lead characters the little guys who have to break the system and while the 2016 remake attempted to do the same thing, there it just felt automatically given to the 4 leads rather than have it be earned but in the '84 movie, that element of the story feels natural as the team really do feel like they are the underdogs as at first they all lose their jobs and are seen as deranged or hustlers by a large array of doubters. The '84 movie takes this idea even farther as by way of the character of Walter Peck: a pompous attorney for the EPA whose desire is to pull down the Ghostbusters at every turn and nearly achieves his goal. This idea not only provides the viewer a feeling that the team is doing battle against government officials and the order of things, it also gives the Ghostbusters some tangible blockades to conquer along with giving them the necessary character growth as a team. With the aid of Reitman and Ramis, Aykroyd grounded the movie's story in reality much in the same way Christopher Nolan would later do with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so that not only do the Ghostbusters have to do battle with legislators, attorneys, and hotel supervisors while doing their job but also the world they inhabit looks real and lived-in rather than overly fanciful or dark and gritty. The romantic subplot between Peter and Dana is nicely handled as both characters have wonderful chemistry with each other and the romance never feels like it's just there for the sake of the plot not to mention Dana actually speaks like and acts like a real single woman in New York City which makes her character all the more likable and enduring and we understand why Peter is fond of her which is more than I can say for the overly-feminized and unlikable characters Paul Feig and Katie Dippold gave us in the remake. The romance between Vankman and Dana adds another grounded and adult aspect to the movie. Throughout the course of any action or action-comedy film, it's always a total blast to see the heroes having to something they shouldn't do in order to defeat the villain and save the day. Much like the air tanks in Jaws or Dr. Strange's plan in Avengers: Infinity War, the ex machine that will destroy Gozer is implied earlier in the movie. Not only is it essential to put your characters in a no-win scenario, but it's also a great innovation to have them win by shattering the rules. The crossing the streams idea isn't just a convenient resolution to the film's climax but it also adds to the movie's motifs of identity and anti- absolutism that run throughout the film. This is one of the many reasons why the original Ghostbusters is still seen as a beloved classic while the 2016 remake will likely continue to ridiculed and hated for years to come. Even though Dan Aykroyd required other people to help him get the story more grounded and less out there but simply put, there would have been no Ghostbusters if it wasn't for Dan and his zeal for the supernatural. The original movie never once demoralizes its ghostly aspects. Even those characters who are shown to be total cynics are soon convicted otherwise. The movie takes it's lore passionately and much of the movie's humor comes from how the characters respond to the eerie circumstances instead of the situations themselves. The Ghostbusters is in no way a camp movie but rather a supernatural comedy in the vain of what Tim Burton or Mel Brooks do with their films where the reaction is just as important as what we're seeing on screen. Even the arrival of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man at the end battle is more of a joke about Ray's childhood naivet\u00e9 being used against the team. The film was realized by a man who wasn't just fascinated by the paranormal but also had a great level of admiration for it as well. Regardless of whatever idea a movie has, no matter how outlandish or far-fetched, the more genuine it'll be if you put the effect into your film's screenplay and make that idea come alive, then the more convincing your movie will be to the audience and the more they'll respond to it. Unlike some modern-day blockbusters who feel like they need to be dull and grandiose in order to give the impression that they're somehow deep and thought-provoking films like Batman V. Superman and therefore lacking in any sense of fun or excitement, Ghostbusters is both a hilarious and entertaining film about the supernatural world that is able to work without having to talk down to it's audience. The action set pieces of the team catching Slimer in the hotel and the scene of them battling Gozer and the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man are all perfectly executed to a high standard and looks incredibly real as well as a lot of fun to watch instead of the giant CGI eyesore action set piece that the 2016 movie gave us. As for the visual effects, they may look cheesy by today's standards but they still work in the movie's favor when working with the more comical style as well as being compatible with the overall story. There are even some genuinely frightening moments in keeping with the horror aspects of the film such as the stop-motion Terror Dogs or the scene of Dana being processed by Zuul and while the scares are few and far between, they still work wonderfully well. The soundtrack for Ghostbusters is composed by the great Elmer Bernstein and it's easily one of the best soundtracks for a comedy movie I've ever heard. The opening theme of the film",

            "content": "Just like \"Stayin' Alive\" or \"Mrs. Robinson\", Ray Parker Jr.' \"Ghost Busters\" is one of these instantly identifiable songs as the first four seconds are enough to make you recall the lyrics that go along. Indeed, who doesn't know whom to call\u0085 if in their neighborhood\u0085 there's something strange. Ever since 1984, the movie has been a cultural phenomenon and speaking for myself, I learned to draw the iconic logo before I even saw the film.But let's get back to 1984. There's something very revealing about that year's ten highest- grossing movies, in order: \"Ghostbusters\", \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"Gremlins\", \"The Karate Kid\", \"Police Academy\", \"Footloose\", \"Romancing the Stone\", \"Star Trek III\" and \"Splash\". Think about it, six comedies, variously overlapping with romance, adventure and horror, but still comedies; only two sequels, and one of them so over-the-top it is funny in it own twisted and politically incorrect way, the rest consists on a musical and a sports underdog film, typical feel-good movies.Those were the good old days, when the box-office champs weren't made of franchises fillers or heavyset blockbusters, when there was still room for originality, even of uneven quality, when the special effects driven movies didn't take themselves seriously and were more fun to watch than these depressingly square and clinical universes today's directors embark us in. Now that the 80's enter their thirties, we realize how entertaining, imaginative and fun they were. You went to the movies to have a good time.And if there ever is one film that encapsulates that spirit, it's the story of three outcast parapsychologists with gray uniforms chasing ghosts with a vacuum-like device attached to packers. Of course, it sounds better as \"Ghost Busters\" and much cooler with the logo that became a defining sign of the 80's, one I'll take before any Batman or Superman shield. Seriously, let these guys fight together, I'd rather have a hot-dog stuffed green monster charging at Bill Murray, and sliming him in the process. Forget the truth, justice and the American way, some psychic nuisances and a trio of misunderstood weirdos will do.And \"Ghostbusters\" is a movie made by performers who knew what the 80's was about, what the public wanted and it doesn't come as a surprise that these guys come from TV. It was a project written by SNL alumni Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd with John Belushi in mind, but his untimely passing entailed many changes in the script. And with gentlemanly class, Ramis and Aykroyd let the lion share of one- liners to Bill Murray, giving him the role his comical legacy needed: a wisecracking scientist named Dr. Peter Venkman, such a constant jerk-ass you can't even tell if HE can tell whether he's serious or not.Ramis plays Egon Spengler, the egghead and Ayrkyod is Raymond Stantz, the good friend and most emotionally involved of the three. You have the trio made of the mind, the heart and the crazy spirit, and their chemistry is the key to the film's success. They're later joined by Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddmore, the everyman of the group, and to some extent, the needed 'voice of reason'. A lot has been said about the way Hudson was treated by the film's marketing, but I don't think the race card is to be brandished here. And there's something oddly original in the way a significant character pops up halfway through the narrative.The film also counts on nice supporting performances. There's Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, a cellist who's the 'first to call', after witnessing some strange phenomena in her kitchen. There's also a familiar face of the 80's, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, the meek and geeky accountant who's obviously infatuated with his beautiful neighbor. For some reason, she unable to see what he's got to offer, and the eight inches between them don't help. She also doesn't call Venkman's 'romantic' tirades but the ghost storyline finds a smart way to reassemble these two romantic subplots, when Dana is demonically possessed by a spirit.And Venkman's reactions to her exorcist-like condition proves at least one thing, it takes a lot to shake the guy. And that's the most brilliant aspect about the film, the special effects can satisfy any sucker for horror or Sci-fi movies but the fact that the three players handle it as pure routine is a great example of tongue-in-cheek humor and a subtle satire on New York's inner wackiness. After all, where else can you see a TV ad about ghost busting? I also love how the blas\u00e9 secretary played by Annie Potts doesn't even question their works, and when she asks Winston whether he believe in these things, he tells her that for money, he'd believe anything (I thought there was a waste here for a funnier line but never mind). Everyone is so crazy that the closest to come to a sane person is the antagonist, an EPA lawyer who had all the reasons not to trust these guys who use radioactive material for their jobs. But only William Atherton, the soon-to-play Thornbug in \"Die Hard\" could have made himself more unlikable than jerk-ass Bill Murray, and he's the one who by turning off the power that stocked all the taken slime, liberated them and turned New York into the outlet of the most demonic presences, using Dana's building as a channel. We get then to a climactic showdown, whose special effects might distract from the comedy for a little while, but not too long.Indeed, the masterstroke comes from the form taken by the evil presence, and this is the stuff iconic movies are made of. \"Ghost Busters\" isn't without flaws, but they're of such microscopic and negligible nature compared to its iconic magnitude, that the film works as a \"Critics Buster\" too.",

            "content": "This really is one of the best things to have ever come out of the 1980's, let alone the magnum opus of all the comedy talent involved. Incidentally, \"Ghostbusters\" did to ghosts what \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) would do to dinosaurs just a few years later. The effects and designs of these spirits are fantastic, and transcended extraordinarily well when it came to the merchandise and that classic cartoon series.Three men (The nerd, dope & slacker) open up a ghost busting squad that while ridiculed, accidentally ends up as a thriving and legitimate business. This all leads to a fourth member (The inevitably cool black guy) and enlisting help against an ancient Demi-God of ultimate evil, taking a bizarre form in one of the funniest climax's in motion picture history.Really what isn't there to like about Ghostbusters? Re-visiting it did I realise just how genius the writing and dialogue is delivered, and while it'll continue to hold up way beyond that of just a catchy Ray Parker Jr. song. While there has been talks of a \"Ghostbuster 3\", there is no doubt that the fans love and \"kind of\" own this franchise. It's so universally loved by all, I would probably rate it as my 2nd favourite comedy of all time (1. goes to \"The Big Lebowski\"). I can't tell you how thrilling it was to be on the motorway onetime and have the ECTO-1 roar pass you (Presumably coming back from a showroom event, but nevertheless lights and alarms all functioning).Final Verdict: They just don't make comedy films of this calibre nowadays, but it's very comforting to know everyone involved went on to star in other comedies that continued to spin this special kind of comedy gold. 10/10.

There's an excellent 80s soundtrack and wide ranging score by Elmer Bernstein. Not only does Ghostbusters work as a piece of entertainment it captures New York during the political and social Reagan-era, a different time. The ghost wrangling cast are excellent, Bill Murray gives a hilarious deadpan performance as the team come together. Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson offer great comic turns. The supporting cast are also strong, Sigourney Weaver is on fine form as Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully and William Atherton as bureaucrat Walter Peck are particularly notably. Annie Potts is humorous as crabby but likable Janine Melnitz. Tully's crush on Barrett is humorously played out. Weaver gets to give a full range of emotion, right down to playing possessed. As well as eggs cooking on worktops and ghouls in fridges there's also a horrific scene where Barrett is gagged and dragged by evil hands across a room on a chair. Many of the effects still hold up and the optical ghosts remain eerie.There's a perfect a blend of special effects and comedy, too many moments to mention, notable is the scene at the hotel where armed with their proton weapons the team go to capture a greedy ghost and Venkman gets slimed. Packed with quotable lines, Reitman offers paranormal and supernatural hi-jinks including demon dogs, skeletons, spectres as well as chuckles. Together Aykroyd and Ramis along with Reitman and crew not only deliver a great film but they forge some pop-culture equipment, the iconic Ecto-1 that the Ghostbusters use to travel, proton packs, the P.K.E. Meters, containment unit and the like.From the New York Public Library where they encounter a elegant ghost that transforms into a horrifying spook, to the showdown against Gozer and the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the witty jokes, the chemistry on screen and the effects are magical.

            "content": "Three scientists start a business catching ghosts and uncover an evil spirit looking to destroy the world.As a child of the 1980s I remember Ghostbusters being a phenomenon of spectacle and merchandising. On more recent viewings with my daughter I can appreciate that it is a timeless classic. A four year old should not be interested in a group of thirty-something men in overalls chasing slimy ghosts around Manhattan but she is.The production values stand the test of time with effects created by some of the best minds that Industrial Light and Magic lost. The highlight for me being the green ghost Slimer who was based on the late John Belushi's character 'Bluto' from National Lampoon's Animal House, a fitting tribute to the actor originally selected to be Pete Venkman.It is a movie with both character and characters that give it a wonderful charm. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis have exceptional chemistry and couldn't be more perfect for their roles. Ackroyd and Ramis play the heart and brains of the outfit, which fits perfectly with us knowing they also wrote the screenplay. In Murray they have the perfect foil to their nerdish personas. He gives us Venkman, one of the great comedy characters of 20th century cinema. A deadpan, lecherous, charlatan who fronts the business with more streetwise brass than his colleagues. There is more than a hint of 80s free-market opportunism and Reganomics about their set-up that encapsulates the era well.Supporting characters are also strong with Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and William Atherton all giving memorable performances.The weakest area in my opinion is the plot itself. It doesn't really draw you in, it's just something for the characters to do while they make you laugh and used as an excuse for more spectacular effects to be shown. It's not bad by any means it's just not something I particularly cared much about.A thoroughly entertaining film with lovable characters and memorable moments for all the family to enjoy. For me it is an 8.5/10, but I like to round upwards.",

            "content": "Before I saw the movie, I know that there was a cartoon. I was familiar with it, but what I did not know that there was a live-action movie. The movie is great, it is so cool and the theme song is so catchy. I knew that in the cartoon the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man was a nice guy with a dopey voice, but in the movie, he was a terrifying monster! My brother and I enjoyed Slimer as well. Just look at that big fat green blob of slime (inspired by Bluto from \"Animal House\"). I always wanted to see the movie as a kid (despite the fact that I saw the cartoon and clips from the cartoon \"Muppet Babies\"), but my parents wouldn't let me due to the creepy nature of it. I saw it on TV a few times whether it was on Bravo, Esquire, or VH-1. Finally I saw it on the big screen recently and it was like the time I took a time machine and went back to the 1980's! 1984 to be specific. Kind of like the time I saw the original \"King Kong\" at an old art house theater, was like going back in the 1930's. Specifically 1933. Speaking of which, there were a lot of scenes that paid homage to \"King Kong\". For instance, the giant temple with gate that opened with Gozor in it, looked like the gate with Ann Darrow being sacrificed before Kong's arrival. The Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man climbing up the building and getting destroyed at the end was like the climax in the old 30's horror film. Apart from the films theme song, there was another cool song that screamed 80's, \"Saving the Day\" by Alessi. When my brother and I were very little, the cartoon was as popular as the movie. We had this coloring book called \"People in your Neighborhood\" (not related to \"Sesame Street\"), and there was this page that showed firemen fighting fires with hoses shooting water. I went haywire coloring it all up and my brother said that looked like \"Ghostbusters\", so we ended up turning their hoses to zappers that shoot electricity we drew a ghost in it and he is loosing. My dad had a friend named Bob and he came to visit us when we were little and my brother called him Peter Venkman because he looked like the one in the cartoon than the film. OK, childhood memories aside, as for the special effects, they changed a lot over the past 30 years. I have been watching a lot of movies with special effects that used a ton of CGI such as those super hero movies and monsters such as The 2014 \"Godzilla\", \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\", \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and Michael Bay's \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". People these days are wondering that if we are spoiling ourselves with a ton of CGI. Are we getting tired of it and do we miss practical effects? Seeing the Terror Dogs growl and leap made me think about it. Fortunately, J.J. Abrams is making \"Star Wars Episode Seven\" and he will use CGI and practical effects marry in this movie. James Rolfe of \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" fame made movie based on his web series and he used practical effect like those seen in old Japanese monster movies like the original \"Godzilla\". \"Jurassic World\", which is coming out next year, is said to have practical effects with the help of CGI. Bottom line: this is a great movie! I highly recommend it. Followed by an animated series and a sequel. Rated PG for violence, profanity, peril and a ton of scary scenes.",

            "review_title": "The thirtieth anniversary re-release",
            "content": "Much to my dismay and disappointment, I am usually never able to catch films that are re-released into theaters on account of an anniversary or a 3D upgrade. This is mainly because so many films often come out the same weekend as the re-releases to, leaving me strapped to make the decision to rewatch an old favorite in theaters or seek out and review the new releases, the ones people want to read reviews of. As somebody who watches anywhere from forty to sixty films a month, I need to choose wisely, and never, until now, have I chosen a re-released film over a new release.This all changed when an unsurprisingly slow film weekend in August revealed the thirtieth anniversary release of the 1984 classic fantasy-comedy \"Ghostbusters\" in about seven-hundred theaters in the United States. In a time where some of the strangest, most unremarkable releases come out of the woodwork in American cinema, \"Ghostbusters\" seemed like a perfect break from the drudgery of blockbusters, under-impressive sequels, under-performing risks, and so forth. Even as I sat back to watch one of the funniest and most original comedies of the 1980's on the big screen, I felt like I was taking a mini-vacation from this gig I call my side-job/passion.I doubt \"Ghostbusters\" needs more than a brief plot summation, but the film concerns Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), three misfits interested in the idea of supernatural forces and paranormal activity. The three men find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of popularity after being called to The New York Public Library to take down a ghost that has been haunting the library for sometime now, and following their success at identifying and capturing the being, the three decide to open up their own business as professional Ghostbusters, working with the city of New York to stop paranormal forces dead in their tracks. They are soon approached by Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to function as their fourth member, and attach themselves to Dana Barrett's (Sigourney Weaver) specific case, which concerns her apartment complex being overtaken by the demonic spirit known as Zuul, who's spirits are worshiped by Gozer the Gozerian, the God of Destruction.At first thought, the film sounds overstuffed and complicated, but as anyone familiar with the film knows, it's anything but. This is mainly because it would appear writers Aykroyd and Ramis bear the similar attitude about the entire project as the character Peter Venkman, sarcastic, lax, and carefree. This sounds like a criticism, but the fact that \"Ghostbusters\" bears such a collective and relaxed aura about its story and its characters never makes the film fall prey to any confusing subplots or technological jargon. It can be sarcastic, it can be smug, and it can be just plain silly, but all of the above reasons, and the fact that the idea is executed to the fullest extent, are the reasons this film is so loved and cherished, albeit worthy of a thirtieth anniversary re-release.Being that there's little to critique, as most comments have already been made and mine will sound very much like a reiteration of old reviews, one must comment on the joy of seeing a re-released film on the big screen. For starters, \"Ghostbusters\" has a great deal of elements that make it worthy of a big screen viewing. From the montage of catching ghosts, to the actual, developed scenes where catching Slimer is the gang's main objective, to witnessing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man come to life on screen all compliment the inherent largeness of a theater screen wonderfully. Combine all of those elements with the terrific sound editing and elaborate special effects, which still look pretty good thirty years later, and there is an arguable reason to make a trip to the theater to see \"Ghostbusters.\" Then there's Ray Parker, Jr.'s infectious theme song, which brings a smile to a nostalgic face, especially when heard through the expensive, surround-sound speakers of a theater. It's this song that is the bow to the entire experience of seeing \"Ghostbusters\" alive on screen again. If the joy of seeing Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson interact and exchange the same classic, witty banter we can all quote flawlessly isn't enough for you, Ray Parker, Jr.'s theme song will surely place the icing on the timeless cake.Being that this is a different review than usual, I'll end the review not necessarily recommending the movie (you should know by now if you are or are not a fan of \"Ghostbusters\") but recommending the experience to anyone who has yet to witness the phenomenon on a theater screen. The entire experience could make a wonderful introduction to classic, eighties films for the new generation, and for once feels like a genuine appreciation of the classic film without unnecessary upgrades in the third-dimension.Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Rick Moranis.

The main cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are great together and Rick Moranis is awesomely funny in a smaller role as a nerdy accountant who lives in the same apartment building as Sigourney Weaver. On Sigourney Weaver: there was nothing particularly bad about her performance, but she did seem a little underwritten. There was one great scene she had with Bill Murray after she gets possessed, but other than that she was merely a plot device/damsel in distress. Moving on to other facets of the production, I thought the soundtrack was top-notch, cheesy 80's goodness and the title song was especially memorable and catchy. Visual effects is one area where I felt the film to be a bit lacking, although it probably was some of the best effects the early 80's had to offer. In my opinion, the animatronics and claymation/stop-motion work was better than some early CG. This especially becomes apparent in the ridiculously convoluted final act, and is preceded by a hastily (but hilariously) resolved conflict with an EPA agent. Other than, I didn't really see any major problems with the writing. It just seemed like the scope of the film could have stayed smaller towards the end and been just as enjoyable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the film a lot and am now \"in the know\" about a film that has left an indelible mark on pop culture. So, who ya gonna call? I know who I would...Ghostbusters!",

Peter \"volunteers\" to help her.Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) then joins the team. In the course of their investigation Ray discovers that Dana's apartment building was constructed by and evil force known \"Gogen\" and that the spirits contained within are planning a comeback. Dana and Louis become possessed by the spirits to become the Gatekeeper and Key master respectively. Peter is mesmerized by Dana in her possessed state.The four Ghostbusters then lock and load and confront the evil Gogen who then thrusts the Marshmallow Man upon humanity and....................................The performances of the principals lift this film above the level of a Saturday Morning cartoon. It's hard though to take Bill Murray's character seriously as scientist. His constant smirk hardly indicates serious intent. Aykroyd and Ramis play their roles more to the point. Annie Potts almost steals the film as the brash secretary. And Sigourney Weaver never looked more sexy than she does as the possessed Dana. Rick Moranis is quite funny as the nerdy neighbor who continuously keeps locking himself out of his apartment. And poor Ernie Hudson. He hardly has anything of note to do after arriving late in the story.Followed by \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989) as we knew it would.",

            "content": "GHOSTBUSTERS is obviously one of the most fun movies ever, up there with Classic's like Men In Black for example. I adore Ghostbusters & i was born in 1984 when it was released so its a special film to me. I do love Ghostbusters but gotta be true to myself, i do prefer it's underrated sequel GHOSTBUSTERS 2!!! The river of slime is a unique & so relevant \"Villain\" for all ages. The music to this 1984 Classic is beautiful & in my mind & heart forever, some films are so important at shaping someone's character.I love both movies & both are a huge part of why i love movies.But Ghostbusters 2 was the first ever movie i saw at the Cinema & my first memories of that Cinema experience is burned into my brain. Ghostbusters 2, even with it's faults, is a misunderstood Masterpiece in my opinion.Legendary Director Ivan Reitman was as much a legend to me as anyone in those Classic films as he directed them & i dug his sense of humour, lovable characters & good-hearted nature of his films.I also grew up on his Twins, Kindergarten Cop, Junior & Stripes.GHOSTBUSTERS has all great elments with it's\nCinematography, music, cast,special effects & locations of New York City are absolutely iconic & burned into my mind since being tiny,i have so much Nostalgia & love for these Ghostbusters movie's.I've been obsessed with Ghostbusters all my life & adore the characters who feel like family to me & everytime i watch these film's it's like seeing old friends again. Also Ghostbusters is defensive a New York movie & the film that got me loving the gritty & dark look of 1980's New York City in movies. Ghostbusters 1&2 are ingrained in me & i adore both films & the franchise, i loved the \"Girls Ghostbusters\" that movie is ridiculously underrated & a great movie in it's own right.Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) will always be my favourite character in the franchise followed by Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore.I grew up watching the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, Extreme Ghostbusters, i collected all the Action figures & watched both FILMS on video over & over growing up,so yes i grew up on Ghostbusters.This movie made me fall in love with New York City for how it looks on screen & the beautiful & detailed cinematography, both films look beautiful!!!I could go on & on about my love for Ghostbusters & still never completely explain it lol, the truth is Ghostbusters & it's characters touched something in me at a young age like most fans & never let go!!!Ghostbusters opened my mind & curiosity to the supernatural, PARANORMAL & my sense of wonder about the world.Ivan Reitman is one of my favourite movie Directors ever, he sits comfortably next to John Carpenter, I've always loved Reitman's films like his \"Kindergarten Cop\" & \"Stripes\" & \"Twins\" & \"Junior\" & \"Evolution\" & of course his masterpiece films \"Ghostbusters 1&2\" he's a legend of cinema. BUT!!!! Ghostbusters 1984 isn't perfect!!! The silly & embarrassing \"Ray & Ghost Blowjob\" scene doesn't belong in the film, it's embarrassing to watch that with ur kids & of course Winston is way underused & Gozer isn't exactly a great villain or Staypuft to be honest & that's why Ghostbusters 2 beats the film. Just being honest but i love this movie that came out the year i was born 1984. I literally grew up with Ghostbusters & Ghostbusters 2 & the animated series.From the beautiful opening music & into the iconic Library Ghost scene, Ghostbusters is a phenomenal Comedy Horror Classic, with a perfect blend of silly humour & Scary frights, the cast are Amazing & all four busters our like Super heroes to us film geeks!!!Bill Murray is a Comic genius, Dan Aykroyd is a Comedy legend & fantastic writer, Harold Ramis R. I. P was a fantastic Director & a the brains on screen & good old Ernie Hudson is an underrated Every man of Cinema.Love you Ghostbusters.Thank you Ivan reitman.Thank you Dan Aykroyd.Thank you Harold Ramis R. I. P\nThank you Ernie Hudson.Murray is funny but also not as nice a guy as all the others (just being honest)\nThank you Sigourney Weaver. But Ghostbusters 2 is the better film in my personal opinion & my all-time favorite movie ever.",

They get kicked out of practice due to some slightly unethical tests (and the fact that everyone doubts their field of study and thinks they are nuts!) so they decide to go into business for themselves as \"Ghostbusters\". They create all manner of tools and gadgets in order to hunt for and trap ghosts, expanding their business and eventually recruiting help along the way too. Unbeknownst to anybody a long dead Sumerian deity called Dozer is attempting to make a come back and it's up to the Ghostbusters to put an end to the chaos and evil. This is one of my favorite films of all time and is a classic film which stands out as one of the best in the 80's. It is filled the rafters with great humour as well as scares and horror a plenty too. As a young boy I was memorized watching this and wanted to be a Ghostbuster! Watching this film back has never disappointing me and I usually find something new which I didn't catch on other viewings. The cast is fantastic and adds much to the success of the featuring Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver all deliver excellent performances. Ivan Reitmen did an excellent job with the film as director balancing the effects with genuine dialogue acting, he let some of the actors improvise their own lines to brilliant effect. I reckon that Ackroyd and Ramis's script was already creative and hilarious but it's not often that you get a director who gives control to some of the stars to do what they do best when they aren't in feature films (most of the main stars were comedic stars on late night American TV shows). Some of the special effects look a little dated nowadays but not all of them, some still stand up as effective and as appealing as they were in the 80's when this was wowing audiences around the world. You have to remember this was before what we consider to be modern CGI so a lot of the effects you see are lessons learned from cinema over the years. As for music or a soundtrack, can you honestly say you've gone through life without hearing Ray Parker Jr's classic titular anthem?!The success of this film led to cartoons, comics, a sequel, a range of toys, and whole host of moments which still get referenced today. Family friendly, full of fun, great visuals and soundtrack, memorable to this day, I could write soo many great things about this but I'll end by saying that you really can't go wrong watching this great film!",

If it wasn't my first time, I saw it \"again\" quite a while ago, and I have to say I loved it. The movie has never seemed to be so much funnier than I thought it would be, and it was it was silly. Without it's silliness, it would just be some boring drama action movie. This is probably one of the few movies that has a sequel that is only slightly less of a rating than the original on IMDb, and that's why I plan to watch the sequel after reviewing this. Plans don't always go, but let's see.Three scientists, who worked together in a University are fired and decide to open up their own business. An unusual business, I might add. Ghostbusters. The university didn't like their theories about catching ghosts and their studies, so they say, \"screw you\" and they're off to become famous celebrities of their art. The police even like them, and they are making some good success. Who doesn't like them? The EPA, and when they shut down the storage of ghosts, something goes wrong to their building, and when one client still hasn't had her problem solved, something goes wrong, too. Two problems collide and the Ghostbusters have to leave jail to the request of the mayor to solve them. How did they get in jail? Find out yourself.This was a very silly movie, and while some things are too intense to even have this PG rating, which I think they should still change, go ahead and watch. An 80s classic that will blow you away, and maybe make you understand the Ghostbuster parodies you might see on some of your favorite TV shows.",

Many horror comedies fall short and can't find an audience. Ghost Busters is an original idea that wasn't too unique to make millions at the box office. Bill Murray adds to the genius of the movie as a modern day Charlie Chaplin with addition to slap stick and Flip Wilson humor. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Moranis complete the wild comedy that makes up Ghost Busters. While remaining to be somewhat serious, the film throws a series of jokes, gags and innocent humor that isn't found in many movies. Weaver had never been sexier whether she was fighting ghosts or aliens. A comedy that stands alone, Ghost Busters is great",

Three professors doing college research on the supernatural lose their funding and decide to go into business for themselves as paranormal investigators. Bill Murray towers over all with his near perfect comic performance as Dr. Peter Venkman, a sort of wise ass guy who doesn't take this ghostbusting stuff seriously until they start making real money. Dan Aykroyd is a charmer as Ray, \"the heart of the Ghostbusters\" and Harold Ramis, who would gain greater fame as a director, generates real laughs here as Egon (\"I collect spores, moles, and fungus.\") Sigourney Weaver makes an intelligent and refreshing damsel in distress and Rick Moranis steals every scene he's in as Weaver's nerdy neighbor who also becomes part of the story as we learn the apartment building where Weaver and Moranis live is on top of some ancient burial ground. Annie Potts (DESIGNING WOMEN) also scores as the guys' secretary and William Atherton is funny as an EPA exec out to ruin the Ghostbusters. But it is mostly Murray's beautifully flippant performance laid against some awesome (for 1984) special effects that made this movie work.

            "content": "Ghost Busters is quite possibly director Ivan Reitman's finest hour (and forty minutes)! Written by stars Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd, \u0091Ghost Busters' is a rollercoaster ride of awesome special effects and intelligent humour which features the undeniable talents of Bill Murray as the sarcastic, but loveable character of Dr. Peter Venkman.After being thrown out of the University at which Ray Stantz (Akroyd), Egon Spengler (Ramis) and Peter Venkman are scientists and researchers they decide to put years of their research and thousands of dollars into starting up their own business \u0096 Ghost Busters. To begin with it seems that this risk will not pay off for them as they run out of money and Venkman's attempts at romance irritate their only customer, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). However this all changes when they get their first big job, after that they're the talk of the town! Unfortunately, there are some people who aren't very impressed with the Ghost Busters and seek to shut them down.This film stands out amongst the movies of the Eighties, and indeed the movies of all time, as being one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and that is a reputation it quite rightly deserves. Unlike many of the movies I watched as a child this is one of the rare movies that I still love now as an adult. The jokes are still as funny, the action is still as exciting, the movie is still as watchable and the genius storytelling is still undeniable. This movie appeals to me on two levels. There are the immature and rather childish jokes and moments of the film that although are funny they require little thought. On top of this we have some rather intelligent and more adult jokes that as a child I didn't catch on to, as an adult it helps me appreciate the movie all the more. Bill Murray is at his best in this movie, delivering sharp and witty one-liners as if they just rolled off his tongue. Dan Akroyd also provides a great comedy element to the movie in the form of the brilliantly minded scientist, but socially slow Ray Stantz. Ray's behaviour provides much enjoyment and this accompanied by Bill Murray's excellent performance makes \u0091Ghost Busters' one of the greatest comedy films I've ever seen.Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett works perfectly as the romantic interest for Venkman and this is complimented by Weaver and Murray's performance on screen together. Despite the obvious absurdity of the central plotline the Dana/Peter relationship storyline works out very well and allows us to see a more sensitive side to Venkman. All of this helps in adding realism to an otherwise unrealistic film.The special effects are something else that must be praised, they have certainly stood the test of time and I would even venture to say they have stood up better than the Eighties other Special FX-Extravaganza \u0091Poltergeist'. I've heard a few negative remarks about them but I find them to be very effective even to this day.I have to say that I recommend this film to everyone, there is so much to it and the movie works on so many levels that it has to be seen. If you haven't seen this movie yet I would check it out as soon as possible because I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. My rating for \u0091Ghost Busters' \u0096 9.5/10",

            "review_title": "Ghostbuster 4k Bluray Review",
            "content": "This is the fourth release of Ghostbusters post DVD era and the first and most obvious question is, is it the best release to date or even worth the upgrade if you own the previous releases? In short, if you have the right TV and AV equipment then the answer is YES!.Picture Quality:Sony has done a fine job of improving the image of a film that is now well over 30 years old, upping the resolution to 2160p and adding HDR could have been an easy way of just churning out another release of a film that has a gigantic following for an easy cash-in. Yet adding this new technology to this disc helps the picture quality by improving the contrast, colour and brightness which make this release a real enjoyment to watch (again).First thing first, does Ghostbusters have the polish and glitter like some of the more modern movies that have been released? No, the grain of the original is still there and present throughout the entire film, however, the image has been enhanced and in places looks tremendous with primary colours, in particular, making the picture pop. Skin-tones are more natural looking than ever and there is plenty of detail to be found where it could not be found before. One drawback I find on a lot of older films that have had a 4k transfer are the darker areas where the blacks become pixelated which I am glad to report I did not see once whilst watching the film in its entirety.Audio Quality: If you are unsure as to why you should buy/upgrade to this release this is one area where this disc excels. Adding a Dolby Atmos soundtrack to a film of this age could have just been done to get the \"Atmos\" badge on the box to entice people to make a purchase, but this really does excel and I was amazed how good of a job Sony has done in this area.The previous Blu-ray releases have a True HD 7.1 track onboard which is great and a vast improvement over the original VHS and DVD versions, but the Atmos track supplied on this 4K disc is a major upgrade. Using the object based technology adds to the atmosphere right through the film in particular towards the end of the film where our team of parapsychologists are in a battle with main antagonist Gozer and this is where the Atmos truly shines with pieces of the building noticeably falling from above. The charge of the proton packs humming in the background the proton beams blasting from every angle. As the saying goes they saved the best to last, in the scene where Gozer asks Ray (Stantz) \"Are you a God\" the booming voice of Gazo surrounds you from everywhere like a voice from God and is truly one of my favourite parts of any Atmos track I have heard to date.Overall:There a few points I would like to make here. As I said at the start of this review to get the most out of any 4k release you need the right equipment, If you have a 4k TV and 4k player and are using TV speakers then you obviously will not be getting the required effects from the Atmos track, for this you will need either an Atmos-enabled soundbar or preferably a capable AV receiver and speaker setup to maximize the effects from these releases.Also, the scores below are based on the age and previous releases of the film, the video is a huge improvement from earlier releases but when compared to the likes of Dunkirk it is somewhat left behind for obvious reasons.(I will be writing an article soon on what equipment Is required to get the most from these newer releases)Score:Video: 4/5Audio 4.5/5",

            "content": "Combining big-budget special effects with irony and sarcasm-laden dialog, \"Ghostbusters\" is a one-of-a-kind sci-fi fantasy comedy as entertaining as it can get.The movie stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, three graduates from the great schools of \"Saturday Night Live\", \"SCTV\" and \"National Lampoon\", as three \"scientists\" whose specialty is to detect and hunt down ghosts of all kinds. They form a team called the Ghostbusters and they offer their duties to whoever wanting to get ridden of a ghost.After some troublesome beginnings, the team quickly becomes very popular and is able to eradicate dozens of paranormal creatures from every corner of Manhattan. They are in such demand that they need to hire a fourth crew member, played by Ernie Hudson. However, their skills and their knowledge are soon going to be rudely tested when a destroyer god from the Babylonian era is getting ready to penetrate into our world and to spread chaos in a Judgment Day fashion.This kind of scenario could reminisce anybody of such disaster movies from the middle of the 20th century, monster movies such as \"King Kong\" and \"Godzilla\", or even contemporary blockbusters, filled with rumpus, destruction and special effects intended to terrify and provoke some panic. \"Ghostbusters\" is all of that at once, but it dissociates itself from the bunch in its own particular way.Instead of presenting itself as a drama, a thriller or an action flick, \"Ghostbusters\" is introduced as a heavy special FX comedy. Chimeric idea? Maybe. But the result is simply delectable, because of the quality of the special effects, but mainly because of the humor brought out by the stars of the picture, beginning with the master of irony, Bill Murray.Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the unofficial leader of the group. His on-screen appearances are always delightful, his lines being almost always stamped with irony and impassive humor. Murray is very much at ease and he does whatever he wants in front of the camera.Murray's two accomplices (and the co-writers of this movie), Aykroyd and Ramis, are not relegated to oblivion anyway and, together with Murray, the three of them have a good lot of chemistry. At moments, they can become as funny as Murray is.Sigourney Weaver is also a part of the cast in \"Ghostbusters\". She plays a violinist who quickly realizes that her refrigerator could very be some kind of portal towards a parallel dimension. Rick Moranis plays her nerdish neighbor. Sometimes nice, sometimes unpleasant, it's actually very hard to really care about Moranis' character in this movie. It becomes easier when he is pursued and possessed by the Sumerian demons, but we actually do care much more about Sigourney Weaver in that situation.Ernie Hudson, a relatively underground actor, is fairly attractive as the fourth Ghostbuster. He represents somehow the link between the ghost trackers and the ordinary people.Nonetheless, the actors from \"Ghostbusters\" are generally overshadowed by the impressive special effects required for that kind of movie involving creatures from another world and innovative technology to hunt ghosts. But the actors find themselves rewarded from that move. Thus, we see \"proton packs\" with extremely dangerous, but extremely convincing beams. We also see ghosts that are both frightening and funny, the green wiener-eating \"Slimer\" being the best example.But how could we forget the unforgettable climax starring the most unlikely destroyer in New York City history: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man? It is without any doubt the most famous scene of the whole picture and it's not without reason. His arrival unleashes the greatest panic attack from the movie's extras, because of his menacing stature. But in the viewers' case, they can't help themselves from smiling and laughing when they see that surreal giant walking in the streets of Manhattan, even if they know that this monster is not so much different from Godzilla, save for the hideous and repulsing appearance.So \"Ghostbusters\" is technically innovating, comically revealing, but it's globally some really tasty entertainment that everybody will be able to appreciate. Everyone will be able to find at least one element that will satisfy them. Those who love spectacle and eye-popping sequences will be delighted by the special effects. Others will respond to Bill Murray's lines with an inescapable smile. And let's not forget the eponymous theme song from Ray Parker, Jr. that will play in the heads of people long after they've seen the film.So, twenty-five years later, we can still watch \"Ghostbusters\" without telling ourselves that this picture comes from another era. The majority of the special effects have aged well, even if some of the moves from the demonic dogs begin to look like those created by Ray Harryhausen for \"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\". So, it's still easy to love the movie, just like if it was just being released.Since the first silent movies of the early 20th century, there have been a lot of comedies that were created. But among those which tried to insert big-budget special effects to counterbalance their comic moments, \"Ghostbusters\" is among the best, if it's not THE best. It's really some pure crazy fun.",

He spends half of the film trying to get Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett into bed. \"I'll take Miss Barret back to her apartment and check her out.\" The lethargic, laid-back manner with which he greets unimaginable confrontations provides some of the film's best moments: particularly his first 'contact' with \"Slimer\" and of course the scenes at a possessed Dana's apartment. \" I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.......Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule...\" Another strength of the film is the way it balances the comedy and terror. Years later, there are still some pretty frightening scenes. I'd easily count the scenes where both Dana and Louis (Rick Moranis) are both attacked.I swear every single year, there is some rumor about them re-making this film.........",

            "review_title": "A defining film of the 80s - but hasn't aged that well.",
            "content": "Ghostbusters is widely acknowledged as one of the defining movies of the 1980s. Everyone seems to remember it fondly and you still hear \"Don't cross the streams\" and \"I am the Keymaster\" randomly quoted from time to time.Now I'm not here to burst any bubbles, I have nothing but positive thoughts whenever the movie is mentioned, but watching the 25th Anniversary edition recently I began to second guess its standing.Immediately after watching the film again the other night I thought that it is not realistic to call Ghostbusters one of the \"all time\" classics. Sure it is a good movie, charming and at times amusing, but it is not in the same league as other 80s flicks.Then a funny thing happened, two days passed and I allowed my memory to elevate Ghostbusters back up the pecking order\u0085 then I re-read my notes. Therefore I think Ghostbusters is perhaps a better concept than film, and I'm not knocking those that love this film and stand up for it, I just don't see it in the same light as say \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" or even \"Stripes\", let alone \"Die Hard\" or \"Aliens\".Perhaps it was more your circumstances, I'm positive that movies I saw in my teens and early 20s are remembered more favourably simply because they were great times period in my life (not that now is so horrible), and I am now more analytical (unfortunately) and unforgiving when I am watching a film for the first time.Anyway Ghostbusters. Not a bad film in any respect, just not as good as some think.The film of course is about three guys who for no known reason start a paranormal investigation company after having their research grant summarily dragged. The three are Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis), Egon is the nerdy genius, Ray the ideas man and driving force behind the business and Peter just tags along for something to do and to get girls.As always Bill Murray is also the main reason to watch the film, and he provides most of the laughs throughout, including some that result from seemingly ad-libbed remarks after another character speaks.Their first mission is successful yet destructive, and luckily they find they have entered into a growth market, as paranormal activity increases in New York dramatically shortly after they commence operations. Due to the escalation in demand they hire a new \"Buster\" Winston, who doesn't do much in the film but obviously balanced out the poster.Their first client is Sigourney Weaver as Dana, who has a demonic possession in her fridge, (don't we all?), she happens to live in an apartment building that is a conduit for all that is evil in New York, and she wondered why the rent was so cheap? She is taken and possessed, as is her neighbour Lewis (Rick Moranis), and they begin a hunt for each other referring to themselves as the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster respectively.As there must be conflict in any movie the Environmental Protection Agency shuts down Ghostbusters operations and in doing so inadvertently release all their captured ghosties, increasing the very need for their existence, which doesn't help as they are in jail.This leads to the reason why I think the film is remembered in such a good light, once the boys are in jail and the ghosts cut loose New York cries out for their assistance, so the finale is not simply four guys in overalls running around with weird backpacks, but that plus a crowd of vocally supportive New Yorkers egging them on.At times it is almost like a sporting contest how the crowd interaction actually seems to elevate the importance of the Ghostbuster's actions, and it definitely gives the latter scenes a bit more buzz.Ultimately Ghostbusters is a fun film, though lightweight harmless and largely disposable. I would consider it a good rental every few years so that you might throw it in and shut your brain off for 90 minutes, but I can't see why people obsess over it.Final Rating \u2013 6.5 / 10. We all know the plot now, and 90% of the laughs of the laughs are from Bill Murray, but that could be said about all his films.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

            "review_title": "My Childhood Favorite Still Holds Strong!",
            "content": "I love Ghostbusters. The movie has always been a major part of life beginning with childhood. I'm very thankful I was introduced to this movie at such a young age. It is no surprise that the film was the biggest hit of 1984 and then some. The theater life was exceptionally long, but that is no big deal for a movie that helped in changing the landscape of feature films. This movie is considered to be one of Hollywood's first blockbusters. It also proved that special effects and comedy will work well together given the right ingredients (unlike Spielberg's disastrous 1941). These are just two of the main highlights that worked out in the film's favor.The film was directed by Ivan Reitman, the man behind comedic hits like Animal House and Stripes. He did have a say in the screenplay, which was first drafted by Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd has always been fascinated with the paranormal. His family wrote books on ghosts or were mediums. His first script was more horror-based, but Reitman convinced him to lighten things up. He brought Harold Ramis (who worked with Reitman previously on the aforementioned films) on board to refine the jokes and add some much-needed humor. The script wasn't entirely used the way it was intended since Reitman wanted his actors to ad-lib. The studio, Columbia thought the film was toast, but boy were they ever proved wrong. Reitman knew the movie was hit at the first audience test screening when they laughed and felt fear during the opening library scene. That scene, with the older librarian being scared out of her wits, is one of the classic all-timers.The performances are great (especially the deadpan comedic performance from Bill Murray), but the technical side of things were amazing. The editing is a thing of beauty. The film had a very short production leash, so Reitman and his crew had to edit as they go. In a film which could have gone horribly wrong, there is an even mixture of comedy, drama, action, thrills, and chills. In an age where special effects dominate each film, I was still impressed with the special effects. The ghosts looked realistic enough. The Marshmallow Man was giant and scary. The zombie cab driver. And, oh Slimer! Our favorite ghost! He was apparently modeled after the late John Belushi. Finally, the movie would not have been the same without the music. Everyone knows Ray Parker Jr's famous title song. I love that song, too!Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists who work at Columbia University. They are fired after their grant ends. They begin a business to hunt down and capture ghosts. Business is bad at first and the public derides them. When Dana Barrett (Signourey Weaver) notices strange behavior by her Central Park apartment, she hires the Ghostbusters to rid her place from evil. Apparently, the place is a gateway to another world. Her oddball neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) also notices these monsters. Now business is great, and they even hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) to their team. The EPA associate, Walter Peck (William Atherton) convinces them they are doing the city harm and gets them thrown in jail. When New York City is placed under siege by ancient Sumerian god Gozer, the mayor may have no choice but to release them from jail.This film also gave belief to the studios that its okay for television folks to star in movies. The main trio were all SNL stars and this movie made bank. Murray had the most experience with movies and he also delivered the funniest performance. It is a deadpan one and his one-liners are brilliant. My favorite is: \"human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria...\" If you understand the context, you'll understand the humor. Aykroyd and Ramis, while not given as much to do as Murray, do their best to create memorable characters. The chemistry between the three is definitely the highlight. Signourey Weaver is an odd casting choice giving her dramatic past in films like Alien, but she nailed the comedy when inhabited by the Gozer ghost. Rick Moranis totally got his character and I was down every second. I want to go to one of his parties!Ghostbusters was a major hit for Columbia and a film that was influential towards culture. It gave studios more confidence that comedy-driven special effect films could work after all. You would not have fun, awesome films like Men in Black if Ghostbusters failed. If you studied New York City history, you'll know that the early 1980's was a horrible time for the city given its propensity for violence and fiscal damage. Reitman said this film was his love letter for the city. It gave the industry a much-needed boost that they could film their productions here. Nearly forty years after its debut, the film holds up very well. It's funny, scary, has great special effects, and it proved why everyone loves Bill Murray.My Grade: A",

And casting Sigourney Weaver playing the dramatic character against the comedy of the other three was nothing short of perfection.

            "content": "John Winger, Bill Murray's lovable loser in the boot camp comedy STRIPES, the second of three collaborations with director Ivan Reitman beginning with MEATBALLS, had his very own theme song: a lazy piano-bar riff, whose likeness can be heard in GHOSTBUSTERS throughout Elmer Bernstein's immense score, but only when Murray's sarcastic Peter Venkman flirts with Signourney Weaver or clashes jovially with Dan Aykroyd's rambling Dr. Raymond Stanz, who Venkman describes as \"the heart of the Ghostbusters.\"And that would make Harold Ramis's Egon the lungs. Murray's reluctant sidekick in STRIPES and the director of CADDYSHACK and GROUNDHOG DAY, Ramis is an essential ingredient to make the gadgets and demonic backstory completely believable.As a team-up, one of the great things about GHOSTBUSTERS is seeing Murray play off of two science-minded serious guys. Aykroyd and Ramis wrote the film and obviously knew Murray had the stuff to steal scenes. Although the lead role was originally intended for Aykroyd's cinema partner, the late John Belushi: who inspired the iconic green ghost, Slimer. For years, Murray and Aykroyd were in the groundbreaking original Saturday Night Live cast after Murray replaced Chevy Chase in the second season. GHOSTBUSTERS was the peak of the SNL surge that also included ANIMAL HOUSE, THE BLUE BROTHERS, 1941 and TRADING PLACES.The original three-hundred-page script by Aykroyd began with a callused trio already fighting specters in New York City. It was Reitman's decision to show the boys origin, and some of the best scenes occur during the first fifteen minutes. One in particular involves Murray seducing a beautiful blonde in a fake telekinesis test followed by a hilarious attempt to snare a ghost within an immense library.A big budget comedy mixing horror/thriller and disaster film elements, GHOSTBUSTERS also makes terrific use of montage. After capturing a troublesome green wraith in a fancy hotel ballroom, we get a neat five-minute glimpse of the once almost-broke team becoming successful and famous. This is a surprise to Sigourney Weaver's lovely Dana Barrett, a classy violinist who, having witnessed something otherworldly in her fridge, becomes the core of an evil god's domination using an antique high-rise as the epicenter, turning the Big Apple into a Gothic medieval liar.With an exception of the stop-motion gargoyle mutts, that still look pretty cool despite Gumby-like movements, the special effects are hardly dated and show up fantastically on the big screen. But the true villain is a human being... You probably won't find any more heavies actually trying to save the environment. William Atherton's EPA weenie Walter Peck makes a terrifically uptight foe (playing a similar character in the following year's REAL GENIUS).Other side-characters include Rick Moranis as Dana's dorky neighbor, who fares better than Anne Potts annoying Busters secretary. But it's African American character actor Ernie Hudson, as newly hired Winston Zeddmore, who really shines. The forth Ghostbuster becomes, during the final battle verses a giant Marshmallow Man, just as important as the other fellas. And his mellow conversation with Ray about the Book of Revelations is a deep departure from the jokey action.GHOSTBUSTERS is a perfect combination of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd's talents. Aykroyd does most of the work, spouting rambling expository about the origin of the demonic presence while Murray remains the constantly wry non-believer, grounding a story that could have easily came off as too far-fetched but winded up one of the best character-driven comedies of the 1980's.With the chart-topping Ray Parker Jr. title song and a cute NO GHOST logo, the subtle traits of GHOSTBUSTERS are often lost in the shuffle, making CADDYSHACK and other smaller films more significant in cult cinema status... And yet, Egon's line \"I collect spores, molds and fungus\" invokes a bigger laugh than the famous Murray quip \"He slimed me,\" but only to us, the true believers who watched GB over twenty times and have a lifelong subscription to Tobin's Spirit Guide... Who says print is dead?",

Initially laughed at and mocked, they get their first customer in the form of the beautiful musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who's fridge is possessed by monster dogs. Then the G-men capture the green ghost Slimer (originally called \"Onion Head\" during production; Slimer later became their mascot of sorts on the cartoon) at a restaurant and before long they become a media sensation with ghosts coming out of the wood work left and right. This leads to them recruiting Winston Zedemore (Ernie Hudson). Then they discover that they're on the edge of the end of the world and Dana's building is the key to the whole thing, but first they must overcome William Atherton's misguided by theoretically well meaning EPA man before they can confront the monstrous Gozer and save the world.\nIn a role originally intended for the late John Belushi, Bill Murray is a hoot as usual as the dead panned yet sardonic salesman professor Peter Venkman. Writers Aykroyd and Ramis have a little less to do but they're fun to watch as the overly enthusiastic Ray and Spock-like Egon. Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson do what they can with their roles of Dana, Janine and Winston respectively. You have to admit, it may be a step down from \"Alien\" but Weaver manages to imbue Dana with more grace, dignity and warmth than the usual love interest. Rick Moranis has a fun bit as Weaver's nerdy neighbor.Not only is the film funny, the film is also surprisingly creepy in places and boasts some great special effects along memorable music by Elmer Bernstein and the title theme song by Ray Parker Jr. Memorable moments include the library ghost, the eggs popping on the counter, the entire Slimer sequence, the appearance of th Stay-Puft-Marsh-Mellow Man, Harold Ramis attacking William Atherton, William Atherton being burrowed in marsh mellow, and pretty much any time Bill Murray is on screen (like when he yanks the tablecloth out from under the flowers), which is quite often. Don't miss the \"Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!\" line, or Winston telling the white mayor \"Since I joined these men, I have seen s**t that will turn you WHITE.\" Film is dated only by certain 80s wardrobe and the excessive amount of smoking down by the characters.\nThe sequel is funny and better than most sequels but still not quite on par with the first one. The first cartoon was good but impossible to find. \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" you can skip.As a trivia note, Bill Murray's character was voiced by the late Lorenzo Music in the cartoon series. Lorenzo Music was also the voice of Garfield the cat. Bill Murray has now replaced Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield for the new movie.Deleted scenes on the DVD include Janine giving Egon her lucky coin before he goes off to fight Gozer and the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man's hat falling on the populace after he gets blown to bits. Commentary by Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman is also fun to listen to.",

Murray's performance reminds me of meaner version of 1940s Bob Hope; they both specialize in the \"that looks really dangerous; you go first\" style of humor to great effect.Aykroyd and Ramis are generally overshadowed by Murray. Outside of Murray the most entertaining performance is Rick Moranis as a creepy accountant.The special effects are for the most part quite good, with silly ghosts and a tremendous and ridiculous final monster. Some of the other effects are pretty bad, most notably those bear-like creatures. The blue-screen edges are actually visible in places.

            "content": "Ghostbusters came out in the summer of 1984 just before I was born and would later be a fan of the film along with its products as I got older with age.The film's premise involves three scientist at a local college in New York where they get kicked out due to lack of funding and poor judgment. The leader of the trio is Dr. Peter Venkman (cool performance by Bill Murray) who not only experiments with people as part of his project, but if it's a seducing woman then Peter would do his best to get the girl. His life is basically sex, money and rock and roll while his two associates Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd delivering major punchlines) a free-spirited scientist that loves his work around the paranormal and Dr. Egon Spangler (Harold Ramis) a no non-sense scientist take their work serious and need to do something once they get kicked out of school. Peter decides that with their knowledge they could open up a business of getting rid of the paranormal after encountering a ghost in the library.Somehow things don't go well until the three members (who are known as Ghostbusters) meet a woman by the name of Dana Barrett (Sigorney Weaver of \"Alien\" fame) who believes that her apartment is haunted after getting notice from a neighbor that her TV was turned on loud and didn't even know about it along with seeing a creature inside her refrigerator. Peter has taken interest in Dana Barrett while seeing that nothing is wrong in her apartment just before getting called into action as the Ghostbusters take their first job before being famous. With so much ghosts in the area of New York they hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) before more things come in their way from a pesky environmental agent (William Atherton) who wants to shut down the good guys while Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) get attacked by the spirits in the apartment where later all havoc breaks loose and it's up to the Ghostbusters to save the day.\"Ghostbusters\" has three things that made the film successful: comedy, a spooky element and a special effects movie where they all work without letting the audience down. Bill Murray is classic where most of his lines will be forever be quoted by fans while at the same time blends comedy in the first act of the film while being serious in the second act when things get out of hand. Aykroyd and Ramis, who wrote the script, make sure they can write a comedy without losing the audience and be subtle at the same time with certain scenes. The spooky parts involving the monsters will more or less likely scare kids away while the special effects will have you begging for more.",

            "content": "I first saw Ghostbusters when I was 8 years old after watching the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters during Saturday morning cartoons when I was younger. The movie is still a delight to watch after many years, and the comedy and special effects are still enjoyable. Who would have thought the Ghostbusters symbol would still be popular after many years, particularly on many t-shirts.Take away the comedic elements and Ghostbusters would not be the same. It is due to the efforts of Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis that makes it possible and has created one of the most popular comedies of all time. Bill Murray's deadpan delivery of his many humorous and sarcastic one liners are still a classic.The movie starts with the discovery of apparent paranormal activities and the three scientists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Ackroyd), and Egon Spengler (the late Harold Ramis) are called in to investigate. After losing their jobs at Columbia University the three decide to start up a ghost busting company specialising in capturing ghosts. Although business is slow at first, the Ghostbusters make their mark in New York after their first call in which they capture their first ghost in the Sedgewick Hotel and their business is in high demand across New York. The Ghostbusters also enlist a fourth member to join their team Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson).The Ghostbusters are later called to investigate the apartment Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) lives in after she finds that her apartment is haunted by the demonic spirit Zuul. Venkman finds himself immediately attracted to Dana Barrett and also takes a keen interest in investigating this further. Dana has to also contend with her neighbour, the nerdy accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) who Dana constantly but politely rebuffs.The Ghostbusters future is almost put in jeopardy when a hard-nosed lawyer representing the EPA Walter Peck (William Atherton) orders the business shut down following breaches of the environmental act as well as inadvertently releasing all the ghosts captured to wreak havoc across New York. He also orders all four of the Ghostbusters arrested and thrown in jail. They are later released by the mayor to combat the paranormal activity across New York, in particular Zuul who has Dana and Louis possessed by demons.Bill Murray steals every scene he is in as Peter Venkman. Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis also counter balance the movie with their unique humour.Ghostbusters is certainly Ivan Reitman's finest movie and Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis prove they are not just a pretty face as they are responsible for writing the movie. Harold Ramis also proves that he is a good director, as evidenced by Groundhog Day.There's no doubting that Ghostbusters is still an enjoyable special effects bonanza and a great comedy. If anyone could compile a list of the greatest movies of the 1980's, Ghostbusters has a well deserved spot on the list.9/10.",

            "content": "'Ghostbusters' is another one of those classic American films from the 1980's that just seems like a foregone conclusion as if it was always there woven into the fabric of our pop culture. As a younger kid in the 80's this was a formative movie for me. Despite seeming like a no brainer 'Ghostbusters' had a very interesting and chaotic route to the big screen. If you haven't seen it watch Netflix's 'The Movies That Made Us' episode detailing the creation of 'Ghostbusters'. It is a supernatural comedy starring some of the funniest actors of the time such as Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray. Aykroyd cowrote the script with Ramis and the project was directed by Reitman who was one of the go to directors of comedies in the 80's. Along with the stellar cast the movie had great music and spawned the number one hit with the same title as the film by Ray Parker, Jr.Three lab geek parapsychologists in NYC investigate paranormal phenomena, and discover through some intense encounters ghosts actually exist in their city. In response they form the Ghostbusters company as basically pest control for ghosts which they capture in a trap and store in a containment facility at there old firehouse office location. They eventually hire Annie Potts' Janine and Ernie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore to round out their odd little collective. Venkman played by Murray investigates a woman's apartment after some weird occurrences. The woman, Dana Barrett, played by Sigourney Weaver, winds up being the target for an entity known as Zuul. Ultimately, as ghost activity becomes rampant, it is apparent the city is on a collision course for a massive showdown which as we all know comes in the form of a battle with a David Bowie-esque god and her destructor, in the form of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, chosen by Aykroyd's poor Ray Stantz. It is an epically tense climax, yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.This movie is quite brilliant and its mark on the pop culture landscape cannot be understated. With the collection of talent funny was pretty much a foregone conclusion. Where this movie excels though is that next to the comedy it treated the ghostbusting and the entities seriously and those aspects of the film played closer to horror than comedy and thus this never falls into the realm of silly or frivolous. It walks this line where the comedy is genuinely funny and the serious aspects of the film are just as genuine, and usually films can't straddle that line successfully. The special effects work great in the film from the various ghosts to the demon gargoyle dogs to the Stay Puft Marshmallow man himself. There is nothing to dislike about this film. Some of the most brilliant comedians of the time acting in a story that captures the imagination of any child of the 1980's. One of the best films of that era without question.Eric's Grade: A.",

I went through most of the reviews on this page and it must have something to do with the fact I never found Murray a funny guy but I can't think of one joke I particulary liked in this movie. Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis are the three immortal ghostbusters but twenty years later it all looks so crappy, it's just like a lasershow from some discotheque and damn difficult to believe this was one of the most expensive productions ever...

No one takes their craft seriously, but when a demonic force begins to threaten the city; it's up to the Ghostbusters to stop it before it is too late.I know, I know. It's criminal that I only just got around to seeing this wonderful movie. If you haven't already seen this movie, I urge you to see it now, and not wait as long as I did to do so. Everything about this movie is good, pure, family fun and entertainment. Some idiots would say that that is a negative, but I very much so disagree. This movie is accessible to ALL people, no matter their age or background. It's excellently crafted fun that the whole family can enjoy and laugh to.What are this movie's major pluses? The FANTASTIC chemistry between the cast certainly comes to mind. Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis are phenomenal in their distinctive and memorable role as Peter, Ray and Egon respectively. I've watched this movie once and I can easily remember everything about their characters. They are all fun, memorable and unique. As for Whinston, that's another story that I'll touch on later.Accompanying the holy trio is a side helping of Sigourney Weaver{Alien; The Year of Living Dangerously} and Rick Moranis{Acting Debut}. Both of these actors do extremely well in their unfortunately minor roles. I particularly loved Moranis as the socially awkward, inept next door neighbour to Signourney Weaver. He NAILED this role and was responsible for a great deal of the film's laughs, after Murray of course.The humour in this movie is awesome. I dare say it's a universally loved classic of comedy. Murray delivers some of the best one liners and jokes of the 1980s, and the remainder of the cast do their very best to support him. I'd say only two characters didn't have a funny line and that'd be Dana Barret(Sigourney Weaver) and Egon. However, Weaver isn't in the movie that much, and Egon's straight faced attitude ironically makes for a barrel of laughs. Even characters I didn't like(more on that later) had couple of good lines and jokes.As far as more minor praise, the soundtrack for this movie is flawless. The now iconic Ghostbusters theme tune could genuinely go down as one of the greatest theme tunes of all time; it is that excellent. What issues do I have with the movie? I take issue with a couple of the characters. Firstly, Whinston. What is the point of this character? He shows up. Makes a decent joke or two. And nothing else. I know this film has a sequel so maybe he'll get more screen time then, but as it is - there are only three Ghostbusters worth talking about, in my honest opinion. Next, the secretary was also pretty dull and useless. Like Whinston, she showed up, made a decent joke or two, and nothing else. There was literally NO point to her being in the film. Like, none. I don't understand why she was here because she contributed negative things to the plot. And finally, the villain. Ghostbusters' villain is not scary; it's not funny; it's not even a decent blend of the two. The villain in Ghostbusters is just plain bad. There is no interest in the character and no likable, charming or frightening qualities to even make them somewhat compelling. Such a weak villain for an otherwise awesome movie. I'll also say that the action in this movie is very weak. It consists of pointing a stick at a monster. BRILLIANT! No. No it's not. Without the comedy, action sequences in this movie would be remarkably dull and boring and just plain awful. I really wish that A LOT more effort was put into it because that(and a somewhat compelling villain) would have made this movie a 10/10, because it certainly has the ability to go for it.Overall, I loved Ghostbusters. It was fun, fast, inventive and had a heck of a lot of heart. Sure the antagonist is mediocre and the action leaves you feel unsatisfied, but the main trio of Murray, Akroyd and Ramis help make this movie the comedic classic that it deserves to be. I definitely recommend 'Ghostbusters', and I'll rate this movie 8 'MASS HYSTERIAs' out of 10!",

Even by 1984's standards, Ghost Busters falls way short with its cheap looking effects. What leaves me scratching my head is that Richard Edlund (Star Wars) was behind the SFX and was even (gasp!) nominated for an Academy Award!!! \"Poltergeist\", which came 2 years earlier has SFX that for the most part, stand out quite well even today.Still, Ghost Busters is still a fun, if slightly dated, classic to watch.",

I had expected the special effects to look dated after all this time but they hold up well.Our trio of misfit heroes are scientists studying paranormal activity at a university in New York till their department is closed down on the day they actually see a ghost. The decide to set up their own ghost busting business but initially they get no costumers. Eventually Dana, played by Sigourny Weaver, comes seeking their help to deal with a strange entity that has taken up residence in her fridge. Doctor Venkman, Bill Murray, goes to the apartment with her to investigate but when he gets there he sees no sign of anything strange.Their first successful case is when they trap a green ghost that has been terrorising a hotel, this success leads to fame and plenty more work. Venkman meets Dana again and persuades her to go on a date with him, unfortunately when he goes to collect her he finds that she is possessed and is claiming to be the Gate Keeper, at the same time her neighbour is running around looking for her while calling himself the Key Master. When they get together a portal is opened and a strange woman appears who summons Gozer, a demon who takes on a rather unlikely form and terrorises New York.This film is a lot of fun and while it doesn't take itself seriously it doesn't descend into farce either. The acting is good throughout and it has possibly the most memorable theme song of any film.

            "content": "Ghostbusters is one of the funniest films of all time that combines a great cast,script and special effects mixing Comedy and the Supernatural to amazing effect that makes this film an all-time classic.Ghostbusters tells the story of three college professors Peter Venkman(Bill Murray),Ray Stantz(Dan Aykroyd)and Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis)who work in the field of the paranormal and psychology. When the trio is fired from the college campus,Peter,Ray,and Egon decide to set up their own business as Ghostbusters. While the Ghostbusters have their success,they'll soon have to deal with ghosts in an apartment building on central park west and these ghosts won't be easy to capture.Ghostbusters is a classic film because it balances different genres,a great script and unique special effects. I love genre mash-up films and Ghostbusters is one of my favorite mash-up films because like some of the best mash-up films Ghostbusters successfully mixes together very different movie genres to amazing effect throwing in everything but the kitchen sink but never becoming uneven or unfocused achieving it's goal in entertaining viewers with a classic that is hilarious,unforgettable and will be re-watchable for all times and generations. Comedy and the Supernatural blend well together in this film because of the great and memorable interactions of the main characters and the funny situations the characters go through. When the film is funny it remains funny and never slows down and when the film becomes suspenseful and spooky it works as well. When most films that mix together different genres and fail this one succeeds and succeeds with greatness and originality that has is masterful. Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were among the biggest Comedy stars during the 80s and the three actors make the characters Peter,Ray and Egon memorable,likable and iconic. The pursuit of the Ghosts and their interactions with other characters as well as each other is great,you feel like the characters really believe in what they're doing,which is catching ghosts. Peter,Ray and Egon's banter, interactions,lines and various conversations with each other and other characters is hilarious and quotable,combining and mixing great laughs sarcasm,wit,smarts and sometimes deadpan Humor in the scenes. Most of the lines will be in you head after watching the film. Ghostbusters is also one few films to never spawn imitators,copycats or remakes. I guess the reason that never happened is because Ghostbusters is a unique film all it's own that can never be repeated or duplicated. One of the things I also love about Ghostbusters is that the film while it creates it's own world of Fantasy and Science Fiction it's still very much grounded in reality thanks to the characters and showing the city of New York and it's people as they love and embrace the Ghostbusters. The screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is original,funny and genius writing great dialog that's memorable,well-written and smart and has scenes that are well-placed and timed and great. Mixing laughs and special effects isn't an easy task but Reitman,Aykroyd and Ramis balance it out where Comedy and special effects don't override each other. It's Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon meets Poltergeist. The only films that I can think that mix Comedy and special effects well is Ghostbusters 2 and the Back To The Future trilogy. The Action in the film is great and intense and during the Action scenes there is wonderful laughs and fantastic moments that will stick with fans and viewers. The special effects in the film are excellent and still hold up to this very day. It's obvious every cent on the special effects especially towards the end. I won't spoil it for you but the very big special effects shot at the end is one of the funniest and surprising endings in film history that will make your jaw drop and have you roar with laughter and is one of the main reasons Ghostbusters is a classic.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Bill Murray is excellent and at his dead-pan best as Peter Venkman,the sarcastic,womanizing doctor who is smart and clever and Murray has some of the funniest lines in the film. Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as Ray Stantz,bringing a funny optimistic,child-like glee to the role. Sigourney Weaver does an amazing and sexy job as Dana Barrett,Venkman's love interest and has a great chemistry with Murray. Harold Ramis does a great job as Egon Spengler a scientist who's the straight man in the Ghostbusters. Rick Moranis is terrific and hilarious as Louis Tully,Dana's next door neighbor. Annie Potts is wonderful as Janine,the secretary of the Ghostbusters. William Atherton is great as Walter Peck,a representative of the Enivormental Protection Agency. Ernie Hudson does a fantastic job as Winston Zeddmore,the newest member of the Ghostbusters. David Margulies also does a fabulous job as Mayor Lenny,the Mayor of New York City.Ivan Reitman does a great job with the film,bringing a lot energy and imagination to the film. Reitman directs the Comedy well and also brings a sense of dread to the film when things get scary. Amazing direction,ReitmanElmer Bernstein's score is excellent at times very spooky,creepy and at other times lighthearted and optimistic. What a great score. And the soundtrack has great songs including the great iconic theme song Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. Magic by Mick Smiley,Savin' The Day by Alessi,In The Name Of Love by The Thompson Twins,I Can Wait Forever by Air Supply,Hot Night by Laura Branigan Disco Inferno by The Trammps and Cleanin' up the town by The Bus Boys. A fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Supernatural Films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Ghostbusters,an hilarious and unforgettable classic from beginning to end that you will watch again and again and is a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "The brainchild of co-screenwriter and co-star Dan Aykroyd, \"Ghost Busters\" was a pivotal movie in the life of this reviewer, helping to turn him into the movie nut that he became. It's one of the most enduring and endearing contributions to the popular culture of the 1980's, complete with tons of witty lines and its catchy hit title song.The story, for those out there who are newcomers to this classic, deals with three paranormal researchers who find it a blessing in disguise when a university kicks them out. Now they're able to go into business for themselves - the business of trapping and storing all spooks in NYC. We have Bill Murray as \"the mouth\", Peter Venkman, Aykroyd as \"the heart\", Ray Stantz, co-screenwriter Harold Ramis as \"the brain\", Egon Spengler, and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddmore (gotta love these names), whom they need to hire when the three original guys realize they need an extra man.There are lots of iconic bits and images to continue enjoying - the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the \"terror dogs\", the Ecto-1 vehicle, the opening commotion in the New York Public Library, the final battle with all powerful Gozer, the Ghost Busters' initial gig taking care of pesky green guy Slimer, etc. It was a testament to just how big this movie would break when even in the early going black market T shirts were being sold with sayings from the movie printed on them. The bouncy pop soundtrack is a joy, as is a score by Elmer Bernstein that alternates between horror and humour just as the movie itself does.And \"Ghost Busters\" indeed stands tall as a big budget Hollywood example of how a movie can be both scary and funny in equal measure. The cast couldn't be better; Sigourney Weaver is radiant as love interest Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis often hysterical as nerdy neighbour Louis Tully, who riffs like crazy in a priceless speech during a party. William Atherton is just right as snooty nemesis (and foil to Venkman) Walter Peck of the E.P.A. Annie Potts is just a hoot as deadpan receptionist Janine. Lots of other familiar faces in supporting roles and bits, too: David Margulies, Steven Tash, Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, Alice Drummond, Jordan Charney, Timothy Carhart, John Rothman, Reginald VelJohnson, and Jean Kasem, with Roger Grimsby, Larry King, Joe Franklin, and Casey Kasem seen or heard as themselves. There's the occasional dodgy special effect, but mostly the effects are fun to watch.\"Ghost Busters\", one of the great NYC movies, keeps holding up well on repeat viewings and never loses its appeal.10 out of 10.",

Ghostbusters is a classic that no matter how many times you've watch it, and know all the lines, it still somehow feels fresh and full of genuine charm. Sure most of its special effects are incredibly dated, but they are also part of the allure. We cannot take the nostalgia factor out of the equation, since it irrevocably appeals to us in that vein.Full of iconic scenes, costumes, dialogues, lines, special effects, the giant Marshmallow Man, and even the Ghostbusters logo have managed to remain in people's collective memory since the year it premiered. Not many motion pictures can do that, so with that in mind, it's really important to get a proper perspective of the film to truly appreciate it. And then, when you watch it, you absolutely understand the magic behind it.",

            "content": "In this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologist little crazy and deeply sarcastic. He's assisted by Dr. Egon Spengler (embodied by Harold Ramis), the intellectual genius of the quartet, Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddmore (played by Ernie Hudson). In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the \"Ghostbuster's\" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly. It's very curious that a film whose many critics said so bad manages to keeps it's popularity today, thirty years after being released.",

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" is one of the best and most iconic movies of the 1980s! It's brilliant core concept, quotable script and fantastic cast has cemented it as one of the most beloved comedies of our time!Even after 34 years, a decent sequel and a controversial yet painfully forgettable reboot, \"Ghostbusters\" is still just as well-regarded and popular as it was when it was unleashed upon the world in 1984! There are many reasons why it remains a landmark in pop culture, the iconography, the song that will never leave your head and the fact that the film employs a perfect blend of humour and spooky moments, there is so much to love!One of my favourite aspects of \"Ghostbusters\" is its original and creative premise. The story of blue-collar, ordinary people capturing extra-dimensional beings and Spector's is such an awesome and ingenious idea. Unlike the Men in Black, the Ghostbusters aren't specially trained agents, but average men who do their jobs not to save the world, but to get a paycheque (at least that's how they start out.) This unique plot makes \"Ghostbusters\" such a special and re-watchable film and gives the characters a relatability that makes them feel like real people.The ensemble cast in \"Ghostbusters\" is absolutely incredible! Every actor gives the film their all, the excellent dialogue manages to balance scientific mumbo-jumbo with realistic speech that, as previously mentioned, makes the Ghostbusters act like people that you could meet in the real world.I love every character in this amazing movie so it is almost impossible to decide who my favourite is! From the wise-cracking Peter Venkman (\"Back off man, I'm a scientist.\") to the loveable Ray Stanz (\"Listen... you smell something?\"), the deadpan Egon Spengler (\"Sorry, Venkman, I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought\") and the sadly and often forgotten Winston Zeddmore (\"This job is definitely not worth $11,500 a year.\")\nThe excellent performances and razor-sharp script gives the team a level of comradery and bravado that makes their interplay so enjoyable!The supporting cast are just as fantastic as the leading actors. The always stellar Sigourney Weaver and zany Rick Moranis provide more comedic situations for the filmmakers to play with and adds dimension to the movie's world.For a film that was released 34 years ago, it is surprising how well the visual effects, production design and creature designs in \"Ghostbusters\" have held up.\nThe ghosts and spirits in this movie are so awesome; the unique aesthetic makes the world that these characters inhabit feel distinct when compared to every other supernatural films. Although I love Slimer, my absolute favourite apparition in \"Ghostbusters\" (and my favourite part of the movie) is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. He's visually striking, hilarious and downright amazing! I was shocked to learn recently that Mr Say Puft wasn't a real American mascot, but was created solely for this movie; I had always made the assumption that his inclusion in the story was simply an ingenious idea for product placement.There are a long line of epic cinematic cars from the 1980s. Owning a vehicle such as the Bluesmobile from \"The Blues Brothers\", the time travelling DeLorean from the \"Back to the Future\" Trilogy and the Batmobile from Tim Burton's gothic 1989 hit \"Batman\", is the dream of many a movie fan. The Ecto-1 is just as striking and memorable as all of the previously mentioned automobiles, you can tell, just by looking at it, that the car can perform dozens of spook-catching functions. As with the DeLorean, the Ecto-1 looks like it was built in a shed/ garage, not on a conveyor belt, which means that the personality of the vehicle makes it a character in its own right, not just a prop.On a quick note, the \"Ghostbusters\" logo is undoubtedly one of cinema's best. It's so simple yet so iconic, even before I'd seen the movie; I knew what \"Ghostbusters\" was.One of the most recognized elements of this film is its ear-worm of a theme song! Everybody on planet Earth knows the \"Ghostbusters\" tune; I don't believe that the movie itself would be nearly as popular if it weren't for Ray Parker Jr.'s contribution!I find it so amusing that at the time, \"Ghostbusters\" was considered to be a family film that all ages could enjoy. Whilst I don't dispute that kids can watch this film (as nearly all of us watched \"Ghostbusters\" as children) the fact that the movie contains an abundance of swearing, smoking, the greatest jump-scare ever filmed and occasional crude humour makes this a far more interesting watch than, say, \"High School Musical.\"To summarise, I absolutely love \"Ghostbusters!\" It's hilarious, cleverly written and one of the most quotable and iconic motion pictures of all time. I shudder to imagine a world without \"Ghostbusters\"...\n\"Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!\"",

And no matter where you stand on the Ray Parker Jr./Huey Lewis debate, we can all say that, when it comes to Ghostbusters, the good looks don't outweigh what's on the inside. The film, even today, is as fun a movie as ever. It's a microcosm of the era--perhaps not as much as Back to the Future was a year later, but in 1984, the decade was just about forming into itself.The film follows a group of perverse scientists who have long been trying to uncover the world of the supernatural. After ominous events start happening and their radical ideas get them fired from the University which they work at, they form their own business as ghostbusters. Even though it works, Dan Aykroyd is slightly underutilized here. He and Harold Ramis serve very little purpose as either straight man or top banana. But Bill Murray and Rick Moranis prove to play the funny guys well enough.Murray was the king back then. He could say or do whatever he wanted without outshining any of his costars or commandeering a film. What he does so well is give the audience both broad and subtle humor, letting them chose for themselves. And he's at his best here. Moranis is phenomenal as well--although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. He and Murray stay comedically brilliant without ever having to step on each other's toes.It doesn't hold up quite as well as some of its contemporaries, but it gets better with every watch.It can be slow intermittently, but that's just a sign of the times. Slightly dated, sure, but Ghostbusters still gets the job done.Twizard Rating: 93",

Originally, John Candy was to play the role as a conservative business type. I think that would have bombed. Moranis's version of Tully was perfect. A low point in the movie was Sigourney Weaver. She is much better at fighting aliens. This movie definitely brings me back to my childhood. I never could figure out the Slimer character. When I see him I say, \"Hey, Look it's a ghost.\" No, I'm more likely to say, \"Hey, Look it's the kind of S#%t I have up my nose.\" Bring on the third installment!",

We would get sticks like they were proton packs and jump around in the snow like the ending of this film. Having a ball and showing what an incredible influence this film had on a group of 9 year olds.Dan Aykroyd originally got the idea of having ghost-battling guys traveling through time and space fighting off demons and ghosts for himself and his old SNL buddy John Belushi. Yet after Belushi's death and finding that the film would be way too expensive Harold Ramis was brought in to rewrite the script with Aykroyd. The story is about three parapsychologists (Aykroyd, Ramis and Bill Murray) who after getting the boot from Columbia University the three decide to get into the ghost-catching business. Their biggest case is that of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver in an excellent role, playing straight to counter act Murray's zaniness) where a portal of evil may have been opened in her apartment building.Bill Murray is a riot in the role of Dr. Peter Venkman and really might be his funniest role and he has had some excellent ones over the years. Also starring Rick Moranis who is also a riot as Dana's loser neighbour Louis Tully who has the hots for poor Dana. Ernie Hudson is Winston Zeddemore the fourth ghostbuster brought in because they are so busy. Annie Potts is Janine Melnitz the secretary of the Ghostbusters, who also brings a nice bit of attitude to the role. Finally, William Atherton plays Walter Peck, the human villain if you will, who is an Environmental Protection Agency inspector and wants to shut them down.Beyond some great humour it is also filled with some effects that were mind-blowing in 1984 and some still hold up pretty well today. It was nominated for an Oscar for the effects. Just love the effects of the Gray Lady in the library, the green ghoul Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmellow Man and the four need to battle at the end of the film. The title song as well is super catchy by Ray Parker Jr. (also nominated for Oscar). The music by Elmer Bernstein is terrific and really adds creepiness and humour when needed through his music. I own the LP for the Ghostbusters soundtrack and its certainly a keeper.Directed by Ivan Reitman, who also added ideas to the script and while it almost made an incredible $300 million at the box office it also may be his greatest film I have ever seen of his. He also had directed Murray and Ramis on the great STRIPES and Murray on MEATBALLS, which Ramis was also one of the writers. I think he does a knock-out job here and handles the humour along with the other elements such as horror and fantasy extremely well. I mean this just isn't a straight-up comedy.Followed by a sequel in 1989, a remake in 2016 (which I have yet to see, but am apprehensive in doing so) and another sequel is coming in 2021, which I hope is at least half as good as the original. Also had a cartoon THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS which I watched every day before school when I was a kid. Highly recommended.",

Murray's Dr. Peter Venkman is some sort of bogus parapsychologist. He plays at tests to study telepathy and similar mental games. But, he's mostly interested in female students. Aykroyd's Dr. Raymond Stantz and Ramis's Dr. Egon Spengler, on the other hand, are into the paranormal. That's the realm of the unknown outside of science. But unlike the psych field, things here can be seen in real life. Venkman is mostly clueless to their work, but he goes along with it. So, they go into the business of catching ghosts. The team invents a trap to contain or imprison ghosts they catch. They have proton weapons that sort of lasso ghosts electrically or by their zapping energy. Venkman is more interested in pursuing Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett. who becomes a client.\n \nFor comedies such as this, one doesn't have to question the fact that there wasn't such a business before because there was no apparent problem. While the para designation says it's outside of science, Stantz and Spengler have made it a science of studying the para field. All of this contributes to the comedy. The humor isn't in clever, witty dialog, but in rapid-fire nonsensical stuff about the paranormal. And, in some satire and the antics of the Ghostbuster squad as it tangles with ghosts. A fourth ghost fighter joins them. Erne Hudson plays Winston Zeddmore. The various ghosts are mostly funny caricatures. The best comedy is provided in the spoofing jabs of the mayor of New York City, city government, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, an EPA honcho who shuts down the Ghostbuster's power supply that keeps its huge collection of jailed ghosts confined. Pandemonium results, and the guys become the heroes of the city for shutting down organized spookery. This is an enjoyable fantasy and sci-fi comedy. It was deserving of the two Oscar nominations it received - for best visual effects and best original song. Toward the end, the ghost fighters encounter their biggest challenge. This is approaching the demonic, and the scenes could be scary for young viewers.",

I have never seen a film that is more fun, not to mention endlessly quotable, than \"Ghostbusters.\" It's become a film that people go back to again and again for the simple aim of enjoying themselves. It's a film that makes people feel good and have a good time. Of course, this also extends to the film's life outside the cinema. Nine times out of ten, you can make a person born in the 70s or 80s crack up laughing simply by saying \"Important Safety Tip,\" or \"It would be bad,\" or \"If someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!\" There are hundreds of other quotable lines from the film, but hopefully you get what I'm aiming at.

It's certainly not by any means a bad movie but in retrospect it's not by any means a great movie either. It's a charming, but only intermittently funny, comedy with some jazzy (at least for 1984) special effects thrown in to liven up the proceedings.The plot of this movie is a rather simple one. New York City has a problem with ghosts and three scientists form a ghost-catching company. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play the three original ghost busters with Ernie Hudson joining up later. Murray is undoubtedly the star. His character of Peter Venkman gets most of the best lines and as you would expect Murray delivers them brilliantly. Aykroyd and Ramis are fine in their roles but they'll never outshine Murray who is terrific whether delivering some sly, understated humor or being completely over the top and totally off the wall. Annie Potts as the Ghost Busters' receptionist, Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's potential love interest and Rick Moranis as Weaver's exceptionally nerdy neighbor round out the principal cast. Moranis in particular has some choice comic moments and his character of Louis probably trails only Murray's Venkman in the laughs department.With its solid cast and plenty of subtle, witty dialogue the movie has a lot going for it. And there are some rather exciting, and sometimes amusing confrontations between the ghosts and the Ghost Busters. The movie certainly has its moments but there are too many instances where the film just kind of sits there and the story struggles to move forward. But there is ultimately a great payoff in the end with an undeniably brilliant final scene. If you expect an all-time comedy classic you may well be disappointed but if your expectations are a touch more realistic you will find that Ghost Busters is a reasonably enjoyable film and that's not so bad.",

Not only are the main characters great but practically every supporting & side character are just as memorable. Dana Barrett, Louis Tully, Janine Melnitz, Walter Peck, characters that all have their own special traits & are instantly recognizable. The whole concept of ghost exterminators was just creatively brilliant & it's just hilarious how the guys treat this like it's an ordinary everyday job. They're not action stars and they're never prepared for the situations that haunt them but manage to somehow put their brainpower together to overcome it. So many fun moments that never get boring, from hunting Slimer down in the hotel to Louis getting chased by a demon dog, & of course the enormous terror that is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I'd say go check it out....but let's face it you already have.",

It still has better visual and optical effects than the version released 32 years later - the latter movie of course killing the ghostbusters franchise from which it may never be resurrected. Ghostbusters 2 wasn't as good as this movie, but ghostbusters (2016) makes Ghostbusters 2 look like an undead Citizen Kane.If you are a fan of the latest ghostbusters abomination, and you haven't seen this one, you need to so that you will understand why Ghostbuster fans were so horrified with the latest version.",

            "content": "Ghostbusters is an 80's movie through and through. It has an odd set up for the plot, and some typical characters pop up throughout. These three parapsychology professors get canned from their job (Murray, Ramis, Aykroyd), and decide to start a ghost catching business based on hardly any data, and with virtually no funding. After they get up and running, things get ugly when the environmentalist steps in and demands they be shut down. Well, the fragile ghost holding tank does get turned off, and guess what, chaos ensues (you have to watch the movie to find out, because I'm not telling). The sub-plot is very strange, because all these released ghosts are really going to be a part of the great Gozer's plan that started with the Hitites in 6000 B.C. What is that about? I found the plot to be a bit confusing, the characters ill-developed, and there were some definite lags in dialog. But, the movie also had some very funny scenes, and light-hearted feel, and a very large marshmallow (gotta see that part). I also found the secretary (Potts) to be a source of comic relief.The characters I felt were typical were the evil business guy who tries to shut down the ghostbusters, the sexy, girl next door lead (Weaver) whom the sleazy professor (Murray) wants a piece of, and her dorky neighbor (Moranis) who just can't catch a break. The typical plot was that the evil guy shuts down business, and from there things get ugly. Overall, the movie is worth a watch, and theme song is very catchy. But it is not going to be a part of my DVD collection any time soon.",

            "review_title": "A Tale of Two Logos",
            "content": "The two logos are the ghastly logo for \"Entertainment Rights\", whatever that is, which looks like Soviet People's Art, and the excellent Ghostbusters logo which doesn't appear on the box but is on the enclosed booklet. As usual, I differ with whoever designed the packaging, since the moaning ghost logo which began and ended the shows, and was used for bumpers (see the special features) was one of the best parts of the show. Ghostbusters was remarkable for about a million reasons. It was a show, as Filmation producer Lou Scheimer notes, in which everything came together. What that really means is that it's a live action show done on the miniscule cartoon budgets that were standard for kids' TV. It was written very fast, as cartoons are. It starred a likable, humorous cast: Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch of F- Troop, who essentially played the same parts as F-Troop and as in their cartoon voice over work. The amazing addition was Bob Burns, who plays the most lifelike gorilla probably ever seen on TV. The show is a ghostbusting take on Gangbusters, with a vaguely '20s feel: Larry dresses the part, Forrest doesn't). As the theme song says, \"I'm Spenser, he's Tracy, I'm Kong. You'd think Kong would be the gorilla; he's not. Tracy is the gorilla. Forest is Kong. There are only three sets: a graveyard, a haunted house hallway, and a room in the creepy house. The guest stars read like a whose who of (then) current television. As with cartoon voiceovers, kids' shows are wildly popular with adult actors who get to let out their kid side. Brilliantly, however, the show never played down to its audience. Kids don't need to \"get it\". They don't need to follow the plot. They relate to the characters and want to be in on the action. This is why it's so tragic that live hosts are gone. They are the natural ones to show cartoons, and form an immediate bond with kids. Ghostbusters brilliantly worked a number of repeating schticks. Every episode Spenser and Tracy would drive their old '20s car to a junk shop to get their assignment, Mission Impossible/ Get Smart style from a different unlikely object, which after playing the tape would self- destruct in five seconds. Tracy would hold it and count down in the repeating gag. Another is that Tracy would don a variety of hats, some relevant to the plot, some not. He never spoke but he grunted in a meaningful way, drew doodles and did charades to get his ideas across, and dragged an assortment of props for visual gags onto the sets. The show's credits say \"Tracy trained by Bob Burns,\" so kids thought he really was a gorilla. Burns is also known for his vast collection of sci-fi memorabilia (see the book Blast Off). One of the best extra features in this set is the interview with Burns, although the interview with Scheimer is also good. One not very great extra is an episode of Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon, which is unwatchably bad for reasons that many mid- eighties cartoons are bad. Ten years after this 1974-5 Live action show, Ghostbusters, came the 1984 Bill Murray Ghostbusters blockbuster film. I wondered then how the movie could use the same title. The conflict came during the cartoon spin-offs. DIC's The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, spun off from the movie, ran in 1986. The same year, Filmation made a cartoon version of the live action show. DIC's is by far the better cartoon because they had the comic trio from the film (mostly voiced by Arsenio Hall) as cartoon stars. Filmation's show suffered from bland, badly drawn human characters which, for whatever reason, bore no resemblance to Storch or Tucker, nor for that matter, did the gorilla to Tracy. Despite that, the closing titles feature lavish surrealistic backgrounds, testimony to the uneven artistry of mid- '80s cartoons. However, to return to the live action show, in the last episode, the song on the radio is \"Sugar Sugar\", the number one charting song by The Archies, which came from Filmation's 1968 The Archie Show. But here Filmation started with great human characters: the gang from Riverdale. Those doing Cartoons Without Cable will find Ghostbusters a wonderful change from cartoons. Play one episode along with a favorite cartoon like Garfield and Friends to make a great hour of kids' TV. There are only fifteen episodes, but Ink and Paint has done a great job with this budget set, which consists of two double- sided discs in a slip case with credits and copious notes. There's even a computer ROM feature that enables you to read all the scripts. A blast from the past recalling a magic moment when great hearts made great kids' TV.",

Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.I think the power of \"Ghostbusters\" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe.

In this film, it is fun to see the Ghostbusters trying to rid the city of pesky ghosts, goblins and poltergeists, and then facing the ultimate ghoul of all in a portal to another world, where untold evil is threaten to be released.The special effects for the ghosts were nicely done - believable and creepy at the same time. Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis did a great job on the story - exciting, adventurous and humorous. And, Ivan Reitman did a great job directing, providing us with a movie with a solid plot and story and character development.Composer Elmer Bernstein provided a catchy music score, and the famous \"Ghostbusters\" song is sung by Ray Parker Jr. in this movie, making it one of the most recognizable piece of music in the world. In addition, the ghosts Slimer and the Marshmellow Man are also introduced in this movie and became some of the most iconic and recognizable movie characters.A great movie overall that has come to symbolize the 1980s, but has stood well through the test of time - one I would watch over and over again.Grade A",

            "content": "This movie was a huge commercial success when it opened, partly because it mixed big budget visual effects with small scale human comedy, but also because the perfectly cast and designed Ghostbusters created such a memorable impression that audiences seemingly had the movie etched on their consciousness for decades afterward.Ghostbusters follows basic comedy plot tropes, broadly speaking; when three unsuccessful parapsychologists are removed from their campus, they face the reality of starting a business in a competitive, uncaring world. In doing so, they offer to capture ghosts with high end industrial lasers, and along the way, lovable goof-ball Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) falls in love with Dana Barrett, a concert cellist who initially rejects him.The movie effortlessly combines sci-fi with horror, fantasy, comedy and romance elements, and no element ever feels out of place or at odds with the underlying structure. The films classy, almost fifties retro visual style has weathered well, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs classic cinematography is put to good use in the films various comic set ups and large scale visual effects set pieces, as is Elmer Bernstein's classic score. What's little known about the film is that a T.V. series from the seventies \"The Ghost Busters\" already existed a decade earlier, although unrelated to the film except in name only, also some of the visual effects appear to be an extension of the effects created for the 1982 movie Poltergeist.Ultimately, the cast of Ghostbusters have gone on to do other things, although internet fandom has made noise about a new film for a decade or more, but none has actually come to light. Plans for a female-led Ghostbusters installment are in the works, but really, who cares? It would mean more to create something new and challenging, but the temptation to rework a successful franchise is too much for the for-profit investment model associated with Hollywood filmmaking.That said, for all of the fans/collectors/geeks/obsessives who love Ghostbusters, its official sequel from 1989 is flat in terms of fantasy OR comedy material, and its also surprising how many utterly hopeless films have been made with the names \"Ivan Reitman\" or \"Dan Ackroyd\" attached to them in the passing decades.",

            "content": "Ghostbusters is one of the most original and beloved films of all time, with it's unbeatable combination of sly humor and electrifying action, barring an inferior sequel and a questionable re-make, there's no other movie remotely similar and for over three decades it's stood the test of time, as a lasting tribute to the exceptional people who created it. If one had to place this one-of-kind movie into a category, it would have to labeled as an \"action-comedy\", because that's what this film undoubtedly brings to your screen - in massive quantity. Upon it's release in June of 1984 Ghostbusters was instant smash hit and still today is regarded as one of the best and most imaginative movies ever created, having both universal appeal and a timeless sense of charm.So whats it all about? Ghostbusters revolves around three struggling hack-scientists and their unique specialty service, surely a niche-market, of \"Supernatural Elimination\" which they offer to the people of New York City. Along the way expect to see the likes of a beautiful cellist and a nerdy accountant to become inseparably intertwined in the story, a story which plays out in a most unusual and colorful series of events, that indelibly sew the threads that which forms the fabric of this wickedly funny and off-beat tale of the supernatural. The cast of Ghostbusters (which boasts not one, but two SNL alumni) is sheer perfection and it would seem impossible for the movie to be cast any better then it was. But perhaps on even an higher level of perfection is the movies script, which is a masterpiece screen-writing (primarily the work of main-man Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis), that endows the movie with an incredible abundance of the most singularly distinctive dialog ever written for the movies; and because of this superlative level of writing talent Ghostbusters, to my way of thinking, is -by far- the most quotable movie ever. When speaking of the human talent that's behind this exceptionally witty masterpiece of the macabre, it's cast takes full advantage of a near-perfect script and deliver their performances with an infectious, often exhilarating, level of energy. The end result is a film that simply works well on all levels and it's cast of oddball characters instills the film, ever so potently, with a one-a-kind vibe that no other movie has matched. Ghostbusters is unquestionably a first-rate comedy, but it also so much more than that. But back to it's script and all the sparkling Aykroydian-genius that's behind it, but not even with a script of this caliber did all of it's ideas pan out. As proof of this, if you've seen the out-takes of this film, it appears that Bill Murray completely rewrote the first of the two scenes where they're in Danna Baretts apartment; in which the original dialog is terribly awkward and was wisely replaced with something much better (which I think results in one of the most charming scenes in the movie). \"They hate this (piano keys tinkling) that right boys it's Dr. Venkman!\" - as well as few other scenes that didn't make the final-cut at all.Not surprisingly for a movie that revolves around ghosts or more accurately the capturing or \"busting\" of ghosts, there's a lot of special effects work to speak of and the sheer quality and quantity of FX is just another part of the grand sum that is Ghostbusters. Had the movies effects not been so brilliant, well then it stands to reason that the movie simply would not have been as brilliant either. The type of effects one can expect to see in vast quantities are photographic effects, aninmatronic puppets, models and miniature work, and I think there may also be a little stop-motion magic worked into the mix. Not to forget all the great stunts and remarkably effective practical effects which are showcased throughout the film, these effects were created by means of compressed air, wires, mist machines and a lot of pyro-technics - my favorite among them literally involves a ton of shaving cream, which was dropped from a great height. As with with all other aspects of this movie, the effects have aged very well. Also there are some impressive sets to speak of such as the earthquake-simulating set and the spectacular astral gate set.Ghostbusters, not JUST a feast for the eyes, the late-great Elmer Bernstein would go onto compose his best and most experimental film score of his storied 50-year career, which is ultimately an inspired masterpiece of film composition. Bernstein's grand musical vision was brought to life by a standard full orchestra, AND was further accented -to brilliant effect- by the \"ondes martenot\", a rare electric instrument of French origin, whose tone does not sound entirely unlike that of a Theremin. This rarely used instruments (unless your Elmer Bernstein, he would go on to over-use it in future works) ethereal intonation was the perfect choice for creating the movies \"musical ghosts\" and it's unique coloring adds immensely to the overall feel of the film. Also when speaking of Ghostbusters one cannot fail to mention it's iconic and universally known theme song, a brilliantly catchy pop number with fantastic lyrical writing and singing, that which was written and performed by Ray Parker Jr. - but yet thee ole' Hughie Lewis (winner of the law-suit) may tell you differently.So if you are one of the many who saw Ghostbusters 30th anniversary re-release in the theaters, not but a few years ago, or have seen the newest Blu-ray version of the film. I think you'll agree that time has proved to be kind, irrelevant even, to this seminal classic of the supernatural. In fact you might say that Ghostbusters is ETERNAL, a testament to it's well-tested and long-standing appeal and popularity for which the reasons are as numerous, as they are well-founded. And for this reviewer, the only other movie I'd rather find myself watching is - Evil Dead II.",

Is the movie a bit cheesy along the way? Sure. But it's also iconic, and more importantly it's just plain fun. There's so much to pick up on with this movie when you watch it as an adult vs. as a kid. I laughed and laughed at the sight of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Sure, that scene is funny at any age, but you really have to be an adult to appreciate the absurdity of the towering monster roaming through the streets of New York with a huge smile on his face. I also found the acting in this movie to be great. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd steal the show, along with Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis. And I kept on thinking to myself, \"Who is that woman?\", who plays the lead actress. I was stunned when the credits rolled to realize it was Sigourney Weaver. She's quite the looker in this movie--a big improvement from the Alien movies when she didn't have hair.All in all I have to give this movie 10 stars.

            "content": "My review was written in May 1984 after a Times Square screening.Columbia's \"Ghostbusters\" is a lavishly produced but only intermittently impressive all-star comedy lampoon of supernatural horror films. Closer in scale at an estimated $32,000,000 negative cost to \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" and \"1941\" than modest spoofs such as the Bob Hope-Paulette Goddard \"The Ghost Breakers\", pic looks to good but not fantastic results in the summer b.o. Sweepstakes. (2023 NOTE: Oops! I was wrong in my prognostication!)\nOriginally conceived as a John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd vehicle called \"Ghostsmashers\" before Belushi's death in 1982, \"Ghostbusters\" under producer-director Ivan Reitman makes a fundamental error reminiscent of the atypical 1946 Abbott & Costello picture \"The Little Giant\": featuring a set of top comics but having them often work alone rather than as a team throughout. This format, together with the usual pauses to gaze at spectacular special effects, creates a comedy that works in fits and starts.The Harold Ramis-Dan Aykroyd screenplay (which, curiously, gives its writer-actors the least interesting of the lead roles), takes as its main premise the idea played straight in Michael Winner-Jeffrey Konvitz' 1977 feature \"The Sentinel\": a Manhattan apartment building inhabited by beautiful Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her nerd neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) becomes the gateway for demons from another dimension (led by the Sumerian demigod Gozer) to invade the Earth.To battle Gozer and other motley phantasms come the Ghostbusters, a rio of scientists who have been kicked off campus and are now freelance ghost catchers for hire. Dan Aykroyd is the gung-ho scientific type, Bill Murray is faking competency (he's had no higher education in parapsychology) and using the job to meet women, while Harold Rmis is he trio's technical expert; later, Ernie Hudson joins the tea as an out-of-work black man hardup for a job.Weaver is their first customer, after she has a poltergeist episode in her kitchen Servicing various other clients en route to fame, the Ghostbusters stockpile a horde of trapped ghosts which are set free when an EPA investigator (William Atherton) opposes their unsafe procedures. Soon after Weaver is possessed by a demon known as The Gatekeeper and Moranis by one called The Key Master. Together, they open the way for Gozer's invasion and a very flashy special visual effects climax.Within the top-heavy cast, it's Murray's picture, as tghe popular comedian deadpans, ad libs and does an endearing array of phsycial schtick. Aykroyd, trying too hard, gers vitually no laughs, Ramis is along for the ride and Moranis is underutilized but quite effective when given screen time. Weaver is deliciously sexy both before and after her possession, addin heavy eye makep and vamp poses to effect the transition. Annie Potts is cute as the heores' secretary.Unde multi-Oscar-winner Richaer Edlund's supervision, the film's visual effects offer quite a show, comparable in quality (most unusual for a spoof) to the targeted horror films. Several effects, such as a monster in the library and floating wraiths, recall earlier Edlund assignments \"Poltergeist\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Elsewhere, both puppet and stop-motion animation monsters provide original contributions, combining with top notch animation and design work to yield satisfying results. Problem is the effects are far better than the film vehicle containing them.",

Meanwhile they're first customer Dana Berrett gets haunted be a creature called Zuul and the team find themselves in the midst of the return of the demigod Gozer and the awakening of the dead in the city of New York.The characters amateur approach, slime spitting ghosts and a 112 ft. tall Marshmallow man, makes this movie hilarious and a true classic and is a must see for everyone. \"Call the Ghostbusters.

Bill Murray is one of the funniest guys from the 80's. He adds sarcastic humor to this film. The rest of the crew, I liked.Everything works with this film. The plot and dialogue are fantastic with each other. The special effects are great even to today's standards. I must say how wonderful the music is.

Then, when they go to the ghost event in the library, it has things in there that are so funny that it makes you wonder how the actors actually kept straight faces when they were acting this.After they leave the University and start the business \"Ghostbusters\", the movie's action scenes seriously picks up. Especially when Pete first gives the guy from the EPA a hard time, after that failing in the later shutdown of their ghost storage facility, one of my favorite moments in all of this is where Pete finds Dana floating around her room saying she is the Gatekeeper and that Dana is gone.The movie had a good ending too, with their fight against Gozer and the Staypuft Marshmallow Man.

            "content": "Immensely entertaining. Ghostbusters is one of the purest forms of entertainment to have blessed the silver screen. The premise is nothing short of ridiculous, but somehow the whole thing comes together to create a spectacularly fun time.I think I've seen this film at least twice before. However, I was quite a bit younger then, and I have wanted to revisit it many times. The thing that surprised me the most was how funny this film is. The scene where Peter visits Dana's apartment for the first time is incredible. I was laughing out loud almost the whole time. I suppose that a lot of the humour would fly over the heads of most kids, my younger self included. But it wasn't just that scene, almost the entire film is ridiculous. Certainly, the absurdity of it all creates comedy on its own, but the character interactions tend to be very funny as well.Although I didn't remember how funny Ghostbusters is, the thing that makes it such an excellent film, is its ability to entertain. I'm a huge proponent of the idea that films are above all else entertainment, and should be treated as such. This film is one of the best examples of how to do entertainment right. It's funny, it's action-packed, it has great characters, and it's overall just a great time. This is exactly the kind of movie that you put on when you just want to have some fun and eat some popcorn. You don't have to think much, if at all, and you'll have a great time. Sometimes that's all a movie needs to do, and this one does it almost perfectly.I didn't remember enjoying this film as much as I enjoyed it now. Maybe it has to do with me finally understanding the humour in it, or maybe I was just in the mood for exactly a film like Ghostbuster. Whatever the case may be, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this ridiculous and over-the-top journey. The more I watch 80s movies, the more I seem to enjoy them. There's something unexplainable about them that films nowadays lack. A sense of endless possibilities and a mood that can only be described, as carefree.I haven't had as much fun with a film in a long time, as I had with Ghostbusters. It served as an important reminder of the ability that movies can have. The ability to take you into another world and make you forget about life for a while. When a film gets it right, it's a wonderful experience. And Ghostbusters gets it very right.",

            "content": "With a new \"Ghostbusters\" film rapidly approaching, it seems like an ideal time to revisit the other three films and see how they hold up. \"Ghostbusters\" is, for me, one of those unassailable classics that I've been watching, on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray for the best part of 30 years - though I have to admit that it's been a while. It mostly holds up, though I'd love to know how I'd feel about it, if I watched it for the first time now.Three scientists, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) establish a legitimate ghost removal and storage service after their research budget is removed. Though their business proves both lucrative and controversial, one of their earliest cases, that of Dana Barratt (Sigourney Weaver) and her penthouse apartment, becomes key to the survival of New York, and perhaps even the Human race.I can accept, during this showing that some of the movie (particularly the first half) can be a bit patchy. I think that the strength, and this small weakness, of the film is that improvisational nature of it. It works for the dialogue and the character moments, but perhaps not the story. This all improves after the midway point when the Zuul/Gozer storyline really steps up and takes the film home. There are certainly a couple of moments in the film that appear different, watching them again as an adult. I don't know what I used to think was happening in the sex dream segment, but now I just question why it was included at all. I also would question what Venkman had planned for his date with Dana Barratt, if he's brought a tranquiliser with him.I disagree with the other reviewers though who say that the visual affects don't hold up. I say that, generally they do - certainly these models and puppets look better than the CGI effects from certain movies from the 90's. Its scary moments remain powerful and I have a vivid memory of not watching the librarian transformation on the VHS version. It is, primarily, a comedy though and I did still laugh at bits of the film even with this number of repeat viewings.Though I don't think it would feature on a list of my absolute favourite films anymore, \"Ghostbusters\" is an undisputed classic.",

When the university decides that they are a disgrace and a waste of university money, our heroes move to the private sector and establish \"Ghostbusters\", a company that will deal with capturing and safely storing ghosts.Initially, the Ghostbusters were on shaky ground, but over time, the number of calls and jobs began to grow and reached apocalyptic proportions. It seems that some forgotten evil god is trying to penetrate our dimension, and someone has to stand in his way.\"Ghostbusters\" is a cult classic of the eighties, the highest-grossing comedy of all time until the release of \"Home Alone\", six years later. Is this status justified? Well, it depends on the angle we look at things from.The special effects are funny from today's perspective, but they earned an Oscar nomination at the time. Since \"Ghostbusters\" is a comedy, these effects contribute to the film today perhaps more than at the time of its creation. As for other technical aspects, there is nothing worth mentioning.The story itself is nothing special. On the one hand, we have a mediocre scenario. In \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Analyze This\", Harold Ramis showed that he can do much better. On the other hand, the fantastic cast mostly saved the movie with improvised remarks and gags. A film with a crew like this just can't fail.Most of the film was carried out by the genius Bill Murray, whose charisma, facial expressions, and witty remarks are in themselves reason enough to watch \"Ghostbusters\". When you team up Bill with Dan Aykroyd, the screenwriter and lead actor of \"The Blues Brothers\", one of the best comedies of all time, who also collaborated on \"Ghostbusters\" screenplay, you get chemistry that doesn't lag far behind the one Dan had with Belushi. The remaining two Ghostbusters are played by Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson.As if this wasn't enough, two more big names were added to the cast. To open a portal that will bring the demon god to Manhattan, his followers must possess two people. The first client to the newly founded \"Ghostbusters\", for whom the character of Bill Murray totally went crazy, was none other than the heroine of \"Alien\" and \"Gorillas in the Mist\", an actress of great talent and beauty, Sigourney Weaver. The other one is Rick Moranis, a comedian we remember from the eighties' films such as \"Streets of Fire\", \"Brewster's Millions\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Spaceballs\" and \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\".And finally, we must not forget the legendary song of the same name by Ray Parker Jr., probably the most recognizable and unforgettable detail of this film.7/10.",

            "content": "Watching the trailers for Ghostbusters back in 1984, one could be forgiven for dismissing it as a silly looking, overextended Saturday Night Live or SCTV sketch. One would have been wrong. Which is why when the film actually came out, it unexpectedly became the surprise smash of the year and a much beloved comedic classic.The film opens when three parapsychologists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis) are dismissed from their cushy positions at Columbia University and decide to go into business for themselves as Ghostbusters, ridding Manhattan of its problematic paranormal denizens. Their first client is classy high society concert musician Sigourney Weaver, who is dismayed to find a Sumerian deity living in her ice box. This ultimately builds into an apocalyptic battle atop her bizarre apartment complex.Given the number of productions completely unable to meld the combination of successful comedic bits and dazzling special effects, the fact that Ghostbusters seems to flow so effortlessly and hits the mark so often is really quite astounding. People not interested in the comedy can actually enjoy the light-hearted action and effects, people not interested in the action can enjoy the comedy, and those who like both will have it made here. Plus, watching the film more than 30 years later, it manages to entertain new audiences as well as keep prior fans coming back for repeated viewings.That is not to say that the film does not have a couple of minor nuisance issues. While the cast is by and large great, that is not to say they get equally funny material, which is a shame. Murray pretty much plays his usual persona of smug smart-ass in the lead role and he has a lot of fun material to back him up. He and Weaver have some amusing banter and chemistry, although the latter is largely forgotten for much of the middle section, before being allowed some fun comedic moments near the climax. While one must give a nod to the generosity of Aykroyd and Ramis in handing over nearly all of the funny material to Murray, I am not sure it was the wisest maneuver to give their own characters so little to do. Ramis (always an underrated comedic actor) at least doubles down on his world class deadpan as the most techno-savvy of the men, but poor Aykroyd really suffers for this sacrifice. Although no one comes off worse from this than Ernie Hudson, who is a late arrival as the last Ghostbuster, and literally has nothing to do other than be the token black guy.Oddly, while the other three Ghostbusters are busy allowing Murray to steal the film, supporting players Rick Moranis (as Weaver's nerdy neighbor drawn into the mayhem) and Annie Potts (as the Ghostbusters' acerbic receptionist) make some really strong impressions. As do some of the bit players, with my personal favorite being whoever that old woman was who comes out of her apartment to investigate the racket made by the creature trashing Moranis' apartment and her reaction to it. Priceless! The film could have benefited from a central villain. The late arrival of a pasty William Atherton as an EPA agent out to close the GBs down just does not cut it. Largely, because Atherton essayed so many similar roles at the time and the thought of the EPA, which was a de-fanged government agency even in the 1980s (moreso today) as having any kind of clout to do much of anything is in itself a comical notion.Director Ivan Reitman has never been as assured behind the camera as with this film. The special effects are amazing and do not forget to be comical as well. It would have been so easy to just go for broke and ride out solely on the visual effects at the climax, but the film remembers to even keep the effects comical. Who can forget the first appearance of the destroyer of the world - the hilariously deranged sight of a giant marshmallow man laying waste to Manhattan? Or, for that matter, the introduction to the legendary Slimer ghost, which culminates in Murray's memorable line.There is very little that does not work for this film and continue to do so decades later. And one can also not underestimate the added success of Ray Parker's catchy title tune. \"Who you gonna call?\"",

Soundtracks has been great for overhyped movies at times and it works. When they use the Ghostbusters theme, it's only at the end or the worst times.The plot. It was just a numb and dull plot hyping up this cool devastation the queen is gonna make. So the whole movie focuses only on that buildup. During the buildup of that, about one person of the Ghostbuster squad was even likeable. The pedophile's sarcastic tone became annoying (and I love sarcasm), the \"leader\" I suppose had no real characteristic I saw, the smart one was actually likeable, and the black dude had no motivation or reason to even join. And they didn't even show his talents. So is he just useless?So much of the comedy was centered around the pedohile character which made comedy not even a point in this.

Ghostbusters is one of those rare films that manages to stand head and shoulders above its peers for its originality, sharp wit, masterful storytelling and a cast of humorous oddballs.But what really sets this movie apart is the fact that it doesn't rely on pop culture references or inappropriate jokes, aimed to make the toddlers in the audience giggle. Rather it relies on sarcasm, visual creativity and the same brand of randomness that made the Monty Python group so successful. In essence, it's a timeless film, which humour stems from the human brilliance and not the lowest common denominator. It's a comedy film that even the most high brow film snobs can enjoy, as it doesn't treat its audience like idiots. There are several jokes that you can miss entirely and only get later when you have time to mull over the dialogue, which in my opinion is an extremely good thing.Furthermore, it's a very quotable film. The dialogue is at times razor sharp and some of the verbal gymnastics between the main characters still make me blink my eyes in surprise. The cast is also very talented, and no less could have been accepted for this script, but luckily they managed to get the big boys and girls to play these characters. The chemistry between Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver is especially memorable.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the special effects haven't aged all that well. Some of them are still surprisingly good, like the ghost trapping beams, which should not be crossed, but some, like the guardian \"dogs\" of Zuul look really fake. It doesn't ruin the film, in some cases it even adds to the film's charm, but it's still an eyesore in certain scenes. And the ending has a certain amount of \"love it or hate it\" quality to it. I lean more towards hate it, but only slightly.All in all this a classic. A comedy film that managed to create its own universe, its own cosmos and mythology. It did that with ambitious story, clever writing and a great cast of characters. It worked back then and it still does. Find it, see it, love it. Force other people to watch it.",

She hires the Ghostbusters, who discover that all the ghostly activities were linked and including in the city.So what makes Ghostbusters work? Lots of things, a script with a good story, jokes and gags, with Ivan Reitman skill with action and special effects. The effects were spectacular for its time. It was easily Ivan Reitman's best film. What really works for this film is the cast. Bill Murray offers an excellent deadpan performance, having great timing with his jokes, showing why he is one of best comedic actor from America. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also excellent comedic performers, having a different approach to Murphy. I enjoyed Annie Potts as the gruff, tough native New Yorker. Sigourney Weaver also rarely stars in a bad film. She beings in an originality person's perspective to the film. It would have been easy for this film to fall into slapstick territory; but luckily the writers and director avoid this trap, using more clever vebral gags and sharp wit, making the film a funny experience.This is a rare example that big budget comedy can work. It's a must see.",

            "content": "Something about this movie doesn't really gel for me anymore. It definitely used to be a movie I loved. I remember having a lunchbox with the logo on it. I remember even loving the second one. My latest rewatch of this was one of the strangest and flattest experiences I've had with a previously beloved movie.I'll start with the biggest gripes: firstly, it's sloppy. Winston is an almost comical afterthought, and the whole absurd (and hastily dropped) story line with Peck is shoehorned into the movie because they'd written themselves into a corner with no way of linking the story line with Sigourney Weaver into the main narrative. The earthquake in front of the apartments just before the climax is pointless and only seems to be in the movie so it could reach the allotted running time. Secondly, and it pains me to say this, for the most part I don't find it funny. There are jokes that I enjoy, and Rick Moranis is so, so perfect, but it's just really not what I'm looking for anymore. Finally, I was bored, and that was the most surprising thing to me. In many cases the more I'm familiar with a movie or song the greater my love grows. In this case, it just left me waiting for the parts I thought I liked, which never seemed to come.This sounds like a pretty negative review. I think that's just the disappointment talking. I didn't hate anything about this. There are scenes and performances that I really like. The ghosts and demons are fun. The theme song is my jam. It was just an empty experience when I thought it would be anything but. Though I certainly would prevent anyone from watching this if they were so inclined. I just wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone anymore.",

            "content": "Ghostbusters when released in 1984 was a smash hit with audiences around the world, and to this day we all still chant that ever famous theme song.  The plot is set in New York City, where supernatural beings have been appearing to people, so a few down on their luck pedestrians make a run for the money by making a fake ghostbusting company-the Ghostbusters.   Bill Murray, Dan Akyroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver all make the perfect comedy team. Bill Murray uses his classic SNL wise-cracking style, Dan Akyroyd plays a character who is a bit shy and nothing like Bill. He abides by the rules society sets and never speaks his real thoughts on subjects. Rick Moranis is the perfect next door nerd type, always hitting on Sigourney Weaver, who pushes him aside softly.\n The directing style of Harold Ramis helps this film too, with some great shots of the city, and excellent cinematography. There is one hilarious scene at the end where Akyroyd thinks up a worst nightmare and it comes true, unleashing the Stay Puffed man upon New York City. What may now be considered bad graphics, back in 1984 the effects they used on the Stay Puffed marshmallow man were state of the art and mesmerizing. It is a very funny scene, and seeing a diabolical Stay Puffed man unleashed upon New York is worth the price of the film alone.  The screenplay is very interesting, and very original. Harold Ramis always finds very original films to direct, and he hit a home run with Ghostbusters. If you have never seen Ghostbusters, go rent it. If you have, see it again. It's an excellent family film that now may be forgotten largely by most people, but for the people who remember it, the film will never die, and we will keep on chanting that famous theme song.4/5 stars-JOHN ULMER",

And I have to say what I got was a major disappointment. In fact I believe it to be highly over rated.For one thing, none of the characters had any depth. They either spewed one liners like they had a fatal disease, explained the plot, or were sex objects.SPEAKING OF SEX OBJECTS; This movie is quite sexist. There are two main female characters in this film ,neither of whose names I can remember, ( I watched this half an hour ago) one of whom is pining for one of the male leads, the other who is possessed and gets turned into a sexy goddess dog... Thing.And just too add to that, ghost busters isn't that... Well, funny. I think I laughed out once in this movie, and that was the first scene where Bill Muray's character is attempting to seduce some woman through his weird physic test... Something . ( I don't really know, it's never explained that well) The rest of it was unfunny one liners or bad situational comedy.But Ghostbusters worst crime is that it's just kinda... Boring. The plot is unremarkable end of the world stuff with a dumb Bill Murray's character trying to seduce Sigourney Weaver's character subplot thrown in there too.So in the end, if you like this movie, by all means, go ahead like it! Who am I to stop you? But personally, I thought it to be incredibly unremarkable. Not bad, just unremarkable(For the record, I love all the actors in this movie. Just not in this)",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I grew up singing the theme song, and watching the cartoons The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters, it's only when I grew up that I finally got to watching the movie, directed by Ivan Reitman (Twins, Kindergarten Cop, Evolution, No Strings Attached). Basically, Dr. Peter Venkman (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd, also writing) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis, also writing) are parapsychology professors at Columbia University investigating the paranormal. A ghost manifests at the New York Public Library, but their first encounter is cut short when the university Dean Yager (Jordan Charney) fires them and discredits their research. In response, the establish a paranormal entity investigation and removal company called \"Ghostbusters\", operating from a disused fire station. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow. Cello player Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) has a paranormal encounter in her apartment and calls the Ghostbusters. She says she saw a demonic dog-like creature that uttered a single word: \"Zuul\". Meanwhile, the Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost, Slimer, from the Sedgewick Hotel. They have failed to properly test their equipment, causing chaos and destruction at the hotel, but they are successful in capturing the ghost, and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit at the fire station. While Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building, Peter continues meeting Dana and tries to seduce her. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous for their exploits, and they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to cope with the growing demand. The Ghostbusters must also confront the suspicions of Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck (William Atherton), who asks to evaluate their equipment. Later, Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to \"Gozer the Gozerian\", a shape-shifting god of destruction. Returning home, Dana is possessed by Zuul, and another entity posseses her neigbour, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). Peter finds the possessed Dana/Zuul, who claims to be \"the Gatekeeper\". Police officers bring Louis to Egon, possessed he claims to be \"Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster\". The Ghostbusters agree to keep Dana and Louis separated. Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. While Louis/Vinz and Dana/Zuul unite at the apartment building. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal Dana's building was designed by Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult, with the building constructed as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and begin the apocalypse. With supernatural chaos spreading across the city, the Mayor (David Margulies) is convinced to release the Ghostbusters. The Ghostbusters travel to the apartment building roof as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer transforms into a woman and disappears when they attack, but her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters \"choose the form of the destructor\". Ray inadvertently thinks of a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears in the form of a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against Egon's earlier advice not to cross the proton energy streams, they fire at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys the marshmallow monster avatar, banishing Gozer back to its dimension, and closes the gate. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage, are praised by the crowd as heroes and drive away in the Ecto-1. Also starring Toy Story's Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, Michael Ensign as Hotel Manager, Slavitza Jovan as Gozer, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Alice Drummond as Librarian. Murray is great as the deadpan leader, Aykroyd is likeable, Ramis is good as the amusing boffin, and there is good support from Hudson, Weaver and Moranis. It is well scripted, with witty humour and the occasional slapstick, some of the ghostly creatures are genuinely eerie, the special effects are terrific, and the finale is wonderfully daft, it made a big impression at the time, and will continue to do so, a fantastically fun supernatural comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and Best Song for the Ray Parker Jr. Title song (it won the BAFTA and was nominated the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",

I loved the movie when I was young, and then, when I grew up, it became even better when many jokes and plot points I didn't get as a kid, finally made sense. But the question remains, why this movie is so good?.I think the enduring charm of Ghostbusters is that is a perfect mix of comedy and horror. The movie is a comedy, but it takes itself completely seriously in its absurd premise, so the movie feels completely grounded in reality. It's basically our world, but with real ghosts in it (I think it helps that Dan Aykroid actually believes in all this weird stuff). This makes al the tension in the movie feel real, and the action looks compelling and believable. The effects sometimes have some failures in some animations, but all in all, it looks great, and really spooky.Regarding the comedy, the main point is that the movie is not over-indulgent in its humor. Of course, Bill Murray is the funniest character in the movie, but he is restrained, and, although he's basically a meta-guy of sorts in midst of the ridiculousness of the plot, in the end he is really commited in the action, and gives an excellent performance. He is, of course, the fan-favorite character of the movie, but let's not forget all the rest of the cast, which makes this movie a memorable experience.I think Ghostbusters is perhaps the best comedy of the 80s. I think to further describe it would be redundant. My recomendation is just watch it, and enjoy it.10/10",

Bill Murray does steal the show with some of the best dialogue and one liners you will hear in a comedy.

As a child the movie scared the s#*t out of me, but now watching it as an adult its just a wonderfully enjoyable timeless classic which is to be respected when you compare it to the total c#*p that comes out of Hollywood these days. The eighties were a time of fantastic blockbusters from Back to the Future to Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Three parapsychologists (Nerdy Egon, well-meaning and enthusiastic but bumbling Ray and sarcastic joker Peter) are fired from their cushy jobs as researchers at a New York university and decide to go into business for themselves.They are joined later by a fourth member of the team, Winston who is not as prominent a character as the other three (his role was allegedly reduced when they couldn't get Eddie Murphy to play him) which is a shame because he arguably gets some of the funniest and most memorable lines in the movie. I still crease up with laughter when he, as the only black Ghostbuster tells the mayor, \"I've seen s*** that'll turn you WHITE!\"For me, the charm of Ghostbusters lies in the details; they get about town in a hearse and use an abandoned New York fire station as their base. A lesser movie wouldn't have put any thought or effort into these details.The movie is sometimes unfairly classed as a children's movie, and sure, everyone I know who watched Ghostbusters as a child loved the big showdown with the giant Stay-Puft Marshmallow man at the end, but our heroes smoke, drink, swear and even indulge in a little adult fantasy humour.

They remove a ghost from a hotel dining room, causing a mess, then remove another from a woman's apartment...but big trouble starts when they find they have trapped the god Gozer.The special effects are very good, especially for the 1980's, and the main characters interact properly and play everything straight. The ending, when the ghosts come out in force, actually make the story genuinely suspenseful and you wonder what will happen.The whole story could have ended up cheesy or silly, but the movie manages to get everything right so that it is genuinely entertaining.",

I officially got the video for my fifth birthday, however I snuck an early look at my birthday presents and pinched the unwrapped video, which means that I have been watching this film for twelve years through bad times and good times. Whenever I was glum it was there to cheer me up. Whenever I was bored it was there to entertain me. It's mix of comedy, fantasy, sci-fi and horror means that there is always something new to pick up on and to enjoy especially when watching the original widescreen version. Which leads me onto the superb DVD. I live in England and import many DVDs from America but none have ever excited me as much as the Ghostbusters one. The remastered widescreen print, the 5.1 channel sound, the live commentary, the deleted scenes, the OK OK I'll shut up now. I like, no... I love this film, if you haven't seen it - watch it - you will love it too. If you know someone who doesn't like it spurn them, mock them, if you really must then sympathise with them but most of all, the single most important thing is - try and convert them.",

Harold Ramis plays Dr. Egon Spengler. Egon is the human encyclopedia of the group. Later in the film they are joined by Winston Zeddemorre played by Ernie Hudson, he's the cool one.

            "content": "I loved the movie as a child and even watched the cartoon that somehow turned Slimer into a good guy. Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures.The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straight man, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly.In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper. Then there are Annie Potts as the token New Yorker secretary and Ernie Hudson, the only ghostbuster without a Dr. in his name that keeps the group grounded and keeps thing in perspective from a regular guy's point of view.The movie itself maybe not be as quote worthy as other 80's classics and some of the CG has not stood the test of time (where George Lucas when you need him) but the movie as a whole is still worth watching especially with Halloween coming up. So fire up the DVD and let the Ray Parker Jr. blare (which I don't think sounds anything like Huey Lewis' I Want a New Drug). And don't forget to roast some Staypuft Marshmallows over the fire.",

After their research grant is stopped. They start their own business as Ghostbusters and make a name for themselves as paranormal activity increases in the city.Despite an overzealous environmental inspector trying to shut them down. The Mayor calls on the Ghostbuster to save New york as ancient demigod named Gozer brings upon the end of days.Ghostbusters pulled a neat trick of balancing comedy and big special effects. It really is a tour de force of comedy horror done in almost a family friendly way.Murray is seen as the coolest but he is also sleazy. Just watch Venkman hit on Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who is experiencing supernatural activity in her apartment.However the trio work well as a team with even some initial scepticism about the paranormal. They are later joined by a fourth member of the team Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) who is the more religious one.Plaudits should be given to Ramis and Aykroyd who wrote the script. Together with director Ivan Reitman, they managed to inject some magical chemistry.The ending does look a bit rushed especially after the Marshmallow Man is conjured up. Some of the special effects looked a bit ropey when the movie was released and aged even more since then.It is still a movie that attracts a new generation of viewers even though it is not suitable for younger kids in its unedited form.",

Whereas other sci-fi comedies such as Back To The Future feel timeless, Ghostbusters screams '80s at every turn. In some cases this works, such as the design of the Ectomobile and all the gadgets, however other elements haven't aged well.There is no real flow for the film, and whilst that contributes to an immediate story, a lot of context and background feels lost. More than anything, when placed in front of their first ghost, the team seem relatively unphased. The climactic villain isn't built into the story from the early stages despite its opening introduction, leading to the entire backstory being explained in one fleeting conversation. The plot all seems like an afterthought to the theme of hopping about to catch non-descript ghosts. Moreover, the special effects are very poor given the standard of other films of the time, but that probably adds to the nostalgia.A largely ad-libbed script, the leading trio have good chemistry without the acting being superb. It is very much a Murray-quipped led dialogue, and he takes lead from the start. Playing his usual character, a viewer's enjoyment of the film is utterly dependent on whether they enjoy his humour. The wider cast are good, Weaver with the best performance in terms of acting ability, but overall, every bit of filmmaking is secondary to an excellent first-of-its-kind concept on a Blockbuster level.",

But it is a classic in the same way that \"Casablanca\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" are. It is one of Hollwood's most successful comedies, and for good reason: it's a very funny and spooky movie.The plot is pretty simple: After getting fired from their university, three scientists, Drs. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves catching ghosts. They soon get more than they bargained for when a demi-god tries to move in and destroy the world.Murray. Akroyd. Ramis. Two are SNL alumni and all are regarded as some of the great comic geniuses of our time. Murray has been leaning more towards drama these days (and Wes Anderson's piles of crap), Akroyd's career has come to a bit of a stand still and generally relegated to cameos, and Ramis has taken to directing films. All three are gifted comedians, and this is a representation of their best work. Murray is terrific as the sarcastic and egotistic jerk, Akroyd is hilarious as the energetic nerd, and Ramis is just as good as the anti-social nerd. Also in the cast are Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, the skeptical musician who becomes their first client, and the target of Venkman's charms, Rick Moranis, Dana's nerdy neighbor who is so nerdy that he puts Stantz and Spengler to shame, and Ernie Hudson is great as the new recruit. And of course William Atherton is on hand to be the nosy asshole (which he does with great ability).Ivan Reitman was the go-to guy of comedies throughout the 80's and mid-90s. His style is professional, but solid, and he knows how to make a movie funny. \"Ghostbusters\" is easily his best film. It's funny, but also spooky. There are a few chilling moments in the film, particularly towards the end.There isn't anyone alive who won't have a great time watching \"Ghostbusters.\"",

For a movie I have not seen in nearly 30 years, I enjoyed it for what it was, a fun filled humorous movie that still is worth bringing out every now and then.",

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" is just one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life. Although I can't think of a person who hasn't already. Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.I think the power of \"Ghostbusters\" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular. For some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.Yet \"Ghostbusters\" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and is one of those movie's I have fond childhood memories of. 8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

I usually also Find them to be a bit overrated because there respected a lot since they're classics. However, Ghostbusters 1984 Just Hits the target every single time with its effects, performances and CGI. It's a timeless treasure and is that for reasons. Its effects while they're outdated are perfect because that makes ghostbusters more of a creepy film. Which makes the film so much more fun to watch since that's what ghostbusters really is. Bill Murray...He was Flippin' Hilarious. Everything he does in a ghostbusters film is totally bonkers. The main theme when you hear it playing totally puts a smile on your face since you know that the ghostbusters are here ready to catch some ghosts and save New York from its mystery Sightings. The stay Puft Marshmallow man scene was iconic. I'm that type of guy who likes big monster movies (Like Godzilla) which is why I Have to give some major praise here. It looked very Realistic and It's imaginative. It feels iconic to see it every time. The performances was Spectacular and the direction was amazing towards this film, it's nostalgic and timeless. And finally, Some of the CGI Portrayed very nicely especially with the ghosts. I have no complaints with this film whatsoever. It currently sits at my 4th Favourite Film Of All Time.Trivia, this is a timeless treasure that should be shown to everyone as well as the kids. This is without a doubt the correct called movie that was shown to theatres back in the day. With another great sequel that it got. Btw: Don't watch Ghostbusters 2016. This and its sequel are better.Rating: 10/10.",

A terrific supporting comedy cast surrounds him, but this is really Murray's film. The FX look kinda cheezy today, but they were superb way back when. The ending is, again, cheezy, but the giant marshmallow man is pure genius. Gotta love that car, too (Ghostmobile?).

It's not the subject matter... it's not the acting... not the humor, nor the music, the effects... what makes it so popular even after all these years is that it's a great slice of the 80's. The music, the clothing, the dialog, the script, the effects... everything is so definite 80's that the film is almost entirely irresistible. The plot is quite original and has a pretty good pace, as well. It's interesting to see these characters develop, even though they are kind of thin... and that each of them is basically the same type of role the respective actors usually portray. The acting is pretty standard. The characters are neither particularly well-written or well-developed. The humor is pretty good, but not really anything special. Not the best of 80's films... but good. The special effects vary, but mostly they're typically 80's... some of them are quite good, though. The dialog is good... some of it is very well-written... and most of it is nicely delivered as well. The film is about three scientists who are certain of the existence of ghosts, and as all of their hopes(or, rather, fears) are confirmed, they decide to make a team of ghost-fighters(or ghost-busters). The rest of the film deals with their fighting the ghosts in an entertaining, humorous and exciting manner. The film is rarely dull, never drags and is an instant classic due to the very 80's qualities of it. It's an entertaining and exciting ride through the 80's, and a film that won't be forgotten any time soon. I recommend it to fans of Ivan Reitman and the actors, and of course anyone who enjoys an 80's film. It's worth watching simply for that 80's charm. 8/10",

When extra-terrestrial activity threaten mankind then the guys with the proton packs are called into action to vanquish the problem. Directed by Ivan Reitman who previously had success with Bill Murray in the mediocre comedy Meatballs as well as the army comedy Stripes. Murray is ripe with sarcasm, which conceals his sense of wonder when a woman's body slowly elevates in front of him. Dan Ackroyd seems to be the technician, while Harold Ramis is the analyst. Sigourney Weaver appears as a customer whose refrigerator is the gate way to another dimension. This leads to Murray's constant flirtations until she is transformed into a demonic dog. Rick Moranis plays Weaver's neighbor whom she pursues in her deformed image. His dimwit nature has him constantly locking himself out of his apartment. Eventually he is being pursued by a demonic dog. Clever and detailed screenplay with exquisite special effects highlighted with ghostly figures including Slimer the green hungry ghost, and the giant Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man that terrorizes the city. Tremendous fun filled balance of humour and special effects that serves as an example of our curiosity of the unknown. Score: 10 / 10",

I remember it has having some really impressive fireworks, fast-paced action, funny repartee, good characters... Gosh, in fact it's pretty lame!

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" is one of the most classic movies of the 1980s, and it's also one of the best comedies of all time. But it's mostly one of my favorite movies of all time. After losing their jobs at the Columbia University, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, star as scientists who team up to become a group of natural ghost hunters named the Ghostbusters. They later research demonic spirits haunting a woman's apartment. Sigourney Weaver portrays the victim of a haunted spirit in her apartment named Dana, who has a geeky neighbor named Louis Tully, portrayed hilariously by Rick Moranis, delivering the best performance in the movie, who awkwardly tries to hit on Dana. With some unique and cheesy visual effects that are actually awesome, a cast of characters that deliver light-hearted laughs, a script with some classic humor, and an impressive directing job by Ivan Reitman, \"Ghostbusters\" really works as a classic ghost comedy. The movie contains a list of some of the best actors in the typical 80s comedy including Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Weaver, Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson. I actually laughed a lot with this movie, and I think it deserves to be laughed with. Every moment is memorable and classic like my two favorite scenes: the Slimer situation at the hotel, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man situation at the end. From beginning to the end credits, I'm still entertained by a movie that delivers light-hearted laughs, a golden cast, and some neat visual effects. This just proves that \"Ghostbusters\" improves more than it did back then. Oh, and let's not forget the awesome theme song that won't leave your head for the rest of the day. \"Ghostbusters\", in my review, \"an entertaining treat of spooky comedy\".",

So with the new movie been coming, I believe it is time to review the movie that mixed science, paranormal and comedy. The story is well known ,but for those who have no idea about it (I pity you) , a team of scientist is trying to find ways in order to track down and capture ghosts in order to get fame and money for their research and for Bill Murrey get lade.Now let's analyze why did it get so much fame. Is it good as a flick?Yes it is definitely entertaining as hell, with great one liners, jokes that we still use and of course it epic theme song who everyone know, from the movie ,the television series (from there I learn it) or videos from YouTube. Also it manages to bring two genres that usually don't mix well science fiction and fantasy with great results! And Bill *beeping* Murray, he deeds no introduction, he is awesome in every movie he is in ,except from Garfield.Does the effects hold up nowadays?Not very well, I mean they are nice to look at and they don't feel fake. However comparing them with what has come... there is no comparison they haven't aged very well and today even a ten-year-old can say the difference between the effects and the costumes on scene. But there aren't so bad there are joke ,are still descent.Final question: Do we need a sequel?The trailer for the up coming flick is banded and some say it will suck loyally ,but I believe we have to see the final product in order to say if it is good or not. However when Ghostbusters 2 came out many said that it was unnecessary and it was a shame for the Logo ,but after more than two decades it has get a great cult following with many saying now that the backlash was an overkill and why we don't have a ghost busters 3.In general, cross fingers and hope that it will good and that fun overreacted ,it won't be the first time!",

Meanwhile, the film transcends genres with magical elements backed up by excellent production design. From the proton packs to the Marshmallow Man, so many supernatural components of Ghostbusters are iconic despite not being the focus of the movie. In reality, Ghostbusters is a straightforward comedy about average joes starting a business. The extravagant sets, visuals, and plot points merely accentuate that comedy. Because prime craft went into both the core humor and the surrounding atmosphere, Ghostbusters can't be replicated. Even if studios poured blockbuster budgets into simple comedies, it's unlikely to gel like Ghostbusters.Interesting fantasy is rare, witty comedy is rarer. Successfully fusing those two is nearly impossible (just look at the sequels). It works here because every role is played perfectly. The focus is rightfully on the sharp humor, complete with defined characters, playful edits, and supreme acting. The tone is serious enough to maintain integrity. The sound design heightens jokes and scares. The special effects are elaborate without overindulgence. And the classic theme song solidifies the mood. Ultimately, Ghostbusters nails every mark, making it universally loved and one of the greatest comedies ever.Writing: 9/10\nDirection: 8/10\nCinematography: 7/10\nActing: 9/10\nEditing: 8/10\nSound: 8/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 10/10\nProduction Design: 9/10\nCasting: 10/10\nEffects: 9/10Overall Score: 8.7/10.",

So much so, it should never be considered an adventure or supernatural action movie up front; it should, by and far, be under the comedy section. And I'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there's barely anything on screen but Bill Murray's comic genius delivery.While I might have seen this in theatres \u2013 I was only ten when released, I don't recall. Unfortunately, my family viewed very few films back in the early eighties and I didn't start my movie obsession until the late eighties. I know I caught it somewhere, sometime following the release and did like it, but never, ever appreciated it until I got older. I don't think I was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film.Yes, the movie made a ton. Sure, it was a bona fide summer blockbuster. But, I think people just expected such quality back then, they probably had no idea how influential, how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact. For, I see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so, that are strictly made for profit. Made to be released, one after the next, while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a Redbox a couple of months later. Movies with very little heart inserted, too much CGI and less care taken. Despite just \"being a comedy,\" Ghostbusters was made correctly, down to the core.Three paranormal doctors/buddies at a university find themselves out on the street in New York just as their ghost theories become reality. Hilariously gathering the funds to make it big in the Big Apple, they open the Ghostbusters pest control business and take off\u0085eventually.One of their first clients is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver,) a tough, but vulnerable broad who has an extra visitor in her refrigerator. While 1/3 'Buster at the time, Peter (Murray,) is more infatuated with her than her ghost fridge, they do follow up on her story while simultaneously capturing ghosts in the city and rise to fame.Her storyline might be more of final clue for the upside in business for the Ghostbusters and then things get real.Above all else in this movie was the flawless performance from Murray. While every single actor involved was also fantastic, namely Harold Ramis as Egon and Weaver's Dana, Murray's Peter was pitch-perfect. His deadpan humor was so great, that I almost feel guilty for not appreciating Dan Aykroyd's Raymond role more, or Rick Moranis and Annie Potts in their third-tier, but important characters.Don't get me wrong; on the whole, they all did great. I just couldn't keep my focus much further than Murray during this film.Beyond Murray and the wonderful supporting cast, was the infamous and beloved title song ('in' due to the countless times it was played,) a good score, special effects decent for the times and fairly good cinematography.This movie screamed what I love about Summer Blockbusters, but haven't seen in about two decades. Sure, there have been plenty of great films; fun and exciting and memorable films. But, rarely will I see one that's more heart than just trying for the Box Office dollar. I miss these types of movies.Well, I don't have to any more. For, I bought this one on BluRay and can revisit the \"good ole days\" any time I feel like it. Recommended!",

Why hasnt this comedy aged?The good: terrific actors, who simply perform at their comical best. It was at the height of Saturday Night Live, with (some say) the best SNL group ever, which featured Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd to \"just name a few\". These guys are comedy geniuses. And they used a lot of improvisation, just as they did in SNL. Simply watch the face of Bill Murray carefully, during some scenes he sometimes cant surpress his laughter WHILE acting, because the jokes were not scripted.More good: throw in a gorgeous, deadly venomous actress like Sigourney Weaver playing a terrific character of a seductive female monster and fireworks are going off.Even more good: the jokes are brilliant. They just are. And that is all it needs to be. But it's more. The direction was tightknit, the special effects (however cheesy) were a perfect fit for comedy, the soundtrack was lovely and let's not forget the excellent spookiness of it, ALL these details just were right on.They truly nailed it with this comedy. IT'S A TRUE COMEDY CLASSIC. To be enjoyed by young and old. This will definitely put a smile on everyone's face. What a joy to see it again!

            "content": "Alright we're talking cultural Phenomenon here...Who Ya Gonna Call? The song, the action figures, the cartoons...this started it all. Does all that make it good?? No. But it was. It was brilliant and funny, and scary, and action packed and made for adults. The eighties was a key time when film makers realized that adults actually wanted comedy for them. John Candy, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, these guys did their best comedy work during this time. Ghostbusters was and still is the most brilliant creation of Dan Akroyd and one of the most entertaining films as well.Ghostbusters although it seems to have become a childhood type thing was not made for children. Some of the ghost scenes and more scary scenes are easy for adults but could be quite disturbing to children. Plus the numerous sexual situations. The cast of this film couldn't be any more perfect which is funny considering how much the cast changed from who Akroyd wanted and who they got. Bill Murray in one of his best comedic roles becomes almost over used in his portrayal as Dr. Peter Venkman. Murray has to be one of the only comedic actors who can run that borderline between being funny and cute, to being annoying and overused (ie: Will Ferrell) His character runs that line but has some of the best and most memorable scenes. Akroyd's Ray Stanz is excitable and eager and holds the team together along with Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler. Ramis seems to just fit right in which is strange because he doesn't really fit the profile for the rest of the team. Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, Murray's love interest and the female lead of the film does a great job as well. Her and Murray have some great scenes and she gets to go from Upper class reserved woman to possessed over sexed demon.Ernie Hudson...well Hudson is a great actor but he is underused and strangely pointless for the cast. There was never a need for a fourth ghost buster and he gets rather left out most of the time. Although he does get to deliver the infamous closing line of the film \"I love this town!\" Ivan Reitman who is an amazing director when it comes to making films that people love and making them just fun to watch does a great job of keeping everything interesting and keeping the story flowing. His idea of showing us how they got started was brilliant. I don't think a remake of this film could ever exist because you could never get the overall chemistry that came out of this cast which is one of the things that made it great along with their abilities to deliver their lines. The film doesn't just have one featured story but instead we see how they get started, their first ghost capture and all the ghosts in the middle along with the amazing hit theme song. If you haven't seen this original eighties classic...well I'm surprised but even if you have watch it again and again because it's one that'll live forever as one of the most entertaining films in history. 9/10",

            "content": "I once saw the part of this film where the Ghostbusters hit the headlines while Ray Parker Jr's theme song is played but what made me want to watch this film in full the most was the \"Don't cross the streams\" part of the dialogue being used as the sound clip for the 11 Second Club's March 2014 competition, so I decided to rent the DVD. On my first full viewing, I was so tired that I fell asleep for part of it, thus making it harder for me to follow the story, so I paused it and came back to it later. I initially gave this film a 6/10 but after having found the film easier to follow second time around due to being more awake, I upgraded my rating to a 7 because most of the film is engaging with a few minor flaws.First off, I found the acting from Rick Moranis overdone for his character Louis Tully. Secondly, the pacing was uneven with the part between the headline-hitting sequence and the climax with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man being the slowest despite some effective scenes such as Louis and Dana becoming possessed (the view of Central Park as they embrace is beautiful as is the accompanying orchestral piece) and several ghosts taking over New York. Thirdly, the animation on the horned demons was jerky and a bit slow.Moving onto the positives, the theme song, despite being played three times throughout the film, is catchy and memorable while Elmer Bernstein's musical score is at its best when it is chilling and powerful. The animation on the ghosts, especially Slimer, was better than that on the horned demons and the Marshmallow Man was generally well done and the scanimation used for the proton streams to capture the ghosts was adequate. Moranis's overacting aside, the acting from the rest of the cast was subtly done, especially from Bill Murray and the late Harold Ramis. Annie Potts (who later went on to voice Bo Peep in the first two 'Toy Story' films) as the Ghostbusters receptionist Janine and Sigourney Weaver as Dana were surprising additions to the cast. A lot of the dialogue is memorable, especially the \"Don't cross the streams\" part and while the Ghostbusters base is run-down, the hotel dining room when the Ghostbusters catch Slimer is elaborate and the scenery of Central Park is stunning. I also liked the ghostly drone-sounding siren on the Ghostbusters' car, the haunting beginning at the library and the well-paced ending where Slimer surprisingly flies towards the screen.Overall, 'Ghostbusters' is a mostly entertaining horror film with its music, dialogue and the majority of special effects being its best features.",

            "content": "'Ghostbusters' was one of those films where lightning just struck in all the right places and was - seemingly - impossible to recapture. The story is so simple that it's amazing no one ever tried to do it before - four men set up a business capturing ghosts. End of. It could have been awful. I'm pleased to say it was perfect.Recently, I've read that all sorts of actors were attached the to the project before the final cast was signed. I don't know what it would be like with anyone but Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson (oh, and Sigourney Weaver is along for the ride, too - no bad thing to also have 'Ripley' on the cast list). They made a direct sequel which - sort of - worked (I liked it, but the popular consensus is that it was vastly inferior to its predecessor) and then a half remake/half reboot in 2016 (and the least said about that, the better). Neither direct attempts, nor any half-baked rip-offs ever lived up to the original and I doubt any ever will.Like I say, it's first and (possibly main) selling point is its simplicity. We get to know all major characters straight away and none require any lengthy plot explanations to 'explain' who they are and their various motivations. The action (i.e. appearance of the ghosts) happens almost within the first quarter of an hour and this is probably as good a time as any to make mention of the special effects - they're pretty fantastic, not just for 1984, but - believe it or not - basically stand up to scrutiny to this day (okay, so the 'dogs' look a little 'stop motion,' but apart from that...).I could say that the uber-catchy theme song and subsequent cry of \"Who you gonna' call?\" went some way to establish the film's hold on popular culture, but, ultimately, it wouldn't be anything without humour. The cast are - as mentioned - perfect and play off each other like few ensembles can ever do. Just as the special effects hole up today, so does the humour - effortlessly.If you're looking for comedy - look no further. The fact that it's - loosely - sci-fi is secondary to the charm of its stars. In many of today's films (and I'm thinking of the Marvel movies, mainly) many lament the lack of a 'strong villain' for our heroes to go up against. Here, interestingly, there isn't really one central bad-guy to fight. I suppose you could argue that a pen-pushing civil servant who's constantly trying to shut the Ghostbusters down is a 'semi-baddie,' but the 'true' nasty doesn't really show up until the final act, but, that doesn't really matter. The film is perfect and will truly stand the test of time. I can't see today's generation being any the less taken with its brilliance.",

It was kid's life blown up into a big exciting adventure: the laser gadgetry, being chased around by ghosts that only slimed you, cozy life in the old abandoned fire station that felt like a big sleepover in someone's attic, the sense of camaraderie between science geeks that looked like they could be your classmates after 10 years time. The shucks demeanor towards danger. The sloppiness that made it seem like everything was being made up on the way. There was no plan, no program. Responsibility was fun.It stroke a wonderful balance between playing around and wanting to grow up. It made adult life seem positively exhilarating, like it was Monday and you had to wait all week for that Sunday visit at the funpark.Watching it again, I'm surprised it holds up so well and as more than a misty-eyed memory. The recipe is simple: all those things referencing experience everyone knows and associates with fun from childhood, plus a huge electric light show about the same.The showdown happens way up in the air beneath swirling clouds, a showdown with mythological evil. The audience watches transfixed from down below, up at cinematic fireworks. They cheer our geeks on like they were movie stars. And when evil finally manifests, it is straight from the imaginative mind - on reflection, a mind bombarded by TV ads.It might not seem like much today but it was a show alright and about the pleasure of watching movies.And lastly the puffy giant monster, a Godzilla for the consumerist 80's. Kids would recognize it as Bertie Bassett, the mascot of a liquorice candy brand, dads as the Michelin Man, moms as Pillsbury's Doughboy. Now Gozer was originally conceived as as a plain guy in a business suit, corporate evil. Instead they took it up a notch: evil that you also know and consume. Clever.",

            "review_title": "One of the memorable films from my childhood",
            "content": "I remember when this movie first came out. I was in year 7 and I really wanted to go and see it. I liked the symbol of the movie and was so fascinated by it that I wanted a t-shirt and everything. While at one stage I considered this to be a pretty boring movie, when I look back at it it still is a classic with some quite memorable scenes.The reviewers commented that this movie was the first to mix good special effects and comedy successfully, but I really don't think it makes that much. I personally don't think that special effects make a movie, and looking beyond the special effects of this movie I really find that there is very little there. To our standards the special effects were not that crash hot, but then this movie is early 80's meaning that we can't expect too much. However, for a movie starring some relatively big names (Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd etc) the acting does have a lot to be desired. Personally, I thought that the best actor in this film was Rick Moranis, who plays an accountant (though not necessarily socially inept, more very eccentric in his own, special, unique way).This movie is about three scientists who are kicked out of university and thus start up a business, Ghostbusters, to exterminate any ghosts in the city. Coincidentally there are lots of ghosts appearing because some Babylonian God is returning to Earth. What I noticed about this film though was the concept of science vs faith. We have the spiritual word of the ancient times trying to break back into our world, and the only thing that is able to stop it is science. Long have ghosts been in the realm of the supernatural, meaning that they have been beyond our power to deal with, but now, as with many of the things in our world, science has come along to solve the problem, and that is what is essentially happening in this film, science is taking its place as our new god.We see this a lot in the movie, especially at the end as the ghostbusters arrive to cheering crowds. There is nothing special about them beyond their power packs and their knowledge of the supernatural, though they make it known that their knowledge gives them power of the ghosts, something that the normal citizens do not have. However it appears that from the beginning they are stumbling around blindly as well, using untested equipment, and bluffing their way through pretending they know something of which others are ignorant.My opinion swings regarding this movie, at first I thought it was great, later I thought it was boring, and now I would have to put it in the realm of a classic 80's movie. However, the one thing that brings to mind is the computer game that was released around the time of the film. While the film would not stand up to the likes of some truly classic films, the computer game literally took the world by storm. Many games these days come and go within 6 months, however the Ghostbusters simply seemed to have staying power. It was a relatively easy game, straight forward, and challenging enough to always bring to back to it when you were board. These days, while I may remember the film, it is the computer game that always sticks in my mind.",

            "content": "Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis. The movie is pretty original with its concept. The original script call 'Ghostmashers' had a very different story than the film we got. The script had traveling through time, space and other dimensions to fight large ghosts. It was deemed financially impractical and the movie was rewritten. They had written roles specifically for Belushi, John Candy and Eddie Murphy, but were forced to change the script after Belushi died and the latter, when the other actors couldn't commit to the film. The movie was saved from being scrapped by the charm of Bill Murray, who took John Belushi's original role as parapsychologists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray). Most of Bill Murray's lines are ad-libs, and his performance was great. Along with Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), they set up a ghost-catching business after a series of apparent paranormal activities seem to come alive, when an uptown high-rise apartment building becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient Sumerian god, Gozer. Gozer become an ever bigger threat to the entire world and the only team that can stop it, is the Ghostbusters. The visual effects for this movie is amazing. I love the proton packs and how they work. The stop motion animation is bit odd, but still pretty impressing for the time. My favorite monster is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I like how they were able to pull off the man in the suit attacking a city visual effect. This movie has one of the best movie theme songs ever, written and performed by Ray Parker, Jr. Without him, catchphrases like \"Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!\" and \"I ain't afraid of no ghost\", wouldn't be there. The song was a huge hit. Still, the song does sound like Huey Lewis 1983's 'I want a New Drug'. He sued Ray Parker, Jr. for plagiarism, claiming that Parker copied the melody from his 1983 song, but it was settled out of court. In my opinion, the Ghostbusters song will outlive the drug song with each generation of fans. The acting is very good from all of the Ghostbusters. Even the not so attractive, Sigourney Weaver as the love interest, Dana Barrett was made sexy and charming. Even side characters like Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) and William Atherton as the villainous prick, Walter Peck was fun to watch. William Atherton later states that the role kinda ruin his life, because fans would often treated him badly or start fights with him. As a kid, I always thought the man playing Walter Peck was Kenneth Branagh. Another villain Gozer, was originally to appear in the form of Ivo Shandor, a slender, unremarkable man in a suit, played by Paul Reubens; but the role was played by Yugoslav model Slavitza Jovan. Her role was short, but Gozer used to creep me out with that both sex evil form. What is really odd is how a really old deity, know what a Stay-Puft Mashmallow Man was. What I didn't like about the film is how downplay the role of Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is. Had Eddie Murphy accepted the role of Winston, the character was actually meant to appear in more of the film. When Murphy declined the role, the script was re-written to have him appear about half-way through the film to show that they need help to cope with the demand of catching ghost. He seem to lacking a lot of things. Not much chemistry between him and the others Ghostbusters. People often forget him, and remember the first three. He doesn't help move the plot. He is just there to be there. I would love to see more of him. I like how the films are very, very thoroughly researched in the paranormal. Nothing in the film sounds too Techno Babble far off from real exorcists and psychiatrists dealing with possession. In addition, all of the books Ego and Ray mention actually exist. The film produced a popular Animated Adaptation, The Real Ghostbusters in 1986. Then a sequel in 1989. In 2009, a video game adaptation was released. As of this writing, no third movie. With the death of Harold Ramis in 2014. It's most unlikely. Many sequences were shot but removed from the film, but put into the DVD as extra. They're worth watching like the scene where a policeman tries to ticket the Ectomobile, but the car won't let him or Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play two bums that witness Louis being chased by the terror dog. Bill Murray acts like Carl Spackler from 1980's Caddyshack in this scene, so check it out. An awful lot of swearing and sexual innuendo for a family comedy. Not to mention the fairly obvious sexual symbolism of the key and the gate. Some children might fear the Demonic Possession, and the ghosts. Surprising there is lot of people think the movie is a metaphor to a lot of things like the war between Religious Vs Science because the scientists kill the Oldest known civilization 'God' with nuclear weapons. The reason why some people got angry of this, is because historian often state out that the Hebrew Yahweh AKA God is often model from the Sumerian folklore. Then there are people that think the film is pointing to an Illuminati threat. The character of Walter Peck can seem like liberal government bureaucrat who barges into a small business and his interference causes disaster that some conservatives find funny. Of course, the homo-erotic implications of men fighting with phallic science-stick. It's pretty Freudian. The movie is smart and deep, even pointing out if Ghost have civil rights, but I think these people are over-thinking the film, but I do like their discussions. It's worth talking about, but in my opinion, just enjoy the film and see it as it supposed to be. A really good supernatural comedy. Overall: They came. We saw. The movie kicks ass.",

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" (1984), I remember the first time I saw this movie on VHS, what a lot of fun I had! Within less than five minutes, I was hooked and then before I knew it, the film was over. After that, I said to myself: \"wow! Where did the last 105 minutes go?\" It went by in a flash! Then, the more I watched it, the more I enjoyed it. Eventually, it found a spot on my top ten all-time favorite comedy movies! How about that? \"Ghostbusters\" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, three parapsychologists lose university funding, right as supernatural creatures start showing up in New York City, prompting them to start their own ghost removal business. That is about as basic a storyline as you can get, which is perfect for a comedy film. It allows more room for jokes and humor. But, in the case of this movie, that's an understatement. Once the film gets going, you're locked in for 105 minutes of non-stop laughs and excitement from beginning to end. I don't want to go into any extra details about the plot at the risk of spoiling anything. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember forever. On top of that, no matter how many times I see it, I laugh just as hard, if not harder, every time I see it. That's when you know that you have a winner! This film knows exactly what kind of story it wants to tell, and it takes every advantage it can to make it as entertaining as possible. Even though I've seen it several times, it never gets old. As for the acting, it's nothing short of outstanding from the whole cast. They all nail their respectable characters, and then some! Not one character outshines the other, all of them have their moments and the performances make you care personally about the characters. You want them all to succeed at the end, which is what's most important. They all have impeccable chemistry together on the screen! All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give this film a great atmosphere. Even though New York City is over-exploited, it is still cool to see it on the screen. This movie uses it's sets and locations very effectively! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Some of them do get a bit cheesy at times, but they just add to the charm and give it an extra layer of realism. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Elmer Bernstein is nothing short of exceptional. His film score sets the perfect tone for the story and it really helps bring the movie to life. Of course, my all-time favorite song in the film, without question, is the \"Ghostbusters\" theme song, by Ray Parker Jr. Whenever I hear any part of that song, I get the sudden urge to watch this movie every time. Aside from that, it's just a great song in general! It's easily one of my top ten favorite theme songs in any film. The whole soundtrack is phenomenal, but the \"Ghostbusters\" theme song seals the deal for me. \"Ghostbusters\" is nothing short of a fun and entertaining action comedy that keeps you invested and laughing all the way through. Seriously, I could watch it over and over on loop and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"Ghostbusters\" yet, what are you waiting for? Go and check it out today. I promise that you'll love it! It's just too bad that the sequel and every other \"Ghostbusters\" film that came out after is pure garbage. But, those will be different reviews for another time. Any way, go and see \"Ghostbusters\", this movie, not it's putrid followup films. Or else, you better prepare to get slimed!",

            "content": "I'm a kid from the 80's and this was one of the first films I saw, this is one of my all time favorite films. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon it had an animated series called \"The Real Ghostbusters\" which is one of my favorite animated shows and was the source that lead me to see the film; along with it's underrated sequel series \"Extreme Ghostbusters\". There were also toys, video games, a sequel which I like, comic books there aren't many films now that can really generate this kind of phenomena, especially one just like any great ghost story is timeless.This film isn't entirely concerned about plot, even though there is one the whole film builds up to that the further it goes. It's really focused on the characters and what happens. I really love how it has the proper balance of special effects and comedy, both are used the right way and the right reasons. I really like this fantasy world the film has created where it feels one foot in reality but also one foot away. The special effects are just great because their practical, they've created some memorable ghosts like the trademark ghost Slimer, But the ones that impressed me the most are Gozer and the demon hounds whom are the main villains the film builds up to and they don't disappoint they made me nervous when I was a kid, Gozer having being a god which means limitless power so yeah that's a tough customer. However I also really loved seeing that otherworldly temple behind them which just looks beautiful and eerily strange, reminiscent of something out of Lovecroftian tales. I really love the weapons of the Ghostbusters those proton packs and traps, seeing how they work made me want to get one. And lets not forget the music which is just great there a plenty of memorable songs like the infamous Ghostbusters theme which is no surprise one of my favorites movie themes, however my favorite song in the film is actually \"Save the Day\", it's just one of those songs that really make you get going.However it's the characters how they deliver their lines and how they talk to one another that really drives this film. Their funny because they play it straight, their talking and acting like regular people would, and all have unique persona's. We see a barrage of clever jokes, one liners, and quotes that are all delivered at the right timing.Peter Venkman played brilliantly by one of my favorite actors Bill Murray. What I like is the fact that his character has a really sarcastic, smart alec , slightly slacker mannerism (though he could be smart sometimes if he wants to be). He just has a lot of key moments from the time when he interacts with his girlfriend Dana (Sigurney Weaver) who unfortunately is possessed by one of Gozer's demon dogs Zool was really funny, or even a small moment when he encounters Slimer and reacts a bit with nervousness then in the aftermath he delivers that infamous sarcastic line \"He slimed me.\" Raymond Stantz: Dan Ackroyd is at his best in this one, shame like with most comedians he never really retained most of that comedic energy again. His character is well a geek, super smart but has a sort of childlike naivety attached to him. I loved that moment when he interacts with Gozer which believe it or not is my favorite quote from the movie; \"As a representative of New York City, I ask you to cease and desist all supernatural activity, and return to your point of origin or the nearest parallel dimension.\" I know that seems to be both the smartest and dumbest thing to say, but then again what the heck else can one say to a ancient evil Samarian God.Egon Spenglaer: Harold Ramis plays this character with dry wit. He's basically all brain which might make it a little difficult when it comes to fruitful interaction. Like some of those little moments with Secretary Janine Malniz (Annie Potts) who flirts with him from time to time but never really gets him which I though was sweet and funny in a quirky sense (this of course is built more in both animated series).This film is funny from it's small subtle moments that work in a big way as well as it's big moments that have the equal affect but in a small way (if you catch my drift). One of my favorite moments are Egon's interview with Lousi Tully (Rick Moranis) who is possessed by another demon dog of Gozer's Vince. It's just funny seeing the looks both Janine and Egon display when Vince talks about a couple of Gozer's past forms and what he, she or whatever Gozer was did at the time. Egon and Janine's faces reflect exactly what I'm thinking at that moment \"What in the hell is he talking about.\" What Vince says is the truth but just the strangeness of the content and the way his says it is just downright funny.And of course the big moment when the infamous Stay Puff marshmallow man shows up. I just laughed my heard off, obviously a small homage and satirical parody on those big monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong. Mr. Stay Puff is one of my favorite super sized monsters, he's both cutely funny but also menacing and scary at the same time.If you guys have any ghosts, you can call and trust these guys.Rating: 4 stars",

Most people who know me will automatically think \"why did you buy this?\" as they know I'm not the biggest fan. However, loving the all-female reboot I just had to own the original and give it another shot. New York City is slowly experiencing more sightings of paranormal entities and ghostly spectres, so who you gonna call? Ghostbusters! (Sorry, couldn't resist). It's a story that's really built on the memorable witty characters. The Ghostbusting team divulge in sarcastic banter that provides some much needed humour which is sustained throughout the runtime. Whilst I didn't particularly laugh at any point, it's difficult not to smile with what's presented on screen. Lead Ghostbuster Bill Murray gives a consistently charismatic performance that brings the team alive. Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd also give fun performances. Sigourney Weaver was unusual casting, prefer her being a badass. Rick Moranis...I just can't. I've never really warmed to him in anything. It's an imaginative premise with plenty of creativity embedded in the futuristic technology. The ghosts themselves were well designed, Slimer and the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man have proven to be unforgettable and are constantly referenced still today. The main antagonist being an ancient Babylonian deity was unfortunately not really fully explored. The primary focus was the Ghostbusters themselves to which the film succeeds. Most of the practical effects have held up well, the visual effects not so much. Particularly the animation for the \"Keymaster\" and \"Gatekeeper\" when moving in beast form. I like Ghostbusters, how could I not...I just don't rate it all that much. It's just good old fashioned 80's popcorn fun that everyone can enjoy. Oh, and you shall be singing that darn theme tune hours later...",

Akyroid and Ramis are also perfect in their roles (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really appreciate Akyroid's \"comedy\").  This is one of the director's best films; the pacing is perfect, with action and comedy in a revolving door... I think this movie was one of the first of its kind and truly trailblazed the way for the big pop comedies of the 1990s and early 21st Century.

These three comprise over 1/2 of my entire comedy collection.This movie was beautiful. It was funny, not clever, but it was not intended to be an intellectual film. This is pure comedy with a little sci-fi and a bit more spirituality thrown into the mix, making for a great comedic effort. I was, and am, happy that their references to the Hebrew God were few. Far too often in films of this type, the dialog is riddled with too many references to religion. Here, they failed to do that, and made for a much better film, in my opinion.Dan Aykroyd is another of my favorites, and his performance in this production is one of the reasons why. I love his ability to portray a serious straight-man to the comedic efforts of the films in which he stars. He stands there, straight-faced, and allows the laughs to rebound off his lines, his facial expressions, and himself. He is a quality actor, and he demonstrated that quality in this work.The script was creative, the dialog was funny and endearing, and the performances were professional, top row comedy. I will refrain from detailing the story line here, as most everyone else has done that already, and I do hate to be redundant.So rent it, watch it, then buy it.It's definitely one for the collection.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",

Finally, though, I sat down and watched and wondered what on earth all the fuss was about. It all centres around three curious geeky academics who find themselves devoid of funding, so they acquire an old fire station and set up shop as a sort of paranormal police force - hunting down colourful beasties from other dimensions. Surprisingly, there doesn't appear to much shortage of work for Messrs \"Venkman\" (Bill Murray); \"Stantz\" (Dan Aykroyd) and \"Spengler\" (Harold Ramis). Less surprisingly, the authorities decide they are certifiable and to jail they go. Luckily for them, though - \"Gozer\" an all-powerful and malevolent Hittite deity descends on the city and the mayor calls on them to save their souls. Can they save the day? To be fair, the ensemble cast work really well together with the scene-stealing, hapless, Rick Moranis \"Tully\" on great form and Annie Potts's \"Janine\" adding value too. Quite what Sigourney Weaver was there for, though, is anyone's guess and I found the ghost-busting visual effects just a bit too basic and repetitive. I know it isn't fair to watch 1984 sci-fi with 2022 eyes, but this also purports to be comedy and the humour I found to be so in-your-face and simplistic that after ten minutes I was expecting Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplin to show up. It is entertaining enough, and passes the time amiably - but like so many other movies that have acquired \"cult\" status, I think this film of it's time, and that time has long since passed.",

            "content": "It's symptomatic of many a big budget, box office blockbuster that the film itself, it's plot (if there is one)and character end up playing second fiddle to the awesome and costly special effects. It seems that many top Hollywood film-makers seem content to show of their flashy special visuals rather than competently entertain it's audience and tell a solid, coherent story. It's as if they're practically throwing their over-sized bank balance at us and saying \"Look how much money I've got!\". Perhaps then that it's feasible that contemporary big shot movie producers should be forced to be sat down sometime and watch \"Ghostbusters\". A movie that to my mind and many others rates as one of the most iconic pictures of the 1980's. Rivalling such other blockbuster's of the era as \"Back to the Future\" and \"Gremlins\" for it's sheer iconography. Although for my money it pits each movie to the post for it's original, adroit, self knowing screenplay which was the brainchild of comic actor/writers Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis. Two men who respectively cut their teeth working on comedy sketch shows \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"SCTV\" A sublime celebration of the Horror Comedies of the 1940's and 50's which included \"Hold that Ghost\" and \"The Ghost Breakers\". The film's basic but innovative premise revolved around three parapsychologists who are drummed out of the University which finances their studies due to their outlandish theories. Now officially unemployed and their reputations being seemingly left in tatters they never the less endeavour to go in to business for their own. As due to recent scientific findings after a fortuitous if not hair-raising encounter with a ghostly apparition leads to the conclusion that it's possible to trap and contain a ghost indefinitely. This leading them to take the cue to go in to business for themselves as supernatural \"pest controllers\" and calling themselves \"Ghostbusters\". The concept was one so offbeat that it might have very well fallen flat on it's face in the hands of lesser accomplished, comedic minds. But in the capable hands of both Ackroyd and Ramis it proved arguably to be the most lucrative and proud achievement of their individual careers. It's success led it to spawn a (admittedly inferior) sequel, an animated kids TV series and a slew of merchandise with a more recent video game having proving to be a financial hit on the gaming market. It's also proved to be a fittingly effective vehicle for the sardonic, comic talents of one Bill Murray who was cast in the now legendary and popular role of Peter Venkman. One that was earmarked for the late John Belushi who would have seemed the obvious choice given that he was riding on the coattails of his success with friend and co-star Ackroyd in the cult musical comedy \"The Blues Brothers\". Tragically however it was not to be and in a bitter-sweet twist of fate it proved to be master-stroke that Murray would be cast. For it's nigh impossible to picture anyone else as the infinitely sarcastic, fast talking Venkman. Inhabiting the role as if he were born to it Murray's Venkman is the spokesman for the audience on screen. Vocally and cynically commenting not only only on his two colleagues outlandish theories but on the extraordinary events that occur throughout the film. And with a hilariously memorable array of ingenious set pieces that include an early encounter with a Library Ghost, their first job tackling \"Slimer\" in a a prestigious Hotel, Rick Moranis's Louis Tully being pursued by a rampaging demonic Terror Dog through New York City. It all culminates in a legendary show stopping finale where the \"Busters\" face against an ancient Sumerian Demi-God called Gozer on top of a New York City apartment building. And if that weren't enough Ackrord and Ramis succeed in pulling out one more eye-popping surprise out of their imaginative bag of tricks! And while the then formidable(for it's time) special effects, which incidentally though dated still hold up reasonably well. They are that rarity in that they don't overshadow the movie's sharp and masterful screenplay. If anything it reinforces and enables the audience to buy in to the insane, nonsensical spectacle on display. Affectionately and deftly aiming slight digs at the far fetched ludicrousness that abounds the film. A scene in a elevator part way through the picture winningly highlights this . When discussing with his colleagues how they haven't had a sufficient successful test of their Ghostbusting equipment, Bill Murrays infinitely cynical Venkman dryly remarks \"Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back\". The inclusion of the often obligatory love interest is present as is it routinely is with many other blockbusters and takes the form of Sigourney Weaver who portrays Dana Barrett, the protagonists first client. A character I'm pleased to say doesn't feel as if she's been shoehorned in and plays an integral key role in the overall plot. And Weaver being the capable actress that she is, is effortlessly charming with a down to earth, candid manner that proves her to be an excellent foil to Murray's brash Venkman. Ernie Hudson, the unsung hero of the movie and although relatively minor in screen-time and presence and given little to do still makes some impact, especially in a beautifully penned and acted moment with Ackroyd regarding the Bible and It's references to \"Judgement Day\". Throw in a amusing turn from Rick Moranis as Dana's neighbouring irritant Louis Tully as well as Acyroyd's child like enthusiasm as Ray Stanz and Ramis's portrayal of the aloof, verbally monotone, awkward brains of the team, Egon Spengler and you have one of the most smart, classy and clever comedy blockbusters of the past twenty-five years! A film that should be the benchmark for any aspiring big budget film-maker with even bigger ideas!",

A strange ancient legend comes to bear and the laughs roll off amidst the action.It's not hard to see the lasting appeal of this film, the many quirky lines coming primarily from the ever wonderful Bill Murray. There's plenty of jostling and joking between the Ghostbusters, the Murray/Aykroyd dynamic being particularly effective. Although the jokes are effective, and the laughs are certainly many, there's something lacking in the film and I found myself somewhat disappointed in the face of this imposing legacy. It's not that it's a bad film, certainly not, there aren't even a huge number of flaws. The humour works well, and there are little to no jokes which fail entirely. That said, it feels less good than it should be. Perhaps, my time rather after Ghostbusters', it's just that bit too dated to be particular appealing to my comedy tastes. The problem lies primarily in the nature of the laughs; none entirely memorable or strong. Not once was I struggling for breath, more chuckling lightly at the funny but never hilarious dialogue. Additionally, Murray's upfront affection always seemed very strange to me, though this impacts little on the film.Though graced with clever writing, rapid-fire dialogue, and fine acting, Ghostbusters simply seems lacking, and the majority of the jokes are more smileworthy than laughworthy.

            "content": "There is a reason why \"Ghostbusters,\" the supernatural comedy hit from 1984 that was directed by Ivan Reitman, is a classic today: \"Ghostbusters\" is a film that easily worked its way into cinema and pop culture, spawning a 1989 sequel, a spin-off animated series, merchandise, songs (by Ray Parker, Jr.), and Slimer!!! It has a top-notch cast, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as three parapsychologists who go into business eliminating poltergeists in New York City.That plot outline sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? Well, OK, it is. \"Ghostbusters\" has one of those \"novelty plots\" (trademark), where a seemingly simple, maybe even random idea snowballs and becomes something truly unique altogether. That is what \"Ghostbusters\" is, and that is what its plot has. I still don't think Reitman, Aykroyd, and Ramis had too many brainstorming sessions where they just sat in a room and tossed around random ideas for three hours.No. In \"Ghostbusters,\" three unemployed parapsychologists, Dr. Peter Venkman (Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Ramis), are thrown out of the university because their studies into the paranormal have failed to yield any positive results. So they get the idea to put their heads together and go into the ghost-busting business. Of course, things are slow at first and people have difficulty taking their ads seriously (save for the opening sequence where a librarian has a creepy encounter with the specter haunting the library).They then get a break when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers that a monstrous dog-thing has taken up residence in her refrigerator. (If you think that's bad, just watch out for those eggs that start frying themselves on the kitchen counter.) Oddly enough, none of her neighbors have complained to the super of any supernatural activity in the building, not even her loser neighbor Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis), who I think, obviously, secretly has a crush on her.So the boys go about investigating Dana's claim, while Venkman initiates some poorly timed moves on her. More calls of ghostly encounters continue, and soon the general public has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters believe them. Cool. Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are eventually joined by a fourth, an Everyman named Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), who proves to probably be the emotional and spiritual anchor the other three need as they find themselves going up against an otherworldly threat that is far bigger than anything any of them ever expected.\"Ghostbusters\" is just as imaginative as it is funny and timeless. The cast members know their roles and fill them out with equal pizazz, including William Atherton as slimy EPA agent Walter Peck and Annie Potts as cynical secretary Janine Melnitz. The real spectacle of course, are the inventive special effects. Of course, it's pretty easy to computer generate ghosts and goblins and film them interacting with live actors. Back in 1984, the filmmakers still had to use lighting and other camera trickery to make such things possible. (So what are you going to do?)And lastly, who can forget Mr. Stay Puft's classic rampage down through lower Manhattan?10/10",

The chemistry between the lead actors feels natural and having Sigourney Weaver gives the possession part of the movie more weight. What I really took away from the movie was what I miss in most movies these days. Great characters, good balance of action and dialogue as well as genuine fun on the actors part . This is a fun movie which gave me a few chuckles and felt like it was really invested in, both in terms of budget (the special effects are a bit dated) and the apparent enjoyment of the actors.Honorable mention. Bill Murray gives his hallmark performance and in my opinion is the pivot of the movie without being overbearing. Sigourney Weaver is strong also.The music is 80's flashback which highlighted the the happy-go-lucky feeling of the movie. What I will say is the the music was implying a sense of mystery or even horror at a few places which to me didn't work at all. There is very little suspense in the movie and even when the score tries to work up a mood of mystery it kind of fell flat for me. Its a comedy with a supernatural context and that's it. Granted, it does it damn well.",

He didn't need to hear the response. Would we make it in time for the last screening? Yes! We were actually allowed to go in whilst the preceding screeing was playing. It had already got up to the Ecto on the Brooklyn Bridge shot by then. We watched it all from there, and then watched the entire film again from the beginning. I was seven years old and that was the moment I fell in love with cinema.The comedy/horror ever? Maybe (though American Werewolf In London comes close too). Certainly the most successful. The DVD release was an absolute godsend for any Ghostbusters fan and I thank the good people at Columbia for putting so many fantastic extras on it.The greatest film of all time?

The story, the all-around narrative, it's basic stuff, remarkably simple; nothing too critical nor too serious. The Humour is excellent (Mostly slapstick, but hey as long as it fits, I'm not complaining). The dialogues are great, perhaps the most highlighting characteristic. No wonder, some of them have turned into immediate classics.As for the performances; everybody does their job respectably well. Even though there's not a single 'Standout Act' by mere definition; nevertheless, each of the cast members did precisely what they have been told to. No major objections from my end whatsoever.Speaking from a technical outlook, it's hard to believe this film is near three decades old! The practical effects, all the prosthetics partly look more productive (even better in some instances) than some of the modern-day CGI fests. Don't know about you, but I will always take sides with the practical crafts, as they look more authentic from where I sit.Now you guys must be wondering why such an unexpected trip down memory lane? Well, the truth is, as you guys already know there's a brand new Ghostbusters film that had just come up. And guess what? I came to know that this sequel is directly associated with the old titles (Thankfully, they are not having any connection with 2016's reboot, that was an atrocity by all means) so all I wanted to do was to catch up.",

From its cover I saw it was made in 1984, and features two big stars of that time: Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver.To say what impressed me most, I would definitely name the erotic performance of Sigourney in this film, as my mindset always associated her with her roles in the Aliens series, where she starred as an iron-fist captain Ellen Ripley and fought with those violent unpredictable dangerous creatures on-and-off and was deemed as a a symbol of feminism rising in a new age.Back to Ghostbusters, I should say there's classic flavor in it, say the hippie music, the exaggerated comic scenes, and of course, the cars and clothes people were wearing at that time. Even all the faces inside gave audience a feeling of nostalgia and classic. I liked the opening scene featuring a screaming librarian and completely went nut when the three heroes went down from their fastfood fete to an emergency calling through a golden pool.This is not a thriller, but a downright comedy, with three psycho doctors and one black-skin Jesus believer running here and there in the NYC to exterminate all kinds of ghosts released from a refrigerator at the kitchen of Dana, the heroine. When it is time to meet the boss and the team was asked to choose in which form Gozer, the commander of all ghosts, shall destroy the city, one of the ghostbusters, Ray, thought of Mr. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I cannot help laughing and meanwhile adore the director's imagination and creativity.Even though there's barely substance Ghostbusters, I will give credit to the time it was made. It is highly likely that it is the movie that inspired so many ghost-themed science fictions afterwords. Yet, I wouldn't watch it again unless I am reminiscent of films in the 1980s.",

Now the \"Ghostbusters\" find themselves in real danger, which the building where Dana lives has unstoppable supernatural evil force that wants to destroy New York City and the entire world.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Dave, My Super Ex-Girlfriend, Stripes) made an entertaining comedy that mixed fantasy and a little bit of horror extremely well. This film was one of the most memorable Big Budget movies of the 1980's. The characters are so likable, often very funny and it has timeless feel to the story. Which it was created by Dan Arkroyd (The Blues Brothers, Coneheads, Dragnet), who had originally written different script and the premise took place in a future instead of present day. Which Arkroyd re-written the script with Harold Ramis (Analyze This, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) to fleshing out the characters more. Ernie Hudson also co-stars as the new \"Ghostbuster\" in the group named Winston Zeddmore and Annie Potts as the \"Ghostbusters\" secretary.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an entertaining commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted scenes, featurettes and more. One of the reasons why \"Ghostbusters\" worked so well over the years, because the humour is so good, the cast are first-rate, there's memorable Special Effects moments and the premise is certainly most amusing. Which all those things made \"Ghostbusters\" a modern classic with film critics and people of all ages still loved this movie. Ray Parker Jr. memorable theme song might have overshadow Oscar-Winner:Elmer Bernstein (Airplane!, An American Werewolf in London, Heavy Metal) wonderful music score of the picture.

We jump towards the plot and stay there for the ride. The story is straightforward to follow. But its simplicity provides a more laid-back approach for the audience. The film is a real \"show don't tell\" with their characters. The characters are very distinct, even none of them have any growth or storyline. You see them as individuals through their mannerisms and the things they say. The characters find a balance of comical to somehow realistic. From Egon being the most comical but serious, Ray is the most realistic but nervous guy, and Dr. Peter is the balance between being smug and a bit of a loveable a**hole.The mixture of the story and characters is enjoyable to watch. Thanks to its simplicity, the dialogue keeps itself from cringing by leaning towards realism. By making it feel genuine, the performances aren't Oscar-worthy but are simple enough to make people enjoy the movie. This is thanks to the excellent improvisations of Bill Murray and many of the cast. Rick Moranis' character is a great punching bag for the film. And the best character to punch is Walter Peck. They are not perfect, especially since the rapey nature of Dr. Peter is very wrong at times, but he isn't like this throughout the movie.The VFX used in this movie is phenomenal and iconic. The effects of their ghosts, from Slimmer to the Marshmallow Man and their proton guns, make the piece memorable. There is a reason why a lot heavily remember this movie of people. It's very distinct with its props and its monsters. The negative of this movie is that some scenes feel dull like they don't care or don't make it exciting. But the cast performances make up for it. The movie doesn't explore many things, like their personal relationships, especially Janine's crush on Egon. This is because this film aims to entertain audiences. And usually, films for the sake of being made are fun, but this movie had a goal of being entertaining in their way, so that was able to lead the film to be a success. Oh, and the film wastes Winston.Overall, Ghostbusters is a good movie that gives a great time for everyone. This movie is quite challenging to analyze due to the film being basic. There isn't much to deconstruct. What you see is what you get. And you get a GGM (Good Ghost Movie.)",

            "content": "I can hardly believe I submitted a comment on the IMDb that not only gave \"Ghostbusters\" a paltry '6' rating, but also had the audacity to claim that the humor hadn't aged well. Since the dawn of my obsession with film, friends of a more casual viewership have always claimed that I take the medium far too seriously. And while I do think an intellectual embrace inspires thoughtful critique, I am not beyond getting giddy over a film just because I can, reasoning be damned.Case in point: \"Ghostbusters.\" Back in 1986, I started my school career as an extroverted kindergartener with a love for Saturday-morning (and weekday-afternoon) cartoons. Out of all I'd watch, \"The Real Ghostbusters\" was the most entertaining; I was endlessly fascinated by the premise of 4 guys running around New York (plus other parts of the world and even outer space) with their 'positron rifles,' blasting deformed comic apparitions. In hindsight, this mixture of comic hijinks and supernatural mayhem is probably what piqued my long-standing love affair with horror films.I didn't actually view the film version of \"Ghosbusters\" until I was a well-ingrained fan of the TV show, to the point where I had to adjust to the difference in appearance of the live-action characters (as opposed the other way around). Despite this, I warmed up to the film instantly--I laughed my butt off and was amazed by Richard Edlund's brilliant FX (which look f*cking incredible to this day). Bill Murray's portrayal of the coolly sarcastic Peter Venkman is one of my all-time favorite performances (and cemented Murray as my favorite comic actor); the efforts of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson also contribute to an unmatched cooperative of quirky humor that works better than one might imagine.The premise of \"Ghostbusters\" is so utterly ridiculous that it's something of a miracle it works as well as it does. The script, by Aykroyd and Ramis (back when they knew 'funny'), involves our heroes sweeping the ghost population of NYC while dodging EPA toady Walter Peck (\"Die Hard\"'s William Atherton, in a hilariously straight performance); in the meantime, Venkman woos musician Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment becomes a portal for ghoulish baddie Gozer to enter through. Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.Through all its absurdity, \"Ghostbusters\" works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.Personally, \"Ghostbusters\" is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on \"Ghostbusters\"' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss.",

I'll admit although the special effects are old, they still are a marvel to look at from so many years ago. I also enjoyed the actors who played in this movie I feel that they all did really well at their jobs. A lot of them had funny moments. My only complaint is that I did not have enough laughs. I felt that there were parts that were supposed to be funny but seemed liked they were out of place.Starring as the awesome four in this film are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Murray is good at being a smart mouthed \"doctor\". Aykroyd is good at making himself look like a complete science nerd with the way he talks. Ramis' character, although somewhat awkward is funny to watch too. As for Hudson, I've always enjoyed the way he makes his character look and act. Even Sigourney Weaver from Alien (1979) has some interesting moments.Together these actors come out on top and make the film very enjoyable. The only problem I didn't seem to understand is the humor in this film. Yeah it was funny for the most part but some moments seemed out of context, or just plain weird. Either it's me because I'm from another generation or it's just that it wasn't that funny. I'm not sure. When I heard people talk about Ghost Busters I expected to have gut busting laughter. I did laugh but not a lot and not out loud. For a movie of this magnitude of fans, you'd think it would be hard to resist, but I didn't cling to me like it did to other viewers. I liked the music that was played in the background. Composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, it has jokey attitude, which helps this movie with its comedic moments. I liked how the tuba played as the main title came on. It was because of that intro, I got a better understanding of how serious Director Ivan Reitman wanted this film to be.The special effects are still lovable in this film. Seeing the Ghost Busters' use their equipment, such as the beam guns, brings back fond memories of watching Disney's Black Hole (1979). My favorite moment is when Bill Murray's character has an encounter with a green slime ghost. It's fun to watch and to imagine of how at the time, something like that could have been pulled off. Of course there are parts that are much better than this but I don't want to give them away. Overall I enjoyed the film, even with the setbacks I had when it ended.Ghost Busters is a funny science fiction comedy with some really unique special effects. Director Ivan Reitman picked a good cast for this film and they work well together to boot.",

There are only a couple of movies, made at that time, that I still consider worth watching and \"Ghost Busters\" is definitely one of them.When three weird scientists / professors lose their grant and their jobs at the university, where they studied the occult and paranormal occurrences, they have to find a new way of making money. They decide to go into business as a ghost extermination company called 'Ghostbusters'. At first people react sceptical and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tries to shut them down, but soon enough business is booming. Especially when an ancient god named Gozer is threatening to take over the city, no-one doubts about their capabilities anymore. But this gigantic enemy is stronger than they have ever met before and they can't be sure that they will be able to handle him...Despite the fact that this movie was created in 1984, the ghosts still look very good. They would look a lot better if done with today's techniques of course, but keep in mind that they didn't have the same possibilities in the early eighties, and than you'll see what a formidable performance this was. And not only the special effects are more than OK. So is the entire story and the acting. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are excellent as the three 'mad' scientists, but the others, like for instance Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts, were nice to watch as well. The main problem that I had with this movie, if you can call it that, was that it was too short. They build the entire movie up to a very good climax and then all a sudden, everything is finished. I sure wanted to keep watching a bit longer.Overall this is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It may perhaps look a bit dated by today's standards, but it still offers plenty of fun. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",

It was funny and, at the time, a little frightening (I remember the Terror Dogs scaring the crap out of me). It is probably one of the most fun films I've seen. The entire movie almost has a cartoon-ish feel to it.The movie is the brainchild of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and stars some of the greatest comic actors of the decade. Aside from starring Aykroyd and Ramis, the film also boasts Bill Murray and Rick Moranis. The group has the perfect chemistry for the team and play off each other beautifully. Sigourney Weaver plays Murray's love interest and the victim of an ancient Sumerian god's attempted resurrection.The special effects are definitely a bit dated. Looking back on the stop-motion animated Terror Dogs now doesn't seem to have the same frightening effects. This doesn't hurt the movie one bit. I still love seeing Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man terrorizing New York City.This is definitely one movie that ages well and is just as fun to watch now as it was then. \"Ghost Busters\" is a movie every child should grow up with.",

Rick Moranis, DanAkroyd, silly, silly. Ernie Hudson gave what was probably the best acting performance in this film (as the 6th lead... this guy was lucky to find a sandwich left for him at Craft Services). Anyway, this review proves that I am (at least attempting to be) unbiased in my critique of these films on IMDB. I really don't like this movie. I liked it as a child, and I resent it now as an adult.

And this was not some off-the-top-of-my-head choice b/c I couldn't think of anything else. It was solid! I hadn't seen the film in a while, but it remained fresh in my memory as being utterly funny and special. Being an 80s movie, it's got that general 80s vibe going (for it, IMHO). But yet it doesn't feel or seem nearly as dated as a lot of 80s movies, I think mainly b/c of how amazing the special effects are and how plain funny it is. I think the special effects are the key: they make GHOSTBUSTERS seem otherworldly, like you are watching a parallel universe version of New York City, but still New York. It's just different from the typical 80s movie, not just in terms of plot, but also in terms of look, tone, and feel.GHOSTBUSTERS is just plain funny. At the heart of all the humor is one Mr. Bill Murray. The man is a comic genius! He's so smarmy, sardonic, and cocksure that he exudes hilarity. These so-called comic actors nowadays have barely a speck of the comic delivery and timing that Murray possesses. It's really kind of sad b/c Murray should have been getting Oscar nods for stuff like GHOSTBUSTERS, not LOST IN TRANSLATION. It's a shame that a great comic actor has to resort being in dramatic hogwash in order to get recognized by the bozos at the Academy Awards! Murray has sterling support in the form of Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, and Ernie Hudson. Actually, Ackroyd and Ramis wrote the screenplay for GHOSTBUSTERS and have spun a confident yarn. It's amazing that they can believably deliver these lines with straight faces! \"Gozer\"! \"the Keymaster\"! \"Zhoul!\" The director Ivan Reitman has done a superlative job. The climactic ending is one of the best ever put to screen. Many comedies, heck movies in general, tend to fall apart in the 3rd act, but not GHOSTBUSTERS. The conclusion is just as satisfying as the first part of the film.One of the funniest, most confident films that you will ever see in any genre! GHOSTBUSTERS!",

Today's generation of children might only possess the ability to roll their eyes at the special effects, but Ghostbusters only earns extra adoration for the awesome action moments. Alongside the tireless effects, the adventurous hunting and paranormal investigation is often very entertaining.However, there's moments where it can become undeniably uninteresting, but fortunately without being overlong. They mainly appear during the climatic sorts of sequences and later in the film. The first hour is almost perfect and if it had included more sequences that own the ability to entertain in massive ways, there's no doubt that the critics would appreciate the movie even more.It can only get better from there though. There's a significantly noticeable amount of tired ideas, but Bill Murray can swoop in and pick up the pace with Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd. There's a likeable combination of comedy, fantasy and fright with a unique story.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

I know people love him but I find the sarcastic and miserable style of his performances to be such a chore (see Groundhog day for the exact same thing). As a lot of humour rested on his shoulders that side of things was a let down. I also think that the greatly funny Dan Aykroyd was underused.Also was it scary? I've seen people describe it as a genuinely scary film but not for me. Maybe in the 80s but watching this for the first time in 2021 it didn't feel very scary at all.The plot is the film's greatest strength. It is goofy, energetic, stupid, fun, creepy. There's lots to enjoy and even though the third act maybe got a bit out of hand in my opinion, I still really liked it.I do find it interesting that this film is hailed as such a classic and revered by so many. I thought it was perfectly fun but given all the discourse around it I was expecting something more akin to Back to the Future in terms of quality. A fun film, and worth watching purely to indulge in the iconic moments of which there are plenty, but you can't hang a film purely of iconic imagery.A strong 7/10 but nothing more.",

In the words of Dr. Peter Venkman: \"Back off man, we're scientists!\" ... Wouldn't really fill you with much faith, would it? Until, that is, you see them in action...Everything in this movie fits together perfectly. The chemistry between the team is unrepeatable, the script is both smart and funny and the special effects hold up well even in this computerised age.

The surprising thing is that, more than 25 years later, it still stands up as a successful melding of comedy and special effects.The story blends science and fantasy in a way that's both believable and entertaining. Meanwhile, keeping the film semi-realistic serves to ground the fantastic events, thus making it easier to suspend belief. The special effects, while far surpassed by today's efforts, nevertheless paint a convincing picture.When it comes to acting, the film excels in that regard. Comedy legends Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis & Moranis all contribute fine performances, often underplaying the humour to excellent effect. Sigourney Weaver adds a welcome distaff element, as does memorable supporting player Annie Potts. Also among the support, Ernie Hudson & William Atherton prove to have been well cast.The direction by Ivan Reitman is well done, if not particularly outstanding. That being said, he should be commended for coaxing authentic performances of out his actors in an effects-heavy film like this. Speaking of the effects, they were the source of one of the film's two Oscar nominations; the other being Ray Parker Jr.'s classic theme.All in all, \"Ghost Busters\" is a well-crafted comedy that deserves to be remembered for years to come. The sequel may have been somewhat underwhelming but the original, with its deadpan humour and iconic visuals, is truly deserving of the designation \"classic\".",

Perhaps the memories of my youth have dolled this experience up,but I still feel like you get the full effect of the special effects and music of this picture when you see it on large screen. I was twelve when \"Ghostbusters\" stormed through theaters,breaking box office records for a comedy,and if I didn't already have some sense of admiration for the comedic talents of Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd,Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis before this movie,I would after.In case you are not familiar with the story,here goes: Three paranormal professors(Murray,Aykroyd and Ramis) are kicked out of their cushy,tenured jobs at a prestigious New York college(NYU?) and decide to go into business as paranormal investigators and erstwhile ghost hunters. They always seem to be close to but never quite able to capture,evidence of the supernatural around New York. That changes when they become the successful,\"last avenue\" answer to corralling a rather nasty ghoul who is creating havoc in a swanky four-star hotel(The Waldorf?). This leads to a string of successful \"Ghost busting\" all over the region, and it leads them back into the life of one concert musician(Sigourney Weaver,in her first chance to flex her comedic muscle)who happens to be siting on top of a particularly awesome din of supernatural activity on the loom. Rick Moranis steals his scenes as the dweeby accountant neighbor of Weaver's,and Ernie Hudson joins on near the end as a no-nonsense guy who believes in the Ghostbusters' mission,in spite of his better instincts. Rounding out the cast are Annie Potts(pre-Designing Women)as the dryly unenthused secretary and William Atherton as the weasly EPA rep and ostensible villain here(an 80s era dig). Director Ivan Reitman,while somewhat of an inconsistent filmmaker(\"Stripes\",\"Twins\",\"DAve\" and \"Junior\"),is very deft and clever in balancing effects and eye-candy with comedy,keeping the film both light AND powerful. I realize that films that have been around as long as \"Ghostbusters\"(which will turn twenty-one this June,if you're counting) rarely get to see the insides of movie theaters anymore,but if by some chance you're at a movie festival or college campus that is showing this on the large screen,I highly recommend you go catch it!",

Weaver is sensational in her portrayal of The Gatekeeper. Think about it, how do you play The Gatekeeper without any reference? Weaver's use of sensuality in her character renders her terrorizing and horrifying, especially since the conveyance of seductiveness usually has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, Moranis portrays The Keymaster with comic wizardry (as if one has reference to the character, as well) and delivers a performance to be remembered.",

            "content": "(SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)Ghostbusters was the best movie of 1984 bar none. It had a great cast, a great director and it was full of 80's humour.The Ghostbusters were scientists who went around trapping ghosts (for some reason New York had suffered an influx of hauntings)and they did it in style. The movie was funny throughout.Bill Murray played the sarcastic Peter Venkman who was sort of the leader of the team. He didn't take his work seriously and he was more interested in getting passionate with Dana Barrett played by Sigourney Weaver. The best scenes in this film were the ones where Venkman clashed with the bureaucratic Walter Peck (played by William Atherton) who was from the Environmental Protection Agency. Peck believed the Ghostbusters were a menace to the environment and Venkman really laid into him verbally.Dan Aykroyd played Ray Stantz who was certainly more serious in his work than Venkman. Stantz was probably more of a leader than Venkman.Harold Ramis played Egon Spengler who was the most scientific out of the lot-he was the one responsible for providing analysis during dangerous situations even when the team didn't need it.Ernie Hudson played Winston Zeddmore who wasn't a scientist. He had joined the Ghostbusters and been taken aback by the sights he had saw.The rest of the cast were great too such as Annie Potts who played Janine Melnitz and the ever dependable Rick Moranis.The scenes are truly great. There was the beginning scene in the library where the ghostbusters (before they actually became the ghostbusters)tried to catch a ghost with their bare hands. Then we saw them struck off from the university where they worked. There was the scene where they trapped a disgusting green ghost in a hotel. And who can forget the end scene where a giant marshmellow man nearly destroys the Ghostbusters? Amazing.I also loved the Ghostbusters car which was called Ecto-1. In fact I actually thought about painting my car in the same colours?That was a joke...I think.Seriously, Ghostbusters was the best film of 1984 and it was followed by an equally good sequel in 1989.",

            "content": "In the summer of 1984, two horror-comedy films came out, in direct competition with each other- Gremlins and Ghostbusters. Both became blockbusters. I grew up watching and loving both of them, but Gremlins is my favourite. Nevertheless, with Halloween nearly here, I've been reviewing horror-related movies/TV episodes/whatever, and Ghostbusters became a must-see again.In this movie, three scientists in New York City have found a way to catch and contain pesky ghosts. It's horror-related in that it deals with ghosts, but there's really no horror here. Ghostbusters is first and foremost a comedy. It's not non-stop, laugh out loud humour, but there's some good humour in jokes like book stacking and \"Get her!\", as well as Ray's enthusiasm for a building and car of dubious value. The part where they catch Slimer, their first real job, is perhaps the best part of the movie for humour. Eventually they come to the big job, which makes the movie feel big- stopping the end of the world, with a Mesopotamian god called Gozer coming to New York. The Gozer and Zuul material makes for good myth, but it probably would have been more fun if they had found real ancient gods to use in this movie. Gozer was made up for Ghostbusters. They do tie in Gozer's coming with Biblical legends of the end of the world, particularly with the dead rising. Meanwhile, making Gozer a marshmallow man was inventive.This movie made me admire Bill Murray. He brings some colour to the movie, with one character comparing him to a game show host. On this re-watch, however, he didn't come across as totally likable. He's not an honest man, and when his ex-boss calls him a \"poor scientist,\" I couldn't help but think that was probably true. Nevertheless, his warning that cats and dogs may one day live together should be taken seriously.Issues with the movie start with the whole concept- isn't it cruel to imprison ghosts forever? Why does the Environmental Protection Agency always have to be the bad guy? Is environmental protection necessarily sinister? The part where Gozer tries to kill the ghostbusters for not being gods was funny- but why didn't they die? On the whole, though, Gozer is a good villain, and Ghostbusters is a fun, memorable movie.Happy Halloween.",

            "content": "My Take: Hilarious comedy carried by a hilarious ensemble cast, gimmicky effects, and big laughs. A classic for bringing both special effects and comedy together successfully, GHOSTBUSTERS actually still holds up today. It's still a funny and elaborate fantasy with some fun special effects (which may not be as good in today's standards, but still enjoyable) and some very humorous performances by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as the three leads. It's not as great as it might have been, but what do I know, this one is still very good.Director Ivan Reitman keeps things as lively as possible. The early special effects work on creatures and spirits (including the infamous Marshmallow Man) are fun to look at. They're not as good as today's, and these may be even considered low-tech, but they have something some of today's special effects have, and that's imagination. It took some imagination to create strange wonders as these, and they're worth looking at.Other than special effects, the real appeal of GHOSTBUSTERS comes from the actors and the rest of the crew. Lead actors, as well as supporting characters like the ones played by Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson, are very well played. The script is finely rewarding with funny one-liners to great jokes. It's also flavored with parodies (THE EXORCIST mainly) and some in-jokes. GHOSTBUSTERS proves that, even with the distractions of special effects, a comedy can still be funny at the same time.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",

            "content": "After getting kicked out of University three scientists get their own place and create an organization fighting supernatural phenomenon.Ivan Reitman's 1984 smash does little wrong with a suave portrayal of the supernatural in what must be the most recognized fantasy comedy of the last 30 years.Almost every living thing (human or none human) could pick up the classic Ray Parker Jr tune without too much trouble recalling the lyrics and quite possibly the dance moves But though this picture is enthralling, sublimely musical and justification of an all too familiar genre, it is Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd who make this picture what it is, which is simply unique at its own accord and stomps all over rival attempts at fantasy comedy.Fantasy comedies are perhaps one of the hardest genres to tackle as diving into a supernatural world is one thing but making the context of what appears on screen is another. Pixar films tackle these with ease such as Oscar winning Wall-E or other alien hit smash Men in Black. But then they can fail spectacularly like parody Disaster Movie or ordinary glossed with fantasy My Super ex-girlfriend.Ghostbusters takes the concept of ghosts and puts a marvellously humorous entertaining spin on with some flashing representations of ghosts. The green slime monster is one of the finest touches of this film, though only on screen for minimal time he makes an impact with the sheer grotesque nature and rebellious attitude. The formation likewise is striking and instantly memorable. However what steels the limelight for the film is the rather weird but undeniably inclusion of the film's final monster, a towering icon that brings fear and quiet humour to a devastating and riveting climax Bill Murray brings that wonderful wit to his character Peter Venkman here, using his talented timing and smart deadpan expressions to win over the audience. Aykroyd also brings that zany element to his Doctor as well, and Weaver rounds it off nicely with a temptress that will please any older male viewer. Dana's hard to get nature is wonderfully comic but insanely romantic also.The plot can occasionally wave with some loopholes in the context of the finale and the fact that the events seem limited in a small space may raise eyebrows. But the humour and sheer brilliance of the encoded fantasy will delight viewers of any age and with comic legends Murray and Aykroyd you can't do much better in a fantasy comedy.",

Ghostbusters is not only a fine film, but perhaps the best showcase ever made for Bill Murray's genius.Who knows how good John Belushi (whom the part of Dr. Peter Venkman was originally written for) would have been in this film. I'd certainly trade Murray's performance for Belushi's life if it were possible. But since that won't happen all we can do is sit back and enjoy Murray's excellent performance. Here are some of the highlights.The guys are interviewing a frightened old librarian who has just seen a ghost. The woman is absolutely petrified as she is trying to describe what she has seen, as well as answer some questions about herself. Murray at one point in the interview asks the old woman if she is currently menstruating. Her supervisor understandably objects, seeing no logical connection. Murray simply tells him, \"Back off, man. I'm a scientist.\" We as the audience aren't quite sure why he asked the question. We can only sit back and chuckle at him putting an already terrified woman on the spot.The scene in which Murray accompanies Sigourney Weaver back to her apartment to check out her initial disturbance is vintage Murray. You get the sense that whether or not his character believes in ghosts is irrelevant. He certainly isn't frightened of them, but he has to at least try to act concerned so this woman might possibly take him seriously as a scientist. He makes a bold point to be the first of them to enter the apartment. He then starts fingering the two highest keys on her piano. \"They hate this. I like to torture them,\" he explains. After some macho posturing, he takes out an obscure device that looks like a combination of a blood pressure cuff and a car battery. He begins squeezing the device, resulting in a swooshing sound. There is a great sense that not only are we the audience baffled as to what the device is for, but Murray himself likely does not know. \"Excuse me, but what is that thing you're doing?\" Weaver asks. \"It's technical. One of our little toys,\" he tries to explain. Later on, they venture into her kitchen where she had some trouble with her groceries earlier. Murray walks over to the counter where there are fried eggs splattered all over it. \"Dana... are these the eggs?\" he asks, trying to sound like he truly thinks they might NOT be the eggs she described to them earlier. It is a testament to her professionalism that Ms. Weaver or anyone else for that matter could get through this scene without dying of laughter.The film is also filled with one-liners, great special effects, and some creepy monsters. This is one of the better comedies to come out of the 1980s. And I think we have Bill Murray to thank for most of it.10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

Ghostbusters communicates comedic intelligence as it plays to your personal intellect. It has a great nerd factor. The ghost hunting scientists speaking their brainy paranormal jargon with their high-tech ghost trapping equipment coming to the rescue to damsels in distress who've seen a ghost, is every nerd's dream, or something close like that. Ghostbusters does a terrific job melding a ghost haunting story into a competent comedy. It does a terrific job in having \"real life\" comedic humor; the humor's very authentic feeling. Ghostbusters does a fabulous job at framing and rating the ghost scenes; they're presented very well. The ghost scenes are satisfactorily approving so allowing the lot of the time for great, slapsticky, goofy dialogue. Bill Murray is nothing too short of great as Dr. Peter Venkman. Dan Akroyd is marvelous as Dr. Ray. Harold Ramis is very well as Dr. Egon. Ernie Hudson is well-cast as Winston, just like the rest of the Ghostbusters. \"That's a big twinkie.\" Sigourney Weaver makes the movie so great as Dana Barrett, the Gate Keeper, as Weaver's wonderful in one of her most memorable parts. I'm a big nerd for Sigourney. The Key Master, Rick Moranis, is kind of the funniest part. Moranis is really good. I really love his kind, silly character. Gozer is a good enough enemy for Ghostbusters but Gozer is tremendously overshadowed by the doglike creatures, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Slimer, especially Slimer. The old lady spirit reading quietly in the library at the beginning's one of the great movie introduction scenes; it's just really fun, and really scary. Ghostbusters is a great overall family film. It has great music and great sound effects. The Ghostbuster's theme song is forever memorable. Ghostbusters is nothing short of a smash hit, a great film to enjoy with family and friends. I must point out Ghostbusters is not some kiddie movie; it's a great success.\"I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that.

Like most great comedies, \"Ghostbusters\" relies on the interactions and conversations between its characters, but leaves enough headroom for some great visuals that play along with the gags. The rest of the film reveals something greatly lacking in many modern comedies: smart dialogue, full of quips, cynicism, sarcasm, and all-around zaniness that feels spontaneous rather than scripted. We don't gather a sense of jumping from one pratfall to the next or from one comedic situation to another. There's a terrific flow in the narrative where each quirky one-liner and special effects-driven prank naturally leads to other, sometimes bigger, laughs. I can't think of another comedy that smoothly transitions from a laser-tag show against a demigod to a battle with a Godzilla-like marshmallow giant without missing a beat.Demonstrating that big-budget special effects can mesh well with laugh-out-loud comedy, the film also enjoys being one of the most successful comedy franchises ever made and continues to convert a new generation of fans with each viewing.Read More - http://reelchat.com.au/blu-ray-disc-review-ghostbusters- 1984/Reel Chat \"Ghostbusters\" episode - http://reelchat.com.au/reel-chat- 1-0-ghostbusters-1984/",

This moves at a good pace, is never crass, and has all these wonderful talents playing off each other really well. If you haven't seen it by now, do yourself a favor and see it.",

            "content": "\"Ghostbusters\" was a huge hit when it was released back in 1984 (geez, has it been that long already) which started a phenomenon. I still remember the song being played constantly on radio stations, while the video was a huge hit on the video stations. To this day, it still holds up with current movies being released.The story revolves around Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stanz (Dan Akroyd) and Dr. Spengler (Harold Ramis), who start up a \"ghost busting\" business when they are dismissed from their positions from the University in New York. Little do they know, that their business is going to explode, as an ancient god Gozer, prepares to enter the world to bring upon the end of the world.With great special effects, great comedy bits (mostly provided by Bill Murray), and a fantastic cast and story, \"Ghostbusters\" is a film for comedy and action buffs. Although the special effects do look kind of dated today (especially in the scene where the demon dog is chasing Louis through Central Park), they are still incredible and bring the characters to life. This was before computer technology became a huge part of cinema.If you have never seen this film, go out and take a look, I guarantee that you will love it. For those others that have already seen it years ago, take another look, it is still a classic that stands up today.",

This movie was definitely a childhood of mine, as I watched this on an old VHS that was recorded on TV before having an actual copy of the movie; then it came to DVD, and now we have Blu Ray. Now I'm an adult, the question is: does it hold up?After the members of a team of scientists (Harold Rimis, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykoryd and Bill Murray) lose their cushy positions at a University in New York City, they decided to become \"Ghostbusters\" to wage a high tech battle with the supernatural for money. They stumble upon a gateway to another dimension, a doorway that will release evil upon the city. The Ghostbusters must now save New York from complete destruction.This movie's considered to be one of the greatest Sci Fi comedies of all time, and it has endured by many generations as they had grew up with this movie and still cherish it till this day. This movie was definitely a childhood of mine and I really enjoyed it. The movie's screenplay is written cleverly by both Dan Aykoryd and Harold Ramis, and they both have given great performances. Ernie Hudson doesn't show up into the second half of the movie, but he does give a good performance too. The villain Gozer is definitely a real threat, and really has a strong performance in this movie. As for Bill Murray, he is the man! He really steals the show, and his lines of dialogue are outstanding. The movie's dialogue are great and funny too. Even Ivan Reitman's direction is really well done as he balance it really well for mixing both the comedy and horror elements into the movie. The ghosts are memorable such as Slimer, Gozer, Terror Dogs, Librarian Ghost, as well as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Elmer Bernstein's music is definitely one of his greatest scores, and does have a great soundtrack such as the famous theme song by Ray Parker Jr.Overall Ghostbusters is still a classic as it is funny, exciting, suspenseful, creative and has a good heart.9/10.",

            "content": "Ghostbusters is a trivial film in both structure and style.  It certainly isn't well edited due to many gaps in the timeline, but there are several redeeming qualities to it.  For starters, the casting is terrific.  While the scripted characters themselves are paper-thin, the writers (Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd) fill them with enough interesting dialogue to make things more memorable.  Ramis in particular is ingenius as Spengler. Unfortunately, his ability and character were wasted in the sequel.The film presents an interesting mix.  There is the prototypical horror hook of such films as The Exorcist and The Haunting, but it combines it with the 80s notion of \"technology can solve or do anything\", evident with WarGames and Blade Runner.  Of course, Ghostbusters isn't anywhere near the level of Blade Runner, and it's all for laughs.  Nonetheless, the comedy element strikes deeper than garbage like Dumb & Dumber.  While Ghostbusters doesn't have a purpose, it certainly is trying to find it.  Interesting in a decade that shunned intelligent thinking.On the side note, I feel this movie was robbed at the Oscars both for Visual Effects and Song.  Ray Parker, Jr. isn't the 80s' greatest, but the song certainly contributed to the success of the movie.  Also, the sound editors deserve their fair share of credit in creating the interesting noises of both the ghosts and the unique \"firepower\" the team wields against them.Overall, a film that has aged, but not as bad as other ones from this decade.  Essential viewing for children of this decade and comedy buffs, but more introspective reviewers who like Woody Allen should avoid it.  3 out of 5 stars.",

Insulting to real ghosts inasmuch as they refer to every sort of intangible goblin or monster as a \"ghost\", the film also makes fun and pokes ridicule to real ghost hunters as nothing but a pack of money-hungry, double-talking, over-sexed pseudo-intellectuals with a collection of illogical and unpractical Flash Gordon-equipment. There is a pretty decent movie here as Bill Murray proves to be an enjoyable and likeable cut-up with a genius-level I.Q., Dan Aykroyd as the boyishly innocent believer in ghosts ( a character not unlike myself) and Harold Ramis as the straight man to the idiocy and the only one with a foot grounded in reality. Rick Moranis is as usual the rather nerdishly inept comic relief, Ernie Hudson the man with the muscle and Superman-grin and Sigourney Weaver who isn't attractive enough to be the type of looker that she is supposed to be. Tossed in for Bill Murray to pursue unsuccessfully, she is less sexual than a car accident, but is a good enough actress to give credence to her role. Annie Potts also provides a wonderfully funny talent as their frustrated, harried and demurely sexy secretary ready to kill them just so she can catch her breath. Slavitza Jovan of the unpronouncable name (later of the House on Haunted Hill remake infamy) is also on hand as some sort of forgotten immortal here to revert the world back to pagan times. It's a great comedy with action overtones, but the ghost formula is straight out of the pen of a Hollywood hack.",

The emotional depth feels forced and is underdeveloped, certainly concerning the romantic relationships. Character development is mostly strong, although this is particularly over-relied on and overdone in an attempt to make up for a subpar plot. There are various unforgivable holes in the story, most noticeably in the third act that is so loosely tied to the rest of the film the conclusion is completely nonsensical. The effects are give and take, but redeems itself with a cool final touch. Ultimately, Ghostbusters is a fantastic idea with promising elements that fail to truly come together in its end.",

Armed with proton guns, the Ghostbusters become wildly popular, and they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), who is looking for a job with good pay. Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Peck is forced to believe the Ghostbusters when New York City is put under siege by an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer the Gozerian, who is channeled through the apartment building that Dana and Louis live in, and the mayor has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters out of jail to face Gozer.Ghostbusters is a fantastic, feel-good movie with lots of laughs and spectacular fun throughout the film. but there's going to the third movie to the series, but will it help the movie industry make a comeback?

I always thought the script in this is so brilliant and will go down in history as one of the best.I still prefer the 2nd overall,but you can't go wrong with this one.Has the best soundtrack of all the GB movies too. Own it on rare 8-track tape. My favorite scene I think is when they're trying to bust Slimer in the hotel. Sucha funny scene. Bill Murray's tour de force. Say what you will but technically this is his best film. Even better than Lost in Translation,etc that came later.",

This is one of the most successful films of all time and also spawned a very successful sequel, cartoon series, and catapulted Bill Murray into super stardom. Let's not forget the catchy theme song as well. We all know what the plot is about, with the Ghostbusters (Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston) trying to prevent the end of the world. The movie is filled with excellent performances by the cast and, for its time, outstanding visual effects. As a matter of fact, this is one of the most impressive casts ever, featuring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and William Atherton (and a cool cameo from Reginald VelJohnson from TV's Family Matters playing a cop, of course).I recently bought the box set of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 on DVD and there is some very interesting information within. Originally, the Ghostbusters movie was going to star John Belushi as Peter and he and Ray were going to be \"intergalactic ghost busters\" traveling through space and catching ghosts. Although this is an interesting premise, I don't think it would have delivered quite the way the final version did. Maybe that would work if they made a third film in the series?I'm giving Ghostbusters an 8/10. It was very innovative back in 1984 and features some great special effects, most of which still hold up today in the age of CGI. Definitely worth owning on DVD!",

            "content": "During the 80's I owned and operated an Ice Cream store in Queens, New York. The hours were long and I would usually arrive home around midnight where I would watch TV to all hours of the morning. I found myself watching the same shows almost every evening for decades. One show I watched religiously was the Joe Franklin Show on WOR TV. Joe was shown locally in the New York City market. Moreover Joe Franklin was the longest running late night talk show in American history, some 47 years. Joe was coined the \"King Of Nostalgia\" or \"The Wizard Of Was\". Joe would flash old movie posters and have forgotten film stars pop in from time to time reminiscing about the old days. Joe had a wide range of guests from world renown artists Salvadore Dali and the Beatles John Lennon. From local celebrities to the famous names in Hollywood, i.e. Sinatra and Bing Crosby. President John Kennedy sat on the famed couch back in the early 60's. Enough about Joe and on to Ghostbusters, I first learned about this phenomenon by also listening to the nationally broadcast all night Larry King show out of Washington, D.C. along the Mutual Radio Network. Between Franklin and King I had a thing for nocturnal media. Larry King also personally promoted this ghostly, comedy, action film mainly because he had a cameo in the film. The publicity department At Sony/Columbia Pictures did a phenomenal job promoting this film especially with children. The popular Ray Parker theme song with the famous catch phrase \"Who you gonna call?\" hit the air waves of the radio medium. Ghostbusters is unique in the fact that special effects and comedy are a slippery slope to combine . Special effect require precise timing. As for comedy it's usually spontaneous. In this film the two styles meld well together. I noticed the fine tuned editing in the Capra style making the movie less choppy. Having a nice flow.. Our story begins with three Columbia professors Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Ray Stantz, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egon Spengler who delve into the paranormal with experiments of a different nature. Venkman asking his female subject is she menstruating? Well the time has come as our scientist's government funding runs out and they are banished from the University. Out on the street pounding the pavement realizing that there is negative energy in the way of Ghosts and the unexplained, People complain about haunting s from their premises. The three realize there is a need for ghost busting. People will pay at any cost to eradicate these paranormal beings from their property or the ghosts in and around New York. The Three go into business and call themselves the Ghostbusters. The three purchase an old firehouse and hire a receptionist (Annie Potts). Annie does a fair job with her New York accent. The three promote their business on TV and are summoned to a Hotel ballroom . They travel in a makeshift ambulance and enter the lobby in jumpsuit uniforms with back packs and laser guns ready to take down a green goblin. They catch the creature and suck him into a box and store him away in there nuclear chamber at the firehouse. The E.P.A. finds out about it and tries to shut them down. Meanwhile on another front; Venkman has eyes for musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who live in a detailed elaborate 20 story apartment with gargoyles on the roof located on Central Park West. Dana calls Venkman to inspect her re-fridge as she claims it haunted watching eggs fry in the case. Dana would eventually be possessed by a ghost. Nerdy and meek Neighbor accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) is throwing party as a tax write-off. One of the stone structures comes to life and ends up chasing Tully out of the apartment and into Tavern On the Green. Evidently there apartment building is a conduit to the next world. Tully eventually becomes possessed as the Ghostbusters are log jammed by the avaricious E.P.A. investigator William Peck (Walter Atherton) who earlier lets out all the Ectoplasm and Ghosts.at their firehouse headquarter having no regard for their service, calling it a hoax. The ghosts and goblins terrorize New York including a hot dog stand. The mayor of New York concedes giving the Ghostbusters permission to resume and restore order in this Ghost ridden city. The screenplay is chock full of funny lines provided by the genius of Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd. Bill Murray has his share of punchlines, (mostly ad-libs) to round out the dialogue. Honorable mention for our fourth member of the Ghostbusters, Winston played by Ernie Hudson who tells the mayor, \"I've only been with this company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I've joined these men, I've seen s--t that will turn you white!\" In my opinion I wouldn't consider this movie scary at all.. Bring your kiddies along for the ride. If your all alone pick up the phone or stay up and watch re-runs of the Joe Franklin Show at the conclusion of this movie.",

We're thrown into the life of these supposed scientist. There isn't much characterization in here and we're just watching these \"scientists\" do some bustin.The plot is not that great either and the story structure is lacking.This really feels like a second part to a movie and it's because of the weak characterization and plot. Even though their car, their suits, their bustin gun, their appearances are all iconic, I still don't feel like I know any of the characters and it's like I'm watching them from afar, just casually watching them do stuff.And speaking of stuff, there are really not much ghost bustin in here aside from that green blob and the finale of the movie, all the bustin happens in a news compilation and most of the movie is just Bill Murray doing weird faces and sayin some dumb dialogue.Also, Dan Aykroyd's acting in this is really bad, especially the part when he first slides down the pole and says that they should buy that place. I was really stunned at that delivery, didn't know if it was intentional or he's just bad. In fact, most, if not all, of the acting is kinda fake to me.And as for the comedy? Is there really any comedy in it? I don't know, I don't really remember laughing at anything in this movie and if there was an attempt at comedy there it just wasn't my cup of tea I guess.It might've been a cool movie if you were a kid in the 80's and you grew up with it, but it's not that great for this day and age.All in all, it may not have worked for me, but it might work for you and be a great comedy and a fun movie for you, so watch it and decide for yourself.",

You have to watch him and pay attention to what he says, or else you'll end up missing the funniest (yet most subtle) moments.  Add straight guy Ernie Hudson and 80s big time hottie Sigourney Weaver to the mix, and this cast is awesome.  The scene in the mayor's office........priceless.

To add to Ramis' contribution to the movie, he played Egon Spengler, the nerdy Ghostbuster that delivered the majority of his lines in a nasally dead-pan tone unless angered. The directing of this movie was brilliant and Ivan Reitman did a fine job in allowing the actors and actresses all the flexibility they wanted with the script and his added ,and sometimes very forgotten voice roles as Zuul and Slimer. And I will not leave Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, William Atherton, and David Marguiles either since they contributed to it in so many ways that it would take too long to list them all.

The sci-fi factor alone was awesome.And it was very funny.  You couldn't have a better cast(with the exception of perhaps adding John Belushi like that had originally intended).  The comedic chemistry between the four of them was flawless, and each of their personalities molded together for perfect timing and very much enjoyment. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were ingenious in, and writing the film, and Bill Murray couldn't have been funnier.  Even Ernie Hudson added a much needed balance to the original 3 Ghostbusters.     The other popular actors in the movie were very enjoyable to watch as well.And yeah, so the special effects looked fake...for 2004.

I had just gotten out of school for summer vacation and we went an saw a movie that had us laughing our heads off. This movie has lost a little of its comic edge a decade-and-a-half later, but today its still a very funny special effects comedy. The Ghostbusters about a trio of paranormal scientists who go into business catching ghosts when they discover supernatural phenomenon plaguing New York City. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are hilarious as the Ghostbusters, who spend lots of time flushing out spirits while making wise-cracks in between. Sigourney Weaver also stars in her first comedy as the Ghostbusters' first client, a musician who one day finds nasty spirits in her apartment and in the process falls in love with nutty Murray. Rick Moranis has some delightful comic moments as Weaver's nerdy neighbor, and Annie Potts (from TV's \"Designing Women\") is good too as the Ghostbusters' receptionist. Everybody is terrific in \"Ghostbusters\" with the exception of William Atherton as the villain who doesn't like the trio he refers to as \"snowball artists\". But the best performance comes from Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman. This is one of his best film roles of his career. He's naturally funny every time he's on screen. One other major asset in \"Ghostbusters\" are the special visual effects by Richard Edlund, the maestro who worked on the \"Star Wars\" trilogy, the first two \"Poltergeist\" films, and the first Indiana Jones movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The effects in this movie help to make it not only funny but exciting too. This film should have won the Oscar for visual effects because there were far more special effects shots here then there was in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", the movie that beat out \"Ghostbusters\" for the visual effects Oscar for 1984. Also, I love the title song by Ray Parker Jr. (which also was Oscar nominated). The song was a smash hit on the radio during the summer of 1984 just as the movie was a smash hit in theaters. \"Ghostbusters\" helped to make the summer of 1984 memorable. If you can remember back then, this was the summer \"Ghostbusters\", \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"Gremlins\", and \"The Karate Kid\" dominated the box office. It also was the summer the PG-13 rating was created (thanks to the violence in \"Temple of Doom\" and \"Gremlins\", PG rated movies). And it also was the summer the Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles and the U.S. Team dominated big time. The summer vacation of 1984 for me was absolutely one of my favorite summers of my life when I was a kid, and \"Ghostbusters\" was a big part of it. Even though I didn't laugh quite as hard at it after seeing it again recently, it's still a very funny movie. ***1/2 (out of four)",

            "content": "Meant as a popcorn comedy feature better than 25 years ago when it debuted, the Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd written tale holds up almost shockingly well despite its age. This partially due to Bill Murray's smarmy, sneering, cynic character which also makes comedies such as \"Stripes\" and \"Groundhog Day\" equally re-watchable. It is also due to how Reitman captures NYC's bad ol' days of crime, grit and lawlessness before Disney conquered Times Square. New York in those days was the most likely spawning group of supernatural evil and adding ghosts to the rats, and roaches seemed like an easy fit. The movie also still works because it was fairly edgy with Murray's Venkman torturing one of his male college students in an attempt to bed a female student (Jennifer Runyon was well worth the academic censure). Later he shows up for a date with Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett apparently with Thorazine in tow which he uses to sedate the possessed cellist he finds (if she wasn't possessed, what was he planning to do with it?) There is talk of the existence of god, a marshmallow man burns to death and the famous line \"yes, this man has no dick\" is uttered. Although awkward when viewed with younger DVD-watchers, the film's spice keeps it fresh even after a quarter century on the shelf. Definitely a very good choice for as a Halloween rental.",

The line \"Who You Gonna Call?\" is well used in real life and even in the movie world as a tribute to the theme music. Ghostbusters is a film that has been tagged as one of the best comedies of 1984, the movie used a lot of special effects to pass it's message across, and the powerful acting of Bill Murray (Peter) made this movie an infectious plague that as soon as you pass by while it is running on TV you just take a sit to see it again.The film was followed by a sequel, Ghostbusters II in 1989 and the movie franchise grew to include two animated television series one named The Real Ghostbusters show casing more adventures of the original four and Extreme Ghostbusters about a new team of busters mentored by Egon.Written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis the movie is about three eccentric parapsychologists in New York City, who start a ghost catching business. The movie original idea which was written by Aykroyd was a little too bogus and out of this world to have worked, as it features a group of Ghostbusters travelling through time and going to other dimensions fighting ghost. They group used wands instead of proton packs to fight the ghosts.When the story was pitched to the director and producer of this 1984 classic, Ivan Reitman, Reitman bought the idea but felt the script was just off, so Harold Ramis came on board and he and Aykroyd worked on the script for a three week period, making it more realistic and more tuned down.The Characters for the movie were meant to be played by Belushi, Eddie Murphy, and John Candy. But Belushi died during the writing of the screenplay and Murphy and Candy didn't want the roles, so Ayrkroyd and Ramis re-wrote the characters took the roles themselves and brought Bill Murray on board, an addition which was well received.The movie plot is about three unemployed parapsychology scientist who got fired from their jobs in the university for their weird behaviour and intrigue by the paranormal. The trio Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) decided to rent an old firehouse to set shop and started trapping ghost, spirits and poltergeist for money. They decided to hire an extra help and got Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) in on the ghost busting business.But things took a change for the worse when they stumbled upon a gateway into another dimension and an evil waiting to break free into this world, the group now have to go save the world from this impending disaster.The Ghostbusters is a classic comedy/Sci Fi movie that all should watch and own, the movie has so much details and fun that you find yourself captivated by the whole idea of Ghost busting. The sequel was just as good.www.lagsreviews.com",

The story, the effects, the humor all was prefect. Got to be some of the best effects in a movie ever. Past and present included. The ghost designs were major league cool and Slavitza Jovan made one sexy evil Deity. Up there's really nothing I can say bad about Ghostbusters, nothing. To this day the first Ghostbuster remains near the top of my favorite movies off all time. Nothing can take that away. The acting was perfect, the storyline perfect, the writing and dialog was perfect. What can I say, look up perfection and the original GHOSTBUSTERS will be there. I give the perfect movie a perfect score of 10 STARS.",

Compared to the other films from the 80s,the only other film that is along the same vein is probably Back to the Future. However, while others may call it a timeless classic, I beg to differ. For me, Back to the Future is significantly better. While this was a good film, especially for the 80s, in this day and age, it is just another film in a slew of sci fi comedies that have come out since then.However don't let my cynicism stop you from watching it. It's good, just not as good as it was made out to be. But if you take into account the context that made this a huge success, then you'll be able to enjoy it in its full glory.",

One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! \"Ghostbusters\" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it.This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best \"a-hole\" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, \"Dickless\". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's.",

            "content": "A wonderfully good movie, brilliantly reminiscent of the era in which it was made, \"Ghostbusters\" is a bona fide Eighties classic.  Whilst it never quite succeeds as a comedy (it is only mildly funny at best) it possesses enough monstrous spooks and ghouls to scare and thrill, combined with some memorable characterisations and a really hip soundtrack.The plot centres in on three parapsychologists who study and investigate the supernatural at a New York University.  The trio consists of wisecracking womanizer Peter Venkman(Bill Murray), overexcitable engineer Raymond Stantz(Dan Ayckroyd), and the studious intellectual Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis).The trio are thrown off campus for their apparently wasteful research, and then decide to start a business investigating and eliminating the paranormal: \"Ghostbusters\".  Armed with proton packs and ghost traps, they battle the ghoulish and the demonic, setting the scene for a climatic show-down at the top of a haunted up-town apartment building.\nThere is some superb characterisation for a comedy film.  The three strong leads are ably supported by (among many others) Sigourney Weaver, who plays Venkman's reluctant love interest,  Annie Potts as their no-nonsense secretary, Ernie Hudson as a down-to-earth black man who becomes the fourth Ghostbuster, Rick Moranis as Weaver's nerdy neighbour and David Margulies as the bemused Mayor.  Whilst none of these characters are explored in any depth, they provide a colourful balance of personalities that is the core of the picture.The colourful and delightfully messy special-effects perfectly suit the picture and one feels they wouldn't be quite so effective if the film was made today with CGI.  They are complement with some excellent set-design ranging from the Ghostbusters' dilapidated fire-station headquarters, to the eerie and foreboding high-rise.The music of the movie is excellent as well.  Bernie Brillstein's soundtrack ranges from the casually jazzy, to the scarily operatic, with some of good use of disco music in some scenes.  It perfectly complements the picture. And few would deny Ray Parker Jr's theme tune is an infectiously catchy hit.The film was followed by an equally impressive sequel in 1989.  As it stands on its own, \"Ghostbusters\" is one of the definitive American movies of the 1980s.  A exciting, and enjoyable fantasy picture.",

A disappointing watch when considering the fact that I expected to be entertained by it. I don't blame the VFX of this movie because it might have been appropriate for its time but my main issue is how the film turns out to be, especially towards the end. I hardly laughed or was amused by the comedy in this movie. Funny enough when you consider the fact that a lot of people seem to love it for its \"quotable dialogues\". The premise of the film does seem interesting but there is an absence of a feeling of genuine threat or conflict inspite of the climax where the world is supposedly going to end. Another thing that bugged me was the treatment of the female lead, i.e, the character of dana barrett (played by sigourney weaver). The character was objectified to a degree that didn't seem necessary as far as the story is concerned. The performances of the lead cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver and Harold Ramis were decent though.",

Ghost Busters is a funny comedy about three guys named Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are scientists at Columbia University, college located in New York City. When their grant expires, the trio gets fired and start up their own business of ghost exterminators called Ghost Busters! Their first customer was Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who is scared out of her apartment on the 22nd floor of a high rise apartment building on Central Park West. It seems that Dana's neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is also being affected by the strange happenings in the apartment building. Later, The Ghost Buster become wildly popular and later they have Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) joined the team because he was looking for a job and he was hired! Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Walter Peck kind of reminds me of Commander Farrell (from Swat Kats) and J. Jonah Jameson (from Spider-Man) because they also think just because the hero they have now isn't protecting the city the way they want them to they want them in jail! Also in this movie we see Slimer and that Giant Pillsbury Dough Boy. Saturday Night Live comedians Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd bring really funny jokes in this movie as well as some of their other movies!

While it does have its share of comedy, it was always 1st & foremost a scary/seriously taken film which is where the comedy comes from & makes the comedy work. The fact that the whole movie has a serious tone. Off topic for a second, this is why the main reason the 2016 movie didn't work...AT...ALL. Their frame of mind was it IS a comedy. Every single actor in that movie that had even the smallest role always tried to be funnier than the other person. There was pretty much ZER0 seriousness in the entire movie! Which is why the comedy '&' movie itself floped.\nBack on topic, enough things happened just right to make this whole film work & make it the pop culture phenomenon. Whether it was thankfully that John Candy just couldn't understand & wrap his head around the role of Louis Tully, therefore Rick Moranis getting the part. Or in a kinda messed up way, the death of Jim Bellushi made it possible that Bill Murray filled that spot, originally made for Bellushi. Everything that had to happen happened to make it what it is.\nI'm sorry & know this was supposed to be a review & part of this wasn't.",

Just to mention a few negatives on this film the casting of Rick Moranis hurts because he simply doesn't connect with the other characters nice chemistry. Sigourney Weaver's bed scene of rising through the air and voice dialogue of a talking demon is Exorcist parody and a rip-off, please this wasn't intended for a film like Ghostbusters.

            "content": "`Ghostbusters' was released back in 1984 and now, nearing 20 years on, it is still as entertaining and witty as it was when it was first released. Yes, the early computer effects do look dated compared to today's standards, but the visual effects and puppetry are good for their own uniquely likeable style. This is backed up by the films cast who are all in top form. Bill Murray is brilliantly witty as Peter Venkman. The film's co-producer, Harold Ramis is also very good as the cynical and somewhat nerdy Ghostbuster, Egon Spengler. Dan Akroyd is well suited to his role as the rather unfortunate Ghostbuster of the bunch, Ray Stanz. Ernie Hudson doesn't receive quite as much screen-time or as much conviction as the other three, but handles his role as Winston Zedmore very well. Sigourney Weaver makes a great love interest and sterling support. The script couldn't be better either and perfectly balances modest comedy with big budget sci-fi. This has proved to be a hard mixture to get right in the past but works really well here. The distinctly 80's soundtrack is highly appropriate and surprisingly memorable. The film has its fair share of memorable scenes (who can forget the opening scene) and brilliantly witty dialogue (we came, we saw, we kicked a*s). The somewhat shoddy effects on the dog like creature, Zool, are well compensated for by the light show at the end and the famous `Stay-puff marshmallow man' scene.\nOverall, `Ghostbusters' is a movie well deserving of its current status as a classic and is just as good (if not better) than the tear jerking `cinematic gems' of melodramatic drivel that has been released in the past. 8.2/10.",

It had jokes, scares, great special effects, four nerdy cool guys shooting lasers, a scantily clad babe...what else can a young boy wish for?Fast forward to twenty-five years later, with me viewing the movie for a second time. An uncomfortable truth wriggles it's way in my head as I watch: that some nostalgia doesn't stand the test of time. I notice my stubbornness to critique the movie but contemporary reality quickly illuminates how dated the movie is. Sure, it's still a big budget spectacle and some of the effects are still cool, but effects being dated can be forgiven. What ruined the overall experience is mainly how sexist and adult the movie is. I wonder how Bill Murray, obtrusively sleazebagging his way thoughout the movie, nowadays would reflect on his role here. What I used to look up to as child disturbs me now. The movie sets the sexist tone early, particularly with a bad joke that correlates menstruation with mental derangement. I watched with dumbfounded amazement. It might be pure speculation but I also got the impression that lots of cocaine where being used while making this movie. There's an exubarant vacancy to it all. A celebration of American culture that is loud, and too often cynical and hollow.While watching I started to view the movie as a cultural time capsule that through it's charicatures exposes some of the more appalling aspects of American culture in the early eighties. Women are mainly being played as puppets and black people are at best 4th option sidekicks and are most often seen as background figures doing low level jobs. Maybe as a kid this black sidekick showed me that black people can actually contribute to saving the world. Or hang with the cool white guys. So, in defense of nostalgia, maybe there is a spin to thiis. Do I devaluate the movie too much using my contemporary lens? My younger mind was better suited to appreciate it as pure entertainment. My older self is better suited to view it as a ideological object of study. If I balance these two out I would rate it a 5, with my younger self giving it a 9, and my older self giving it a 2.

            "content": "Probably the comedy film of the 1980's, Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis star as three down and out ex-college professors who decide to go into business hunting and catching ghosts in the city of New York.The true sign of a classic comedy is one that still makes you laugh, no matter how many times you've seen it. And this still makes me laugh to this day and I've seen it an awful lot! Featuring a brilliant concept and script from Akyroyd and Ramis, seamless direction from Ivan Reitman and dazzling special effects, the film is a very funny fantasy comedy with a wonderful supporting cast including Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Rick Moranis. However the stand out performance comes from Bill Murray as the deadpan Dr. Peter Venkman who, depending on whom you believe and what you read either, improvised some fantastic one-liners or improvised everything he did in the movie.A comedy classic 10/10",

It wasn't because I didn't want to, or because it looked too kiddie, but because other movies got in the way. I always told myself I was going to watch it: tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or the following day after that, but I never did.. Finally, yesterday to be exact, I watched it off of Netflix and it was more than I hoped for... Ghostbusters is just genius. There really isn't any more explanation. The lines were hit right, it was a breakthrough in terms of it's special effects and film-making, and it remains a classic. I cannot believe I haven't seen it beforehand. It's completely fun, and unbelievably clever. I'm not going to run through what adds up to make a movie, but only to explain what I liked, and that's all you'll need in order to see it, if you haven't already...The humor. It's surely not a comedy-driven film, but it surely is funny. Everybody packed in lots of witty one-liners and such, but Bill Murray is the man who does it best. The film is somewhat of a parody of films in general, but packs in a lot more than parodies usually do. If Ghostbusters had no comedy, then Ghostbusters wouldn't be Ghostbusters; plain and simple... Bill Murray. Yes, him. He basically drives the film itself packing it in with much more than it needs to be. His one-liners were hilarious, and his antics were dry but comedic. If it weren't for him (which him also tying in with the comedy) the film wouldn't be THE film...FUN! The movie is pure fun, and it was made for the 80's. It was a breakthrough in everything possible, and it seemed to have influenced much of what we have today. It's comedy was straight up hilarious. Bill Murray drives the film with his one-liners and his dry wit. The 'supporting' cast, which lines up behind Bill Murray, also shoots the film with their infectious chemistry and charisma, and makes the film what it is. If you don't like Ghostbusters, you cannot like anything. It's more than just a \"kid\" film, it's all things possible. It remains one of my favorite 80's movies, and I JUST saw it.8/10.",

The cast in Ghostbusters is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, there was so much great comic talent.

It's a hilarious comedy, one that still gets me cracking up today after having seen if hundreds of times.  Everyone in my family quotes lines from it, and it's great fun.  The ingenious comedy cast really makes the film soar, from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, to Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis. It was also nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a role other than Ripley from the \"Alien\" movies.  And the special effects, my God, the effects are absolutely incredible, regardless of what anybody says!  Some of them you can tell how they did them, but they still look good, while others simply amaze me!  This and all the other combined talents of comedy make \"Ghostbusters\" a delightful special effects comedy!  I grew up with \"Ghostbusters\".  My friends and I obsessed about it, and played \"Ghostbusters\" with toy proton-packs and traps.  I watched \"The Real Ghostbusters\" every day, and it remains my favorite cartoon.  I remember getting \"Ghostbusters\" as a Christmas gift when I was about 5 years old. That copy has since faded out, but I still watched it, almost every day when my friends came over.  I only wish I could've seen it in theaters(I might have seen it there, but I was too young to remember). \nLast weekend, I purchased the \"Collector's\" DVD, and I must say, for \"Ghostbusters\" fans, and for those who just want to have a good time, it is a must!  It has loads of extras, a video commentary as opposed to an audio commentary, and deleted scenes, including a particularly weird scene in which Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play street bums instead of Ray Stanz and Pete Venkman.  As for the movie itself, the transfer is excellent!  The special effects never looked better(well, maybe in the theaters it looked best)!\"Ghostbusters\" remains a phenomenon of special effects and incredible hilarity!  Unfortunately, the re-uniting of the ghostbusters in \"Ghostbusters 2\" didn't quite have the same magic of the first film, but I still liked it.  If you haven't seen \"Ghostbusters\", or simply didn't like it because it was \"mediocre and dated\" as some reviewers at the IMDB have said, I can't help but feel sorry for you.  \"Ghostbusters\" is a great film, not a masterpiece of film, but a masterpiece of special effects, comedy, and great fun!",

            "review_title": "Re-viewing \"Ghostbusters\"",
            "content": "At the risk of raining on anyone's nostalgia, I recently felt compelled to watch the original \"Ghostbusters\" film after not having seen it in decades and was struck by how odd the experience seemed in light of modern-day concerns. \"Ghostbusters,\" for anyone new to the planet Earth, is the story, remade into an unsuccessful reboot, of some people who create a spiritual-entity-pest control business, get in over their heads with a demonic overlord and end up saving the world, or at least a major city.I liked the movie as a kid and was in the prime demographic for it, being young, white, male and a fan of \"Star Wars,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Poltergeist.\" \"Ghostbusters\" is a fun 80s time capsule romp that doesn't seem to exist for any reason other than to entertain and has a great many memorable moments, and I wouldn't suggest that anyone who likes it not watch it, but like many movies past their prime this one seems different watching it today, and it made me think:1) The \"ghosts\" are actually demons--this happened in the poltergeist-free \"Poltergeist\" film too. The ghosts are generally not representatives of dead souls and the final battle is essentially with a demon. It probably would have been too much to portray demons and religious matters in a mainstream, big-budget comedy back then, but that's what the film seems to be about (particularly the scenes with a possessed Sigourney Weaver paying homage to \"The Exorcist,\" which would have made more sense then than it probably would now). It's interesting that a 1984 version of the underworld casts what looks like a spandex-clad female dancer from \"Xanadu\" as its devil.2) Speaking of which, women, in the world of \"Ghostbusters\" are either grouchy receptionists, objects of desire at the mercy of clueless men or neutered hags. The ideal woman is apparently cold, statuesque, well-to-do, does aerobics and is only \"released\" from the prison of herself by wearing make-up and slinky dresses. It's weird to see \"Ripley\" as a damsel in distress, to say the least. There are no healthy romances in the world of \"Ghostbusters\"--the end credits suggest Weaver and Murray end up together but it's apparent it wouldn't last.3) People of color aren't in prominent roles. It seems Eddie Murphy was supposed to be in the film and one wonders how it might have been different--would he have stolen the show from Murray? Or would he have played another embarrassing caricature? As it stands in the movie it's clear--it's a white, (straight) male world and everyone else is a supporting character. I was there at the time and that wasn't the case in real life, even if it was often the case in the movies. We have plenty of movies that represent \"the rest of us\" nowadays and it's great that things have leveled off enough that seeing a movie as homogenous as this now feels kind of odd. Oh, and all the smoking--indoors yet--is funny too. The world has truly changed.3) Science is something only \"nerds\" are into, and nerds are to make fun of and brush off even if they have the power to use their brains to save the world. In the world of this film, the only thing that matters is one-liners and taking jabs at everyone and everything that one thinks is dumb, which one sees echoes of in today's society (whether \"Ghostbusters\" is to blame for teaching generations fed on TV this outlook or not is another matter).4) Bill Murray, once again doing his \"anarchist/lovable creep\" routine, looks really bored, maybe even irritated most of the movie, and I can't help but think a lot of people confuse actors with the roles they play. Back in the day, every guy I knew wanted to be Murray...getting away with being rude, obnoxious, lazy and stupid, making fun of everything he doesn't understand while indulging in bravado and cynicism to mask his insecurities, preying on women by annoying them until they give in, being a big, paunchy dummy who loves rock and roll and fast women, but always with a punchline at the right moment to distract people from his lack of attractive attributes by disarming them with humor. He isn't particularly witty despite his witticisms; he's the ultimate underachiever and the realization of what people outside the US see as an ugly American: oblivious, entitled, obnoxious, bloated and unable to keep his mouth shut, even when he's shooting himself in the foot. That this character was once considered a hero and someone people tried to emulate, something I never understood even as a teen (and I liked Murray's films) says a lot about where we are these days.5) Young boomers of the day once doubled over in laughter at the idea that a mythical pop-consumer icon, a symbol representing a false conception of a lost era in the shape of a doughy, fat, monstrous, giant white male, would potentially be society's downfall.I distinctly remember the sequel to \"Ghostbusters\" being underwhelming and realizing I had finally, perhaps, grown too old for these kinds of movies. At the least, the sequel didn't have anything like the same bite or charm the original had. I don't know that anyone but people my age care about \"Ghostbusters\" anymore, or even if they should (even as a new reboot is on the way apparently), but if nothing else, despite being problematic in some ways, the film remains a unique entity, a big-budget comedy that treads a line between humor, horror, science and speculation while dazzling the eye with pretty colors and the mind with intriguing, imaginative ideas. Oh, and Rick Moranis is, as always, wonderful.",

It was TOO MUCH if you understand what I am saying. The plot is that three parapsychologist professors get fired from the university that they work with so they take loan and start a business to catch(busts) ghosts(duh!)(by the way noone in this city seems too upset that ghosts are real). I want to be real with you I loved Bill Murray in this movie and I personally think he is the reason that the movie was such a big hit I cant say the same for the rest of the cast tho. They are too corny for me , they try to much to be funny and they just don't succeed except Rick Moranis's character the only time that I laughed is when he was on the screen. The plot moves really fast and it didn't make any sense whatsoever. The romance between Bill Murray's character and Sigourney Weaver's its too linear(she doesn't like him then he becomes famous now she does) . The phrase \"don't cross the streams\" will be in my head for ever for some reason. The movie was made to make people laugh(i didn't) but some people will , maybe am not the Ghostbusters type of guy. Music was a big one, I don't know if liked the main song (Who you gonna call..

Now Ernie Hudson was never really part of the group in this movie, in the second one he was more integrated into the fold. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis are a brilliant comedic pairing. The chemistry between these 3 characters is warm and funny. The special effects are good for the time and contribute to the film rather than make up the majority of it like so many films today. Bill Murray especially laces his dialogue with wisecracks and this is one of his best roles. This movie is a classic and I think they should be making a third.

And even though I am a big 80s movie fan, particularly of the horror and sci-fi genres (to a point of deeming the releases of this decade as the best ever made), I never quite got its massive appeal. I saw the inspired creativity and iconic designs behind it, and the story was fun enough to uphold the badge of great entertainment. But in a decade that I considered the most creative, with movies like Back to the Future, Star Wars OT, Terminator and such; I never quite understood what made it so massively popular... Then I saw it a second time.I cannot believe, at some point, I almost began to believe I disliked this movie. I must have seen it in the wrong mindset because when I rewatched it a second time, my opinion of it shattered. Every element that matters in a movie and particularly a blockbuster movie like this is done with care and perfection: the writing is tight and unburdened, with incredible comedic timing and witty dialogue; it never wastes your time and delivers its creative contributions like who they are, what they do and how they do it with concise and at times visually layered sequences that uses the comedy to present the information. It never panders to the audience and the biggest and best joke is saved for the ending, which I found hilarious. An ending that thank god was not only funny but brought the story and elements presented full-circle at the end.There's very little to criticize about this movie, any faults it may have like questionable VFX and cgi/puppet-blend noticeability is easily overlooked once you are in the mindset of the time and movie. If anything, the only flaw I can see in it is simply the mishandled use of the fourth Ghostbusters, Winston Zeddemore. I think the reference they make in Stranger Things Season 2 is earned and understandable given the character comes out of almost nowhere in the story and doesn't seem to add anything to the team except \"lend an additional hand\". And it's nothing against the actor nor is it a big enough aspect to ruin my enjoyment of the movie, but his presence and dialogue is focused on reacting to circumstances and never suggesting a plan of action, he simply behaves like a civilian who got caught up in all the madness and has nothing scientific to add.Believe it or not, I never quite understood Bill Murray's brand of humor. I never found him as funny as people said. However, I like his humor here because his lines contain great wit and he is a fantastic quippy actor that delivers them perfectly. Also, despite how all actors are famous SNL comedians, the movie does a great job at giving each of them a distinct and interesting personality, each one of which adds something to the team and story. So much so that, even though Bill Murray has the role of \"comic relief\" for the audience, his character has more aspects to him that also add to the story and the team which makes that character trope work in this case. And that's why, for me personally, I found Winston to be a very underdeveloped character. Perhaps they developed him more in the next movie, but in this one I don't understand why he wasn't there from the beginning. Storywise it changes nothing.I personally am grateful that the movie not only is tremendously original when it comes to how it approaches its premise, themes and story elements. But its audiovisual designs are snappy, simplistic and iconic. From the ECTO-1 car, to their Headquarters, to their get up, to their theme song, to their logo. As an artist myself, I personally love the 80s and 90s because when it came to branding and design, these decades had some of the more \"in your face\", clean, loud and colorful designs, from costume to props to characters to story to even their merchandising and posters. The Ghostbusters logo is so simple in design and color and yet so inspired, with a great contrast that tells exactly what you need to know without added details. And that's what the movie could be summarized in: inspired. Just like all the imagery used as inspiration, from the decision of making them \"look\" like exterminators, to the fitting choice of using a firemen station for their base of operations, where ghost sightings are as alarming as a fire and require the same need for immediate response.IN CONCLUSION, Everything works in Ghostbusters. From the characters, to the story, to the comedy, to the self awareness, to the poking fun at its premise as they use super dangerous methods to entrap ghosts, to the poking fun and making use of horror and sci-fi tropes; to the surprising subtle commentary on the government, capitalist and branding/Commercialisation of 1980s America. These things make this movie not only amazing but also timeless. I think it is the best example and blend of comedy and sci-fi/horror, although I wouldn't consider it horror or scary, more like using Halloween-monster-lore. A movie designed to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, which believe it or not is not as easy to do as you think. Overall a must watch.",

Sigourney Weaver is in this during her earlier years.Anybody can enjoy this movie. I saw this when I was about 6 years old and I have loved it ever since. The kids will like it for the action and the ghosts, everyone else who watches it will probably appreciate the humor in it. This isn't real scary, but I knew a 4 year old who watched this and he was pretty scared by it.Unfortunately, it is a bit dated. Many of the ghost effects that were amazing in 1984 are considered fake for today's standards.

As a child, I would watch them over and over, reciting line for line.  It's probably responsible for some of my mental problems (And obsessions with memorization), but the movie still stands up today as one of my favorites to watch.It seems silly to tell you the plot, not knowing what Ghostbusters is about is like being unfamiliar with the story of creation with Adam and Eve.  At least amongst my generation it stands as a rite of passage practically; when my friends learned that another friend had never seen it, he was practically shunned.  The omission was called a good deal of things, my favorite adjective was \"outrageous!\"Anyway, Ghostbusters is of course, the tale of three parapsychologists, Doctors Peter Venkman, Ray Stanz, and Egon Spengler (Great character names, I can never forget them) who are kicked out of their professorships at Columbia University, and decide to go into business for themselves as a sort of exterminator service for people with ghost problems.  The film is mix of comedy, action, and scares, that somehow manages to hit just the right notes on all three, you scream and laugh at the same time.  It's a mix that few have been able to achieve since (The recent Evolution by Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman has limited success in this same area).Everything about this movie clicks.  The cast, led by Bill Murray, seem so perfect in their roles.  Harold Ramis, for all his success elsewhere, shall always be Egon (Love the line when facing the Marshmellow Man, \"Sorry Venkman.  I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.\")  The song by Ray Parker Jr. is of course famous, but Elmer Bernstein's excellent score has sadly been overlooked.  The effects, fairly cutting edge for the time, (mostly) hold up well, those that don't only make the ghostbusting scenes all the more humorous.Really, if you haven't seen this movie, you should be arrested.  It's on television more than Die Hard.  Watch it!",

All of the supporting cast is good as well making the most of what they are working with.\nVisual Humour is the well done here with the final big bad being awsome.So what's not so good?The humour is hit and miss although it does hit more often than miss there where long pauses where you wait for the funny and well, it just isnt. After Stripes I'm afraid Ghostbusters was a little too bland & safe with many of its jokes in the theatre being predictable and just not working (no one laughed).I mentioned the visual comedy was well done but was all wasted as all of it was revealed by the films trailer, so no where as impactfull as it could have been. Sadly Hollywood just doesnt know how to cut a trailer anymore.A horror comedy should be scary as well, the opening scene in the library delivered but thats it, the rest even for the 1980's was a bit of a yawn. The effects where well passable for 1984 but now? oh dear!Finally just as something began happening the film kind of ended as there isnt that much of a story.Despite all the issues I enjoyed it more than I was bored but maybe it was all the hype at the time that spoiled it all (and the trailer showing too much as usual)This is a good film but thats all.",

Of course, it had already been a huge hit in the US, and the waves of enthusiasm had been lapping at our shore for months;  then there was that splendid theme tune which had been sat in the Top Twenty throughout late summer and the autumn, so by the time the pic finally arrived there was a tremendous amount of expectation.That Saturday night there were hundreds of filmgoers in the centre of Cardiff, but all to see the one film (I can still remember the deafening silence that greeted the cinema manager's enquiry, shouted down the length of that great queue, \"Is there ANYONE for 'Bachelor Party'?\").  Lord knows how many were turned away, but those that made it in cheered as one when the lights dimmed.  Moments later, we were cheering again, whooping our appreciation of the library ghost's horrifying transformation, and then we were singing - well, shouting really -  along to the theme song, and this mood of festive celebration (it was Christmas, after all) was maintained throughout the next two hours, and it was one in which I joined as enthusiastically as anybody, despite a bladder which had been demanding urgent attention since even before the trailers had finished (and despite the slight disappointment of that giant doughman, which meant nothing to us in the UK), and long before the film's conclusion, I realised that I hadn't had so much fun on a cinema visit before, and nor have I had since.And when it had ended, and we had filed back out into the winter night (some of us via the gents), with each of our group almost taking turns to ask the rest if they had enjoyed the movie as much as he had, we began the ritual of recalling favorite moments from the film. But something odd happened. \"Remember that bit when...when...\" When what? Hmm. Try again.  \"How about when he said...when he said...\"  Said what?  Did what? Hmmmm.Long before we'd reached home, we'd realised that the only highlights the film had were moments of spectacle, that there hadn't been any really good jokes, or plot twists, or weird little moments of invention; less than 30 minutes after leaving the cinema on that high, we'd realised that the movie had been thoroughly mediocre.A paradox, surely: how could we have enjoyed it so if it was a poor film? Simple: the audience made it fun; we'd acted like our own warm-up act.  We were there to enjoy ourselves and enjoy ourselves we did, all the film did was provide us with a few cues so we could keep the vibe up.  I said it is the most fun I've ever had at the cinema, and so it is: it's the same sort of fun I've had on a fairground ride when there's a load of people all screaming in mock terror - wouldn't be as good if you were alone, and so it is with 'Ghostbusters'; I've seen it since on TV, and it passes the time if you've absolutely nothing else to do, otherwise...Oh, and I saw the sequel in a cinema, but one that was nine-tenths empty. It didn't stand a chance.",

This used to be my favorite movie as a kid and I just recently saw the DVD version and I could see why I liked it so much.It's the story of three New York paranormal investigators who were just fired from their university and consider this an omen that they should go into business for themselves. The three(and later four) of them find themselves to be most successful and popular paranormal eliminators. But once one of them gets involved with a woman who lives in a demonic spirit like building things turn ugly for them, with sometimes hilarious results.Anyone who doesn't like this movie either hasn't seen it or doesn't have a sense of humor. I don't know who wouldn't laugh at Bill Murray's hilarious one-liners or the classic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man scene.A great movie. 9/10",

            "content": "Some of the most memorable characters in comedy were created by Saturday Night Live legends Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. Ghostbusters was the second time Murray teamed up with SCTV writer Harold Ramis, and combined with Aykroyd, they made a comedy classic that still holds up well today. Kids who grew up in the 80's remember the Ghostbusters mania that swept the nation. My brother had all the toys, and I think we still have the Ghostbusters fire house model in our attic. It is even popular with young kids today.Murray, Ramis, and Aykroyd play a group of paranormal scientists whose theories and experiments are looked down upon in the Academic world. Murray plays Peter Venkman, the sarcastic member of the trio. Ramis is Egon Spengler, a dead serious yet hilarious scientist. Aykroyd is the closest thing to a straight man but he has an almost childlike enthusiasm for his job that makes him amusing. After they see a ghost for the first time, their University terminates their grant, and they are forced to go into business for themselves. Just when it looks like they are about to go bankrupt, ghost fever grips New York City, and they become huge celebrities. Funny supporting cast members include Rick Moranis of SCTV fame, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson as Winston, the fourth Ghostbuster. Eddie Murphy was originally considered for the role of Winston, but I'm glad he turned it down. 80's Eddie Murphy was hilarious, but it would have been too much to have another comedy giant in the cast, especially when he's introduced so late into the picture.Ghostbusters had great special effects for its time; I must say even today's computer animation could not do much better. Memorable ghosts include Slimer, who got his own TV show, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. The film's main strength and the cause of its lasting appeal is the cast, however. Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis form a terrific ensemble cast and are some of the most memorable characters in comedy. The deadpan delivery of the jokes amongst the absurdity is hilarious. Just a sample of a great joke: \"Why worry? Each one of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.\" The film has a cynical New Yorker attitude that makes the film even more endearing, and funny when you consider that half the film was made in California. In one of my favorite scenes, Rick Moranis is attacked by a demon, and all the witnesses just go back to eating their food when it's over. There are too many good one-liners and jokes to mention, and the writers take great pride in turning \"slime\" into a verb! Ghostbusters spawned one sequel, several cartoon series, and video games (a new Ghostbusters game is coming out soon), but none of them has been or will be as memorable as the first movie.",

The only thing classifying it as a comedy is probably due to its absurdity like the final marshmallow guy boss.The close-up CGI was also a joke. While this is to be expected from the 80s, I'm not sure they should even make a CGI movie in that case. On the other hand, the larger-picture CGIs were surprisingly good.At the end, there is a forced romance with one of the ghostbusters kissing the girl involved in this mess. There was no reason what so ever for this kiss but that every western movie seems to need a kiss even in the 80s.Maybe I'm too much of a zoomer to appreciate this movie. But for today's standards, it was definitely a hot mess.",

            "content": "In this supernatural comedy that blends the paranormal, when Columbia University downsizes their science department, Doctors Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters - investigators and eliminators of paranormal pests. When the team's first client Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, the Ghostbusters come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to destroy Manhattan and the world along with it.\"Ghostbusters\" has a lot of neat effects, some of them mind-boggling, others just quick little throwaways, as when a transparent green-slime monster gobbles up a mouthful of hot dogs. No matter what effects are being used, they're placed at the service of the actors; instead of feeling as if the characters have been carefully posed in front of special effects, we feel they're winging this adventure as they go along.This was a movie that was crafted in a way where its sincere, dry humor relied mostly on witty dialog and delivery rather than sight gags. It's the comedy, the acting, the writing, and the creativity behind the film that truly make it succeed. The comedic genius of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, coupled with the intriguing and exciting idea of ghostbusting (those proton packs are almost as irresistibly cool as a lightsaber from Star Wars), really make this one stand out. The guys play off each other like a modern day Marx Brothers team, lead by the ever-talented deadpan humor of Bill Murray.But the idea behind Ghostbusters feels as though it could have been adapted from a famous comic book. However, its completely original story and realistic portrayal set in New York City really adds a lot to the film. While many of today's comedies probably would be more vulgar, more silly, and more campy (you can look at director Ivan Reitman's abysmal 2001 mistake Evolution as such an example), the comedy in Ghostbusters just seems more honest and real.The jokes, the chemistry on screen, and the effects all fall into place. As entertaining today as it ever was, it's a classic to be treasured by all.",

            "content": "It's a bit difficult to review this film in a conventional way. Normally, I'd be disappointed with a movie that has as many tonal inconsistencies as this does, and also has such a convoluted plot. These are valid concerns, and are enough to make a lot of movies just plain suck. But in the summer of 1984, convention was thrown out the window and an unsurpassed American classic was born. Ghostbusters is enormously entertaining and one of the funniest movies ever, containing some of film's most iconic moments of all time. With vintage special effects, great characters, and large doses of Bill Murray, Ghostbusters is a movie that everyone can, and probably will, deeply enjoy.The film opens in a mood typical of a horror movie, with an innocent, elderly librarian being terrorized by some sort of ghost. Then suddenly, some great 80s music kicks in and in the next scene, we are introduced to the least scary or serious thing ever: Bill Murray. This man makes Ghostbusters his own, and completely steals the show. His dry, sarcastic humor is so perfect and unique, and he can conjure up laughs with just a look. Nothing fazes him, everything amuses him, and nothing is allowed to be taken too seriously in his presence. Without him, this movie would be vastly different, and probably quite a bit less fun. Interestingly, he has great chemistry with Sigourney Weaver, and it's a joy to watch their characters interact. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis complement each other (and contrast with Murray) magnificently, playing socially awkward geeks with hilarious results. Ernie Hudson, portraying the last-minute fourth ghost buster, also gets in a few great lines. William Atherton from Die Hard also appears late in the game, playing just as great an antagonist as in said film. Adding more to the spectacle is the inclusion of Rick Moranis, playing one of his best characters ever. Add it all together and you get a brilliant comedy that is completely outrageous, yet at times quietly subtle in its humor. It's also one of the few of its kind that actually gets better with age and repeated viewings.However, there's still the matter of the utterly inane story to consider. By the climax, any remaining semblance of plot is basically thrown out the window. But the film's rather ridiculous premise actually serves to better the film. Some of the movie's most strikingly memorable moments come from the silliest concepts, such as \"crossing the streams,\" the Slimer ghost, or the colossal Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (all of which still look fantastic, even by today's CGI standards). And it's examples like these that tell us how much fun the filmmakers were having with the whole concept from the get-go. All the ridiculous backstory with Zuul, Gozer the Gozerian, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster doesn't mean much; it's all about being entertaining, and Ghostbusters does this perfectly.With such a strange foundation for a film- that is, being big- budget, special effects-laden horror-comedy- there were countless things that could have gone wrong. Against all odds, Ghostbusters gets everything absolutely right. It's blast for people of all ages, and an absolute laughter riot. It has an immensely talented cast backing the superb Bill Murray, just doing what he does best, and a plethora of noteworthy scenes and one-liners. It's a must-own, and it deserves 10 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "This feels awkward... how do I explain this?Let me see if I can explain my reaction to this movie the best I can.This movie came out when I was in my early teens. I first saw the commercial for it on television, and my obnoxious older brother was there pointing out every detail in the commercial and cackling wildly over it. I thought it looked intriguing and wanted to see it, but I couldn't figure out why my brother was going berzerk splitting a side over the commercial (he ROARED the moment they showed the now-famous Ghostbusters logo and shrilled, \"Isn't that logo HILARIOUS???\" I liked the logo, but I didn't think it funny).Unfortunately, the movie came out at a time when I was expected to buy all my own stuff since I had a paper route. And that particular time period I was busy raising up money for a new stereo. So as a result, I was disappointed when the movie left town before I had gotten to see it. And I had sighed, \"WOW, for a huge hit movie, THAT was sure gone fast.\"For the next year or two, I was forced to endure everybody else's comments about how hilarious and wonderful this movie was. But whenever I asked what had happened in it, they never answered me. All I got was, \"You've just GOT to see it, words don't do it justice, it's HILARIOUS and it's SO COOL!\"Well, during that time I had learned a few of the basics, such as the uniforms and the gadget packs their wore, but that was about it since nobody answered my questions. Fortunately, the movie was being brought back for a brief run in movie theatres before they released it to home video (back then, movies didn't get automatically released on to video a few months after theatrical release the way they are today--you had to wait a few years and then MAYBE if you were lucky it would be). I got all anxious to see it, raised a bit of money once I had gotten finished paying for everything else I had needed to take care of that month--and it was gone from the theatres again! Another groan of frustration from me. I thought, \"Why can't the local movie house at LEAST keep it here for a MONTH or so???\"But then, FINALLY--around early 1987, I think--GHOSTBUSTERS was finally released to home video among a huge flurry of hype. And a friend of mine had managed to rent it one night while I was sleeping over at his house. So I finally managed to see GHOSTBUSTERS for the very first time--\n--and I went \"Huh?\"I just sat there with the most puzzled feeling and going, \"This is it??\"I just don't know how to describe it. By the time I had finally gotten to see it, I was all prepared for that really \"cool\", \"hilarious\" movie everyone was telling me about... and I didn't get one. Instead, I sat through it bored and bewildered. I don't know, somehow I had just expected it to be... very, different. I don't know how, just different, not like the movie I ended up seeing.I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this movie. I truly did. God knows I tried. I bought the soundtrack and everything afterward, trying to get myself to be as nuts about this movie as everybody else I knew was. But I just couldn't get into it at all.A few months later my older brother rented GHOSTBUSTERS and my whole family sat and watched. I, along with my parents, just sat there confused. But my older brother, on the other hand... well, to give you an idea, during the one scene when you briefly see a Ghostbuster hopping along on one foot with his eyes closed, my brother was just rolling all over the floor and squealing with delight. \"Isn't that just THE most HILARIOUS thing you ever SAW?????\" he shrieked. The rest of us just sat there trying to figure out what all the fuss was about.It wasn't until years later that I think I finally managed to figure out my huge disappointment with this film. I was not familiar with Hollywood names save for one or two, and I had always just taken movies at face value. It wasn't until much later that I had begun to be familiar with that one particular Ghostbuster who had been doing the foot-hopping that my brother was crowing about, an actor named Bill Murray. This was the first movie is he I had ever seen.I hate to say this, but around 1992 or so after seeing many more of his output, I have come to the conclusion that I simply do not care for Bill Murray. I have never found him funny, on the contrary he bores me to pieces. In the future, I would end up just not enjoying a single, solitary motion picture of his--Bill Murray is apparently just not my type of performer. Only the spectacular LOST IN TRANSLATION ended up winning a huge place in my heart, not because I thought him funny but because I thought his character was genuinely touching and sublimely acted--and that was twenty years after the fact.I find it interesting that, later on, I found the first season of the cartoon based on this film (THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, so named as to distinguish it from another \"Ghostbusters\"-entitled cartoon released at the same time by Filmation) much more involving and entertaining than the actual movie itself.These days, I can watch it on occasion, but I just watch it on a whim whenever it happens to be on. I haven't actually gone out and rented it myself to this day. My personal feelings are that I probably needed to see it as soon as it was released along with everyone else as opposed to after the rest of the world and putting up with all the hype--I think in my case my expectations ended up being raised so high that I ended up suffering \"Phantom Menace\" syndrome for this title. That's a shame, too, as I thought this should be a movie I would automatically love. I have the feeling not getting to see it fresh simply killed it for me and I just didn't get it because I didn't get to experience it along with everyone else properly. I still sigh in disappointment whenever I watch it, as even now when I see it on I try so hard to like it... I really, really, REALLY want to like this movie as much as everyone else does, but so far I have yet to get above \"just okay\". Maybe someday I'll finally love it as much as everyone else seems to, though.",

A veteran of such movies as \"Alien\", Weaver seemed destined to portray an alien in her future.The director made a great decision when they decided Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson to fight alongside Bill Murray and Harold Ramis.

One can always tell when a movie will be a success when the actors perform on screen with enjoyment and smiles on their faces.Everything about this film says great movie from plot, direction, cast and especially the humor. This is suggested to everybody",

Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are hilarious, Rick Moranis is classic, and Sigorney Weaver proved that she could do comedy long before 'Galaxy Quest'.The dialogue is great, with some fabulous ad-libbed stuff from the actors. The special effects are not the greatest compared to today's computer-generated stuff, but I think it adds a sort of comic feel to the movie that deserves to be there.Forget about the then-overplayed theme song. Forget about the 'He Slimed Me' and 'Back Off Man' t-shirts. Forget about the not-so-great sequel.If you haven't seen this movie for awhile, go rent it and I'm sure you will laugh.",

            "content": "This is my childhood classic. From the age of four, I followed ghostbusters religiously for many years. The cartoons have stopped, the toys have gone, but the films remain. The first instalment is definately my favourite! This film is such good fun to watch for all ages and is very underated, but then again, most Ivan Reitman films are.Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver are on great form as they normally are (although Aykroyd has had his fair share of blips). Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis and Annie Potts provide good support in probably the best roles of their career except Hudson who was really good in The Crow. With a good cast and crew, this film is on a winner before you've even seen the first scene and with some great special effects, this movie is pleasing to the eye. Spoiler: The bit where Dana and Lewis transform in to Zool and Vince would have been achieved much better under modern standards. In fact, the two 'demon dogs' often looked a bit fake. But, the Marshmallow man redeems it completely! Fantastic!This movie offers a lot, comedy, action, romance and can be quite scary for kids. The bit where Dana is attacked on her arm chair had me running behind the sofa when i saw the film the first couple of times. Great film, should be in everyone's collection.",

Venkman being an older male teacher and flirting with a young female student was gross. Then him asking a woman who saw a ghost if she's menstruating was misogynistic (and since when do periods cause hallucinations anyways?). And him repeatedly forcing himself on Dana and trying to kiss her when she clearly says no and is uninterested was really creepy. Overall this movie has NOT aged well and unless you have nostalgia for this movie I don't recommend watching it.",

Bill Murray said in 1989 he'd only want to make one Ghostbusters movie every 5 years so we'd be up to Production on number 5 by now.  Thanks Bill!  Ivan Reitman said he didn't think it was a good movie when he made it.  He said he thought \"Junior\" was a better movie How many times do directors say that about a film that becomes a big hit.  Eddie Murphy was originally cast as Winston and later in \"Multiplicity\".  The joke there is it's twice he's rejected working with Harold Ramis.  He chose to do \"The Golden Child\" in 1984 instead. Interestingly, his friend Arsenio Hall did the voice of Winston for a few years on the cartoon show.It's a great funny movie that I've probably seen 50 times in my life and memorized all the one-line jokes of.  The supernatural mumbo jumbo that Egon shoots out there is as funny as any joke by Peter Venkman.  Ernie Hudson gets to play Winston as such an outsider to the other three that it made him an instant crowd favorite.  I wish they'd make another but Bill Murray doesn't want to because he's afraid of being typecast.  Memo to Bill Murray: Your last big movie was in 1993.  Stop playing golf with your brothers on Comedy Central and make another one, pronto!",

Bill Murray really shines here. His dead-pan humour and smart-ass remarks are really great. The rest of the cast are great as well. Dan Aykroyd as the smarts of the group, Harold Ramis as the intelligent scientist, and Ernie Hudson as the smart-talking new recruit. But there are ghost in this film, and as unrealisitic as it is compared to today, they are still really good, and I can say that I've now got one quote from this film that has become one of my all-time favourites ('We came, we saw, we kicked its ASS!!').This is a funny film, and I can really see why it's entered the pop culture world.

            "content": "In this recession hit cesspool that we wade through today, times are hard for the small businessperson. We often hark back to the glory days in the mid eighties when the the self-employed were kings among men, mass unemployment provided cheap labour and the national minimum wage was only the stuff of a communist's dream. This was the age of the yuppie, the brickish mobile phone, the tape-loading home computer and, of course, the Ghostbusters: men who knew all too well what small business implementation meant.The founders of the Ghostbusters (Drs Spengler, Stantz and Venkman) were firmly ensconced in the academic gravy train before being made redundant due to the perceived lack of moral and financial viability of their research. With no funding and only their ideas, as well as some purloined laboratory equipment, these three, instead of going cap-in-hand to the unemployment office, used their bold initiative and set up their own small business: Ghostbusters.At first they only had an idea that they genuinely believed in: a paranormal reconnaissance and disposal service. With little or no market research, they collectively decided to risk Dr Stantz's home, taking out a triple mortgage secured against the property in order to procure some fixed assets. A high risk strategy that they staked against their service being exclusive to their chosen market.Their first task was to search and snare business premises, wisely choosing one of the less salubrious areas of Manhattan for a property search. This resulted in their finding a ramshackle former fire station with a high level of interior and exterior maintenance requirements. Both criteria ensured initial start up costs were kept to a minimum while being able to stay within their target audience in the heart of New York City and the Tri-state Area.Now with a work space, the three pioneers soon divided the labour: Dr Spengler became head of research and development, ensuring their tools of the trade were operational as soon as possible; Dr Stantz procured more fixed assets, including a reasonably priced used vehicle, undertaking the maintenance work himself to slash costs; Dr Venkman became the human face of the organisation, encouraging his partners with humour and constructive criticism. A receptionist/secretary was hired in the form of Janine Melnitz, who with her New Yorker savvy and no nonsense attitude, was a great find in an already saturated job market. A strong branding exercise in the form of a striking logo and accompanying song was soon incorporated into the business, which awaited its first customers.After an initial slow period, as expected in any new business, the work soon trickled in, starting with just one customer, Ms Dana Barrett, with a seemingly small complaint, one which our intrepid entrepreneurs could easily handle. From then, possibly by word of mouth in the spirit world (or syndicated television advertising) their turnover increased exponentially. For the initial contracts with large corporations, including luxury hotels, they were able to charge higher fees being the only ghostbusting service within that area. Having a sliding scale of prices also meant that the ordinary customer was not priced out of the market, gaining them popularity with the bottom end of the demographic.Additional labour was soon acquired in hiring Winston Zeddmore, with a strong work ethic based on monetary reward, and a brutal honesty in admitting that if the paycheck were right, he would believe in anything. Winston fitted in well with the other founders in providing a neutral sounding board and an additional common sense attitude in tandem with Dr Venkman.Even with four operatives, three being executive board members, the unpredictability of working with the paranormal took its toll. The Environmental Protection Agency intervened causing an administrative as well as cataclysmic headache for the Ghostbusters and the city in general. After arrest, interrogation and incarceration, the exclusivity of the Ghostbusters' business shone through and after a no nonsense meeting with the mayor, they were free to tackle the crisis at hand.And so the Ghostbusters saw themselves go from disgraced academics to small business entrepreneurs to city saviours. With the right combination of ideas, talent and a previously untapped market, you too could become as successful. Just remember to never cross the streams of business and interpersonal relationships unless there is no other choice.*** In my next essay \"Ghostbusters II: What went wrong?\" I will outline the errors in the Ghostbusters' taxing and liability insurance strategies and how ultimately they managed to regain a foothold in a recession-riddled and cynical market.",

As a result of this outrageous craze, I would imitate the film's characters both at home and at school, where I would act out various scenes from the pictures outside on the playground. Back then I would view this movie several times in a single week! Ghostbusters remained a favorite with me through the years as I discovered other interesting, entertaining, and overwhelming motion pictures that would also become huge hits with me. Ghostbusters is my number one favorite movie today, no doubt about it. I own a copy of the DVD and plan on keeping it forever.

Our three heroes(with a fourth who joins halfway through the movie) do battle with an ancient god who plots to put an end to the world. This sounds pretty slim.

But he remains a jerk throughout. The kiss he shares with Sigourney at the end seems like a tacked on happy ending that is entirely unearned. Murray seems disinterested in what is happening in the film, cracking lame jokes but hardly ever involved in the action in any meaningful way. He's the least capable ghostbuster, and the others have to explain things to him. I know this was popular but I'll never understand why.",

I was about nine or ten before I fully got into it, just before the sequel was released.  I tend to develop crushes on men in movies when I really enjoy a film.  I won't say which one it was, but in retrospect I have an attitude now of, 'what the hell was I thinking?  The man had to be at least 20 years my senior... old enough to be my father!'  I was teased quite a lot for it.  So after the fixation on Ghostbusters went to the wayside, I only recently watched some of this film during the holiday season (I own the sequel).  The mixture of storyline, humor, intensity and a touch of horror makes this one of the cinematic gems of the past decade... quite possibly the past century.    And it can be enjoyed by people of pretty much any age.  When you're young, you wouldn't understand some of the humor that when you get older you would understand.    Lots of fun... and the special effects were amazing for the time.  I recommend it for anyone.",

I still loved it and continually hired it when it came out on video, then bought it, then bought the laserdisc and now have the incredible special edition DVD! This movie is side-splittingly funny every single time. Bill Murray just seems to play the part so naturally, the script is genuinely funny and original, containing wit, sarcasm and hilarity. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play their parts like they were born to play them and transferring every character from their script onto the screen with its own individuality, giving each actor a chance to shine. There are so many bonuses to this movie that you just don't find in others. Besides the three ghostbusters providing all the laughs, there's Rick Moranis in still his best role ever, Sigourney Weaver in her first comedy, but playing the character straight, sincerely, and sexy. There's Ernie Hudson, providing the film with even more reality, with his black new-yorker's point of view. Then, besides all that, you've got some impressive special effects, some great ghosts, a cool eighties soundtrack, and perfectly fitting, ghostly, musical score. And don't forget Annie Potts or the student who keeps getting electrocuted! This movie has so many memorable lines. Every scene is a classic, obviously handled so well by director Ivan Reitman and edited into a perfectly quick-paced running time. There is no limit to how may times you can watch this movie. It couldn't have been any better, but the sequel sure could have!",

I recently picked up a special DVD set of both Ghostbusters films and I still love watching them.As a child of the 80s, I had all the Ghostbuster toys, the GB action figures, Ecto mobile, Firehouse. I only wish I'd kept them. My brother and I even dressed up as Ghostbusters one Halloween.The film itself is very entertaining and really makes me miss good, intelligent comedies. There is not one single fart or sex joke in this entire movie and yet it's still really funny in some parts. I often wonder if good comedy movies like this still exist, one can only watch so many fart jokes until they get lame and boring.Although some of the effects to seem dated, they hold up pretty well considering over two decades have passed since the production of this movie. The Stay Puft man is still one of the coolest bad guys ever.If there's something strange in the neighbourhood...who you still gonna call?",

The movie itself has some of the funniest actors alive in it and they all perform well. And the movie is based around a concept which can interest millions. It is no wonder this film is a cult classic.The film is directed by Ivan Reitman, the same genius behind films like Stripes and Meatballs. The film is written by both Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis, who both star in it. Ghostbusters is about a group of scientists who form a profession about hunting, tracking, and trapping ghosts! Exactly what the title insists! The story is terrific! Full of so many laughs, I get a kick out of the movie every time I watch it again and again. Some things are absolutely absurd but they are funny and that is the entire point.The acting is top notch among the three main Ghostbusters. Bill Murray, one of the funniest men alive, delivers one of his funniest performances. His serious, stylish, and absurdly-uptight attitude in this movie is funny as heck. Dan Akroyd is funny as well! Harold Ramis is hilarious! He is so serious with his job. He treats everything he does with such precise attention and importance. Like when the girl asks him what hobbies he has. Just the way he gives his response is hilarious. His character is great. These three actors have such good attitudes that their performances in this film came out top notch. Aside from the three ghostbusters, Rick Moranis gives a funny performance as well. His character is ridiculously funny as a dorky and stupid little guy! The comedy of these 4 actors make this film as good as it is! The special effects in this movie are very good! Everything from the blast packs to the ghosts to the stage set-ups. I love the Ghostbuster car! It is great! And the theme song is amazing! I get dance fever whenever I start to hear it!Bill Murray said, \"We came, we saw, we kicked it's ass!\" That is exactly what Ghostbusters did to movie-goers everywhere. Everyone loves this movie and there is no question why. If you have yet to see this movie, stop reading and go rent it NOW! No disappointments. I guarantee it.",

            "content": "I should begin this review by stating that Ghostbusters is my all time favourite film. It has been ever since my father took me to see it in the summer of 1984. The film made a huge impact on me as a child. I loved it then and I love it now. Do I think its the best film ever made? No. But if were talking sheer entertainment value if there's one film I enjoy watching more than any other it's this one. Why? Lets start with the concept. Ghostbusters premise is simple but genius. A group of men who create a ghost catching business. It's such a unique and interesting idea which really shouldn't be overlooked. Next is the tone. This film perfectly balances horror and comedy. It offers equal doses of scares and laughs. There are parts which are pretty frightening , especially for kids but the scares are quickly countered by something funny. The film also does an impressive balancing act of mixing the berserk with the mundane. The goofy looking ghosts and ridiculous situation that the characters find themselves in is made believable due to the tone of the acting, the convincing ghost catching technology and Elmer Bersteins epic score. This brings me on to the music. Ray Parker Jrs theme tune, like the film itself, is genius. Apart from it being an incredibly catchy tune it acted as a perfect advertisement for the film and works well in the places its utilised. Due to the popularity of the theme tune the score by Elmer Berstein is often overlooked. Bersteins score is pitch perfect and his epic sound elevates the film making it feel as big as a one hundred and twelve and a half foot tall Stay Puft marshmallow man. The films strongest point though is without doubt it's characters. Peter Venkman is the wisecracking cynical ladies man. Ignorant and uninterested in science and the supernatural his character is the polar opposite of the educated and highly motivated Ray Stantz. Egon Spengler is the genius of the group who serves as the one who provides the other characters with his insight. Then there's Winston Zeddemore. An everyman who joins the group pretty late into the story but fits into the team really well. I wont go into the rest of the cast but they all do a great job. The dialogue is extremely memorable. It's full of funny one liners and unique scientific jargon. The story is simple but we'll written in its structure. The film is well paced. Each scene plays it's part in moving the story forward and isn't a moment longer than it needs to be, something that many films today should take note of. Though some of the special effects look a little shoddy most of them still look great. I could go on but I think I'll end my review by saying watch it and if you have watched it, watch it again.",

The movie was such a success back in the 80's. Much fallowed the films release such as a sequel, a cartoon series, a line of video games and action figures. Everything about Ghostbusters is fun to watch weather it be watching a ghost get grabbed by the proton streams and being sucked into a ghost trap with amazing special effects, or it be hearing the siren from the ecto-1 as it speeds passed, not to mention the awesome theme song. The gadgets that the Ghostbusters are equipped with are also very cool my favourite being the ghost vacuum that is on the roof of the ecto-1. The Ghostbusters face off against Gozer and her minions and must stop them from destroying the city Having all that said, Ghostbusters is a movie that people look back on and remember the feeling they got after watching it for the first time as kids, and that feeling is a feeling no one will ever forget.",

I wholeheartedly say that this movie is one of my all time favorites. Watch it over and over agin and you'll see: the jokes never bore, the laughter is always flowing. Ghostbusters is a Hollywood Smash.The story in Ghostbusters is about 3 scientists at Columbia University: Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). They are the crack team in the parapsychology department but soon find that their antics push them out of the University and onto the street. With new technology, they open up their own business: they investigate and eliminate ghosts in New York. At first, Dana Barett (Sigourney Weaver) is their only customer. She has had some ghostly apparitions in her apartment and needs help, and Venkman especially wants to help her. But soon, all of New York City is engulfed in spooks and Dana, along with her eccentric neighbor Louis (Rick Moranis), become the focus of summoning Gozer, a vicious evil that could easily destroy the world. With a new recruit, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), the Ghostbusters set out to save the world.This movie is an excellent comedy, thanks to a great script by co-stars Aykroyd and Ramis. They setup the characters wonderfully, so that each adds something unique to the wacky group. Murray and Moranis are given the best material of their careers and Aykroyd, Ramis and Annie Potts have a collection of zingers. The story is made believable, in spite of the obstacles, and the visual gags plus the sharp dialogue make for an unforgettable comedy classic.The visual effects are also very good. They help deliver a couple of nice scares in the movie like when Dana gets captured by the Terror Dog or when, as Zuul, a minion of Gozer, she telepathically destroys her own apartment. Richard Edlund and company has done a fine job.All these things, along with the great title theme, make for a film that lived up to and exceeded the hype. Everything about this movie clicks; nothing seems to be out of balance. I really loved this movie and I think that everyone else would too. Go out and pick up a copy of Ghostbusters today.",

Murray and Weaver are true artists, continually pushing the boundaries of their talents, and these are characters you don't want to miss if you are a fan of either.  Also, I miss Dan Aykroyd being this funny.  If all you've ever seen of his work is Blues Brothers 2000 or Soul Man on TV, you need to watch Ghostbusters to understand why people of my generation (baby boom) still love and respect him.The art direction and production design in this movie are also notable.

And those Proton Packs were such a great weapon, they didn't kill, but they had so much power. This is a perfect popcorn flick, and i enjoy it everytime i watch it. I used to buy all the memorabilia i could put my hands into. I think it works because it's about three big-time-geeks like anyone, who really become famous not by being rock stars or anything like that, but by being brilliant and intelligent. I also tried to visit all the spots when i was in New York. I never missed the cartoon show when it came out. Peter, Egon, Ray and Winston are great characters.

If I had to vote for on film to be digitally remastered and re-released, it would definately be this.The film and it' effects are pure genius, with Murray's funny one-liners and Ackroyd/Ramis providing the dry comments from time to time.  The four leads had a good repore and worked off each other well.  Weaver was good as the straight laced working woman, and Moranis was brilliant as ever. The plot was strong and original, and set up well for a sequal, which was just as good as the first. If they ever make a ghostbusters 3, I'll be first in the queue!!Neil",

            "content": "Pros1. This movie justly has a reputation for being one of the funniest movies of the 80's. That's mostly for great one-liners, particularly from Venkman, but the movie has a lot of funny visual moments like Venkman and Egon backing away from Ray after his proton pack is turned on or Egon getting a high PKE meter reading on a man in the hotel and touching him to see if he's a ghost.2. Ghostbusters earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Visual Effects. After nearly 33 years the special effects still look relatively good today.3. Ray Parker Jr. earned an Oscar nomination for the movie's theme song but the other songs are great as well: Cleaning Up The Town, Magic and Saving The Day are tunes well worth listening to. Leonard Bernstein composed a fine music score. I especially liked Dana's theme. Bernstein would go on to compose the score for Ivan Reitman's next film, Legal Eagles and his Legal Eagles score sounded like leftover Ghostbusters score. 4. Most people claim Venkman as their favorite Ghostbuster and understandably so but my favorite is Winston. He has a level-headed quality that is a nice contrast to the others. He may not have all the one-liners like Venkman but he couldn't ask for a better final line: \"I Love This Town!\"5. Yes, Walter Peck had good reason to suspect the Ghostbusters equipment might be dangerous but the fact remains that he could have saved New York a lot of trouble by keeping the ghost trap on. Peck lost all credibility when he told the mayor that completely fabricated story about Ghostbusters using hallucinogenics to make people think ghosts are real. God is it a joy to see Stay-Puft goop splat all over Peck.6. Great to see a brief appearance by the future Carl Winslow: Reggie Val Johnson7. Best Line:Winston: Ray, when somebody asks if you're a god you say YES!Cons1. Venkman tells Janine to stop staring at him with her bug eyes but he was talking to her. If you talk to somebody they are going to be looking at you when you're talking.2. So what happened to the library ghost? Did the library workers just pretend nothing every happened?3. Since Dana is a professional cellist, it's a shame we never actually hear her play.4. What's with Slimer attacking the audience? What did we ever do to him?",

            "content": "Ghostbusters introduced a new way of making comedy films that few films since have properly duplicated; the art of mixing special effects with humor.  Even the horrible special effects work, simply because the film uses them so effectively.Bill Murray was the best choice for Peter Venkman, a person whose easy to dislike, but impossible to hate.  Bill made Peter work, and made the romance between Peter and Dana Barrett believable.Dan Aykroyd, who also co wrote the film, also made Ray Stantz work excellently, a man no one could hate, no matter how stupid he acted.  I loved his speeches, which made the circumstances he was in funny and enjoyable.Sigourney Weaver also made Dana Barrett a fun character who made her place in the movie by being sensible, not deliberately funny.  The non-sense of Zuul, which she also played perfectly, also turned out to be great fun.Harold Ramis, Dan's co-writer, gave Egon Spengler a great part as well. It was entertaining to see him serve as the straight man while everyone else were making so many jokes, yet still remain one of the funniest characters in the film.Annie Potts receptionist/secretary also made the film fun; her perfect New York accent and her attitude made the part fun to watch.Rick Moranis also made his role fun to watch; I have to respect an intelligent man who can play a moronic character so well, and Rick's character did great in the role.And to ignore the great parts William Ackerman and Ernie Hudson gave to the film would be a great act of injustice; Ackerman was easy to hate, and willing to play the fool, to an extent, while Ernie did a wonderful job as the fourth Ghostbuster, giving some of his best lines in the film during the battle against Gozer.I wish more films would take the example from Ghostbusters; the use of personality and good acting is far more important in a film than special effects, but special effects, when used properly, make a film excellent.",

The sci-fi special effects are overall quite impressive for the 80's but even those lack a ghoulish air. Every single minute of the film is light and comical.

With a very good cast and even a catchy jingle. The movie is enjoyable for the entire family. \"Ghostbusters\" starts in the New York City Library with a librarian working in the basement. She is confronted by catalog cards flying around and then a bright ghostly apparition. Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), and Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) are paranormal professors at a university that get called in by the library. Egon questions the librarian about what happened to her and the men move to the basement. Books are stacked up in the halls, slime is on the card catalog drawers, and shelves are falling over. Finally they come across the ghost reading a book. The ghost in turn scares the men and they run out. The university decides to discontinue their grant and fire all three of them. With the help of Egon's technology of actually catching a ghost, and with a little help from Ray's mortgage, Ghostbusters is created.Just as Ghostbusters fame is rising, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men for help. Her apartment refrigerator is occupied by two beasts that yell out Zuul. Peter investigates Dana's apartment. After some looking he finds nothing. He does get a date with her thanks to his smooth talking. The day of the date the beasts in Dana's refrigerator come and possess her as the Gate Keeper. Luis Tully (Rick Moranis) her next door neighbor is possessed by the other beast the Key Master.The Key Master comes into the hands of the Ghostbusters just as the EPA tries to shut them down. A disaster happens and releases the ghosts all over New York. With the Ghostbusters in jail, the Key Master finds the Gate Keeper and awakes Gozer. The city is in turmoil and the mayor decides to let the men go. Upon arrival at Dana's apartment, it is apparent that Gozer has come. They make it to the roof where a battle of proton packs and spirits leaves the Ghostbusters in a stale mate.Gozer sends a destructor to destroy the men. This is a huge marshmallow man. Egon decides to break the rules and cross the streams in order to get rid of Gozer and the marshmallow man. As they say their goodbyes, each man starts the stream. The roof is completely destroyed but the men survive. They saved the world and rescued Dana from the beasts.This movie is one of my favorites and I can watch it again and again. The movie is part of the criterion collection which chooses important and contemporary movies that have changed film. This year with the 25th anniversary, Harold Ramis announced that a third Ghostbusters is in the making. Ghostbusters is one of the comedies that stand out in the eighties. It's fun for everyone in the family.",

            "review_title": "Comedy Classic",
            "content": "The 1980s was a decade known for its variety of unique entertainment, especially in film. As a child, I was raised on these movies, but none stand out more than that of Ghostbusters (1984). While not the most sophisticated piece of cinema to come out of that decade, it still stands as one of the most iconic. From the jumpsuits to the sigma, Ghostbusters made a permanent mark on popular entertainment. What makes the movie a classic comedy are not the iconic costumes and props, but the interactions between the Ghostbusters themselves.Each character has their own mold, which they fit into. Starting off, Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) portrays a typical scientist; dry, humorless and an avid collector of spores, molds and fungus. Although also highly intelligent, Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd) plays the dimwit of the group with a major lack in common sense or just sense in general. This is blatantly apparent during the scene which he purchases a junker car that needs a plethora of tune-ups and replacements, but only cost them $4800. Peter Venkmen, played by Bill Murray, is a sarcastic quick-wit who plays off both Egon's seriousness and Ray's stupidity. Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) completes the Ghostbuster team by being the new guy with zero experience in paranormal investigation, yet still manages to fit in due to the remainder of the team's lack of professionalism.Despite their unprofessional methods, the Ghostbusters still make good business and Venkmen is even able to get a date with customer Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). Things go awry though when Barrett is possessed by the evil demons haunting her apartment and from here, the movie takes off into a hilarious yet apocalyptic direction. This in itself is another reason why Ghostbusters is such a good comedy.Speaking for myself, when I hear terms such as \"Armageddon\" or \"Judgment Day,\" hilarity usually does not ensue. However, these elements are very prevalent yet the movie still garners countless laughs. This occurs for two reasons. The first being the brilliant script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd who, as mentioned before, star in the film. The second can be accredited to Bill Murray's trademark smug, sarcastic persona. One moment which comes to mind when Murray portrays this ideally is when he shares quips with the demon possessed Barrett. Murray's acting and mannerisms supply the comedic lifeblood to the script like no other actor could.As stated above, Ghostbusters is not the most serious of films, but during some parts it can be a little too corny. This is most apparent during the scene where the frightening demons are finally seen on screen in clay animation, also known as \"claymation\". I realize the film came out before movies featured giant spectacular effects; however I think by 1984 other options existed. Another minor gripe I have with the film is the acting done by Weaver during her demon possessed state. I really do not know how someone is supposed to act in such a state, but the entire scene where Dana, while being demon possessed, was talking to Ray felt a bit awkward. Her heavy panting came off as more of a person suffering from an asthma attack than a hellacious demon. However, do not let these two minor complaints stop you from enjoying this classic comedy.Looking at the film with a realistic point of view, Ghostbusters is a movie about four men trying to prevent Judgment Day from occurring due to two people's demonic possessions. In actuality, the movie is based around four guys who enjoy their job and make light of even the grimmest of situations. For those who disagree with this; I have only one statement: \"Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\"",

Answer, YES IT DOES, pretty much everything holds up, the acting, the comedy, definitely not the CGI but it's allowed to miss something. Bill Murray delivers a very memorable and hilarious performance as Peter Venkman, and all of the other characters were written and cast incredibly well, the music will still make you excited and the final battle with the stay put marshmallow man is so entertaining, such a good film, just a shame that the sequel was so bad (Ghostbusters 2 not Ghostbusters Afterlife, ghostbusters afterlife was incredible). 9 out of 10.",

An ancient and powerful evil (Gozer) has laid dormant for many thousands of years and is now ready to re-enter the world through a mystic gateway situated atop a New York apartment building. The only people stupid enough and brave enough to stop this entity are the ghost-busters! Each armed with a proton pack and a clean pair of shorts they do battle with spooky librarians, giant marshmallows and floating bogie's in a classic film that never will become outdated.",

            "content": "I watched this movie a long time ago, as a young boy, but because I hardly had any discern of rational awareness I didn't think much of the film... until now. I decided to rewatch it with a more earnest attitude and I can affirm that I was impressed and entertained. There were flaws, but I'm going to start this review with the positives.\nThe most obvious piece of this film is its music. It's bloody catchy as hell. It's one of the most iconic themes in film history and it will never leave your memories whether you've watched and listened to it seriously or not. The logo is also iconic, so I responded with excitement to witness it again now that I'm much older.\nThe characters are undeniably funny, impressive, intriguing and flawed (which is a good thing). The protagonist, Peter, has a careless approach for personality, which for once isn't annoying on a character. He is generally comedic and quite courageous in the forefront of ghost fighting, despite his imperfections. Ray is stupid, but that's why we love him of course. He is the child of the group, which is why he is funny. Egon is the 'common sense' of the group and has a fierce personality underneath his intellectuals. And Winston had to be the funniest, to me, although I thought his comedic moments could've been better prolonged. I never had any issues with the other side characters, so that says something about the writer's well-picked choices of actors to fit the roles. Though, I thought character developments could have been arranged better.\nThe story, itself, is a fun composition of entertainment. Four parapsychology professors hunting and defeating ghosts is simply a fun idea, and I enjoyed it without a doubt.\nNow, the flaws. Character development could have been done better because even though I enjoyed spending the film trying to seize what I liked about the characters I thought that I would've adored them further if I understood more things about them. Especially Winston, who I thought was hilarious but could've had more time to be the comedic punch to the story.\nI also feel like the writers overlooked what plot they were going for. Yeah, there were ghosts and the ghostbusters, but why did Demons and Gods suddenly appear? I guess some people would see demons and Gods as spiritual, but to me, the idea was rather misleading and unsatisfactory in a way. I also feel like some of the ideas were fragile, which confused me from time to time as I tried to wrap my head around what I was being informed of. Why is there a Demon and another world within Dana's fridge? Why does Gozer appear only when the ghosts are freed? Why does Ivor's plan to overthrow humanity only take effect after he's dead? Potentially, I've been missing some ideas, but from where I'm standing, these ideas just don't penetrate well.\nOverall, this was an enjoyable, action-packed movie with great and funny characters and a pleasing enough storyline. Again, there were flaws, but I'd definitely watch it a second time in due time.",

What this film benefits from most is physical comedy, the old rule that something is funnier shown rather than said can be proved simply by watching this film.  When Egon comes across the guest watching him in the hotel corridor while looking for 'slimer' and he gives the guest a little 'prod' before he carries on to check he is real still makes me fall off the sofa laughing twenty years on. Ever funny moment is backed up by four great comedians who know that to make someone laugh its not just what you say it's the way you say it and what you do while saying it that really counts.",

Ghostbusters was a pro-nonsense, no worries or cares kind of show. Repeated aspects of the show include Tracey's attempts at painting, Spencer's attempts at opening the file drawer, Tracey driving to get their assignments, the assignments self-destructing in Tracey's face as he follows the countdown, the same castle drawing that was pictured for where all the ghosts seemed to reside, and Tracey's prop gags before the Ghostbusters entered the castle.

For one, the entire cast is set in the roles they were born to play. Honestly. Bill Murray is at his comedic best. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as a bright, independent woman and is given the added fun of being possessed for a good portion of the movie. Rick Moranis was destined to play the Uber-nerd Louis, Dan Aykroyd perfectly cast himself as a lovable, semi-naive back-up comedic effect guy to Bill Murray, and so on and so forth (I only get 1000 words). Aside from this is the fact that there is truly something magical about the whole premise. A group of guys, not super men, but just some guys, get together and decide to combat the supernatural problems of the world (well, New York). There has always been a certain aspect of this that made me feel better; the realm of moviedom, after having countless horror movie fiends and people running from said fiends, now had heroes to fight back. Everyone knows you can't do anything to fight a ghost. Until the Ghostbusters came along. What is especially fun is that with this certainly ridiculous sounding plot, the movie is executed in a completely mundane manner. If someone heard the story idea, they may think of some awful action movie or an Airplane-type absurd comedy. Instead, the whole film is done in a ho-hum type manner, with normal (enough) believable people having to save the world from certain doom. Yikes. Then, of course, we get into the fact that it really is just about the funniest comedy ever. You really can't completely appreciate everything if you watch it with someone who laughs too loud, like a drama kid or a line-reapter guy (hopefully you know the people I reference). You would just miss too much. It isn't a movie that necessarily will have a person rolling on the floor laughing at everything, but there are countless moments where, if you have the kind of sense of humor the world needs more of (and I don't mean that in some political sense or anything so don't read into me that deep), you would chuckle and think to yourself \"that's funny.\" But again, you don't have too much time to think that, because something else funny is about to happen. Subtly. I once read someone's review on this very website that said that Ghostbusters was one of those movies that you think is good the first time you see it because you're in a theater and it all seems really big and whatnot, but isn't really that great when you go back and watch it again. This person must walk backwards or something, because that's completely opposite from the truth. And yes, I say \"the truth\" rather than \"my opinion\" because I looked it up and it is the truth.",

After some sucess, they end up facing their biggest challenge yet when one of their clients-and Murray's love interest-ends up being the focal point of the reincarnation of an ancient God. The film's main star is Bill Murray, who actually ab-libbed a large number of his lines, but Akroyd are hilarious as well.

Unlike most of Filmation's live series, The Ghost Busters focused a bit more on humour than just being action with comedy relief. Basically, loosely using the 'Mission Impossible' schtick (heavily used in Saturday Morning spy shows) to obtain their assignments. Jake, Eddie and Tracy would deal with the likes of demented spirits, wacky vampires and other spectre and ghouls from haunting the mortal world. Humour was used a lot in the show, sometimes through classic visual stunts or puns. Case in point, when dealing with a vampire, Jake finds out one thing they fear is a wooden 'stake', whereas Tracy pulls out a wooden 'steak.' And when Eddie attempts to disclaim Tracy's attempt, he ends up getting a splinter from the 'steak.' However, because it was Saturday Morning TV, The Ghost Busters normally vanquished rogue spirits with a Polaroid-esquire device called the Dematerializer. As the name suggested, when fired at a ghost, the screen would appear with a blue screen effect and the ghost would 'dematerialize' out from the mortal world. Though I believe it only had one season in 1975, the series was often ran in syndication on Sunday mornings as well. Ironically, though the name was used for the film, there was no real connection between it and the series. Despite well-box office reviews, many still felt the Akroyd and Murray film did not capture the same fun as the original series. So in 1986, Filmation revived the series in animated form: Filmation's Ghostbusters. Here, however, the offspring of the original Ghost Busters and Tracy dealt with a nemesis called Prime Evil (think Terminator merged with a specter) and his ghoulish legion of ghosts. Whereas in the original series, the Ghost Busters simply obtained assignments from the mysterious Agent Zero. What really made Ghost Busters appealing for it's time, as with most Filmation Live Action, was it did have great storytelling, and really made the limited special effects work. Also for F-Troop fans, the comedy stilings of Tucker and Storch made the show enjoyable, and it was a wonder Filmation didn't consent with Hanna-Barbera for a spot on the Scooby-Doo Movies (since they aired about the same year). I'd definitely recommend this product for not only fans of the classic series, but for those who loved Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, as well as a new generation of viewers.",

I have recently bought the 15th Anniversary Edition of Ghostbusters, which I might add makes me angry in several ways. 1) I don't like how the camera moves around the screen, when one person is cut out. 2)Where is the added scenes? I bought the video to see the added scenes, and there none. I have the original movie, and I bought the 15th Anniversary to see new scenes, and there were none, it was the same. When I was young, my friends and I dressed up with our toy Proton Packs and watched the movie while acting it out. We knew the lines off by heart, and I still know them. I have never seen New York. I have planned twice to go there, but they have canceled each time. I have always dreamed of going there since I first saw Ghostbusters. But it can wait because no matter how many times I have seen Ghostbusters, it never gets boring. I love this movie because of New York, I love how Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the story, it was amazing! Now, I always wondered why Ivan Reitman never made Ghostbusters 3. There was some talk of it, but I think it was only a rumor. As for Ghostbusters 2, part 1 was WAY better.Thank you for letting me get this out of me.",

And if you know better any of other works from those 3 guys, you'll know what I'm talking about.They are 3 little genius, one in each aspect of making movies, and the collided together in this one. It couldn't have resulted in anything better, it was just perfect, for the time.I'm not gonna talk about the story, there's enough reviews and knowledge over this big hit. Instead, I want to talk about intertextuality.The movie was made in 1984, same year of some movies I've watched, such as Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Starman, Amadeus, Karate Kid, The Garden of Eden, Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, Dune... And so many others I wish I had seem... It was a hard competition for prizes, I guess that's the reason why it didn't get so many awards.Hell, not even former Monty Python's award winning from 12 monkeys Terry Gilliam could win something with his movie, mostly because of poor production (not his fault, at all).Anyway, this movie has so many deep inner meanings, every time I watch it again it gets me surprised with something I haven't seem before. And I have seem a lot.Later works from Harold Ramis are my favorite. Every one of them. I think my favorite would be Bedazzled (2000) and, please, don't overlook this amazing movie. It was first written by Peter Cook and shot in movie on 1967 by the same Peter, yes the same Peter who inspired Monty Python and probably most of Terry Gilliam's works.But I can't get enough of all of Harold R. like Analyze this and that, he only gets better and better in time, maybe going too far and then heading back to earth, hehe. To me, he resembles a lot Calvin & Hobbes (a.k.a Harold) for some reason... I just miss few of his works, like Cadyshack and maybe Stripes.He also makes appearances like in Orange County or As Good As It Gets. Always playing a really good and smart person, just like in Ghostbusters, but always different sides of himself.And now he is doing a new work with the also amazing, although weird, Owen Wilson. I think he was best seem with Jackie Chan in Shangai Noon.Anyway, this first Ghostbuster is amazing, a great story and at least 5 star merit. Worth way more than watching it just once. 5 times might not be enough to fully understand it, and I keep hoping I've had enough at same time I keep getting really good surprises when I watch it again, over time.Hard to decide the vote between 9 and 10, but since the score right now is 7, I made my mind for a 10+. :)",

Bearing this in mind, I'd have to say that Ghostbusters delivers well on this level. The film moves at a good pace, and isn't dull or lagging. The comedy is great, but unlike some other films, there are a few moments of genuine intensity that contribute to the frission in this film. In short, it doesn't overdo it when it comes to humor. The climax of the film exemplifies this; the marshmallow man was a scream when incongruously paired with the demonic threat of Gozer. It is concluded when the otherwordly threat is dispensed with; there is no last tie-ups. It ends when it should, in my humble opinion.The FX are good, I suppose, though it's a disappointment more creatures weren't showcased. The characters are also well-developed, and each Ghostbuster makes a perfect foil for the other members of the team.Suffice it to say, short but sweet. Get it if you can.",

I love it for the amazing dialogue (a load of vocabulary in this movie). The plot is suprisingly realistic.  It's told in such a way that you believe this could actually happen. The cast...well, need I say more? Everyone was purely perfect in their roles. I also love the timeless look of the movie.  Watching it now you will have no problem believing that these events could be occuring at this second because the clothing, dialogue, etc. are not dated, as is the fate of many \"classics\". The special effects seem outdated now, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. Because even in a movie where special efects are abound....the special effects do not propel the story. Because of the amazingly structured script, they could have used sock puppets instead of animated ghosts and get the same effect.  Even the sequel...though not quite as compact, is a delightful addition to the Ghostbusters family.  There is news about Ghostbusters 3. While I will greet it with open arms, I can't help to think it shouldn't be made.  Because there hasn't been one for so long...even if its utter poppycock, I'll love it just for the effort.  However, after so long it could never hope to light a candle what came before. I bought the DVD to Ghostbusters and it literally took me 2 days of viewing to weed through all the material.  UNBELIEVEABLE.  I loved every tidbit on it and even learned a few things that *gasp*  I didn't know before.  (I recommend the DVD to any Ghost-head or any person who wants to remember the glory days of 80's blockbusters! It is decadence to the highest power!",

It never drops off, which is the only reason it beats Ferris Bueller's Day Off. While both are fast-paced comedies, there is a satirical wit and a strong self-critical overtone to both that is often overlooked.Ghostbusters sums up so much of the get-rich-quick mentality which prevailed back then, and it puts us in the picture by making reference to all the little things which made the eighties the eighties. And it does it all in an even, witty way, that is funny to this day.The eighties songs featured are not the popular ones, except perhaps Ray's ripoff of Huey Lewis And The News (he's probably still paying for that one), but they are classic tunes nonetheless. The score is brilliant, and I must admit I always watch the credits right through just to have an encore of it- and the pop tunes.The effects are good enough, and the backstories offered on the DVD release give an entertaining insight into this and other aspects of the film's creation. In my view, the story behind Ghostbusters is the key to its proper appreciation, because I don't think there has ever been a more talented group of people involved in writing, directing, acting and creating a comedy movie. To hear them speak and comment on a movie they are so proud of, even to this day, is an experience I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in the genre.",

Eventhough I was not yet born, the year it came out made all the differnce in the world...1984!I have looked in to the year 1984 and quite frankly Ghostbusters non-surprisingly became the must-see flick of summer '84. I can see why, because the film's humor and sense of direction holds up well today. Just take a handful of people from Saturday Night Live, Second City, Caddyshack, Meatballs, Stripes, Animal House, Blues Brothers, Tootsie, Trading Places, National Lampoon's Vacation and add elements from films like Abbot and Costello, King Kong, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, Trilogy of Terror, The Exorcist, and those Pillsbury Dough Boy ads along with a huge dash of Comedy and you've got yourself a hell of a great movie!The film features a group of odd-ball scientists who are fired from their jobs. As they spend time in the gutter, they establish a system of paranormal investigaions and eliminations calling themselves \"Ghost Busters\". They're first assignment is to investigate a pesky poltergeist living in a woman named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) fridge. Along the way, they trap their first ghost (Slimer) at a hotel and resume their ghost-catching spree, until the spirit in Dana's apartment captivates her body and eventually Rick Moranis's body, causing the city of New York to break out all hell. The ghostbusters are left to deal with this pesky ghost and near the end of the film, takes the form of a giant marshmallow man. Another problem the ghostbusters are facing are federal charges by a tree-hugging, beaurocratic snitch named Walter Peck, who is the third-district attorney of the EPA (environmental Protection Agency).The timing of the humor in this movie is so perfect. Bill Murray delivers that same sense of unique, lazy-ass humor we all love. Dan Aykroyd has that same dry, odd-ball humor, like Rick Moranis. And Harold Ramis delivers that bookish and INCREDIBLY DRY, dead pan sense of humor, along with Annie Potts. If you want to check out a nice, feel-good 80s comedy, who ya gonna call?GHOSTBUSTERS!10/10 stars -- BRILLIANT!",

            "content": "Ghostbusters was fabulous when I saw it aged 12 and 15 years on it's even better.  As a kid caught up in the (well deserved) hype, I had little interest in the dialogue and subtle spontaneous comic asides.  I was wrapped in the effects, which , stop motion aside, actually still stand up pretty well today.  However, coming back to the movie on DVD after all these years I can now see the film 'whole' as it were, and it's only now do I realise just how good it is.  The special FX aren't really whats important here.  The story is highly original, has a lovely pace, and strikes a clever balance between comedy and terror.  There are some spooky moments in this film, but they never push it too far, and they are always followed by a laugh.  The film is nicely scripted but the delivery also has a nice spontaneous feel to it, perhaps not surprising considering we've got three good comedy actors and writers centre stage.In fact all players in the film are fantastic, the three leads look like they've spent their whole life together, Sigourney becomes a bit of a hell-raiser, and Rick Moranis barely pauses for breath during his hilarious verbal diarrhoea as uber-nerd Louis.  Also, let us not forget another truly odious character from William Atherton, as the over-zealous officer from the EPA.  In a way, it's a shame Winston (Ernie Hudson) couldn't have been given a bit more to do or a few extra gags - but then maybe that would have been too much, and his character works well representing all us 'normal' people.Ghostbusters is so much fun, and so brilliantly crafted it actually makes me despair for the kids of the 90's as they've had so little to compare to this.  Only Men In Black and the Pixar releases have come close.  Come on Hollywood - start making some original fun films again! \nOh, and special mention must go to the wonderfully spooky music by Elmer Bernstein, which is often overlooked (overheard?) due to the famous Ray Parker Jr. theme tune.In summary:great for kids + great for grown ups = superb for grown up kids.",

The supporting cast is great, including Sigourney Weaver as the damsel in distress Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis as nerdy accountant Louis Tully, and Annie Potts as secretary Janine Meltz. This movie is a rare example of big budget special effects and comedy working together. Pick up the DVD for the ultimate Ghostbusters experience.

Well, I do and I'll tell you why.When the movie premiered in 1984, it had then-state-of-the-art special effects, but now the digital age has dawned and practicality in special effects has all but disappeared.  But this film is far above most digital extravaganzas because it realizes that effects that look neat are better eye-candy than effects that are expensive.  I would rather see the giant marshmallow man or the killer dogs than all of the asteroids, slow-motion bullets or spaceships that Hollywood can throw at its patrons.The plot is basically simple: three scientists set up shop in New York as paranormal exterminators and contend with various spooks.  As an action-comedy-fantasy-scifi movie, \"Ghostbusters\" delivers enjoyment in truckloads.  Whether watching the colorful effects or laughing at the tomfoolery of the goofball scientists, it is a true joy to behold.\"Ghostbusters\" should be regarded as a classic -- it takes viewers to a comic wonderland, and back to a time when special effects really were special.**** (out of 4)",

They create a film that will not only be loved by the generation of it's time, but will also be enjoyed by the many generations to come. Ghostbusters is one of these films.As our story opens, the boys are investigating a possible ghost sighting at a library, and it is here that they come up with the idea of actually capturing and holding a ghost indefinitely. Thinking how lucrative the rights alone could be, they decide to go into business as professional paranormal exterminators.  They aren't taken very seriously at first and have trouble finding clients.  Until one day, a nice young woman wanders into their office and tells them about strange goings on in her apartment. As they investigate her case further, it is soon realized that she isn't being plagued by a small time spook.  The ghosts in her apartment building have bigger plans, and are in fact trying to bring something or someone into our world using this building as the door.  And as it turns out, only the Ghostbusters can save us.Director Ivan Reitman has done a tremendous job in his direction of this movie.  Instead of relying heavily on special effects, he lets his characters tell the story.  Yes, there are a lot of effects in the film, including the introduction of one of the biggest visitors to ever come to New York City.  Fans of the film know exactly who I am talking about, and the \"character\" leaves several indelible impressions upon the city.  But alas, I am getting away from the terrific human cast that is also in the picture.  Bill Murray gives one of his best performances as Dr. Peter Venkman, a smooth-talking \"game show host\" of a scientist who is always using his scientific credentials as a guise to meet women.  Note the scene in which he is doing an electric shock \"experiment\" on a pretty coed and her nervous male friend.  It's hilarious.  And also, Rick Moranis as Sigourney Weaver's nerdy neighbor Louis, who delights in playing Parchesi at his parties and always manages to lock himself out of his house time and time again.Blessed with a great script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, Ghostbusters is a truly great comedy, filled with quirky characters, great visual effects, and a good sounding soundtrack.  Who honestly hasn't shouted \"Ghostbusters!\" when you hear the phrase \"Who ya gonna call?\".  All in all, Ghostbusters is a very funny movie and to those who haven't seen it, you are missing one of the best movie going experiences of all time.",

I think you should see this movie yourself, because believe me, this movie will injure yourself laughing.",

This is one of the great stepping stones of cinematic history. I myself am not a Murray fan, though he preformed more than adequately. The TV show never even came close to the humor of the movie.

            "content": "Ghostbusters was one of my favorite movies that I watched over and over as a child. Ghostbusters is a funny, science fiction movie. It is difficult to find a film more funny throughout the whole movie industry. In the finale the giant marshmallow man comes alive. This is a scene no one can forget, especially with Dan Aykroyd, known as Dr. Raymond Stantz on the screen. Another scary scene was when Gozer appears in Dana Barrett's(Sigourney Weaver)refrigerator. Bill Murray, known as Dr. Peter Venkman, is great in this scene, as in every scene he is in. He has a dry, ironic sense of humor. He does not have to use words to express himself as a comedian. This movie has an impressive cast, and excellent special effects. I enjoyed this movie when I was a child, and to this day I watch this movie on VHS; and laugh again and again like I had just seen it, even though I know about every line by heart.This movie has something for everyone. One was when Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) was recalling the Book of Revelation or another time when Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) tells about the possessed apartment coming into being. Also, when the grid was shut off was a very frightening moment. All the Ghostbusters are unforgettable and humorous in their own way. They work very well with one another, which is what makes it the best of movies.Manhattan is the heart of the subject due to the Gothic architectural grandeur of the city; it makes for the perfect setting. This movie's special effects look as great today as it did in 1984. It is more imaginative than most movies today. The shifting back and forth from comedy to the imaginative and ghostbuster thriller make it one of the best films ever in the hearts of many. It is impossible not to laugh,no matter how many times people see this movie. The audience can see the movie over and over again without tiring because of the comedy mixed with suspense. Rent or buy it soon, as it has truly held up as a classic and one of the biggest blockbuster movies ever made in the 80s!",

Ulimately, the way that I know that this is one of those movies that will always rank at the top of the list, is the fact that I can watch it over and over, and never get bored with it.

Each of the actors truly embodied the people they were playing.  It is hard to find a comedy that does this in today's world of entertainment.  In fact, many of today's top comedy movies have too much actor in each of the roles.From a cinemographic standpoint, this movie is outstanding for its time. How often do you get to see a five-hundred foot marshmallow man walking down the streets of New York City, and see it flawlessly done?  There were not that many mistakes made with props, and each scene was well filmed.Story-wise this film is also a winner.  I like the idea of three friends being fired and then starting a business that no one has EVER seen or thought of before.  Making it work and capitalizing on their publicity is what propels them into the biggest job of their lives: saving the world. Despite the actions of a Mr. Walter Peck from the EPA and the inconvenient destruction of their operating center, the Boys in Brown win against all odds, providing us with an immensely popular and prolific summer blockbuster that birthed ALL summer blockbusters.",

Dr. Venkman first arrives at Dana Barrett's apartment to find she has been imbued with the spirit of Gozer and now is calling herself the \"Gate Keeper\" and is awaiting the arrival of the \"Key Master\". There is a scene that shows her animal tendencies (floating above the bed, panting rapidly, deep and growling voice). Then the scene cuts away and returns to a phone call between Peter and Egon. Peter Venkman states that he injects her with the dosage during a phone call with Egon.So we have to assume, since Dr. Peter Venkman did not show up with a briefcase, medical bag, or any other piece of science kit or gear, that he showed up to Dana Barrett's apartment with a syringe filled with 300cc's of Thorazine in the breast pocket of his blazer.I could see a surgeon walking around with a set of scalpels or clamps in case he or she is called upon to perform an emergency appendectomy on the street or other minor surgeries in life or death situations, but Dr. Peter Venkman is a psychologist/parapsychologist.

Watching it now at the ripe old age of 18, I notice so many more subtle pieces of dialogue and realise the film to be totally tongue-in-cheek.Considering it was made in 1984, the film has a timeless quality which has given it a longer shelf life than many other '80s films. The special effects are still awesome and the dialogue and visual humour has the power to make you roll about laughing. The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man especially remains one of the best visual gags in film history. Roll on Ghostbusters 3....",

A movie like that would probably not be greenlighted today. The strengths are the awesome cast which has fun playing the roles, the director, humor and the mixture of comedy, fantasy with some science fiction elements. It creates a world that is fully believable and entertaining. Also it gets the mixture of seriousness and humor right in a way that non harms the other. It is the story of the 3 parapsychology scientist Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler (later joined by Winston Zeddemore) who investigate paranormal activities. Because this field of science is not taken serious and seen as fraud they are thrown out of their jobs at the university and are discredited. Because of this they start a business called Ghostbusters. They use their knowledge and technical skills to develop tools / equipment to locate, capture and contain ghost. Of cause there is more to it as paranormal activities are on the rise. I stop with the set up here. The story might sound a bit silly but works fully. Maybe the start is a bit to slow for my taste but it introduces the characters well. The rest is a great story with an epic climax. It is one of the most well know movies of the time. The humor is awesome and is carried by the cast and script. The actors have a great chemistry together and so it is natural that the demands for a new movie and the franchise are still strong. They created something that is a timeless classic. Lets continue with the strong cast. We have Bill Murray as Peter Venkman. Must I even praise him? He made so many wonderful performances in his career and this is one of the best of them. He is a charming trickster and master of persuasion. Then we have Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz. He is the noble scientist with a hearth of gold. Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler is the smartest scientist of the group. He has also some dry humor. Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore has less screentime in this movie but fills it with a really good performance (They say that the role was for Eddie Murphy and was cut down when he was not available but other say this was just a rumor). These 4 Ghostbusters are pop culture icons and legends. This performance laid the foundation for the franchise. It ends not here as we got even more great actors / actresses. There is Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett with a great performance. She is a legend in the industry and one of my favorite actresses. Then we got Rick Morranis another one of my favorites. He has also so many good performances including this. Sidenote: I wondered why he made no movies after becoming a big star. His wife died and he quit his career to raise their kids. He is such a great man. There is Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz who is often forgotten, has a smaller role but fully delivers. Finally I want to mention Ernie Hudson as Walter Peck. He has a memorable scene and says he was mocked by / for the nickname he was given in this movie;-). A truly remarkable cast. All characters work well and I consider it a true strength. I praise also the clever written script by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and of cause the director Ivan Reitman. Without these it could also not be a cult classic. The special effects were amazing for its time but aged a bit badly. Still has some scary scenes. Then there is the humor which is another strength. There are a lot of good jokes, memorable quotes and scenes. I must also praise the music. The Ghostbusters song by Ray Parker Jr. has also become a classic and is still sometimes played today in the radio. Heard it so many times but still enjoyed it. Overall this is a childhood favorite I still enjoy as adult. A cult classic that earned its place in movie history. Even after all the years it has so many fans. One of the easiest recommendations I can make for movies.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAh yes, Ghostbusters. One of the classics that came from the 1980\u2019s, I\u2019m sure it was a time considered by many to be a great decade. This movie has been seen by audiences and plenty of critics alike as one of the greatest comedies ever made. And, seeing as there is a new Ghostbusters movie coming out soon I feel it would be fitting if I looked at the two films that came before. Does it meet the expectations I hoped for, or am I going to have the unpopular bad opinion? Well, let\u2019s go into detail.\r The film centers around scientists of various degrees of credibility, Ray Stanz (Dan Akroyd) the person who is always energetic about what he does, Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) the logical one who doesn\u2019t have much emotion and has his eyes always focused on science, and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) the sarcastic one who\u2019s not afraid to say what he thinks. All of them, after being kicked out of teaching in university decide to start a business centering around catching the paranormal and see what makes them tick. At least, that\u2019s what I assume why they keep all of them in a secured container.\r You also have Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett who requests the Ghostbusters help to discover the strange occurrences happening in the apartment building that she lives in. Little does anyone know about what events are about to unfold.\r First thing I like to say is that the soundtrack is nice, the various songs that play throughout the entire movie I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t left the mind of some people currently reading this. It really is a thing of beauty to listen to. The special effects too, especially for the time look very good. It has aged quite a bit though, especially with the party scene with the monster what wrecks everything. I rarely had a feeling that he was actually there chasing Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis) at all.\r Oh yeah! The characters, let\u2019s talk about that part. The chemistry between our trio of scientists is pretty funny, Murray, Akroyd and Ramis certainly know how to work off each other and be able to provide comedy that made me chuckle when it happened. Not surprising, since both Akroyd and Ramis were also writers of the script as well. If I remember from research, Akroyd too worked on Saturday Night Live at the same time that Murray was in the cast. So I had no doubt that they could make a concept like this work very well. When Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) arrives on the scene later on, they waste no time in giving him time to develop and work with the other cast. Every character in this story, main and supporting alike, manage to make a story about capturing ghosts possible.\r Even with all this, there are a few things holding me back from giving the film a very high score. For starters, some of the science in this thing isn\u2019t exactly logical. I\u2019m not talking about that ghosts can never happen; I have no issue. It\u2019s things like how can something like a proton pack actually scientifically work? I don\u2019t think protons work like that! There are also a few minor scientific licenses they used. 300cc of what again? That would kill someone, not put them to sleep! I guess Dana's right, Venkman's not a scientist!\r This is going to sound odd, but I was a bit disappointed that I didn\u2019t laugh as often as I should have. They clearly written a lot of stuff that should have made me visibly laugh, but all I did was chuckle every now and then at most of them. I only laughed out loud once, and that was when they used the packs for the first time on a maid\u2019s cleaning cart. Her reaction after the blasts stopped was golden! I wished I could have laughed more often, but I suppose that\u2019s my problem, not the film in that regard.\r I really don\u2019t want to upset anyone who thinks of the film as a masterpiece, but it\u2019s really a good film. I promise that! I just think that it isn\u2019t perfect. That is all.",

I thought it was funny, imaginative and entertaining, and I do completely agree it is underrated. I really liked the soundtrack, and the special effects were truly excellent, considering it was made in the 1980s. The direction was slick and self-assured, and there are a lot of truly funny lines in the script like \"Ray, if someone asks you if you are a god, you say yes\". I can't count the number of times I was laughing when I watched this film. The performances were brilliant. Bill Murray, who is excellent when he is given a great script, see him in Lost in Translation for evidence, steals every scene he's in, and Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis both gave spirited performances. Also fun to watch were Annie Potts and Rick Moranis, and Sigourney Weaver was her usual charming self here. I will confess when I first saw this I was frightened by the dog like creatures Zuul and Vinz Clortho. I also felt that scenes like the Marshmallow Man (or whatever it was) bit got a bit too silly, but hey, it's all part of the fun. Overall, a hugely entertaining and enjoyable film, which I will award a 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.",

It is about a group of scientists who are failing at their current job and decide to open up a business for catching ghosts after many ghost sightings have been heard about in New York.The main reason this movie stands out is the characters, most notably the Ghostbusters themselves.\u00a0They feel like real people and the reason for that I believe is because most of their lines were made up by the actors as they went along and in real life people make up what they say as they go along which adds a sense of realism. Bill Murrary absolutely steals the show; he's funny, his character is likeable and feels real. All of the characters have great portrayals and all tell good jokes but Murray is the stand-out of the lot.The movie may seem like it's aimed at kids with all of the ghosts and whatnot but it actually has lots of adult jokes and is actually aimed more at older viewers.There's something about nearly all movies made around this time which makes them so special- many of them are so simple yet so effective. Many of the outstanding movies nowadays are those which contain complex storylines but are very good (like The Dark Knight) but it's great to see how great these older movies can be by having such a basic premise.I also need to note that the pacing in this movie is great- everything progresses quickly and never comes to a halt.I couldn't really find many issues with the movie but I do have a few. They aren't major but they are minor things I would like to point out.Winston, even though I like his character, feels like he's just 'there' and doesn't really add anything. This is probably because he is introduced later on so he kind of feels slapped in and isn't really necessary.Even though I like the final act (the fight against the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man), it feels a bit short and only lasts a couple of minutes. I'd like to have seen it cause more chaos.Also, it might just be me but it kind of ends rather abruptly. Usually in a movie, the final act goes down and then there's a final scene clearing everything up. In this it's like the credits are playing over that final scene. Imagine at the end of Star Wars (spoilers for the first Star Wars even thought you probably already know the ending), imagine the credits start rolling as soon as the Death Star has been destroyed\u00a0and they are playing over the award ceremony scene. I mean, it's not like anything needs clearing up at the end of this movie but it's a bit different to other movies.Overall, this is a great movie with great characters, great dialogue and humour and also very good pacing. I would highly recommend this.8/10",

The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologistIn this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologist little crazy and deeply sarcastic. He's assisted by Dr. Egon Spengler (embodied by Harold Ramis), the intellectual genius of the quartet, Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddmore (played by Ernie Hudson). In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the \"Ghostbuster's\" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly. It's very curious that a film whose many critics said so bad manages to keeps it's popularity today, thirty years after being released.",

Well, I\u2019m sorry to tell you guys, but your favorite movies are no less repetitive and self-indulgent than the modern ones you seem to hate. Yes, some movies were good in the past. A lot of them also CREATED the same tropes you complain about in modern movies. You just grandfathered them in because they were the ones YOU liked. This movie is filled with horrible motivations for characters (the same people who are \u201cappalled\u201d by the behavior of men in Hollywood seem to love ALL of Bill Murray\u2019s roles that play that exact archetype) and characters that talk a lot and really manage to say nothing of importance. Egon at one point proceeds to explain how, if their current amount of ghosts were a Twinkie, his \u201c new data\u201d (never explained) shows that they would have a 35 foot long, 600 pound Twinkie on their hands...so in a round about way he said they have a lot more ghosts to worry about...but he said it with a metaphor that had science words so it sounded like he said something smart...seriously, this movie is just made by a bunch of coke head actors, yet you all treat it like some \u201cscientific\u201d take on ghosts. Saying things that you heard in your high school science class doesn\u2019t mean you know what you\u2019re talking about...or that you\u2019re saying anything that correlates to actual fact. If you like a movie, GREAT, enjoy it! Don\u2019t pass yourself off as an objective critic, though, because you **** keep convincing me to watch these overrated 80s movies simply because you were all in elementary when they came out. Or that\u2019s when you first saw them, at least. 7/10",
